00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:40,360
[Linji Prefectural Office]

4
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,590
Didn't we agree

5
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,000
that you'd hold nothing back from me?

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,060
Lady Rong Shanbao,

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,930
how many more things
are you still hiding from me?

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,280
Shanbao,

9
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,210
I'm really curious

10
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,870
which one of us

11
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,590
will end up going farther.

12
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,329
Did you hear our conversation

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,079
just now?

14
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,710
She was forced into this.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
She has been looked down upon
since childhood.

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,280
Now

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,150
she just wants to secure her footing

18
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,280
in the Rong Mansion.

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
Mr. Bai, do you dare
to make a bet with me?

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,190
If she's willing to give up the wealth

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,650
of the Rong family for you,

22
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,520
then it proves

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,320
she's not completely ruthless,

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,220
and I will let bygones be bygones.

25
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,640
But if she abandons you,

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,700
then you shall work for me.

27
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,010
What do you say?

28
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,430
We have a message from Lady Yunxi.

29
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,150
It says that Jiang Yiqian has captured Li

30
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,550
and is forcing Lady Yunxi
to do his bidding.

31
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,360
Tell her

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,950
to follow Jiang Yiqian's orders.

33
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,580
Yes.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,250
Have you lost your mind?

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
You even dared to burn the Tea King Tree?

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,240
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Only in this way can we make Jiang Yiqian

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,570
let down his guard completely.

39
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,960
Fine.

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
I've been running around,

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,470
working tirelessly for you.

42
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,680
But in the end, you won't even give me

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,940
a single word of truth.

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,310
Rong Shanbao, to you,

45
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,000
am I just a tool to be summoned

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,260
and dismissed at will?

47
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,770
Jiang Yiqian is your sworn enemy.

48
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,320
By eliminating him,

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,980
wasn't I also helping you?

50
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,320
What on earth are you even angry about?

51
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,710
Fine, I'm being unreasonable.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,990
I shouldn't have worried
that you would get bullied by your sisters

53
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,630
when you returned to the mansion.

54
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,079
I shouldn't have worried
that Luo Deze would hold you accountable

55
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,740
for the ruined birthday gift.

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,870
And I certainly shouldn't have worried
that getting entangled in a murder case

57
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,470
would ruin your reputation.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,740
Stop the carriage!

59
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,240
My Lord, are you getting out?

60
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,780
Are you still getting out?

61
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,190
No, I'm not.

62
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,770
When this case is over,

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,630
I will give you an explanation.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,920
Good.

65
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,470
I'll wait.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,330
Fragrant pouches and sachets!

67
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,040
So you actually colluded with Rong Shanbao

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
to deceive me!

69
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,520
What a loyal servant indeed!

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,560
Since you've chosen
to work for Rong Shanbao,

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,310
why put on this mask of mercy?

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,590
Yes, I deceived you.

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,270
But Yunshu,

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
you have

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,630
gone astray.

76
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,950
Astray?

77
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,870
In this vast Rong Mansion,

78
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,000
when Grandmother held Rong Shanbao up

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,159
as the shining moon,

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,159
did she ever stop to think

81
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,090
there was still a weed clinging to life
in the corner?

82
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,530
If I don't fight,
should I just wait for her charity?

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,390
I must fight!

84
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,190
I fight, whatever the cost!

85
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,720
I fight, until the very end!

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,530
I thought you would understand me.

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,340
But why would even you stand in my way?

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,750
Why would even you think

89
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,030
I should admit guilt?

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,190
Leave. I don't want to see you anymore.

91
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,070
The day I fell into the river,

92
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,670
the water, steeped in hatred,

93
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,940
surged into my lungs.

94
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,950
When I awoke, I swore

95
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,430
that I myself would shackle

96
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,270
the hands
that had pushed me into the river.

97
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
Then you can do it now.

98
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,830
Yet even now, I still cherish the memory

99
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,490
of the quiet orchid fragrance

100
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,720
on the sunny day we first met.

101
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,010
I'm about to go to the capital
for the imperial exam.

102
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,750
This will likely be

103
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,480
the last time we see each other.

104
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,040
Grandmother, it's time
to take your medicine.

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,190
Set it down for now.

106
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,360
What the hell are you doing?

107
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,500
Let me tell you the truth.

108
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,120
My eyes have been healed for a long time.

109
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
All these years of biding my time

110
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,800
were only to seek justice for my mother.

111
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,669
Grandmother,
you must take your medicine obediently

112
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,789
and stay alive

113
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,440
to see with your own eyes

114
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,630
that a maid's child

115
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,080
will inherit the Rong family,

116
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,140
and that my mother's memorial tablet

117
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,320
will be rightfully

118
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,650
placed in the Rong family ancestral hall.

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Drink! I'm telling you to drink!

120
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,740
Mr. Yan.

121
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,550
Why are you being so rude?

122
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,410
Old Madam Rong,

123
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,020
wake up!

124
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,140
Old Madam Rong!

125
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,510
-How dare you break into Chongxi Hall!
-Old Madam Rong!

126
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,510
Someone come at once!

127
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,110
Throw this insolent man out!

128
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,390
Yes, someone should be called here

129
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,440
to examine exactly
what is in this medicine!

130
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,120
Mr. Yan,

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,120
I show you respect

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,840
because you're an honored guest
invited by Grandmother,

133
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
but you have no right to spout nonsense

134
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
and falsely accuse me!

135
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Please go back to pack your things now

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
and leave the Rong Mansion immediately.

137
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,130
Lady Yunshu,

138
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,000
Mr. Bai has cherished you deeply.

139
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,550
He once earnestly advised you

140
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,880
to leave this den of intrigue.

141
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,100
But you were filled with hatred,

142
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,910
trapped in the mire
and refusing to free yourself.

143
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,910
Even now, you still show no remorse.

144
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,360
Do you truly not fear karmic retribution?

145
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,560
How did you know that?

146
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,120
This is a private matter
of our Rong family.

147
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,750
An outsider

148
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,480
like you has no right to butt in.

149
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,730
Mr. Yan is indeed an outsider.

150
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,060
As a member of the Rong family,

151
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,520
I can intervene, can't I?

152
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,470
Lady Shanbao,

153
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,290
you've returned.

154
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,510
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

155
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,790
I'll take care of the Rong family's

156
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,820
private matters.

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,750
Yunshu.

158
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,270
I've properly resolved the matter
of the birthday gift.

159
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,670
Now that things have come to this,

160
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,840
it is time to settle accounts with you
properly.

161
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,370
Your most unforgivable act

162
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,720
was confining

163
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,630
our sick grandmother

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,660
to control the entire family.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,480
This is the deepest filial impiety.

166
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,390
What right do you have

167
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,390
to lecture me?

168
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,890
Let's not forget

169
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,600
that now you're still just a granddaughter

170
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,360
who has been expelled

171
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
from the Rong Mansion by Grandmother.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Guards.

173
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,680
Guards!

174
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,750
These two

175
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,600
are disturbing Grandmother's rest.

176
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,870
Throw both of them out!

177
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,770
Have you forgotten what Grandmother said?

178
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,700
While she's ill,

179
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,360
I am in charge of all the affairs
of the Rong family.

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,390
Are you all deaf?

181
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,360
Throw them out now!

182
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,630
Otherwise, when Grandmother wakes up,

183
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,490
every one of you will be punished.

184
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,630
Rong Yunshu.

185
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,080
Yang Yitang

186
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,540
has already turned you in.

187
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,750
You conspired with him
to bring trouble into our family,

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,350
which made Grandmother ill.

189
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,910
Now, Jiang Yiqian, the man behind him,

190
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,200
has also been arrested.

191
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
If you are still so stubborn
and refuse to repent,

192
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,030
I'll have the constables take you away

193
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,690
and interrogate you in court.

194
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm stubborn?

195
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,550
She was the one
who was stuck in outdated ways

196
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,480
and brought untold harm to others.

197
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,030
She was the one
who was obsessed with social standing

198
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,630
and treated my birth mother as someone

199
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,960
to be trampled on by all.

200
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,030
She was

201
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,750
the one who watched

202
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,840
her own son

203
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,910
die of grief,

204
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,840
forbade him to be buried
in the family graveyard,

205
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,630
and even barred me from paying homage
to my own parents.

206
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,840
To outsiders,

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,150
she is the respectable head

208
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,210
of the Rong family,

209
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,670
helping the distressed
and doing good far and wide.

210
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,530
But to members of the Rong family,

211
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,080
she's nothing but a tyrant!

212
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,720
Rong Shanbao, you were only 13

213
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,630
when she forced you

214
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,240
to join the tea caravan
on its trade routes,

215
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,440
nearly causing you to die far from home.

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,750
No matter how much you sacrificed
for the Rong family,

217
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,600
the moment you showed
the slightest disobedience,

218
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
you became a traitor to the Rong family,

219
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,510
stripped of everything

220
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,150
and expelled from the Rong family.

221
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,880
Is that fair?

222
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,950
You all accuse me of wanting to harm her.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,720
But why would I need to lift a finger?

224
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,630
The state she's in now

225
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
is Heaven's punishment for her.

226
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,150
Heaven is punishing

227
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,740
this overbearing old tyrant,

228
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,440
leaving her hands paralyzed,
her voice silenced,

229
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,910
her kin estranged
and her possessions stripped away!

230
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,750
Your father truly loved your mother.

231
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,790
They were indeed a rare loving couple.

232
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,360
But for his personal desires,

233
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,720
your father abandoned
the entire tea caravan.

234
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,550
The entire tea shipment
was looted by desert bandits.

235
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,440
More than 10 people died
or were injured.

236
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,270
If I had been the head of the Rong family,

237
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,030
I would also have needed
to give the tea farmers an explanation.

238
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,150
In her position,

239
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,060
Grandmother faced many difficult choices.

240
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,000
When I was lost in the desert,

241
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,000
so thirsty that I nearly

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,840
had to drink my own blood to save myself,

243
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,970
I did blame her once.

244
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,270
But had I been in her position,

245
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,530
I, too, might have been

246
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,390
forced to do certain things.

247
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Isn't that right,

248
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,430
Grandmother?

249
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,680
I'm not as magnanimous as you are.

250
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,030
Now that I cannot

251
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,830
seek justice for my poor mother,

252
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,080
what joy is there in living?

253
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,360
Better to just end it all.

254
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,000
Mr. Yan.

255
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,400
I...

256
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,710
I didn't mean to do it.

257
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,760
He threw himself onto the blade.

258
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,500
Take Lady Yunshu away at once.

259
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,490
Lady Yunshu.

260
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,850
Mr. Yan!

261
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,660
Lady Shanbao,

262
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,960
thank goodness you're alright.

263
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,150
Mr. Yan!

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, well,

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,960
you work here
but secretly serve someone else.

266
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,030
You've become a spy

267
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,120
for Lady Shanbao, haven't you?

268
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,750
Spare me, sir!

269
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,670
I wouldn't dare!

270
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,310
I would never dare to do such a thing!

271
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,790
I ordered you to seal off the riverbank

272
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,440
and spare no effort in the rescue.

273
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,390
You told me you couldn't

274
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,860
find any trace of Bai Yingsheng.

275
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,360
Yet he conspired with Lady Rong Shanbao

276
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,880
and snuck
into the Provincial Governor's Office.

277
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,070
Jun Dai, oh Jun Dai.

278
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,880
How remarkably well you kept this from me.

279
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Lady Shanbao said

280
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,510
Mr. Bai was reserved for other purposes

281
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,550
and couldn't be handed over
to the authorities.

282
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,720
Please don't be angry, My Lord.

283
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,520
I am completely loyal to you, My Lord.

284
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,120
It's just that my parents and sister

285
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,510
still work for the Rong family.

286
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,510
Their fate

287
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,720
rests entirely in the hands
of Lady Shanbao.

288
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,120
But I dare swear to Heaven

289
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,360
that apart from saving lives
for good karma,

290
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,030
there is not a single thing

291
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,760
I have hidden from you, My Lord.

292
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,420
Do you dare swear to Heaven

293
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,240
that you haven't hidden anything else
from me?

294
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
My Lord, you've said before

295
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,210
that my loyalty to Lady Shanbao

296
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,960
is loyalty to you.

297
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,200
It seems that Rong Shanbao

298
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,770
is still keeping far too many things
from me.

299
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,570
Take him away.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Give him 10 lashes
before bringing him back for questioning.

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,600
No, no!

302
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,440
Please don't!

303
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,860
My Lord, I'll tell you.

304
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,780
I'll tell you everything!

305
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,550
Speak.

306
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,960
As long as it's about Rong Shanbao,

307
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,270
you must not leave a single word out.

308
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,270
Old Madam Rong's illness

309
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
started from her ankles,

310
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,790
gradually spreading upward to the knees.

311
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,270
Within a month or two, it spread
to the thigh bones.

312
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,530
Then it moved to the shoulders and elbows

313
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,850
before finally reaching the hands.

314
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,420
It started with numbness and itching.
Then it felt like insects gnawing,

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,510
with the pain worsening through the night.

316
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,720
Since the illness didn't develop
overnight,

317
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,870
it cannot be cured in a month or two.

318
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,360
Doctor, your words are indeed strange.

319
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,200
Grandmother has always been
in good health.

320
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,430
She had a stroke
because she was frightened by bandits.

321
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,550
But according to your words,

322
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,410
it sounds like a chronic illness.

323
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,600
If Grandmother had truly been ill,

324
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
how could she have shown no signs at all?

325
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,310
Yunxi, did you know of this?

326
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,369
So your prescription...

327
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,160
The prescription from Dr. Sun earlier

328
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,040
primarily targets
excessive internal heat.

329
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,400
It is effective to some extent.

330
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,030
But Old Madam Rong's illness

331
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,110
is caused by chronic arthralgia.

332
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,050
She ought to take
the Life-Prolonging Decoction instead,

333
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,880
which will surely work
after just one dose.

334
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,230
Can it really be that miraculous?

335
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,810
Grandmother, you're awake!

336
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,480
-Grandmother, are you alright?
-Old Madam Rong.

337
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,280
You're awake.

338
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,590
-Grandmother.
-Grandmother.

339
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,720
How are you feeling?

340
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Hurry.

341
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,030
The moment Grandmother woke up,

342
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,310
she kept asking to see you.

343
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,070
Hurry up.

344
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,090
Don't panic.

345
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,510
You stay at Xinfang Pavilion.

346
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,640
If Mr. Yan wakes up,

347
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,320
come report to me at once.

348
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,040
Let's go.

349
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,750
Grandmother, are you feeling better?

350
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,030
You've suffered a lot.

351
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,240
Grandmother, if you're no longer angry
with me,

352
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,170
I don't feel it's suffering at all.

353
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,070
Where is she?

354
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,440
She is confined in the small courtyard
behind the ancestral hall.

355
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,970
Once you've fully recovered,
you can deal with her personally.

356
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,750
How is Bailou doing with his injuries?

357
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,150
According to the doctor,

358
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,380
Mr. Yan's injuries are severe,

359
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,880
and his life is in danger.

360
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,690
Whether he can pull through

361
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,920
depends on how he fares
these next two days.

362
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,830
I was thinking

363
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,350
we should send someone
to inform the Yan family immediately,

364
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,960
but I feared the journey would be too far

365
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
to make it in time.

366
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,010
Fortune favors the virtuous.

367
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,990
He is a fine young man,

368
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,240
even sacrificing himself to save you.

369
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,960
When you weren't at the Rong Mansion,

370
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,350
he still spoke well of you to me

371
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,480
every single day.

372
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,290
It was all because of him

373
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,350
that you and I could finally reconcile.

374
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,530
He is truly a blessing to our Rong family.

375
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,770
There are people attending to me here.

376
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,640
You need not stay by my side.

377
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,370
Go to Xinfang Pavilion

378
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,750
and make sure his life is saved.

379
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,850
Okay.

380
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,270
I'll go watch over him
at Xinfang Pavilion right away.

381
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,030
Grandmother, your illness
has only just taken a turn for the better.

382
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,790
You must not exhaust yourself
with worries.

383
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,270
Let me help you lie down first.

384
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,880
No.

385
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,960
Go tell Bailou

386
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,020
that if he pulls through,

387
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,790
I'll

388
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
grant him a wish.

389
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,680
A wish?

390
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,040
A wish that he has long kept hidden

391
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,130
in his heart

392
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,040
and has been too hesitant
to ever speak aloud.

393
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,210
As long as he survives,

394
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,720
I will make it come true for him.

395
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,350
[Prison]

396
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,960
I have urgent business
to discuss with Lord Luo.

397
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,490
Go tell him I need to see him!

398
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,920
Someone come at once!

399
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,290
I demand to see Lord Luo!

400
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Lord Jiang,

401
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,590
you're making such a fuss
to see the Imperial Inspector.

402
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,590
What exactly do you need to report?

403
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,310
Through the ages,

404
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,310
the cycle of rise and fall never ends.

405
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,550
Young man,

406
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,590
never burn all your bridges.

407
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,350
Do not celebrate your victory too soon.

408
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,070
Lord Jiang,

409
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,000
you yourself handed over

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,350
Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku.

411
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,470
For a single set of books,

412
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
you persisted in targeting Madam Yang
even after she had left

413
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,260
the Wei family.

414
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,580
Now the witness has confessed.

415
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,420
What excuses do you have left?

416
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,180
Shut up!

417
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,720
I did nothing wrong!

418
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,590
Wei Kejian was the real murderer!

419
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,110
The verdict
was not a miscarriage of justice!

420
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,270
Madam Yang was nothing but a prostitute

421
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,310
the Weis hired!

422
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,510
You and Rong Shanbao

423
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,640
are conspiring together

424
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
to frame me!

425
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,350
I want to see the Emperor!

426
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,320
I want to appeal for justice!

427
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,720
I want to see the Emperor!

428
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,090
My Lord, Miss Xu requests an audience.

429
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,400
Miss Xu?

430
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,160
Xu Meiying?

431
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,390
Lu Jianglai,
you are far from blameless yourself.

432
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,030
To serve your own selfish ends,

433
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,880
you pinned Madam Yang's death

434
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,830
on me!

435
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,590
You and those despicable people

436
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,880
are birds of a feather!

437
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,200
Lu Jianglai!

438
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,490
Guards! Let me out!

439
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,980
On his way back to the capital,
Minister Xu

440
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,350
was seized by a sudden recurrence
of his old ailment and lost consciousness.

441
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,270
The boat made an emergency stop
at Songzhou,

442
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,510
but before a doctor
could be summoned to treat him,

443
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,440
Minister Xu had passed away,

444
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,510
his pulses ceasing entirely.

445
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,720
Miss Xu is escorting his coffin
back to his hometown.

446
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,780
She is here to inform you of his death.

447
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,900
When you retire
and return to your hometown,

448
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,110
your boat will still pass through Linji.

449
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,840
At that time,

450
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,980
I will bring the finest Longjing tea

451
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,910
and wait for you at the dock.

452
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,830
Senior Lu, the Xu family
is not a big family,

453
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,000
and I am my father's only daughter.

454
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,240
If I go back alone,
I might be bullied by my relatives.

455
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,900
On his deathbed, my father

456
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,560
told me to seek help from you.

457
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,550
Senior Lu, I beg you,

458
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,680
for the sake of the old bonds
between my father and you...

459
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,640
Please, don't!

460
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,200
Please sit down.

461
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I'll never forget

462
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,650
the kindness
your father bestowed on me.

463
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,480
I will ensure
his funeral is handled properly.

464
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,720
Have several quiet rooms

465
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
prepared at once.

466
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,070
And make sure
the Xu family is well settled.

467
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,680
Yes.

468
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,600
Junior Xu.

469
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,160
You must not let grief ravage your health.

470
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,270
Your own well-being must still come first.

471
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,930
I see that you don't look well.

472
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,030
Go and rest in the rear quarters first.

473
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,360
All other matters can be discussed later.

474
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,830
Jun Dai.

475
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,960
Miss Xu, please.

476
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,030
Senior Lu, forgive me

477
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,750
for losing control of my emotions.

478
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,810
I didn't bring many servants with me.

479
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,330
Three or four rooms will be enough.

480
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,310
But on my way here,

481
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,710
I came across a beggar
on the brink of death.

482
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,650
I felt compassion for him,

483
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,350
so I brought him along.

484
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,260
I'm sorry for causing you undue trouble.

485
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
He is gravely ill.

486
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,110
Senior Lu, please

487
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,400
find a doctor for him.

488
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,480
What kind

489
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,280
of deep hatred

490
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,510
could drive someone to do

491
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,410
something so cruel to another?

492
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,740
His limbs were ruined,

493
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,680
his voice silenced, his sight lost.

494
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,680
Yet he desperately tried

495
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,410
to crawl all the way into Linji.

496
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,640
He was being teased
by a group of children.

497
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
I took pity on him,

498
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,880
so I brought him with me.

499
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,440
Get a doctor for him.

500
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,590
Yes.

501
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,500
Why don't you go in?

502
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,690
She said, "I thought
you would understand me.

503
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,440
But why would even you stand in my way?

504
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,790
Why would even you think

505
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,200
I should admit guilt?"

506
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,240
Lady Shanbao.

507
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,310
Was I wrong?

508
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,640
You two are

509
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,670
quite a pair.

510
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,240
There's something I need to tell you.

511
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,000
Grandmother hasn't fully recovered yet.

512
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,480
How could you bring her here
while she's still so weak?

513
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,830
-You...
-It was I who insisted they carry me here.

514
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,830
Don't blame them.

515
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,880
Grandmother, please go back.

516
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,740
I'll stay here and watch over him.

517
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,620
Do you think

518
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm overly concerned about Bailou?

519
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,590
You know

520
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,790
that the Yan family once sent a man

521
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,920
to our Rong Mansion.

522
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,610
He was Bailou's grand-uncle.

523
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,960
He was the ninth son of the Yan family,

524
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
so everyone called him Ninth Young Master.

525
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,330
Though he was handsome,

526
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,400
he was too gentle and too reserved.

527
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,680
He was truly not much to my liking.

528
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,350
I seldom visited his quarters.

529
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,270
But in the end,

530
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,590
he gave his own life

531
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,830
to save mine.

532
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,060
I didn't know this.

533
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,330
Grandmother,
you never mentioned this before.

534
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
It was a long time ago.

535
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,870
That year, he accompanied me
on the tea caravan route.

536
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,750
When I got trapped in the quicksand,

537
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I thought that was the end of my life.

538
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,370
I never imagined

539
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,740
that he would risk his own life
to save me.

540
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,510
When I saw Bailou that day,

541
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,610
I felt somewhat disappointed,

542
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,760
because the two of them
didn't look much alike.

543
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,450
It wasn't until I saw Bailou

544
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,720
step forward to shield you from the blade

545
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,250
that I suddenly understood

546
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,170
the two of them were the same

547
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,720
in at least one aspect.

548
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,770
The men of the Yan family

549
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,410
are ready to lay down their lives

550
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,120
for the women they love.

551
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,770
Fortunately, there are

552
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,060
two renowned doctors, Dr. Hou and Dr. Sun,
in our mansion.

553
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,900
Dr. Sun

554
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,240
is especially skilled at treating wounds.

555
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
He will surely spare no effort

556
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,500
to save Mr. Yan's life.

557
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
Please don't be too distressed.

558
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,510
The Rong and Yan families have been bound
by marriage for generations,

559
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,680
maintaining a long-standing alliance.

560
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,960
Now, the Yan family is thriving

561
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
in the Shu region.

562
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,310
Last year,

563
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
they shipped 20,000 bales of tea

564
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,310
via the Guanmaosong Ancient Road.

565
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,310
They sent their son

566
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,440
to our Rong family.

567
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,130
Their intention to strengthen the alliance
is obvious.

568
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,750
I also intend to open up

569
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,000
a new tea trade route for our family.

570
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,720
As long as Bailou

571
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,390
pulls through,

572
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
you two shall marry.

573
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,350
My mind is made up.

574
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,550
Fushan Temple is really well-known
for making wishes come true.

575
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,150
Tomorrow,

576
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,390
go draw a fortune stick for Bailou.

577
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,230
Yes.

578
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,870
[Fushan Temple]

579
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,220
Slow down.

580
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,160
In his later years, my father devoted
himself to Buddhist practice,

581
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,620
often visiting temples
to listen to sutras.

582
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,070
Fushan Temple is the most eminent
monastery in Jiangnan,

583
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,330
holding scripture lectures each month.

584
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
I intend to place

585
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,690
a memorial tablet here in his honor,

586
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,420
fulfilling his lifelong wish.

587
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,350
However, the abbot, Master Xuhui,

588
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,710
is a revered monk of our time.

589
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,110
It's not easy to meet him.

590
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,400
So I have to trouble you to take time out

591
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,830
of your busy schedule to accompany me.

592
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,230
There is no need for such formality
between us.

593
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,490
The kindness Minister Xu bestowed on me
was immeasurable.

594
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,770
Even if I were to sacrifice myself,
I couldn't repay a fraction of it.

595
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,700
Being able to do something for him now
is a privilege.

596
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,150
I don't deserve such thanks.

597
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,640
This is what Grandmother

598
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
wanted me to see?

That Miss Xu

601
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,350
was Minister Xu's beloved daughter.

602
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,350
After Minister Xu passed away,

603
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,160
she came to seek refuge with Lord Lu.

604
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,000
She was settled in the rear quarters
of the Government Office.

605
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,030

That oath-breaking scoundrel!

635
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,250
You not only saved his life,

636
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,920
but also defied Grandmother

637
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,270
and gave up
the Rong family's vast fortune for him.

638
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,830
If he had even a shred of conscience,

639
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,920
he ought to lay down his life

to repay your kindness.

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Yet he openly walked arm in arm
with another woman,

642
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,560
clearly having an affair behind your back.

643
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,750
He's unfaithful and shameless!

Why did you come back?

645
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,510
You should tear off his hypocritical mask

646

and give him the punishment he deserves!

Lord Lu has been appointed
as Prefect of Linji.

He has even brought down Jiang Yiqian

and a brilliant future.

As long as he treats tea farmers well

and respects the tea trade,

655
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,510
our Rong family should not only
avoid offending him

656

but also maintain good relations with him.

What kind of talk is this?

658
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,880
Do you really intend to cast him aside?

Fine!

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,150
Do not stand on ceremony.

671
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,100
From now on, don't call me Old Madam Rong.

00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,350
Just call me Grandmother.

673
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,400
Since I came to Linji,

674
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,640
Old Madam Rong, you have shown me
such care and kindness,

675
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,470

I'm not that delicate.

681
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,150
It's merely a superficial wound.

682
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,590
I'll recover soon.

You've been with our Rong family
for so long now.

685
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,800
I have watched

686
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,030
your every word and action closely.

687
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,320
You are gentle and refined,

688
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,030
and your conduct
is always measured and proper.

689
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,630
Though many young men
came to the Rong Mansion,

690
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,960
but only you

691
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,870
have remained free from strife,

692
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,730
open-hearted and upright,

693
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,639
without a trace of resentment or envy.

694
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,000
You truly have

695
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
a remarkable character.

696
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,670
I have been testing you
for quite some time.

697
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,880
Only you can shoulder
such great responsibility

698
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,550
and are worthy
of marrying our Rong family's

Don't forget

what you've promised me.

704
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,360
Mr. Yan, Grandmother is right.

705
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,360
You need to recover soon

706
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,660
so that our Rong family can prepare
for the wedding.

707
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,030
The case about Jiang Yiqian

708
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,550
has been sent to the Ministry of Justice.

709
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,030
With Imperial Inspector Luo's testimony,

710
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,690
the charges are irrefutable.

711
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,550
Those wrongfully imprisoned magistrates

712
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,810
will be released soon.

713
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,150
Everyone praises your righteous courage

714
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,350
and decisive action.

715
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,760
You should be happy.

716
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,410
Why do you wear such a worried look?

717
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,220
There's still one case

718
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,040
that remains unsolved.

719
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,480
Yang Yitang has been interrogated
repeatedly.

720
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,590
If he did not commit the murder
out of hatred,

721
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,990
then who drove Madam Yang

722
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,440
to her death?

723
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,640
I thought

724
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,460
you were troubled due to Miss Xu.

725
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,680
Haven't you noticed it?

726
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,760
Noticed what?

727
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,280
Have some tea.

728
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,190
Though the Xu family is small,

729
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,840
Minister Xu was an upright official

730
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,110
and deeply revered by local people.

731
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,370
When Miss Xu goes back,

732
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,380
there surely will be people
she can rely on.

733
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,040
Minister Xu

734
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,550
asked his beloved daughter to come to you.

735
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,960
He clearly intended
to betroth his daughter to you.

736
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,110
Miss Xu is beautiful and intelligent,

737
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,480
skilled in both calligraphy and painting.

738
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,510
Though from a noble family, she's humble,

739
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,510
gentle and well-mannered.

740
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,670
Such a fine woman

741
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,450
is the dream of countless men.

742
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,650
If she marries you,

743
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,070
she'll surely be a virtuous wife

744
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,800
and understanding companion.

745
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
Someone just loves
to make things difficult for themselves.

746
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,190
Fine, I'll say no more.

747
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,880
Since you don't want to marry her,

748
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,440
you must make yourself perfectly clear.

749
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,010
Don't leave any room for misunderstanding.

750
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,740
I know.

751
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,530
My Lord, Miss Xu requests an audience.

752
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,660
Minister Xu has just passed away.

753
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,160
She is still in the depths of grief.

754
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,450
If you're going to refuse the marriage,

755
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,850
you must do it tactfully.

756
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,730
Don't put the young lady
in an awkward position.

757
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,900
Tell her to come in.

758
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,760
Yes.

759
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,440
Senior Lu, Mr. Lang.

760
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,550
Here's some fresh tea. Take your time.

761
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,150
I'll take my leave now.

762
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,440
No, you stay.

763
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,190
I'd like you to be here while we talk.

764
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,670
Junior Xu,
you've come at the perfect time.

765
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,040
I was just about to look for you.

766
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,700
Have a seat.

767
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,190
In the rear quarters,
the clerks, the constables

768
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,790
and the visitors are all men.

769
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,230
Aside from the old cook in the kitchen,

770
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,630
there is not a single woman here.

771
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,230
Junior Xu,

772
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,240
you are an unmarried young lady.

773
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,190
Staying here would be highly improper

774
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,810
and would inevitably harm your reputation.

775
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,670
Minister Xu asked me to take care of you.

776
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,840
Then I am like your own brother.

777
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,310
If I fail to do my utmost,

778
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,840
that will be unforgivable.

779
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,440
If you are unwilling
to return to your hometown,

780
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,970
then I will find you another

781
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,540
peaceful residence in Linji.

782
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,340
You can move there in three days.

783
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,480
Once your mourning period is over,

784
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,710
I will find you

785
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,330
a virtuous and talented

786
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,480
husband from a family of equal standing.

787
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,010
Only thus
can I live up to Minister Xu's trust.

788
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,630
Senior Lu, I get

789
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,450
what you're saying.

790
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,480
Please continue your conversation.

791
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,740
I'll take my leave now.

792
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,760
Wait.

793
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,800
Senior Lu asked you to stay here.

794
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,710
It's to stop any gossip before it starts.

795
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,840
He doesn't regard you as an outsider,

796
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,370
so you don't have to be so eager to leave.

797
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
My father is gone.

798
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,180
And there is no elder in the family
to make decisions for me.

799
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,780
So there are certain matters

800
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,840
that I can decide for myself.

801
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,710
Senior Lu, since you're willing

802
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,320
to speak frankly with me,

803
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,700
then I will also speak plainly.

804
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,320
Some of my words may offend you.

805
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,570
Do you refuse to marry me

806
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,490
because you intend
to become a live-in son-in-law

807
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,600
of the Rong family?

808
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,440
You're really well-informed.

809
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,110
I've heard the talk

810
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,570
going around the streets.

811
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,560
When my father was alive,
he used to tell me

812
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,840
that all talented men

813
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,640
are inevitably arrogant

814
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,190
and unsociable.

815
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,280
Such people can hardly

816
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,940
succeed in official circles.

817
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,630
He had many students.

818
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,920
But only you, Senior Lu,

819
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,250
were most valued by him,

820
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,710
because you have
unwavering determination

821
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,840
and great ambition,

822
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,400
take on responsibility without flinching
in crisis,

823
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,860
know when to be principled
and when to adapt,

824
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,420
and hold a heart of true benevolence.

825
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Given time,

826
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,110
you will surely assist the Emperor

827
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,790
in achieving national rejuvenation

828
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,650
and ushering in a prosperous era.

829
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,580
Among all the promising talents at court,

830
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,260
you were the only one

831
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,880
my father spoke so highly of.

832
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,340
But sometimes my father also worried

833
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,320
that your early success

834
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,480
would arouse envy and resentment.

835
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,120
The slightest misstep

836
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,780
could put your life in peril.

837
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,900
What exactly are you trying to say?

838
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,370
The Rong family
is a powerful local clan,

839
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,530
with overwhelming influence.

840
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,070
For others, marrying into the Rong family
as a son-in-law

841
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,790
would surely be a shortcut
to instant prosperity.

842
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,660
But if you marry Miss Rong,

843
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,440
people will inevitably criticize

844
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,400
that you let your personal feelings
cloud your judgment in the Wei case.

845
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,460
More importantly,

846
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,630
the Emperor trusts you so much.

847
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,580
Sooner or later, you will leave Linji.

848
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,730
For the sake of a single woman,

849
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,320
would you truly be willing
to confine yourself to this tiny corner

850
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,150
and abandon the grand aspirations
you vowed to pursue

851
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,210
when you first entered officialdom?

852
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,400
Miss Xu, you...

853
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,000
Mr. Lang, Senior Lu,
please don't misunderstand me.

854
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,150
It is true that my father intended

855
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,010
to entrust my future to Senior Lu.

856
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,170
But a marriage between a man and a woman

857
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,230
must be blessed by the will of Heaven.

858
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,500
If it's not my destined match,

859
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,290
I have no desire to force it.

860
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,980
Senior Lu, I said these words,

861
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,190
only because I don't want to see

862
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,850
you fail to fulfill your ambitions
in the future

863
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,360
and regret it for the rest of your life.

864
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Junior Xu, I have already...

865
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,920
Senior Lu, you should
think it through yourself

866
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,450
and make your own decision.

867
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,070
However, I came today

868
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,600
for another urgent matter.

869
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,230
It's about the beggar

870
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,160
who came with me.

871
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,710
What's wrong with that beggar?

872
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,370
Please follow me, both of you.

873
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,510
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

874
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,400
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

875
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,110
What's wrong?

876
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,360
Young Master, what's wrong?

877
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,280
-Please get up, Young Master!
-Young Master!

878
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,080
Young Master!

879
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,110
My Lord.

880
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,520
Help him up quickly.

881
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,200
Yes.

882
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,260
Come on, Young Master.

883
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,370
Young Master.

884
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,190
I can see
that you originally had a handsome face

885
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,250
and noble bearing.

886
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,710
You don't seem like an ordinary beggar.

887
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,560
I am Lu Jianglai, the Prefect of Linji.

888
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,920
If you have suffered an injustice,

889
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,450
you can tell me everything.

890
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,230
There's no hurry.

891
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,870
Can you write?

892
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,010
Bring paper and brush.

893
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:09,570
Yes.

894
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,550
But his tendons in both hands and feet
have been severed.

895
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,010
How can he possibly write?

896
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,070
He can hold the brush with his mouth.

897
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,950
We must at least give it a try.

898
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,290
That makes sense.

899
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,260
What is he writing?

900
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,920
It's completely illegible.

901
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,550
Take your time.

902
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,630
Don't rush.

903
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,060
Stay calm.

904
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,870
I know you have grievances to express.

905
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,630
However, even 3 years may not be enough
for a child to learn to write well.

906
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,960
You're using your mouth
instead of your hands.

907
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,360
That must be much harder.

908
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,090
Take your time.

909
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,440
You can practice it slowly.

910
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,360
I'll wait here

911
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,830
until you make it.

912
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,900
Lord Lu's word is his bond.

913
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,400
He never breaks his promise.

914
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,200
Rest assured.

915
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,110
I know

916
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,840
that you've suffered greatly,

917
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,860
carrying immense bitterness in your heart.

918
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,870
Write it down.

919
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,100
Only by writing it down

920
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,490
