00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,770
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,170
What the Rong family took in

4
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,680
was a poor woman who was beaten

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,000
by her mother-in-law and husband
until she miscarried.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,759
She was bedridden for three months

7
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,220
before she escaped death.

8
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,759
She neither killed nor burned,

9
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,509
nor did she transgress in any way.

10
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,039
How could she be a criminal?

11
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,710
Even if she were brought to the court,

12
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,870
she would be a witness, not the accused.

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,120
But you even intend to shift the blame

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,050
for false accusation onto others?

15
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,680
How can there be

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,440
such an easy way out in this world?

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,800
You!

18
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,350
Father,

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
please calm down.

20
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,310
Miss Rong makes a valid point.

21
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,870
Now is not the time

22
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,600
to shift blame onto each other.

23
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,630
I hope Miss Rong,

24
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,590
considering the past friendship
between our families,

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,250
can show our Yang family
in the right direction.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,280
The Wei family mistreated my aunt first.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
Their downfall was their own doing,

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,590
and they can't blame others.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,370
My family stepped back many times,

30
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,240
all for the sake of
my aunt and her husband's harmony.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,710
Later, despite our exhaustive efforts
to find her,

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,120
we accused him
of murder in a moment of righteous anger.

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,050
Yet, many hidden grievances
and circumstances

34
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,150
are difficult to share with outsiders.

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,400
There's just one thing
I must tell Miss Rong:

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,470
the ones who filed the lawsuit

37
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,070
were indeed the Yang family.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,590
But with the multiple subsequent retrials

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,390
implicating

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,290
countless unexpected events,

41
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,800
the Yang family has long

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,860
since lost control of the situation.

43
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,950
Are you saying

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
the Yang family was also coerced

45
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,470
with no other choice?

46
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,710
Father.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,750
Miss Rong generously sheltered my aunt

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,560
and took on countless responsibilities.

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,710
Her anger now

50
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,590
is for my aunt's injustice.

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,430
You shouldn't be angry;

52
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,800
instead, you should thank her
for her noble integrity.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,910
Since things have reached this point now,

54
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,710
it's pointless to argue
who's right or wrong.

55
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,640
Both families must face the court,

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,579
so we should work together

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,170
to resolve the grudges

58
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,240
and turn conflict into peace.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm just worried

60
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,630
that your aunt
may resent her maiden family and,

61
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,710
if provoked by someone
with ulterior motives,

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,510
might speak recklessly in court

63
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,110
and ruin the big picture.

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,820
After so many years apart,

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I don't know what my aunt's temperament

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,810
or personality is like now.

67
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,680
Can Miss Rong give us some advice, please?

68
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,260
I have a couple of things to say,

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,720
though I'm not sure
if I should bring them up.

70
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,770
Yunshu?

71
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,270
Eldest Sister,
you've always been so smart.

72
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,079
A small thing like this
is hardly an obstacle for you.

73
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
You just don't have the heart
to go through with it.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,560
Then let me be

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,690
the bad person here.

76
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,270
Uncle Yang, Mr. Yang.

77
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,800
Although the government has arrested him,

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,340
the truth hasn't been confirmed yet.

79
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,800
What is the evidence then?

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,310
What?

81
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,760
Don't you two understand yet?

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,040
He hasn't spoken a word?

83
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,840
My Lord, he hasn't spoken.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,950
This case is difficult to judge.

85
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,160
News of the Imperial Inspector's drowning

86
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,480
reached the capital

87
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,580
and infuriated His Majesty.

88
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,720
He ordered Xu Song, the Prefect of Linji,

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,420
to personally take over the investigation.

90
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,670
Xu Song
dared not delegate to others.

91
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,720
He brought
the accused and evidence to court

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
and examined
the details of the case

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,050
one by one with strict interrogation.

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,740
The suspect,
Wei Kejian, has lost his sanity

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,960
and can't even utter the word "injustice".

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
Given this, Xu Song made sure

97
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,630
all official procedures
appeared impeccably proper.

98
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,630
Moreover, this case has passed
through many hands,

99
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,950
and every official involved
now fears implication.

100
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,430
Which one of them would permit a retrial?

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,680
My advice to you is this:
Caution and Discretion.

102
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,080
That's the key point.

103
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,610
I nearly lost my life in Linji,

104
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,160
so I know how deep

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,290
this water truly is.

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,370
But since I've taken this case,

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,060
I will face all dangers

108
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,520
and get to the bottom of it.

109
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,230
Only then will I be worthy
of the long journey

110
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,730
you undertook to secure
the imperial decree

111
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,130
that verified my status.

112
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,090
Though Wei Kejian has gone mad,

113
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,270
he is still

114
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,920
under Xu Song's strict supervision.

115
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,510
I am afraid

116
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,310
that Xu Song won't let you
see him easily.

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Fortunately,
you've got Madam Yang yourself.

118
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,950
She

119
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,760
is the only solid evidence in this case.

120
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,630
You must force her to talk.

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't worry, Mentor.

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,360
I will definitely make her talk.

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,830
My Lord.

124
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,050
I understand. You may go back.

125
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,310
Please give us your instructions, My Lord.

126
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,000
Minister Xu

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
has come with the Emperor's decree.

128
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,790
The Ministry of Justice
has rejected the case files.

129
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,700
The case will be retried.

130
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,690
Holy Mother and Son, may you live forever!

131
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,750
Good.

132
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,430
Good bird.

133
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,159
The Empress Dowager's birthday
is followed by the Longevity Festival.

134
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,190
I'm counting on all of you

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,220
to make me look good
in front of the Empress Dowager.

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,830
But, My Lord...

137
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,610
Just let him try the case then.

138
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,750
That old lord

139
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,870
is about to retire.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,510
He's already one foot in the grave,

141
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,560
yet he still came specially
to watch you preside over this case.

142
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,420
If you don't preside over it well,

143
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,760
how will you survive

144
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,560
in the officialdom after this?

145
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,070
No water can rise above the ship's mast.

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,500
No hand can be big enough
to cover the sky.

147
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,530
All people in this world

148
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,460
have their own fates.

149
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,549
Just go back.

150
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,030
It's not your turn to be anxious yet.

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,760
Allow me to take my leave.

152
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,990
Miss Rong.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,480
What an imposing

154
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,030
and powerful Imperial Inspector Lu!

155
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,670
Does he forget how he was once
clinging to life by a thread,

156
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,730
gravely wounded and awaiting death?

157
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,550
If not for your kindness

158
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,480
in taking him in,

159
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
how could he still be alive?

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,960
He'd have been eaten
by vultures and wolves,

161
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,970
let alone coming to throw
his weight around at the Rong family!

162
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,970
What an ungrateful

163
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,700
and disrespectful damned man!

164
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,870
We're not going!
Drive those officers away.

165
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,470
We're definitely not going!

166
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,710
If we don't accept a polite invitation,

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,290
then the government
will come to arrest us.

168
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,030
How dare him?

169
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,150
Miss Rong, the Emperor has given

170
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,440
his imperial word to reopen the Wei case.

171
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,240
All of Linji is buzzing about it.

172
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,700
Everyone is waiting to see

173
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
how this case will be solved.

174
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,080
When officials arrested Madam Yang,

175
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,480
she was with Lady Yunwan.

176
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,910
I'm afraid we can't hide where Madam Yang

177
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,710
has been hiding all these years.

178
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,550
But Lady Yunwan's side...

179
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,790
Didn't he want the witness
to be present in the court?

180
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,320
I will go.

181
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,440
They've recently dotted the hillslope

182
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,510
beneath this tea grove
with chrysanthemums and orchids.

183
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,240
Now, with the autumn blossoms
in full display,

184
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,960
the view is a delight to the senses.

185
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Old Madam,
you often stroll here to unwind,

186
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,770
which'll never fail to lift your spirits.

187
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,440
This was Bao's idea?

188
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,440
Yes.

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,860
Who would have thought

190
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,390
that tea trees could thrive alongside

191
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,780
wild chrysanthemums
and grow so vigorously?

192
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,560
I recall Miss Rong mentioned
that next year,

193
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,870
varieties of chrysanthemum
are to be carefully chosen

194
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,220
for both petals and roots

195
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,820
that can be used in medicine.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,750
No wonder you're being so kind,

197
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,000
accompanying an old woman like me
for a walk.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,660
It turns out
that you're speaking on her behalf.

199
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,310
She won't appreciate your efforts.

200
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,120
Lady Rong, Miss Rong...

201
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,840
Enough.

202
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,570
It's rare for me to come out for a stroll.

203
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,970
Let's not talk about troublesome matters.

204
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,560
I know your heart is full of sincerity,

205
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,470
far better than that Lu fellow.

206
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,390
But unfortunately,
you keep everything bottled up inside.

207
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,790
You do good deeds
but no one knows about them.

208
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,790
You're honest...

209
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,730
To a fault.

210
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,900
Miss Rong insists on appearing in court.

211
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,750
She must have a well-thought-out plan.

212
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,720
Miss, you have lost

213
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,080
a lot of weight these past few days.

214
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,010
You'd take better care of yourself

215
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,290
and not worry so much about others.

216
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,550
How could the court
be a pleasant place to visit?

217
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,650
The Rong family stands in Linji
because of its reputation.

218
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,360
Eldest Sister's position
is extremely important.

219
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,630
If she loses in court,

220
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,830
it means the Rong family loses.

221
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,360
Those who understand

222
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,550
will say Eldest Sister is virtuous

223
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,080
and took pity on Madam Yang.

224
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,740
Those who don't know the truth

225
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,390
will surely say
our family is harboring a criminal

226
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,060
to seize the Wei family's tea plantation.

227
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,860
How does that reputation sound?

228
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,840
Grandmother is getting old now.

229
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
How could she bear such disgrace?

230
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,270
Well said.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Grandmother.

232
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,790
I'm impressed you thought of this.

233
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,910
You are even more

234
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,320
sensible and filial than Shanbao.

235
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,030
I'm not stopping her
from doing good deeds.

236
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,940
But as the head of the Rong family,

237
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,130
I must see further than she does.

238
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,070
Saving one person's life

239
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,240
is a small kindness.

240
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,790
Bearing responsibility for thousands of
tea workers' livelihoods

241
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,120
is the greater good.

242
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,120
To think that just to save Madam Yang,

243
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,790
we must sacrifice the Rong family's

244
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,200
century-old reputation

245
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,030
and abandon the duty
that rests on our shoulders!

246
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,960
How could I not be furious with her?

247
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,090
It's me, being not resilient enough.

248
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
Grandmother.

249
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,670
Eldest Sister already has

250
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,360
a solution.

251
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,290
She won't lose in court.

252
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,920
Please don't blame her anymore.

253
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,390
Alright.

254
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,000
Yesterday,

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,230
the calming pillow you sent was excellent.

256
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,810
My maid used to make ones

257
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,870
with sandalwood and borneol too.

258
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,910
But they weren't as effective as yours.

259
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,600
I added my own sun-dried

260
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,060
gardenia petals and mint.

261
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,470
I was afraid you couldn't sleep well,

262
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,200
so I added them to help you relax
and sleep better.

263
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,120
Lately,

264
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,370
are your eyes getting any better?

265
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,560
What medicine
have you been taking recently?

266
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,000
So it is truly the Wei family's case.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
The real culprit has gone mad,

268
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,900
so what's to investigate?

269
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,330
Haven't you heard?

270
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,440
The wife who died over ten years ago

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,640
has come back to life.

272
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,720
No wonder everyone is like flies to blood,

273
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,050
rushing here in swarms.

274
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,270
Everyone wants to see

275
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,790
how people can return from the dead.

276
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,080
Come on, let's go have a look too.

277
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,280
How is that possible?

278
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,150
Let's go.

279
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
Let's see what's happening.

280
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,150
We must go take a look.

281
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,770
Don't push.

282
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,980
[Linzhang Government]

283
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,910
Might!

284
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,870
Power!

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,040
Miss Rong.

286
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,680
If Old Master finds out...

287
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,680
Then we just won't let him know.

288
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,590
Here they come.

289
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,730
As your guest,
I'd follow your lead, Lord Xu.

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,530
How about you take the lead?

291
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,390
I forgot.

292
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Lord Xu's verdict

293
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
has been rejected
by the Ministry of Justice.

294
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,770
Today, it's more appropriate

295
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,610
that I preside over the proceedings.

296
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,070
Please.

297
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,350
Bring forth witnesses Madam Yang

298
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,910
and Yang Jisheng to the court.

299
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,510
Bring Madam Yang
and Yang Jisheng to the court!

300
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,110
I, Yang Jisheng,

301
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,810
pay my respects to both lords.

302
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,190
Yang Jisheng.

303
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,320
Open your eyes and look carefully.

304
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Who is standing beside you?

305
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,230
You accused your brother-in-law Wei Kejian

306
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,490
of beating his wife to death.

307
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,160
Now Madam Yang has been found.

308
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,260
What else do you have to say?

309
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,720
My Lord,

310
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,200
this is not my sister Yang Yun.

311
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,340
You keep your mouth shut

312
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,280
and refuse to admit you're Yang Yun.

313
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,250
It's only because you fear your brother

314
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,320
would be charged with false accusation

315
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,050
and the entire Yang family
would be punished.

316
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,450
For this, you'd rather hide your identity,

317
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,790
willingly serve as
a servant in the Rong family,

318
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,670
and live as a walking dead
for your entire life.

319
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,660
Yang Yun, how foolish you are.

320
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Go to the court and see

321
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,140
how your Yang family treats you.

322
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,150
Who are you?

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,910
How dare you come to court

324
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,970
and falsely claim to be our relative?

325
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,600
My Lord,

326
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,710
Yun is my very own dear sister

327
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,240
and we have the same mother.

328
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,960
How could a brother

329
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,620
not recognize his own sister?

330
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,020
There is some resemblance in appearance,

331
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
but she is absolutely not my sister.

332
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,110
How can you be so sure?

333
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,810
My Lord,

334
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,180
the notorious case of Wei Kejian,

335
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,270
who cruelly killed his wife,
shook Jiangnan to its core.

336
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,270
Despite repeated investigations
for ten years,

337
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,480
no verdict has been reached,

338
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,210
which is common knowledge now.

339
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,320
If she were truly my sister,

340
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,510
why would she hide herself
for so many years?

341
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,320
Why would she stand by and watch

342
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,580
the Yang and Wei families clash in court,

343
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,790
watch her innocent husband

344
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,050
imprisoned unjustly,

345
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,200
watch the Wei family fall into ruin

346
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,290
and its members scatter,

347
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,320
and watch her mother-in-law waste away
from hunger and cold?

348
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,870
Why?

349
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,480
My sister, Yang Yun, is a woman
of both knowledge and virtue,

350
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,630
renowned for her exemplary filial piety,

351
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,480
graceful decorum,
and peerless moral character.

352
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
How could she commit such unfilial

353
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,210
and unconscionable acts?

354
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,480
It must be the Wei family's people

355
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,440
who want to reopen the case

356
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,150
and found this woman
to deliberately deceive us.

357
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,880
How pitiful!

358
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,360
My poor, innocent sister,

359
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,750
cruelly slain,

360
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,050
now bears this guilt even in death.

361
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Her name dragged through the mud,

362
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,940
her very being devoured, flesh and bone!

363
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,349
My Lords,

364
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,270
please uphold justice
for me,

365
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,040
and clear my sister's name!

366
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,720
Lord Lu, you heard all that?

367
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,310
Yang Jisheng and Yang Yun

368
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,970
are siblings, immediate kin.

369
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,869
Even if others failed
to recognize Madam Yang,

370
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,050
he certainly would not.

371
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
Moreover, every point he made was valid.

372
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,750
If Madam Yang were truly alive,

373
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,550
why'd she remain hidden

374
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
and watch her husband be condemned?

375
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,790
This simply doesn't make sense.

376
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,210
I did hear that.

377
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,740
Madam Yang,

378
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,270
everyone in court can hear

379
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,640
Yang Jisheng's words,

380
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,750
but you alone are deaf and blind,

381
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,550
with a leaf before the eye.

382
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,310
I fear all your devoted efforts

383
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,480
have been spent sheltering
a nest of serpents

384
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,080
you've warmed in your bosom!

385
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,590
My Lord, everyone in my Yang family,

386
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,680
all 170 members,

387
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,830
can testify to this.

388
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,640
If you still don't believe me, My Lord,

389
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,240
you can summon Yang family relatives

390
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,720
and longtime neighbors.

391
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,590
They are people

392
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,750
who witnessed Yun grow up

393
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,350
and who have seen me
escort her to her wedding.

394
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,550
They can all attest

395
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,990
that not a single word

396
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
of what I've said today is false.

397
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,750
Madam Yang!

398
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,790
They want to drink your blood

399
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,790
and devour your flesh.

400
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,050
Are you still going to remain obstinate?

401
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,620
You don't recognize me,

402
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,720
but I recognize who you are.

403
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,000
I recognized you

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,390
when you gathered
your friends for drinking bouts,

405
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,310
were expelled
by the mentor of Songhe Academy,

406
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,130
and received
thirty lashes from our father.

407
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,200
I recognized your wolf-hearted nature

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,390
and your profit-driven mind.

409
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,360
Knowing full well the Wei family

410
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,590
had abused a daughter-in-law to death,

411
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,370
yet you still
threw your own sister into that inferno.

412
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,490
I recognized your mouth
full of benevolence and virtue,

413
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,480
constantly using filial duty
and moral rectitude to pressure me,

414
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,270
feeding my flesh and blood to fill

415
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,550
the Wei family's pit of suffering

416
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,090
while you lived a carefree life.

417
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,790
I recognized you--cunning as a fox

418
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,590
and greedy as a wolf--who,

419
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,240
for the sake of three hundred mu
of Wei family tea fields,

420
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,880
fabricated charges to accuse
your brother-in-law of murder,

421
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,210
bringing ruin
upon the entire Wei family.

422
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,040
My Lord!

423
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,310
I have said it.

424
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,870
I've endured this for ten whole years.

425
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,480
If I didn't speak up,

426
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,310
I'd have suffocated from holding it in.

427
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,520
You liar!

428
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,160
My Lord, don't believe her.

429
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,240
She's a liar!

430
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,960
This woman's story

431
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
has details and makes sense.

432
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,730
It doesn't sound false.

433
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,590
This Yang family

434
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,110
is truly despicable.

435
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,550
Madam Yang, since you're still alive,

436
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,480
why didn't you
come forward earlier to testify?

437
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
Yes, why did you wait until now?

438
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,170
Please examine that, My Lord.

439
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,200
What are they looking at?

440
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,960
-Such a large scar.
-An old scar.

441
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,550
It really exists.

442
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,410
Indeed it does.

443
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,440
My Lord,

444
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,070
this woman has

445
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,330
an old scar on her head,

446
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,790
which is deep, narrow,
and over 7cm long.

447
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,450
Madam Yang,

448
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,380
where does this scar come from

449
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,550
and what does it have to do
with this case?

450
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,550
Since I married into the Wei family,

451
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,110
I've suffered constant abuse
from my mother-in-law

452
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,840
and had a strained relationship
with Wei Kejian.

453
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,300
That night,
he believed his mother's slander

454
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,530
and accused me of not being
respectful enough to elders.

455
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,420
I'll beat you to death!

456
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,400
You worthless woman!
I won't let you escape!

457
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,750
I'll kill you!

458
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,830
You worthless woman! Go to hell!

459
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,640
Why are you

460
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,170
making Mother angry again?

461
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,480
-Let go! Let go!
-I’ll kill you!

462
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,000
Let go!

463
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,240
What woman in this world

464
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,440
can't bear children?

465
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,790
I would have had grandchildren by now.

466
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,380
I never liked her
since the very beginning.

467
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,640
I’ll kill you!
Mother!

468
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
Mother, please stop beating!

469
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
You'll kill her if you continue!

470
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,140
Mother!

471
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,750
Stop it! Stop it!

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
-Mother!
-Let go!

473
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,270
Mother!

474
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,560
I barely managed to escape

475
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,170
and save my life.

476
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
The Wei and Yang families
were in a legal dispute.

477
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,200
After much consideration,

478
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,460
I did decide to come forward as a witness.

479
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,070
Just as I returned to my maiden home
to discuss the matter,

480
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,440
he...

481
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,920
He feared I'd expose the false accusation,

482
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
so he pretended to consult the clan.

483
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,030
In the evening, he drugged me to faint

484
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,070
and tried to drown me
in the backyard's well.

485
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,370
When I awoke during the attempt,

486
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,570
he swung a blade at me.

487
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,830
Had my mother not discovered us

488
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,230
and fought to restrain him,

489
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,630
I would have been killed.

490
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,660
Then, fearing the truth would come out,

491
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,920
he deceived my mother,

492
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,030
claming he was sending me

493
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,630
to a clan uncle's for safety,

494
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,070
but in fact, he sold me far away,

495
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,200
to a place I could never return to--Linji.

496
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,640
I took advantage when the guards
on the ship weren't watching,

497
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,680
jumped into the water,

498
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,960
and survived by the skin of my teeth.

499
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,850
Now you tell me,
why I dare not show my face?

500
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,450
Tell me!

501
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,930
Listen to this!

502
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,260
What kind of brother would do such things!

503
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,240
How can there exist

504
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,700
such a
savage and vile creature in the world?

505
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,150
Yang Jisheng,

506
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,400
do you plead guilty?

507
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,880
My Lord.

508
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,470
Since my sister Yun's tragic death,

509
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,650
and with the true killer still at large,

510
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,110
my mother wept day after day.

511
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,160
Her profound grief turned to illness,

512
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,400
and she passed away five years ago.

513
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,000
This woman implicates innocent people,

514
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,420
speaks nothing but lies,

515
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,900
even fabricates stories
about my deceased mother.

516
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,820
How shameless she is!

517
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,720
Fine.

518
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,830
You keep claiming

519
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,160
that you are Madam Yang.

520
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,340
Where are your witnesses?

521
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,810
The entire Wei family is implicated
and can't testify.

522
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,870
What about others?

523
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,720
Among Linji's million residents,

524
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,550
can you find even one witness?

525
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,900
No matter how eloquent you're,

526
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,960
a lie can never become the truth.

527
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,520
You...

528
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,830
What you said sounds reasonable.

529
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,270
You claim to be Madam Yang,

530
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,310
but who can vouch for you?

531
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,160
Without witnesses,

532
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,040
you're making false accusations.

533
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,960
Lord Xu wants witness?

534
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,270
Why'd there be any cause for concern?

535
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,130
The doctor who treated Madam Yang

536
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,750
and the Rong family that took her in

537
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,500
are both still waiting their turn
before the court.

538
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,960
Guards!

539
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,560
Take Yang Jisheng into custody

540
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,070
for further questioning tomorrow.

541
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,110
Yes! Take him away.

542
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,370
I'm innocent, My Lord!

543
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,210
My Lord!

544
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm innocent, My Lord!

545
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm innocent!

546
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,880
So that's really happened?

547
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,310
Isn't it?

548
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,200
Let's come back tomorrow
and see how it ends.

549
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,530
-My Lord!
-Lord Lu's handling of this matter

550
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,060
has been indeed exemplary.

551
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Court adjourned.

552
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,130
Impressive!

553
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
It has to be Lord Lu

554
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,040
to bring justice for Madam Yang.

555
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,410
Well judged!

556
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Well judged, Lord Lu!

557
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,870
I can hear you.

558
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,790
I'm impressed
you dared to call the siblings

559
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,750
to testify against each other in court.

560
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,350
You provoked Madam Yang

561
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,880
into revealing the truth about that year.

562
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,720
Had it been me,

563
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,920
uncertain whether the siblings

564
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,550
had conspired from the start,

565
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,480
I'd have been far too cautious
to take on such a great risk.

566
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,880
Guard!

567
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,680
Yes? My Lord?

568
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,700
Post a notice immediately

569
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,590
to search for witnesses
throughout the city.

570
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,590
I think the Yang family in Linji

571
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,310
can't completely control everything.

572
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,620
With a generous reward,

573
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,400
brave people will surely
come forward as witnesses.

574
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,750
Yes!

575
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,310
Why are you worried?

576
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,540
Didn't Madam Yang already say?

577
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,640
She miscarried
and escaped from the Wei family,

578
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
and was saved by Doctor Luo Ping,

579
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,270
who specializes in gynecology

580
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,110
and practices regularly in the area
around Chunning and Yangzhong.

581
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,210
As long as
you send someone to find him tonight,

582
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,070
he will show up in court tomorrow.

583
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,170
Just in case.

584
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,350
What you concern makes sense.

585
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,510
We must consider
the possibility of sabotage.

586
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,120
However,

587
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,790
tomorrow Miss Rong

588
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,450
will appear in court herself.

589
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,520
Have you thought it through?

590
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,070
I dare not think about it.

591
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,200
Madam Yang escaped from
a desperate situation,

592
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,930
and the Rong family took her in.

593
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,590
This is understandable,
both emotionally and morally.

594
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,850
But in terms of the law,

595
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,110
Wei Kejian is in prison
awaiting execution,

596
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,590
and many Wei clan members
have been exiled due to lawsuits,

597
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,050
suffering for many years.

598
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,730
Now that I've taken this case,

599
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,890
we must handle this impartially

600
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,150
without giving in to personal feelings.

601
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,070
I wonder how she'll

602
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,110
face the court tomorrow.

603
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,830
Mother.

604
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,830
I'm not crying.

605
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,020
Don't tell anyone.

606
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Grandmother said

607
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,480
Miss Rong of the Rong family
is not allowed to cry.

608
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,170
It's all right. You can cry in private.

609
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,240
No one will see you.

610
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,370
Miss Rong.

611
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,260
Are you really
not going to see him one more time?

612
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,490
He is the Imperial Inspector,

613
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,890
and it's his duty to review old cases.

614
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm a daughter of the Rong family,

615
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,440
naturally being obligated
to defend my family's honor.

616
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,840
He talks to me about laws,

617
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,590
but I don't want to listen.

618
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,070
I appealed to
his sense of personal obligation,

619
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,730
he'd not yield an inch either.

620
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,110
We'd better not to meet at all.

621
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,490
Miss Rong.

622
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,970
You've cut off all the leaves.

623
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,550
It is indeed difficult

624
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,430
to confront one's beloved in open court.

625
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,110
Miss Rong, you don't have to

626
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,910
put on a brave face in front of me.

627
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,570
I won't laugh at you.

628
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,440
But I am Rong Shanbao.

629
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,420
Rong Shanbao doesn't lose

630
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,740
and can't lose.

631
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,060
My Lord.

632
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,190
There's not a single person.

633
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,720
It's quite strange.

634
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,110
Local customs are quite open.

635
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,590
Even ladies from
the most secluded households

636
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,200
venture out during the Lantern Festival
and the New Year.

637
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,000
This is especially true for Madam Yang,

638
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,110
who grew up
and was married right in Linji.

639
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,880
We've asked at shops
selling rouge and bracelets,

640
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,170
and the old clothing stores,

641
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,210
all households,

642
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,860
yet not a single person knows her.

643
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,400
Unless she never left her home

644
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,160
and never socialized with others,

645
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,790
but this Wei family

646
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,050
is in the tea business.

647
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,070
How could the hostess

648
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,400
live in such isolation?

649
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,980
Something's not right.

650
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,920
There's always someone more powerful.

651
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Keep your voice down.
Don't draw trouble to yourself.

652
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,550
What mighty stature
for a mere Linji Prefect,

653
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,610
to hold the entire city in such thrall

654
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,850
that not a whisper of testimony

655
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,030
can be heard.

656
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
A single hand blots out the heavens!

657
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,790
Do they have any respect for the law?

658
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,910
My Lord, that Doctor Luo...

659
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,720
Doctor Luo, he...

660
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,920
What happened to him?

661
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,590
Constables went to his home
to take him in,

662
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,160
but it turned out
he went up the mountain yesterday

663
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,790
to pick herbs, fell into a ravine,

664
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,450
and died...

665
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,590
He died.

666
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,830
Let's return
to the Government Office first.

667
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,590
I killed her. I killed her.

668
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,920
I killed her.

669
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,130
Look at this.

670
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,440
I killed her.

671
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,630
Well done.

672
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,960
I killed her.

673
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,680
I killed her.

674
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,590
[Linji Prefectural Office]

675
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,070
Mighty.

676
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,680
Powerful.

677
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,130
Bring Rong Shanbao for questioning.

678
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,440
So it really is
Miss Rong of the Rong family?

679
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,760
Impressive.

680
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,350
Even the Rong family was summoned.

681
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,590
What a rare occasion.

682
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,200
What connection does
this case have with the Rong family

683
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,850
that even Miss Rong has been called in?

684
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,510
Indeed. Why is Miss Rong here?

685
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,070
Make way.

686
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,730
Step aside.

687
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,370
Let her through.

688
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,320
Greetings to both lords.

689
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,720
Silence!

690
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,030
Mighty.

691
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,440
Powerful.

692
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,680
Miss Rong,

693
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,300
take a closer look.

694
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,620
Do you recognize this lady

695
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,450
in the court?

696
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,620
I haven't noticed her before.

697
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,640
I personally led people

698
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,440
to arrest her from Rong Mansion.

699
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,450
You claim you've never seen her?

700
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,710
Lord Lu.

701
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,820
The Rong family has 300 servants

702
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,160
and 30,000 tea workers.

703
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,940
If I need to know everyone,

704
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,350
even if I have ten heads,

705
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,550
that won't be enough.

706
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,740
She's just an ordinary servant,

707
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,640
yet why did Lady Yunwan
of the Rong family

708
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,770
refuse to let her go?

709
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,830
Miss Rong, you carefully attend to

710
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,360
Lady Yunwan's daily needs.

711
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,550
How could you not recognize

712
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,750
someone close to her?

713
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,130
I remember now.

714
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,790
Since childhood, Yunwan

715
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,550
was served by the maid Madam Liang,

716
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,210
to whom she was very attached.

717
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,790
Three months ago,

718
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,480
Madam Liang
returned to Qiongzhou to retire.

719
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,210
Yunwan became ill with longing

720
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,950
and moved out to recuperate.

721
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,910
Later when I visited her,

722
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,070
I discovered that Yunwan

723
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,600
had taken in a female beggar

724
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,920
because she resembled Madam Liang.

725
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
It was just transference of affection.

726
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,160
My sister had a childish nature

727
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,760
that changed from day to day.

728
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,880
Since she wanted to keep a servant,

729
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,340
I didn't inquire further.

730
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,500
Today when My Lord asked about it,

731
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,210
I suddenly remembered.

732
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,990
But My Lord seems so certain.

733
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Could it be

734
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
that you've met

735
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,520
the real Madam Liang before?

736
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,600
Not a word of truth. Complete lies!

737
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,200
How would he dare admit
in front of everyone

738
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,310
that he infiltrated
the Rong family with ill intent?

739
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,200
Or should I say he's shameless enough

740
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,170
to sacrifice himself
for a fraudulent marriage?

741
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:47,610
You!

742
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,270
How could she be easily cornered?

743
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,330
Miss Rong is indeed calm and composed

744
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
and doesn't back down at all.

745
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,690
Madam Yang.

746
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,200
I know
you don't want to betray your benefactor

747
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,070
by testifying against them in court.

748
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,920
But since
you've already appeared as a witness,

749
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
if you back out now,

750
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,750
it will be a serious crime
of false accusation.

751
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,840
Making false accusations
will result in punishment.

752
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,630
The Rong family claims you were a beggar

753
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,960
taken in by Lady Yunwan.

754
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,960
A servant
who has only been there for three months

755
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,230
would hardly know
the details of the Rong Mansion.

756
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,960
If you truly are Madam Yang's daughter,

757
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,030
who is literate and skilled in painting,

758
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,570
and have lived with
the Rong family for ten years,

759
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,030
then rendering the plants and gardens

760
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,550
of Rong Mansion should be easy for you.

761
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,400
I order you to draw here in court,

762
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,630
so we can verify the details to check

763
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,230
whether your account is true

764
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,760
or Miss Rong's is correct.

765
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,730
The truth will become self-evident.

766
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,960
Madam Yang, do you dare or not?

767
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,230
I'll do as you command, My Lord.

768
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,000
Wait.

769
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,510
Lord Lu,

770
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,070
there remains the single

771
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,630
most crucial witness

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,400
you have yet to question.

773
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,900
Guards, bring in the prisoner Wei Kejian.

774
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,000
Look!

775
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,590
What have they done to him?

776
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,190
This is...

777
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,320
Just look.

778
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,190
He's unrecognizable now.

779
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,650
Totally unrecognizable.

780
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,680
Didn't Wei Kejian go mad?

781
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,570
How can he appear in court?

782
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,710
Young Master? Young Master?

783
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,190
Though that man is still breathing,

784
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,630
he's been tortured
until there's barely any life left in him,

785
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,630
hardly looking like a living person.

786
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,090
What happened to this man?

787
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,400
Lord Xu.

788
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,210
This prisoner is already delirious.

789
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,180
You summoned Wei Kejian to court.

790
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,000
Could it be that you want him

791
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,330
to identify Madam Yang?

792
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,740
Look at his condition.

793
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,490
Can he even recognize
who's in front of him?

794
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,670
Wei Kejian!

795
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,400
Did you kill Madam Yang?

796
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,490
I killed her.

797
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,280
I killed her.

798
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,870
It was me.

799
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,110
I used a wooden pick

800
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,840
to strike her dead.

801
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,440
I wanted her dead!
I wanted her dead! I wanted her dead!

802
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,350
Kill! Kill! Kill!

803
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
The prisoner has confessed.

804
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,440
He killed Madam Yang.

805
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,760
That woman is an impostor!

806
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,880
He spoke so clearly.

807
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
He must be the killer without doubt.

808
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,170
He was just pretending to be mad.

809
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,500
Yes, he's pretending to be mad and stupid.

810
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,630
Wei Kejian committed this heinous murder.

811
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,560
Remorse and fear drove him insane.

812
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,510
Now he reveals the truth in court.

813
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,710
This is heaven's justice.

814
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,000
Good and evil
will always be rewarded accordingly.

815
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,870
We can't let Madam Yang die in vain,

816
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,870
nor allow others to impersonate her

817
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,250
with malicious intent.

818
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,840
Who helped you carry and bury the body?

819
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,970
Tell us!

820
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,760
Wei Laowu.

821
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,930
Wei Ming.

822
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,160
Wei Ming.

823
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,590
Wei Laowu.

824
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,960
Wei Ming.

825
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,190
Whether he is truly insane

826
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,320
or just pretending,

827
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,360
I will have someone examine him.

828
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,510
Guards! Take Wei Kejian away.

829
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,070
Move.

830
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,040
My Lord, this woman took down the notice

831
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,510
and came to identify Madam Yang.

832
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,040
I, Zhang, pay my respects to both lords.

833
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,600
My Lord, I know this woman.

834
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,480
Her surname is Wang,
given name is Dongling.

835
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,820
She was from the Jia family in Luzhou,

836
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,500
a concubine of Old Master Jia.

837
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,550
Because the legal wife
couldn't tolerate her,

838
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,360
she was sold several times

839
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,480
until she came to me.

840
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Over these years,

841
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,400
she grew old
and was not as pretty as she used to be,

842
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,710
so she couldn't treat clients anymore.

843
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,110
So I was planning

844
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,710
to send her to

845
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,110
a nunnery to settle down.

846
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,790
But who would have thought

847
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,390
she would escape on the way

848
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,490
and disappear without a trace?

849
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,720
If you don't believe me, My Lords,

850
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,250
you can remove her clothes.

851
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,590
On her left arm

852
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,550
is a scar from a candleholder

853
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,490
that I myself branded onto her.

854
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
My Lord, here is the witness.

855
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,760
You despicable beast!

856
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,510
That's a scar from some mischief

857
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,070
-when I was a kid.
-You crazy woman!

858
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,000
How dare you cause a scene in court!

859
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,600
Seize her!

860
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,890
She's hitting people!

861
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,440
Pull them apart!

862
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,480
-Stop her.
-No one is more shameless

863
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,360
than you!

864
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,550
Tell me who I am.

865
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,590
Tell me! Who am I?

866
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,180
Tell me!

867
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,860
Speak up.

868
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,920
I am Yang Yun

869
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,360
who was ruined by you.

870
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,590
You all made my life worse than death.

871
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,280
Tell me who I am.

872
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Court adjourned.

873
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,550
Court adjourned.

874
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,110
Miss Rong.

875
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,800
Lady Yunyin refuses to eat or drink

876
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,960
in the tea plantation.

877
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
She says if you don't take her back,

878
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,110
she would rather starve herself to death.

879
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,920
Let her be.

880
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,000
Wait.

881
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,760
Bring her to me at 4 p.m.

882
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,350
You may go now.

883
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,600
So she knows to take me back?

884
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,290
Why not just
let me die in the tea plantation?

885
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:50,870
It would have been perfect for her

886
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,550
to use my corpse
as fertilizer for her beloved tea trees.

887
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,110
No matter how many mistakes I've made,

888
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,310
I'm still her sister.

889
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,230
If Mother knew how cruelly she treats me,

890
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,760
Mother'd die
without closing her eyes in peace.

891
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,220
Lady Yunyin must be tired.

892
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,630
Please rest well for a day.

893
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,230
Tomorrow,
after paying respects at Chongxi Hall,

894
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,360
the carriage will be waiting outside
at 7 in the morning.

895
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,280
The weather is getting cooler.

896
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,640
Nights in the mountains are cold.

897
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,510
Miss Rong has instructed

898
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,800
to prepare more warm clothes for you.

899
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,660
I'll send them all together then.

900
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,710
What?

901
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,640
She still wants to send me away?

902
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,550
Where is she? I'll go see her myself.

903
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,770
Tell me quickly!

904
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,320
Miss Rong is in the Flower Hall.

905
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,300
She has important matters
to discuss with Mr. Yang.

906
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,760
Lady Yunyin!

907
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,880
Lady Yunyin!

908
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,910
Don't be rash, Lady Yunyin!

909
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,230
Who gave your Yang family permission
to make decisions on your own?

910
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,430
What's the story with that woman Zhang?

911
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,760
Mr. Yang.

912
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,960
Yang Yun is your own aunt.

913
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,190
How can you resort to
such underhanded tricks?

914
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,030
Don't you fear
it will curse you with misfortune?

915
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,070
This is a life-or-death crisis
for the Yang family.

916
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,320
If we can get through this,

917
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,710
I will personally go to apologize,

918
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,320
and accept whatever punishment
my aunt gives me.

919
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,510
Even if my knees
are worn raw from kneeling,

920
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,040
I won't even furrow my brow.

921
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,190
For the rest of my life,

922
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,070
I, Yang Yitang,
will serve my aunt until her final days,

923
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,330
as if I were her own son.

924
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,750
But if we don't survive this,

925
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,400
and if the Yang family
is convicted of false accusations,

926
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,960
we'll face execution,
exile, death, and ruin.

927
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,820
How would we support my aunt then?

928
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,030
These stakes and consequences

929
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,320
aren't clear to outsiders.

930
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,600
Miss Rong is a person
of great undertakings

931
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,240
and should be magnanimous.

932
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,280
What lofty rhetoric!

933
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,230
Your cheek is thicker
than the city walls.

934
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,150
Truly, you've even outshone

935
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,810
your families in brazenness.

936
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,600
Don't gloat too soon.

937
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,200
Don't forget,

938
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,360
my younger sister Yunwan

939
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,810
has lived with Madam Yang for many years.

940
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,510
They're as close as mother and daughter.

941
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,240
If she were to testify in court,

942
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,200
she could overturn everyone's testimony.

943
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,590
That's exactly
what I'm asking for your help, Miss Rong.

944
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,150
Before the lawsuit is settled,

945
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,230
please properly arrange for Lady Yunwan,

946
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,880
and don't let her rashly appear

947
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,680
to ruin
the important matters of our two families.

948
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,920
Miss Rong.

949
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,330
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

950
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,780
I'm also forced into this corner.

951
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,480
I implore you,

952
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,530
please spare
the lives of my entire Yang family.

953
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,000
Miss Rong.

954
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,280
Fine. For the sake of
the Rong family's reputation,

955
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,590
I'll have to go against
my conscience this once.

956
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,800
Tonight I will send Yunwan

957
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,920
to stay at the newly opened
tea plantation.

958
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,590
Before the lawsuit is settled,

959
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,390
I won't let her appear in public.

960
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,500
Miss, it's Lady Yunyin!

961
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,750
Fourth Sister, you've returned.

962
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,400
Eldest Sister is discussing matters
in the Flower Hall.

963
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,130
Did you see her, Fourth Sister?

964
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,440
Lady Yunyin,

965
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,960
why did you come here?

966
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,260
You had me searching everywhere for you.

967
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,630
All right, I'm leaving now.

968
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,840
But you must let me go back
to pack my autumn clothes

969
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,640
and say goodbye to grandmother.

970
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,240
See you, Fourth Sister.

971
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,530
Lady Yunshu.

[Landscape and Tea in Zhejiang]

973
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,970
Who would have thought

974
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,510
that tea trees could thrive alongside

975
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,870
wild chrysanthemums
and grow so vigorously?

976
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,660
I recall
Miss Rong mentioned that next year,

977
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,000
varieties of chrysanthemum
are to be carefully chosen

978
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,310
for both petals and roots

979
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,840
that can be used in medicine.

980
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,700
The Rong Family ancestors
moved to Jiangnan

981
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,230

00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,480
for over 100 years.

983
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,920
The Tea King Rong Family

984
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,400
became renowned throughout the land

985
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,180
mainly because of

986
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,720
favorable timing,
geography, and human factors.

987
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,360
Tea trees prefer moisture,

988
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,290
and their growing environment

989
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,620
requires sufficient water

990
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,090
with ideal temperatures
between 10 and 30 degrees Celsius.

991
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,380

Loamy soil

997
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,480
or sandy loam is preferred.

998
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,250
These soil types benefit

999
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,800
the growth and development
of tea tree root systems.
