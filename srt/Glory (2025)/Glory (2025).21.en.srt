00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,200
Thank you for your help, Lady Yunshu,

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,530
for giving me this idea.

5
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,710
Brand Madam Yang as a prostitute

6
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,640
makes her identity impossible to verify.

7
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,710
Even her testimony

8
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,759
was no longer believed by anyone in court.

9
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,160
Mr. Yang, you flatter me.

10
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,950
I merely asked you

11
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,040
to find her a cover.

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,680
Never did I expect you

13
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,400
to consign her

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,930
to such a shameful station.

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,760
Such a wicked scheme

16
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,000
requires a vicious mind.

17
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,190
For the safety of our Yang family,

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,630
we have no choice
but to sacrifice her alone.

19
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,800
They all say Miss Rong is peerless in wit,

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
but in my view, it's merely a false rumor.

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
Those who keep a low profile

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,260
are the truly clever ones.

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
I can never thank you enough.

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,670
Please accept this pearl.

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,310
Once the case is settled,

26
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,440
I shall reward you handsomely.

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,030
A luminous pearl?

28
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,000
Giving a luminous pearl to a blind person?

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
How ridiculous.

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,120
Keep it.

31
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,520
My Lady.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,030
Why did you help this villain?

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,360
Do you know what people outside

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
have been saying?

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,650
They say that

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Wei Kejian has already confessed in court,

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,750
so that woman claiming to be Madam Yang

38
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,880
must be an impostor.

39
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,590
They also say she was
bribed by the Wei family

40
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,120
just to frame the Yang family.

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,430
With the case in such chaos,

42
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,630
how can it be settled?

43
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,710
You shouldn't have

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,970
traded Qing Yun for me.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
If we had caught Xu Song

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
with evidence of plotting
against the imperial envoy,

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,920
he wouldn't be meddling.

48
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,750
So this is the home of Wei Laowu?

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,150
He's been dead for years,

50
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,329
so there's no one left to testify.

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,190
Our ancestral medical skills
cure every illness.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,520
Better than Hua Tuo reborn,

53
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,750
and greater than Bian Que revived.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,840
Even the most stubborn disease
vanishes at a single touch.

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,630
Master.

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,079
My grandmother is blind.

57
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Can you treat her?

58
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,270
We're starving to death.

59
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,560
How could we afford medicine?

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,520
Just leave.

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,150
Even a miracle elixir

62
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,150
cannot cure poverty or starvation.

63
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,960
Old Madam, your face is pale

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
and your lips are purple.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,670
This is caused by
a deficiency of qi and blood,

66
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,930
and a lack of heart yin.

67
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,810
Let me examine you.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
To be honest with you, Old Madam,

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,600
my master is a man of virtue

70
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,500
and charity.

71
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,310
For poor families, he charges
only for the medicine

72
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,720
and never for his consultation.

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,780
Let him take a look.

74
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,159
Do you often suffer
from persistent coughing

75
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,420
and sleepless nights?

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,159
Do you also experience chest tightness,
shortness of breath,

77
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,040
and chest pain?

78
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,120
This illness isn't recent.

79
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,970
You must have experienced some heartbreak.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
To cure an illness,
the remedy must fit the cause.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Your sickness is of the heart.

82
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,950
If there's anything weighing on you,

83
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,920
you can tell us.

84
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,320
Perhaps we can help ease your mind.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,270
You truly have insight, Master.

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,680
In all my many years,

87
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,720
I had only one son.

88
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,560
And now he's gone,

89
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,530
how could I not be heartbroken?

90
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm sorry for your loss, Old Madam.

91
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,120
A deficiency of heart yin

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
is caused not only by excessive sorrow,

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,420
but also by living in a damp place.

94
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,360
Please allow me to take a look inside.

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,870
Even if you can't afford medicine,

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,980
a few acupuncture treatments

97
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,950
may help ease the pain

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,750
in your heart.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,060
Our home is bare and empty,

100
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,120
with only a roof over our heads.

101
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,920
Even thieves would avoid this place.

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,470
I'm grateful that you do not disdain it.

103
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,120
Please come in and sit.

104
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

105
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,250
The officials came to arrest him,

106
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,310
yet they didn't say
what crime he'd committed,

107
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,840
nor offer any explanation.

108
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,800
Back then, we went to the Wei family

109
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,300
to borrow grain because we were poor.

110
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,280
When we heard that
the bride had gone missing,

111
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,360
my kindhearted son

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,310
went to help find her.

113
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,070
After three days and nights,

114
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,320
he brought back
no more than three dou of rice

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,790
and fifty wen

116
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,070
as a token of thanks from the Wei family.

117
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,800
Please don't grieve too much.

118
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,360
I'll come to see you again.

119
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,680
Thank you.

120
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Wait.

121
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,950
What?

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,310
This is my grandmother's cane.

123
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,750
How did it end up here?

124
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,890
My cane is right here.

125
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,790
Where did you get that firewood?

126
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,170
These days,

127
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,190
I've been grinding tofu for Mrs. Gao,

128
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,750
with no time to gather firewood.

129
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,480
I got this from the pile

130
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,120
of decayed wood at the old house.

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,980
Who used to live in that old house?

132
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,240
My father.

133
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,710
Wei Ming?

134
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,000
[Linji Prefectural Office]

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,130
Bring in Wei Kejian.

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,780
Wei Kejian.

137
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,510
You admitted killing Madam Yang yourself.

138
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,720
And your relatives Wei Ming and Wei Laowu

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,430
helped you carry and bury the body.

140
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,690
So where was it buried?

141
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,070
What can that fool possibly say?

142
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,120
At this rate,

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,510
how can the case ever be resolved?

144
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,310
Indeed.

145
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,070
He is sometimes clear-headed,

146
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,200
sometimes muddled.

147
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,510
And it just so happens that

148
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,070
today is one of his muddled days.

149
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,400
Let me explain instead.

150
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,560
The real Madam Yang's body

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,830
was long ago unearthed,

152
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,690
at the foot of Qingfeng Mountain.

153
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,510
The Wei family's tea plantation
is also on Qingfeng Mountain,

154
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,640
so it makes perfect sense that Wei Kejian

155
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,630
would choose this place to bury the body.

156
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,240
Is that so?

157
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,150
The Wei family does not
live deep in the mountains.

158
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,080
He killed and buried the body
in the middle of the night.

159
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Are all the nearby households

160
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,150
clay dolls,

161
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,010
deaf and blind,

162
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
that none of them

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,150
noticed?

164
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,090
Do you think that's possible, Lord Xu?

165
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,550
Have you never
examined the case files, Lord Lu?

166
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,770
It was a dark and rainy night.

167
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,360
The neighbors had no idea
of his crime.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,150
Moreover, Wei Laowu and Wei Ming

169
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,720
used the pretext of transporting tea bags

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,650
to cover for him.

171
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,390
Who would suspect anything?

172
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,960
Bring in Wei Laowu's mother, Madam Chang,

173
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,620
and his daughter Wei Miao'er.

174
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,880
Who are these people?

175
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,790
Are there any other witnesses?

176
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,720
Who are they?

177
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,240
She's blind.

178
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,300
Why bring her here?

179
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,980
A blind old woman

180
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,770
and a young girl?

181
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,960
Lord Xu, these are Wei Laowu's

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
mother and daughter.

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
Do you notice anything unusual about them?

184
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,790
A blind woman and a young girl.

185
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,810
What's unusual about that?

186
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,480
Madam Chang.

187
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,120
During my undercover investigation,

188
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,600
I found Wei Laowu's

189
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,060
walking cane at your home.

190
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,990
Do you bring it here?

191
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,720
Yes, I do.

192
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,530
Miao, present it.

193
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,380
My Lord.

194
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,600
No need.

195
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,000
Lord Lu, so you're saying

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,720
Wei Laowu was a cripple.

197
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,840
Since he could come to borrow grain,

198
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,970
that proves he had no trouble walking.

199
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,670
But who ever said a cripple

200
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,890
couldn't dig the ground and bury a body?

201
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,240
Lord Xu, please look closely

202
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,450
at this old woman and the young girl.

203
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,750
They both have an internal eye disorder

204
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,130
that clouds their vision.

205
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,150
Although they have eyeballs,
they can hardly perceive anything,

206
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,320
only light and dark.

207
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
The girl here is no more
than 13 years old.

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,530
She can see in bright light,

209
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,510
but in dim light her sight fails.

210
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,600
In Arcane Essentials
from the Imeperial Library,

211
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,860
this disease is called

212
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,440
cerebral night blindness.

213
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,510
Three generations of this family
suffer from this ailment.

214
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,240
Wei Laowu

215
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,770
wasn't severely affected.

216
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,010
In daily life, he could
see unclearly

217
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,470
but still managed to work.

218
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,270
So he never revealed it to others,

219
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,200
fearing it might disrupt his livelihood.

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,120
But as you, Lord Xu, said,

221
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,410
it was dark, and it rained heavily.

222
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,330
Wei Laowu could barely see

223
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
and had to rely on his walking stick.

224
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,910
How could he possibly carry a corpse

225
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,790
and bury it?

226
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,080
The Wei family had
servants and neighbors nearby.

227
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,830
Why would Wei Kejian go so far

228
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,110
to involve outsiders?

229
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,510
Wei Laowu had

230
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,750
an elderly mother
and a young child to care for.

231
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,750
For a mere sack of grain

232
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,550
and fifty wen,

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,960
how could he risk his life

234
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,550
to carry and bury a body for someone else?

235
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,320
Clearly, it's all nonsense.

236
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,990
Anyone who dares to speak
such madness in this court again

237
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,520
will be beaten with the rod.

238
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,390
Indeed.

239
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,270
That fool

240
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,400
must have been instigated by someone.

241
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,240
This old woman and
the young girl are truly pitiful.

242
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
Take them away.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,060
Bring in Yang Jisheng and Madam Yang.

244
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,510
Is there really something wrong?

245
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,030
Is this for real?

246
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,300
Bring the brushes and ink.

247
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,270
Write.

248
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,750
On your knees.

249
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,400
Madam Yang, sit.

250
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,310
I won't ask about anything else.

251
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,760
I only have one question.

252
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,320
I've heard that Master Yang

253
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
was often ill in life.

254
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,550
Which pharmacy supplied his medicine,

255
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,320
and what prescriptions were used?

256
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,450
Write them all down.

257
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
Young Master.

258
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,350
What's going on in the court?

259
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,670
What on earth

260
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,790
is Lu Jiang up to?

261
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,720
My Lord, you must

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,380
have heard some false rumors.

263
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,300
Father was always in good health.

264
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,670
Only with age did he experience

265
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,040
some aches in his back and legs,

266
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,390
feel occasional heat, and irritability.

267
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,600
The medicine he took was Kanli Pills,

268
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,930
prepared by Yixin Hall.

269
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,910
It was the Kanli Pills you sent.

270
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
Father took them for less than a month

271
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
and developed high fever

272
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,030
and swelling pain in his legs.

273
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,550
Only then did we realize that Huangbo
and Zhimu, while boosting vitality,

274
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,200
could deplete the liver and kidneys.

275
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
He was thus given Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang

276
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
in the morning,

277
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,050
and Six-Flavor Rehmannia pills at night.

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,800
Yang Jisheng.

279
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,670
This is the medical record
for your father,

280
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,480
personally written by
the renowned physician

281
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,810
Gao Shuwei of Anle Hall.

282
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,870
The Wei family is eager
to overturn the case,

283
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,080
how do you know
they wouldn't bribe a physician

284
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,160
to give false testimony?

285
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,910
How would the Wei family know that

286
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,720
Father grew strong and vigorous

287
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,390
after taking the medicine

288
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,150
of Physician Gao,

289
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,960
and fathered an illegitimate brother

290
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,790
for you?

291
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,680
How would the Wei family know that,

292
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,480
fearing your half-brother
would reduce the inheritance,

293
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,340
you secretly sent him to a temple?

294
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,190
And how would they know that

295
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,390
your father died
with his eyes open in anger,

296
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,640
that he tore
the jade pendant from your waist,

297
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,390
and that in seizing the pendant,

298
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,520
you broke the fingers of the deceased?

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,330
Such unfilial conduct!

300
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,750
He is less than a beast,

301
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,510
doing such a thing

302
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
to his own father!

303
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,160
How cruel!

304
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,320
My Lord.

305
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440
Before the Wei family incident,

306
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,600
I went to the temple every year

307
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,870
to offer winter clothes and cakes.

308
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,150
Just go to Jingguang Temple

309
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,480
outside Linji and investigate.

310
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,610
See if he can deny it!

311
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,040
Yang Jisheng!

312
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,880
She spoke of
the Yang family's private affairs

313
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,220
that no outsider could possibly know.

314
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,550
Do you still dare say
she isn't Madam Yang?

315
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,550
Lord Lu.

316
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,840
No wall is completely sealed,

317
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,520
and no woman can keep secrets forever.

318
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,070
Madam Yang married into the Wei family,

319
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,360
and might have revealed secrets
during intimate moments with her husband.

320
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,550
Who can say for sure?

321
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,970
Miss Rong personally
identified her before.

322
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,360
Could she be lying as well?

323
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,630
Miss Rong, forgive me
for speaking out of turn.

324
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,720
Before we left,

325
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,180
Lady Rong repeatedly said

326
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,790
that no matter how serious the matter is,

327
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,600
one must not act beyond the Rong family.

328
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,550
As for what to do,

329
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,120
you must have your own judgment.

330
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,130
Don't follow me.

331
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,620
Bring in Rong Shanbao.

332
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,080
Why is Miss Rong here again?

333
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,160
Rong Shanbao.

334
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,630
Today, I ask you in all seriousness.

335
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,550
Do you truly not recognize

336
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,030
the identity of this woman?

337
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,160
I've already stated

338
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,040
everything in court yesterday.

339
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,050
There's no need to ask me again.

340
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,190
You call her your foster mother,

341
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,240
and that binds you
by mother-daughter ties.

342
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,480
How can you bear to have her

343
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,880
labeled as a prostitute?

344
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,500
If you mean to take the Wei family's side,

345
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,180
I have nothing more to say.

346
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,600
Good.

347
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,720
Since you don't recognize her,

348
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,150
someone from the Rong family will testify.

349
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,870
Bring in Rong Yunyin and Rong Yunwan.

350
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,440
My Lord.

351
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,810
Yunwan is naturally foolish.

352
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
How could she possibly testify in court?

353
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,490
Even a madman can testify in court.

354
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,170
Lady Yunwan has the innocence of a child,

355
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,270
incapable of fabricating lies.

356
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,240
Isn't she the most

357
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,840
honest witness in the world?

358
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,240
Bring her in.

359
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,760
This is Lady Yunwan of the Rong family.

360
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
How is she a simpleton?

361
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,180
She is a simpleton.

362
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,510
Ms. Liang.

363
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:10,950
Wanwan.

364
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,960
Lord Lu.

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,170
She's clearly a simpleton.

366
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,920
What testimony could she possibly give?

367
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,270
My Lord, please allow me to explain.

368
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,790
After Madam Yang came to our family,

369
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,480
she became Yunwan's maid,

370
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,250
raised her personally,

371
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,810
and never left her side

372
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,260
for more than a decade.

373
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,240
Everyone in our Rong family

374
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,590
calls her Ms. Liang.

375
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,750
My Lord.

376
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,330
Rong Yunyin

377
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,000
made a grave mistake
while tending the plantation

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,750
and was punished by working
on the tea mountains.

379
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,510
She harbors resentment
toward the Rong family,

380
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,270
so her testimony is not credible.

381
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,480
Yunwan's is mentally confused.

382
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,240
She cannot even recognize people
during her episodes.

383
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,000
How could she possibly distinguish

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,520
between Ms. Liang and the others?

385
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,850
Shanbao, you're lying.

386
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,030
I can recognize them clearly.

387
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,230
I can tell them apart.

388
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,880
See, see!

389
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,230
I was only seven

390
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,960
when Ms. Liang taught me to paint.

391
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,880
She painted me

392
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
and herself too.

393
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,940
Where is Ms. Liang?

394
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,200
Look.

395
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
Shanbao, you're in here too.

396
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,310
Shanbao, you told me

397
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,110
that children should never lie.

398
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,110
You lied to me. You're a liar!

399
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,400
Wanwan.

400
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,680
For ten years,

401
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
every painting has been signed.

402
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,190
Compare the signatures
with Madam Yang's handwriting,

403
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,790
and you'll see that
Rong Shanbao's words are lies.

404
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,030
Ms. Liang is Madam Yang.

405
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,510
That's right.

406
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,890
Bring the paintings
and have them compared here.

407
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,720
Yes.

408
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,190
Madam Yang, stop!

409
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,350
My Lord, My Lord!

410
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,690
I had nowhere to go

411
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,550
and was kindly
taken in by the Rong family.

412
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,590
It was my greed that made me

413
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,880
falsely claim to
be Madam Yang and extort money.

414
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,720
I confess my crime.

415
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,110
I beg you to consider my circumstances

416
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,910
and not implicate the innocent.

417
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,030
My Lords, you've witnessed it clearly.

418
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,400
She confessed herself!

419
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,760
What did I say?

420
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,000
She is not Madam Yang at all!

421
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,970
She is a lowly prostitute,

422
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,720
a fraudulent whore!

423
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,750
Shanbao! Shanbao!

424
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,720
Shanbao!

425
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,900
Lord Lu, you are still young

426
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,660
and eager to solve the case for merit,

427
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,260
which is why you were misled.

428
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,160
I will personally submit a report to
the Ministry of Justice,

429
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,920
to uphold the original verdict.

430
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,200
As for this fake Madam Yang,
who slandered others,

431
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
guards, give her forty strokes first!

432
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
She hasn't falsely accused anyone.

433
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,870
She is Madam Yang.

434
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,370
How does she become Madam Yang now?

435
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,340
Whose word should we believe?

436
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
In this court,

437
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,400
how dare you contradict yourself

438
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,070
with such reckless accusations!

439
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,600
You claim she is Madam Yang.

440
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,390
Are you saying the Rong family admits

441
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,250
to harboring a criminal?

442
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,030
My Lord, she is Madam Yang,

443
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,070
Wei Kejian's wife,

444
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,570
Yang Jisheng's sister,

445
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,750
and the only reliable witness

446
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,350
in the Wei family's old case.

447
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,670
Ten years ago,

448
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,720
she wanted to come forward as a witness.

449
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,920
But being powerless,

450
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,200
she nearly lost her life
in the Yang family.

451
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,730
When her life was in danger,

452
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,000
the Rong Family
sheltered her out of kindness,

453
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,530
preserving her as a witness

454
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,280
until the day should come

455
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
when a worthy official would arrive

456
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,790
to bring justice to light,

457
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,930
and vindicate the Wei family.

458
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,110
Before this, I was
threatened by officials,

459
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,750
and dared not present the evidence.

460
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,480
Lord Lu.

461
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,160
I have Madam Yang's

462
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,200
blood-stained garment from back then.

463
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,750
And the renowned physician
Zhao Shijing can also testify.

464
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,790
The servant hidden in
the Rong family for ten years

465
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,850
is indeed Yang Yun.

466
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,600
This is the absolute truth.

467
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,030
What?

468
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,350
How can it be true at one moment

469
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,410
and false the next?

470
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,210
Is she really Madam Yang or not?

471
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,830
Just now Miss Rong strongly proved

472
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,680
that Madam Yang was an imposter,

473
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,030
all to help me draw the real culprit

474
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,960
into our trap.

475
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,270
Now that Madam Yang Yun is alive,

476
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,350
all has been brought to light.

477
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,360
Yang Jisheng!

478
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
You falsely accuse Wei Kejian

479
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,070
of killing his wife,

480
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,970
and tried to kill the witness.

481
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,860
Yet you show no remorse until now.

482
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,110
To cover up the truth,

483
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,590
you falsely accused
your own sister of prostitution.

484
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,070
Your actions are despicable
and your heart is wicked.

485
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,520
I have nothing more to say to you.

486
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,710
Guards! Give him forty strokes first,

487
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,760
before further questioning.

488
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,200
Yes!

489
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,090
That's exactly what he deserves!

490
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,350
Move!

491
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,230
Get up!

492
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,260
Move!

493
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,160
Beat him!

494
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,680
Serves him right!

495
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,830
Good!

496
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,670
Father! Father!

497
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Step back!

498
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,640
Stop!

499
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,340
Get back!

500
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:19,890
Aunt.

501
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,070
Save him!

502
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,000
Father!

503
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,510
Stop it! Stop it!

504
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,700
Father!

505
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,750
Father!

506
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,510
Aunt!

507
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,070
Save him! Aunt!

508
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,500
Aunt!

509
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,750
Aunt!

510
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,270
Father!

511
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,790
Aunt, please save my father!

512
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,830
Aunt!

513
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,040
No!

514
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,590
Father!

515
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
Father!

516
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,410
My Lord, have mercy!

517
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,410
Father!

518
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,430
Beat him to death!

519
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,750
How dare you, Xu Song!

520
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
Wei Kejian is clearly innocent,

521
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,440
yet you fabricated charges against him.

522
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,790
Yang Jisheng committed
unforgivable crimes,

523
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,400
yet you spared him again and again.

524
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
The Ministry of Justice
rejected the verdict,

525
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
yet you dare to cover it up,

526
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
deliberately obstruct justice,

527
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,960
and treat a capital case
as if it were a game.

528
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,200
According to our criminal law,

529
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,070
any official who deliberately manipulates
another person's punishment

530
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,790
shall be held fully responsible
for the entire offense.

531
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,250
Guards!

532
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,790
Strip him of his official hat and robe,

533
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,030
and have him stand below
to await punishment!

534
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,480
Lu Jianglai, how dare you!

535
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,240
See if I dare or not.

536
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,900
Seize him!

537
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,800
Lord Lu.

538
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,720
Lord Lu.

539
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,860
We serve in the same court.

540
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,350
You...

541
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,590
Seize this corrupt official!

542
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,790
Well judged, Lord Lu!

543
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,070
Justice, my lord.

544
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,440
This is justice for the people!

545
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
Well judged, Lord Lu!

546
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,000
Well judged!

547
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,030
Well judged!

548
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,030
Well judged!

549
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,830
Well judged!

550
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,160
Well done, Lord Lu!

551
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,930
Old Madam, Miss Rong has returned,

552
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,440
and is waiting outside.

553
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,400
Did she win or lose?

554
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,680
Old Madam.

555
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,830
Lady Yunyin intercepted

556
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,090
Lady Yunwan on the way.

557
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,590
Lady Yunwan recognized
Madam Yang in court.

558
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,520
It's not really Miss Rong's fault.

559
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,310
Luckily, everything
was made clear publicly.

560
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,110
Madam Yang herself is entirely innocent,

561
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,290
and our Rong family's taking her in

562
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,790
was an act of kindness and righteousness.

563
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,160
What wrong was there in that?

564
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,240
All sensible people outside

565
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,400
praise you for being

566
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,930
compassionate and protecting the innocent.

567
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,660
What use is such a worthless reputation?

568
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,620
Our Rong family has
long-standing principles.

569
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,380
When dealing with gentlemen,

570
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,920
we can be as close as we wish.

571
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,340
But when it comes to petty people,

572
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,640
we must be doubly cautious.

573
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,550
The first rule is to keep harmony
at home and respect outside.

574
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,790
In all matters, we should
endure and yield,

575
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,720
and never act on momentary impulse.

576
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,920
Publicly exposing a petty person's schemes

577
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,590
will only invite

578
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,510
endless resentment and revenge.

579
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,110
The Wei family case

580
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,910
remained unsolved for 10 years.

581
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,680
Is Xu Song

582
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,920
the only one involved?

583
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,310
The reasons are far too deep to fathom.

584
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,070
The honor she bears

585
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,200
is not just her own.

586
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,310
She's still too rash,

587
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,040
lacking the wisdom of experience.

588
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,060
Old Madam Rong.

589
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,960
The autumn wind is rising,

590
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,310
and Miss Rong has just
recovered from her illness.

591
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,370
Should we have her come in to respond?

592
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,240
You...

593
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,480
What's wrong?

594
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,480
Grandmother, it is all my fault.

595
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,160
That day, Yunyin

596
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,820
left the Flower Hall in haste,

597
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,680
and didn't answer when I called her.

598
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,830
She must have overheard

599
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,440
how Shanbao

600
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,790
dealt with Yunwan.

601
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,860
If I had sensed
something was wrong sooner,

602
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,400
we wouldn't have ended up with the sisters

603
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,950
testifying against each other in court,

604
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,210
forcing Shanbao to contradict herself.

605
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,200
It is all my fault.

606
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,020
I beg for your forgiveness, Grandmother.

607
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,220
If she truly didn't want others to know,

608
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,070
why would she speak of it aloud?

609
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,500
She said it on purpose for Yunyin to hear.

610
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,030
Well.

611
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,260
She's deliberately going against me!

612
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,110
Grandmother.

613
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,040
You have nothing to do with this.

614
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,550
Old Madam Rong, what about Miss Rong?

615
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,700
Tell her to get lost!

623
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,960
Miss Rong, for the sake of Madam Yang,

624
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,200
you would dare

625
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,920
to oppose Lady Rong, who loves you

626
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,240
and make enemies
of all the officials in Linji.

627
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,110
Is it worth it?

628
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,720
Old Madam Rong has never been so angry

629
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,240
in raising Miss Rong.

630
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,580
If you truly care about Miss Rong,

631
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,890
then don't meddle.

632
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,880
The Rong family has always been peaceful.

633
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,760
It's all that Lu Jianglai's fault
for causing trouble,

634
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
upsetting Miss Rong, and making her

635
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,420
fall out of favor with Old Madam Rong.

636
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,320
He truly deserves to die.

637
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,030
The Rong family has thrived
in Linji for many years.

638
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,160
This requires a strong leader

639
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,750
to keep officials in check,

640
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,160
preserving outward harmony.

641
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,680
To be the leader of the Rong family,

642
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,210
one cannot be soft-hearted

643
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,830
or put personal feelings above duty.

644
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,690
Miss Rong is far too sentimental,

645
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,400
which is Old Madam Rong's greatest taboo.

646
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,960
Things are about to change
for the Rong family.

647
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,310
Take Lady Yunyin

648
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,070
back to the tea plantation immediately.

649
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,270
Old Madam Rong refuses to see her again.

650
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,640
Go now.

651
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,480
Yes.

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,870

663

Hurry up!

664
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,880
Everyone, do not move!

665
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,550
Anyone who moves will be
treated as an accomplice!

666
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,270
Men on this side, women on that side.

667
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,870
Separate!

668
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,750
Search thoroughly.

669
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,270
Record everything, item by item.

670
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,330
Stop crying. Move!

671
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,080
Hurry up!

672
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,350
Hurry up!

673
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,550
What are you looking at?

674
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,010
Master.

675
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,070
We searched the whole Yang family,

676
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,000
yet Yang Yitang was nowhere to be found.

677
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,270
According to the steward,

678
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,200
several boxes of gold, pearls,

679
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,350
and valuables kept in the storehouse

680
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,480
have also vanished.

681
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,000
The Yang family clearly
prepared a backup plan.

682
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,460
Send out the orders.
Search the entire city.

683
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,160
My Lord! My Lord! My Lord!

684
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,440
I've been wronged, My Lord!

685
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,070
I'm innocent, My Lord!

686
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,270
I am innocent, My Lord.

687
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,240
My Lord, I am innocent.

688
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,160
I've been wronged, My Lord.

689
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,890
My Lord! I'm innocent! My Lord!

690
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,350
I'm truly innocent!

691
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,640
I've been wronged!

692
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,350
My Lord!

693
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,270
Let me out!

694
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,000
Who is him?

695
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,110
My Lord.

696
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,350
This man is the former magistrate

697
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,950
of Tonglu County, Fan Wende.

698
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,830
The trouble was that

699
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,590
the presiding judge
back then, Fan Wende,

700
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,720
was held up by a sudden rainstorm

701
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
while rushing to repair
the collapsed houses,

702
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
delaying the autopsy by three days.

703
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,350
He insisted the evidence was insufficient,

704
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,830
refused to
condemn Wei Kejian to death,

705
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,590
and repeatedly defended Mrs. Wei,

706
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,850
so he was punished for delaying the case.

707
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,400
Good essay!

708
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,190
Please let me out, My Lord.

709
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
My Lord!

710
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,440
My Lord, is there anything else you need?

711
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,640
I can get more for you.

712
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,680
This meat is a bit tough.

713
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,190
Alright, I'll go swap it out.

714
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,550
Prefect Xu, what an appetite you have.

715
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,690
Are you enjoying your meal?

716
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Spare me, My Lord!

717
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,300
Please spare my life, My Lord!

718
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,270
What?

719
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,440
Inspector Lu, did you come here

720
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,100
just to kick me while I'm down?

721
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,210
I'm here to add
another dish for you, Lord Xu.

722
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,110
Serve it.

723
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,520
The last meal?

724
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,120
Lu Jianglai, you dare
sentence me to death?

725
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,830
Xu Song.

726
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,350
Yang Jisheng couldn't
withstand the torture

727
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,620
and has confessed everything.

728
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,160
You took bribes from the Yang family,

729
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,830
forced Wei Kejian into a false confession,

730
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,720
causing several deaths in the Wei family.

731
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,070
Your actions have stirred public outrage

732
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,050
and caused widespread fear.

733
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,980
I sentence you to public beheading

734
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,340
to appease the anger
of the people of Linji.

735
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,020
You cannot kill me!

736
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,240
You wouldn't dare!

737
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,060
You wouldn't dare.

738
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,610
You wouldn't dare.

739
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,110
A last meal should be a generous one.

740
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,310
Add more dishes for Lord Xu,

741
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,440
in return for the many favors

742
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,350
he once bestowed upon me.

743
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,360
Yes.

744
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,190
Lord Lu.

745
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,230
Lord Lu.

746
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,199
The Wei family case was far too serious

747
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,840
to be decided by me alone.

748
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,600
Now that I'm sentenced to death,

749
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,800
I shouldn't be the only one to die for it.

750
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,110
I've been wronged!

751
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,070
Then by your account,

752
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,230
who else has been involved?

753
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,730
Who has escaped justice until now?

754
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,670
It's...

755
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,800
Who is it?

756
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,920
It's...

757
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,510
I cannot say.

758
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,030
Don't force me.

759
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,670
Who exactly is it?

760
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,400
I want to hear you

761
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
say his name yourself.

762
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,370
Lord Lu, I cannot say.

763
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,320
I can't.

764
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,160
It would surely throw
the officialdom into turmoil.

765
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,800
Even if I'm not sentenced to death,

766
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,550
I won't walk

767
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,550
out of here alive.

768
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,150
I can't say it. I just can't.

769
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,630
I...

770
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,190
Open the door! Now!

771
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,440
Xu Song! Xu Song!

772
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,590
Call for help!

773
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,150
Yes!

774
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,440
This... this...

775
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,320
It... it wasn't me.

776
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,820
The food and wine
were sent by the Xu family.

777
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,110
It has nothing to do with me!

778
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,440
Nothing to do with me!

779
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,150
The Wei family case has been resolved.

780
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,000
Wei Kejian and the Wei family
are cleared of all charges

781
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
and released.

782
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
Yang Jisheng will be executed

783
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,800
this autumn for the false accusation.

784
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,030
Are you really not coming with me

785
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,440
to report back to the capital?

786
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,510
Master.

787
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,510
In Linji, there are villains

788
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,960
like Xu Song, who is corrupt,

789
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,000
perverts the law, and acts reckless.

790
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,960
But there are also many upright officials

791
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,280
who would rather be imprisoned
than condemn the innocent.

792
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,720
Several former magistrates
who upheld justice

793
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,450
and were wrongfully convicted

794
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,890
are still in prison,

795
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,480
waiting to be released.

796
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,480
Xu Song's constant evasions

797
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,030
and concealments only prove

798
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,230
how formidable the power behind him is.

799
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,550
Without bringing him to justice,

800
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,080
how can this case
truly be said to be resolved?

801
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,010
I have submitted a memorial

802
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,110
requesting to be appointed
as Prefect of Linji.

803
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,480
I am determined to uphold integrity,

804
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,540
purge corruption,

805
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,710
and set the local officialdom right.

806
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,590
Foolish!

807
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,070
Absolute purity leaves
no room for survival.

808
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
In the world of officialdom,

809
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,510
there are many unavoidable compromises.

810
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,960
When danger arises,
one should step back in time

811
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,160
and wait for a better opportunity.

812
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,090
I am stubborn by nature.

813
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,760
I've never learned
the art of timely retreat.

814
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,440
I know only how to advance
in the face of adversity.

815
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,170
Please forgive my obstinance.

816
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,110
You're young and impetuous.

817
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,280
You will suffer greatly in the future.

818
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,960
Please take care of your health, Master.

819
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,760
Longjing tea in Linji
is at its best in early spring.

820
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,960
You arrived a bit late

821
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,760
and missed it.

822
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,340
When you retire
and return to your hometown,

823
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,510
your boat will still pass through Linji.

824
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,280
At that time,

825
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,400
I will bring the finest Longjing tea

826
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,360
and wait for you at the dock.

827
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,110
I fear that once I'm gone,

828
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,230
the tea will soon grow cold.

829
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,840
The winds on the river are strong
and the waves are high.

830
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,070
Take good care of yourself.

831
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,840
Come out now.

832
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,760
You've followed me all this way.

833
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,510
Did you really think I was unaware?

834
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,400
Father.

835
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,990
Greetings, Senior Lu.

836
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,800
That's enough.

837
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,110
Let's go.

838
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,610
One should know the ways of the world
without being worldly,

839
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,210
and grow sophisticated
while preserving one's innocence.

840
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,070
If a young man lacks sharpness,

841
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,670
he will never amount to much.

842
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,190
If Lu Jianglai can overcome

843
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,630
this obstacle,

844
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,110
Ying,

845
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,070
you will finally have

846
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,030
someone to rely on for life.

847
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,330
Father, once you leave,

848
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,590
Senior Lu will lose all his backing.

849
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,230
I'm truly curious.

850
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,230
What skill does he have

851
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,110
that could take down

852
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,970
high-ranking officials single-handedly?

853
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,780
Miss Rong, you're kind-hearted.

854
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,030
Other than you,

855
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,230
no one would ever come to see

856
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,320
a cast-off woman.

857
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,990
I've clung to
this wretched life for ten years.

858
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,850
The Yang family members loathe me

859
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,900
and seek to brand me as a wanton.

860
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,520
I tried to vindicate Madam Wei,

861
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,260
but the Wei family
didn't show the slightest gratitude.

862
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,390
They only curse me as a venomous woman.

863
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,760
Nowadays, everyone,

864
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,000
even vegetable sellers

865
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,610
calls me a harbinger of disaster.

866
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,180
Miss Rong, who do you think

867
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,840
I am now?

868
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,110
Godmother.

869
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,570
Why should you care about such gossip?

870
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,850
I was carried into the Wei mansion
on an eight-bearer sedan.

871
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,490
My arms once rivaled

872
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,170
even the finest tribute silk.

873
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,210
After marrying into the Wei family,

874
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,810
I was only called Madam Yang.

875
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,070
Now I'm called a loose woman,

876
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,840
a venomous woman, a jinx.

877
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,400
No one remembers my name.

878
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,590
Miss Rong.

879
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,480
My name is Yang Yun.

880
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,670
From now on,

881
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,000
I'll have no name or identity.

882
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,110
Miss Rong.

883
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,550
You need not worry about me anymore.

884
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,210
I have already chosen where I will go.

885
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,480
If you can live in peace and ease there,

886
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,220
it can be a place for you to settle.

887
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,610
I'm not going back!

888
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,770
No one can force me!

889
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,560
You're my only son.

890
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,880
I had hoped you would
pass the imperial exam

891
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
and bring honor to our family.

892
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,840
But instead,

893
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,630
you run off to the Rong family,
hoping to marry in.

894
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,480
What a filial son you are.

895
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,480
I've raised you for 20 years,

896
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:07,920
and this is how

897
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,960
you repay us?

898
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,110
Father.

899
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,360
I love Shanbao.

900
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,950
I'm resolved to marry
into the Rong family.

901
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,950
Mind your own business!

902
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,720
You... you wayward son!

903
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,000
Do you even know

904
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,330
what the Rong family is?

905
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,320
When Lady Rong turns cruel,

906
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,830
she's worse than any man-eating demon!

907
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,400
I should never have

908
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,860
sent that bowl of meat soup

909
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,070
and arranged that match.

910
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,920
Yet you dare to rush headlong into this.

911
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,450
You've got no fear of death!

912
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,960
I actually don't know

913
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,360
what our Rong family is.

914
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,760
Why don't you tell me, Uncle?

915
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,330
Miss Rong, you're here.

916
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,960
I misspoke just now.

917
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,960
Please don't take offense.

918
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,990
-I…
-Enough.

919
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,560
If Grandmother heard that,

920
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
your carefree days

921
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,760
would be over.

922
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,050
Take him away.

923
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,260
Okay. Let's go.

924
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,390
Young Master.

925
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,870
Young Master.

926
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,130
Since I started doing these things,

927
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,110
I knew it would hurt our relationship

928
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,710
and damage your reputation.

929
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,270
But I did them anyway.

930
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,630
And

931
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,800
I have no regrets.

932
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,300
If you intend to drive me
out of the Rong family,

933
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,100
there are some things I must say.

934
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,170
Shanbao, others adore you

935
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,360
for your beauty and wealth.

936
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,380
But even if you were plain,

937
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,890
and not a daughter of the Rong family,

938
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,370
I...

939
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,080
I would still be your cousin.

940
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,180
Even without romantic ties,

941
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,360
we still have our bond as cousins.

942
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,880
I would never harm you.

943
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,330
Go on.

944
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,190
Not a single one of those

945
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,750
who came to the Rong family
truly cared for you,

946
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,420
especially that Lu Jianglai.

947
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,550
You are so noble and proud,

948
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,960
yet you exhaust yourself for him,

949
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,360
damage your reputation,

950
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,030
and estrange yourself from your family.

951
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,030
It's not worth it.

952
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,130
You've been determined

953
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,530
to bring glory to the Rong Family.

954
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,410
You are the brightest jewel of it.

955
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,590
Everyone looks up to you.

956
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,880
You shouldn't let a man

957
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,680
hold you back.

958
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,840
The whereabouts of Madam Yang

959
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,490
were deliberately passed on to me.

960
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,990
Someone in the Rong family
intends to harm you.

961
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,120
You need to be ready.

962
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,810
[Tea and Health]

963
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,100
Ancient people drank tea

964
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,450
primarily to refresh the mind.

965
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:21,710
[Give yourself a cup of tea every day,
and let your body savor its benefits]

966
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,950
One cup,

967
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,580
and weariness would vanish.

968
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,510
Scholars could then

969
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,030
focus on their studies.

970
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,590
In fact, tea has great benefits

971
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,630
for human health.

972
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,980
The Classic of Tea

973
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,310
records its effects.

974
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,160
If one feels heat and thirst,
mental heaviness, headache,

975
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,700
eye strain, restlessness in the limbs,

976
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,230
or stiffness in the joints,

977
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,460
taking a few sips

978
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,890
can rival the finest elixirs
and sweet dew.

979
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,620
Modern scientific studies have shown that

980
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,090
the polyphenols and catechins

981
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:47,930
in green tea

982
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,020
can significantly enhance the activity

983
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,360
of superoxide dismutase,

984
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,920
reduce oxidative damage,

985
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,440
thereby slowing aging

986
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,600
and preventing various chronic diseases.

987
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,890
Tea polyphenols

988
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,930
can absorb radioactive substances,

989
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,600
reducing the harmful effects of radiation

990
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,810
from electronic devices

991
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,620
such as computers and mobile phones.

992
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,200
Moreover, in regions where the diet

993
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,160
is predominantly meat-based,

994
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,750
tea is especially important.

995
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,640
For example, in highland areas

996
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,600
where people mainly consume beef,
mutton, and tsampa,

997
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,450
drinking tea

998
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,770
not only aids digestion

999
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:16,630
but also maintains

1000
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,560
the body's acid-base balance,

1001
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,640
compensating for dietary deficiencies.

1002
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,340
That's why, thousands of years ago,

1003
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,400
tea had already become

1004
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,530
a vital commodity along
the Ancient Tea Horse Road.
