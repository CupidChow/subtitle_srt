00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,900
[Linji Prefectural Office]

4
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,200
My Lord, why did you
summon me back so urgently?

5
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,190
Take a look at this.

6
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,930
A reward notice from the Rong family.

7
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,680
Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku

8
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,350
is a rare and valuable book
printed during the Song dynasty.

9
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,040
Rong Shanbao

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,970
likely wants to use it
to please the Empress Dowager.

11
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,210
What do you think?

12
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,870
My Lord, if you trust me,

13
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,600
please leave

14
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,350
this matter to me.

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,430
What's your plan?

16
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,030
Please wait and see, My Lord.

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
I will make sure Rong Shanbao

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
falls into the abyss.

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,890
These days, with all
that's happening at the Rong family,

20
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,550
everyone is feeling anxious.

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,190
I can see they

22
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,560
have completely lost
interest in processing tea.

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,500
They've even ruined

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,930
many freshly picked tea leaves.

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,329
We might as well
let them rest for a few days.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,530
That's fine.

27
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,910
Shanbao.

28
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,800
Do you know who

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
is behind the attacks on our family?

30
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,360
Naturally, it's someone who despises
the Rong family the most.

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,690
After all, a few days ago

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
he was just at our tea plantation

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
where he lost face

34
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,090
and lost his trusted aide.

35
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,390
Him?

36
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,150
How could he possibly control

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,480
people from our family?

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Lady Shanbao!

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,530
Someone has responded to the reward notice

40
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,530
and has come here.

41
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,310
Be more vigilant these days.

42
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,370
Jiang Yiqian has ill intentions.

43
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,660
He definitely won't spare

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,660
this place where he was humiliated.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,600
I understand.

46
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,270
Please show him in.

47
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,360
Come in, please.

48
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,170
Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,820
is in your possession?

50
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,950
Lady Shanbao.

51
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,190
I escaped
from the Wei family years ago

52
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,000
and have been hiding all these years.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,590
Now I'm too ashamed to go back.

54
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,550
Please keep this matter confidential.

55
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,570
Don't tell the Wei family

56
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,829
about my whereabouts.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,590
I'm only here for

58
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,050
the "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku."

59
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,930
Other matters don't concern me.

60
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,390
I certainly won't gossip.

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,020
In the reward notice,

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,900
the Rong family promised one condition.

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,430
Is it truly anything I want?

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,680
If the Rong family can fulfill it,

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,630
we will see to it.

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,630
Good.

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,430
Please follow me.

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,640
Miss, please have a seat.

69
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,430
I've put the book in the inner room.

70
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,269
Please, Miss,

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,019
write the agreement first

72
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,950
and I'll go inside to get it for you.

73
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,480
Alright.

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,460
My Lady.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,260
Go report to the authorities.

76
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,480
Wei!

77
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,040
Wei, look.

78
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
I've brewed a new pot of wine for you.

79
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,390
Wei.

80
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,320
Wei?

81
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,210
Something's wrong!

82
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,480
Murder!

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Murder!

84
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
My Lord, bad news!

85
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,220
Lady Rong Shanbao has been captured.

86
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,460
Is your leg feeling better, Old Madam?

87
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,070
I still can't get out of bed,

88
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,410
though I can move a little bit.

89
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,600
Your condition

90
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,110
naturally requires gradual recovery.

91
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,920
Given time,

92
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,970
you will surely return
to your former health, Old Madam.

93
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,830
After lying here for so many days,

94
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,160
you're the only one

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
who comes to see me from time to time.

96
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,820
That ungrateful girl

97
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,430
is probably still holding
a grudge against me.

98
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,430
She hasn't shown her face even once.

99
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,510
What lasting grudge could exist
between grandmother and granddaughter?

100
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,110
Old Madam,

101
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,510
the most important thing for you now

102
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,570
is to rest quietly.

103
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,190
The household matters

104
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,190
will be handled by the young ladies.

105
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,970
Why do I feel

106
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,290
that recently the mansion

107
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,430
seems much quieter?

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,620
What's the matter?

109
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,909
It's nothing.

110
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,990
Just some personal affairs.

111
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,540
I should take my leave now.

112
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,220
I'll visit you another day, Old Madam.

113
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,510
You heard correctly?

114
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,750
Lady Shanbao has killed someone?

115
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,650
There's no mistake.

116
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,040
Someone has identified her.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
It's already been brought to court.

118
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,560
[Linji Prefectural Office]

119
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,070
My Lord.

120
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,720
I am a neighbor of Wei Zhou.

121
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,870
I saw

122
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,390
the three of them enter the house.

123
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,250
Shortly after,

124
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,190
Lady Shanbao's maid

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,090
suddenly rushed out in a hurry.

126
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,180
I never expected

127
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
to walk into the room

128
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,510
and find my neighbor

129
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,890
lying on the floor,

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,360
his head covered in blood.

131
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,120
Are you certain you only saw

132
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Miss Rong and her maid

133
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,330
enter that room today?

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,159
Yes.

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
I was actually

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,580
standing guard outside the whole time.

137
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,110
When I went in with the wine,

138
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,660
I saw that the doors and windows
of Wei Zhou's house were tightly shut,

139
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,740
with only Miss Rong present.

140
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
You took one hasty glance

141
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,790
and noticed the windows?

142
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
How observant of you.

143
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,410
What's wrong with that?

144
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,180
We've been neighbors for many years,

145
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,330
so I know

146
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,640
there's only one window in his house,

147
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,080
and I naturally noticed it right away.

148
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,160
Miss Rong.

149
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,600
I understand that you

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,060
went to great lengths
for the birthday gift,

151
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,690
but that doesn't justify

152
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
taking someone's life.

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
I went to Wei Zhou's house

154
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,720
indeed for

155
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,980
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku."

156
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,040
But he went alone

157
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,900
to get the book when he was killed.

158
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,200
I have no idea

159
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,309
who killed him,

160
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,190
or why.

161
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,919
I went with him to make a deal.

162
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,330
On what grounds am I
accused of murder for money?

163
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,150
That makes sense.

164
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,270
But she was the only one there.

165
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,530
She must be the killer.

166
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
My Lord.

167
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,600
Actually,

168
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,080
my neighbor

169
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,720
mentioned to me before

170
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,150
that he wanted to use his book collection

171
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,080
in exchange for

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,180
half of the Rong family's fortune.

173
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,660
Indeed,

174
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,000
what he did

175
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,250
was somewhat greedy.

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,670
But Miss Rong,

177
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,160
if you didn't want to give it to him,

178
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,550
you didn't have to

179
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,960
take his life.

180
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,350
The man is dead,

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,940
and these words

182
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,090
are clearly your fabrication.

183
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,890
Rong Shanbao!

184
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,250
Wei Zhou was murdered
while alone with you.

185
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,150
What else can you say?

186
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,110
He claims I killed for money,

187
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,790
so where is

188
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,990
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

189
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,550
that I supposedly stole?

190
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,970
Isn't it obvious?

191
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Her personal maid

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,790
must have taken

193
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,630
the stolen goods

194
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,870
when she fled

195
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,150
in panic.

196
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,840
My Lord,

197
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,390
I urge you to interrogate her thoroughly.

198
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,000
Under torture,

199
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,770
she will surely confess.

200
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,320
Guards!

201
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,830
Your Excellency.

202
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,750
Lord Lu.

203
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,880
Why has Lord Lu come?

204
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,360
Lord Lu is here.

205
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,600
Investigating cases and passing judgment

206
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
is my duty.

207
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,150
Lord Jiang, why have you condescended

208
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,610
to investigate this case personally?

209
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,900
You and Rong Shanbao are close friends.

210
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,760
You should recuse yourself from this case.

211
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,130
Then, Lord Jiang,

212
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,120
you've confronted

213
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,150
Miss Rong at the tea plantation.

214
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,290
Should you not recuse yourself as well

215
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,080
to avoid others

216
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,830
thinking you're seeking personal revenge?

217
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,040
I've invited Lord Luo

218
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
to observe this case.

219
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,040
What's wrong?

220
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,440
Are you suggesting

221
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,460
Lord Luo is not fair either?

222
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,150
Lord Luo

223
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,040
is certainly just and fair.

224
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,200
It's just that this case

225
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
still has many suspicious aspects.

226
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,380
Lord Jiang, you intend to proceed
with the punishment.

227
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,600
Do you intend to extract
a false confession?

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,330
Lu Jianglai.

229
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:53,970
You're letting personal feelings

230
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,190
interfere with court proceedings.

231
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,270
Lord Jiang, don't change the subject.

232
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,270
I'm saying this case is suspicious.

233
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,550
Being in the same room with the deceased

234
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,150
doesn't automatically
make one the murderer.

235
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,610
That's far too arbitrary.

236
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,360
Everyone knows that Rong Shanbao

237
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,390
spared no effort

238
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,940
for "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku".

239
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,550
She was the only one at the murder scene.

240
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,720
The motive for murder
has been established.

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Is that being arbitrary?

242
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,120
Currently, "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

243
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
is still nowhere to be found.

244
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,510
The most urgent matter

245
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,960
is to locate the book

246
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,800
rather than punishing an innocent person.

247
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,210
You...

248
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,040
Since you two cannot come to an agreement,

249
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,910
then this case

250
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,670
will be personally examined by me.

251
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,150
This matter

252
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,130
began with a birthday gift.

253
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
The Empress Dowager's birthday

254
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
should be celebrated throughout the land

255
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
and must not be tainted with bloodshed.

256
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,350
Miss Rong.

257
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,680
I have witnessed the influence
of the Rong family

258
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,840
in Linji over the past few days.

259
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
First the birthday gift was ruined,

260
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,720
and then it became
entangled in a murder case.

261
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,150
If this case is proven,

262
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,960
no one can save the Rong family.

263
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,670
Guards!

264
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,150
Take Rong Shanbao

265
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,440
into custody.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,730
Yes, My Lord.

267
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,700
My Lord, you need not worry.

268
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,680
Wei Zhou and his neighbor

269
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,940
are people I arranged.

270
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,120
They never actually had

271
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,380
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku".

272
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,390
As long as she has the murder motive,

273
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,650
no matter how eloquent

274
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,910
Rong Shanbao is,

275
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,240
she cannot escape punishment.

276
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,240
How did Wei Zhou die?

277
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,630
Suicide.

278
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,740
Wei Zhou had been ill for a long time

279
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,470
and didn't have much time left.

280
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,110
He wanted to leave a dowry for

281
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,480
his daughter who left

282
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,750
with her remarried mother.

283
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,080
So I paid him handsomely

284
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,280
and bought his life.

285
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,770
No matter how this case is investigated,

286
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,030
there will only be Rong Shanbao

287
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,000
as the murderer.

288
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,740
Brilliant!

289
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,360
However, Mr. Bai,

290
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,390
there's blood on your hands.

291
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Aren't you afraid

292
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,880
it might affect your official career?

293
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,270
Consider this as my

294
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,890
pledge of loyalty to you, My Lord.

295
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,840
My future path

296
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,210
will greatly depend on your support.

297
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,880
Rest assured.

298
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,240
In the future,

299
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,070
I will certainly help you
rise to great heights.

300
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,700
Mr. An,

301
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,910
where are you heading?

302
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,360
I...

303
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,920
Mr. An,

304
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,550
I'm returning to Rong Mansion now.

305
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,870
Before I leave,
I want to remind you of something.

306
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,470
A person can't be too greedy.

307
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,560
If you want a peaceful life,

308
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,660
you must give up something.

309
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,630
Can I have a word with you?

310
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,880
From the very beginning

311
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,650
you've all been lying to me.

312
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,910
You don't really think

313
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,370
that good fortune
falls from the sky, do you?

314
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,270
You should be grateful

315
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,870
that you still have some use.

316
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,530
Otherwise, who would even notice you?

317
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,120
You're doing quite well

318
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,630
at the Provincial Governor's Office.

319
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,510
It's better than having

320
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,240
that heartless Lady Yunxi

321
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,150
who refuses to acknowledge your existence.

322
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,630
She is not heartless.

323
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,170
I made this choice willingly.

324
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,750
Lord Jiang is not

325
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,880
a man of good temper.

326
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
I advise you not to be foolish again.

327
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,160
If you serve Lord Jiang,

328
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,370
he will certainly treat you well.

329
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,320
When the Rong family falls,

330
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,700
you and your daughter

331
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,620
will rise to great heights.

332
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,430
Hurry up. Don't take too long.

333
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,510
Mr. Yan.

334
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,320
Why are you here?

335
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,910
They're wrongfully accusing you,

336
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,640
aren't they?

337
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,870
Yes.

338
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,080
Is there any way out of this?

339
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,440
They've set a trap

340
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,270
waiting for me to fall in.

341
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,570
They'll certainly make me pay dearly.

342
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,650
I have an answer to that question

343
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,190
you asked me last time.

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,600
What is it?

345
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm willing.

346
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Lady Shanbao.

347
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,730
I'm willing to stay,

348
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,060
even without the Rong family.

349
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,150
All my life,

350
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,870
every decision I've made

351
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,000
has required careful consideration.

352
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,860
But that day,

353
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,840
I didn't promptly

354
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,100
answer your question.

355
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,780
I've regretted it for days.

356
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,660
I believe

357
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,920
this is my answer.

358
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,520
Even if this time

359
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,320
you have no way to clear your name,

360
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,270
I'll do everything possible

361
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,930
to save you.

362
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,400
Even if it means

363
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,200
we become fugitives afterward.

364
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,980
As long as you trust me.

365
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,050
-You...
-Shut up if you can’t save her.

366
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,680
Why talk about becoming fugitives
when there's no need?

367
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,310
Mr. Yan,

368
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,060
I need to discuss the case
with Lady Shanbao.

369
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,200
Please excuse us.

370
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,620
Mr. Yan, please go back first.

371
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,800
I understand

372
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,450
your feelings.

373
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,590
Look,

374
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
a pure, flawless disciple of Buddha

375
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,920
is willing to flee
with you to the ends of the earth.

376
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,350
How touching.

377
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,720
Speak properly.

378
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,740
What exactly are you planning?

379
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Looking for a book

380
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,240
and somehow
getting yourself thrown in jail.

381
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,830
There are too many people

382
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,200
watching me like hawks.

383
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,540
I can't guard against them all.

384
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,110
What are you

385
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,740
planning to do next?

386
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,860
I don't believe you'll just admit defeat.

387
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,270
I have a plan.

388
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
I need your help.

389
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,230
What do you want me to do?

390
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,060
I should warn you beforehand.

391
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,270
This matter carries enormous risk.

392
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,110
One misstep,

393
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,610
and you could be dragged down as well.

394
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,280
So what?

395
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,440
Someone already has the role

396
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,570
of fleeing with you.

397
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,940
I should at least have

398
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,670
the title of sharing your fate.

399
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,030
Lady Yunshu,

400
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,140
you're still in the mood
to tend to these flowers?

401
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,400
Tomorrow will be the fifth day.

402
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,070
Your freedom

403
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,530
to come and go at Rong Mansion

404
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,390
is about to end.

405
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,120
It seems you haven't heard.

406
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,550
Rong Shanbao,
in her search for a birthday tribute,

407
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,680
committed a murder.

408
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Your Rong Mansion

409
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,500
is headed for disaster.

410
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,720
Impossible.

411
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,600
She's not that foolish.

412
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,300
It's often the clever ones

413
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,360
who make mistakes.

414
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,230
You framed her.

415
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,250
I wasn't ruthless enough back then.

416
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,500
I should have let you die in the river.

417
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,200
Sorry to disappoint you.

418
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,880
Heaven wasn't ready for me.

419
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,440
Rong Yunshu.

420
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,740
I'll give you a way out, all right?

421
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,130
You are to identify

422
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,720
Rong Shanbao as the one who,
out of resentment,

423
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,380
burned down the Tea King Tree.

424
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,010
I'll plead with Lord Jiang to spare you

425
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,000
and even grant you

426
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,580
one of the Rong family's tea mountains.

427
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,100
We daughters of the Rong family

428
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,830
may fight for power,

429
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,510
but would never betray each other

430
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,970
just to save our own skins.

431
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,050
[Linji Prefectural Office]

432
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,130
We're here.

433
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,550
Miao'er, strike the drum.

434
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,400
What's happening?

435
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,330
What's going on?

436
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,030
Someone is striking the drum.

437
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,310
Why is it a little girl?

438
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,290
This set of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

439
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,850
belongs to my Wei family collection.

440
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,100
During the confiscation years ago,

441
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
it was hidden in a screen by my family

442
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,930
and escaped being seized.

443
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
I've been hiding it all these years.

444
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,750
No matter how difficult life became,

445
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,910
I endured and persevered.

446
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,030
I chose to hang on a bit longer.

447
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,550
I thought when the day came

448
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,550
when we couldn't make ends meet anymore,

449
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,210
I would take it out and sell it.

450
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,110
Fortunately,

451
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,030
our Wei family

452
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
has been exonerated.

453
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,410
Yesterday, my granddaughter told me

454
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,220
there was a murder in town
because of this book.

455
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,160
My heart

456
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,720
was truly filled with anxiety.

457
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,120
So I brought this book

458
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,200
and hurried over here.

459
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,760
[Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku]

460
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,160
You mean

461
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
this is "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"?

462
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,770
That's right.

463
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,560
Back then, Wei Kejian

464
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,830
built a library

465
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,790
and kept this Song Dynasty edition

466
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,830
as his family's most treasured possession.

467
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,630
Before the library caught fire,

468
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,830
Wei Kejian

469
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,360
had already hidden

470
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,980
this set of books away.

471
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,030
By chance,

472
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
it ended up in my possession.

473
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
If this collection is in your hands,

474
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,160
then Wei Zhou, who answered
the reward notice yesterday

475
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
and died unnaturally,

476
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,640
was lying.

477
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,030
In that case,

478
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,620
Lady Rong Shanbao's motive for murder

479
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,420
becomes even more nonexistent.

480
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,880
Whether it's true or not,

481
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
how can we rely on one person's word?

482
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Lord Jiang, previously

483
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,510
you also just believed

484
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,960
the testimony
of Wei Zhou's neighbor, didn't you?

485
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,400
Now that the real "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

486
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,200
has appeared,

487
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,070
it proves that Wei Zhou and his neighbor

488
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,200
had ill intentions.

489
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,640
Perhaps they conspired together

490
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,270
to deceive Lady Rong Shanbao,

491
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,160
but quarreled over dividing the spoils.

492
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,440
After accidentally killing Wei Zhou,

493
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,030
the neighbor framed Lady Rong Shanbao.

494
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,760
Lu Jianglai,

495
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,000
your reasoning

496
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
is far too arbitrary.

497
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,000
Lord Jiang, you only relied on hearsay

498
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,230
to conclude that Lady Rong Shanbao

499
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,020
killed someone for a set of books.

500
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,080
Isn't that equally arbitrary?

501
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,930
Nonsense!

502
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,880
Enough!

503
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
This case has too many suspicious points.

504
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,170
How can we make wild speculations?

505
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,900
First, we need someone
to verify
if this set of books is authentic.

506
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,750
Tomorrow,

507
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,260
I will investigate
until the truth comes to light.

508
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,740
Lord Luo, you're wise.

509
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,960
Although I spoke

510
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,690
in righteous terms at the time,

511
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,230
on reflection

512
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,530
I still felt a measure of unease.

513
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,790
That woman, Ms. Chang,

514
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,830
out of gratitude

515
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,240
for my help with her case,

516
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,720
was willing to bring a fake copy

517
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,780
of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku" as evidence,

518
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,380
but a fake is still a fake.

519
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,020
If it's discovered,

520
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,880
the punishment will be even more severe,

521
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,210
and we'll never
be able to clear our names.

522
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,810
I've already told you before

523
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,640
this matter carries enormous risk.

524
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,300
I'm not worried about myself.

525
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,120
I only worry whether you can

526
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,550
see this through safely.

527
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,070
I've been offering a generous reward
for so many days

528
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,670
but still haven't found
any trace of this book.

529
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,750
I suspect the book

530
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,960
was probably destroyed

531
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,490
in that fire at the library.

532
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,920
Probably?

533
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,680
Lady Rong Shanbao,

534
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,480
when did your actions

535
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,880
become so questionable?

536
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,830
You're overlooking something.

537
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,310
What?

538
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,310
Few people

539
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,400
have ever seen the real

540
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,660
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku."

541
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,770
Have you thought about

542
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,970
how to conclude this?

543
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,840
Surely

544
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,030
you don't really intend to present
a fake Song Dynasty edition

545
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,360
to the Empress Dowager?

546
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,650
That would be a serious crime.

547
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,340
The real Song Dynasty edition
no longer exists.

548
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,400
Now if we say

549
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
what Ms. Chang has is authentic,

550
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,790
then it is authentic.

551
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,560
Are you hiding something from me?

552
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,990
You've helped me so much.

553
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,960
I've been completely honest with you.

554
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,270
That Rong Shanbao

555
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,130
is truly reckless beyond belief.

556
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,480
She actually thought of

557
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,740
using this method to break the deadlock.

558
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,630
That old woman

559
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,430
who owes Lu Jianglai a debt of gratitude

560
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,400
must have been used
by them to create this deception.

561
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
This is good news.

562
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,510
Lu Jianglai is rushing here
to his own death.

563
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,110
We can catch them all at once.

564
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,920
Okay.

565
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,830
I'll go right now
to instruct that neighbor

566
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,050
to stick firmly to the story
that Rong Shanbao committed murder.

567
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,120
If he dares to waver...

568
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,520
No need for that trouble.

569
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,290
Come over here and look.

570
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,830
The authentic "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

571
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,640
is in my hands.

572
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,350
Rong Shanbao

573
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,810
walked right into the trap herself.

574
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,960
Is this book authentic?

575
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,000
I got this

576
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,640
from Wei Kejian before.

577
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,760
It's absolutely authentic.

578
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,120
Just tell them

579
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,480
you found this book during the search.

580
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,200
An Cha and his daughter
are at the County Office now.

581
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Send a letter

582
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,460
to Lady Rong Yunxi.

583
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,830
Ask her to testify

584
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,570
that she saw this book at your place.

585
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,080
This will ensure Rong Shanbao

586
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,480
can never clear her name.

587
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,570
Rest assured, My Lord.

588
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,830
I will certainly complete this mission.

589
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Li, be a good girl.

590
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,310
In a moment,

591
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,880
I want to play a little game with you.

592
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,160
No matter what happens,

593
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
you must not make any noise.

594
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,750
Alright?

595
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,030
Good girl.

596
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,840
Come.

597
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:25,970
Now,

598
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,260
I'll cover you with this.

599
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,740
Okay?

600
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,130
This way!

601
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,550
They ran this way!

602
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,150
Hurry!

603
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,990
Split up and chase them!

604
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,520
Yes, sir.

605
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,340
Li, listen carefully.

606
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,440
That tea plantation ahead

607
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,590
is where you used to live.

608
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,520
Do you remember?

609
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,550
I want to play a game with you.

610
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's have a race.

611
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,750
Whoever gets there first wins.

612
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,240
Okay?

613
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,020
Go.

614
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,370
That direction.

615
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,000
Hurry.

616
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,990
I'll be right behind you.

617
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:49,870
Li, be good.

618
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,350
Remember to go to the plantation

619
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,830
and find

620
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,160
the big sister
who took care of you before.

621
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,030
Run quickly.

622
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,750
Don't fall.

623
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,070
Don't look back.

624
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,920
Tell me

625
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,210
where your daughter is.

626
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,280
You won't talk? Beat him!

627
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,080
Stop!

628
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,310
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,360
You fool.

630
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,220
[Linji Prefectural Office]

631
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,440
Our Wei family

632
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,810
have also been wrongfully accused

633
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,530
and suffered humiliation.

634
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,790
Today I step forward

635
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,640
because I don't want

636
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,390
to see another Wei family
suffer the same fate.

637
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,160
I don't want innocent people

638
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,190
to be wrongfully accused again.

639
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,110
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

640
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,310
has always been hidden by me

641
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,590
and never fell into others' hands.

642
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,350
This precious book

643
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,880
carries

644
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,250
all the wisdom

645
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,960
of our ancestors throughout history.

646
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,160
It should not become

647
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,850
evidence for false accusations.

648
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,360
A housewife with such noble character.

649
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,840
We who serve in court

650
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,590
should be even more discerning

651
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,720
and uphold justice.

652
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,310
Lord Luo,

653
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,360
how is the verification of
the Song Dynasty edition going?

654
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,550
Rong Shanbao,

655
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,430
I ask you:

656
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,510
do you truly not know why Wei Zhou

657
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,510
died?

658
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,310
Lord Luo,

659
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,110
I've already stated clearly before.

660
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,400
I went to Wei Zhou's house

661
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,510
to make a deal.

662
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,440
Even if the deal falls through,
we can still part as friends.

663
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,480
The Rong family has never

664
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,210
bullied others with our power.

665
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,240
Not to mention murder and robbery.

666
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,590
As for why Wei Zhou

667
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,880
died in a room

668
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,810
with all doors and windows locked,

669
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,660
I'm afraid only he himself

670
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,810
and this good neighbor would know.

671
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,960
When Wei Zhou died,

672
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,360
I wasn't even in the room.

673
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,880
How dare you slander me?

674
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,640
You didn't actually see me kill anyone.

675
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,400
You only saw Wei Zhou after he was dead,

676
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,860
when I was in the same room.

677
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,640
What grounds do you have
to falsely accuse me of murder?

678
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,710
You... I...

679
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,160
Lord Luo.

680
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,550
This case is very clear.

681
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,590
Someone powerful

682
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,160
holds a grudge against me

683
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,760
because of past grievances.

684
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,200
Knowing I was looking for

685
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,460
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku",

686
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,980
he set a trap

687
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,850
to lure me into Wei Zhou's house,

688
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,110
then committed murder

689
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,410
and framed me for it.

690
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,590
I will investigate
Wei Zhou's death thoroughly.

691
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,550
Since there's insufficient evidence,

692
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,350
Rong Shanbao,

693
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,740
you may return to the Rong family.

694
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,690
But before this case is resolved,

695
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,510
you must not leave Linji.

696
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,370
Thank you, Lord Luo.

697
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,480
Ma'am.

698
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,720
I wish to buy your copy
of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

699
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,750
at a high price.

700
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,110
Would you

701
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,090
be willing to part with it?

702
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,870
Lady Shanbao, if you like it,

703
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,480
I'll simply give it to you.

704
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
I only ask that

705
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,340
if Wei's descendants ever face hardship,

706
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,140
Lady Shanbao,

707
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,390
you would lend them a helping hand.

708
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,050
Okay.

709
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,440
I promise.

710
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,710
Thank you.

711
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,310
Lord Luo,

712
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

713
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,110
is the crystallization
of countless people's devotion and labor.

714
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,170
Books are innocent

715
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,990
and shouldn't be tainted
by worldly desires.

716
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,310
I humbly dare to present
this work as a birthday tribute,

717
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,370
and ask that Your Lordship accept it.

718
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,500
Wait.

719
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,920
Lord Luo,

720
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,610
This copy of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

721
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,360
is fake.

722
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,020
The authentic one is in my hands.

723
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,380
My surname is Bai,
courtesy name Yingsheng,

724
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,280
a student from Wanfeng Academy.

725
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,830
Since childhood,

726
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,480
I've loved collecting old books.

727
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,350
This Song Dynasty edition

728
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,150
has been in my collection for 2 years.

729
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,350
A few days ago, I heard

730
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,800
someone was passing off
a fake as authentic,

731
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
so I hurried here.

732
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,480
The matter of authenticity
shouldn't concern me.

733
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,000
But

734
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,070
I study the classics,

735
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,830
and cannot stand to see this used

736
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,900
to deceive the sovereign.

737
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,590
Madam Wei,

738
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,690
how do you explain this?

739
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
I... I...

740
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,290
You claim yours is authentic.

741
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,929
How can you prove it?

742
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,489
A reproduction

743
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,159
is naturally inferior to the original.

744
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,550
The difference between these two

745
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,030
is obvious to anyone.

746
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,620
Lord Jiang,

747
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,470
I've heard

748
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,100
you're also a book collector.

749
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,320
Perhaps

750
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,870
you could help determine
which is authentic.

751
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,170
Okay.

752
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,760
Li.

753
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,360
Li.

754
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,660
Li.

755
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,240
You're awake.

756
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,140
Lady Yunxi.

757
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,440
Jiang Yiqian

758
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,320
and Bai Yingsheng

759
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,030
are plotting against Lady Shanbao.

760
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,230
And that Wei Zhou too.

761
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,300
He and his neighbors

762
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,500
are working for them.

763
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,030
They also want to use Li

764
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,920
to blackmail you into helping them
coordinate their testimonies.

765
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,580
Where is Li?

766
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,420
Did she make it safely
to the tea plantation?

767
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,840
I'm sorry.

768
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,010
Xiangling is taking care of Li.

769
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,940
That's good.

770
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,420
By the way,

771
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,400
is the trial today?

772
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,840
I can testify.

773
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,190
I heard with my own ears

774
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,030
Bai Yingsheng and Jiang Yiqian's

775
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,760
conspiracy.

776
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,230
You risked your life

777
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,880
escaping from
the Provincial Governor's Office

778
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,280
just to tell me this?

779
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,840
I'm so sorry.

780
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,320
Before,

781
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,330
I believed the slander

782
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680
and that's why I hurt you.

783
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,920
If there's any way to make amends,

784
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,380
even at the cost of my life,

785
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,110
I am willing.

786
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,410
It seems I've underestimated you before.

787
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,030
With a father like you,

788
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,840
no wonder Li

789
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,100
called me a bad person.

790
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,060
I didn't teach her that.

791
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,640
Now is not the time for this.

792
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,400
I need to get to
the County Office quickly.

793
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,730
The fact that you're in my courtyard now,

794
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,360
don't you understand

795
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,690
what's really going on?

796
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,840
Based on my book collecting experience,

797
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,320
Bai Yingsheng's Song Dynasty edition

798
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,520
is the authentic one.

799
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,940
Good that you've admitted it.

800
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,480
What's going on here?

801
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,760
What does this mean?

802
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,150
What does she mean by that?

803
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,680
Lord Luo,

804
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,640
I wish to file charges against

805
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,370
Governor Jiang Yiqian of Linji

806
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,550
for corruption and perversion of justice,

807
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,810
for his personal gain,

808
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,210
persecuting the innocent,

809
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,230
and forcing the Wei family

810
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,280
to complete ruin.

811
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,670
Nonsense!

812
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:02,930
Rong Shanbao,

813
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,430
even though we have had our differences,

814
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,230
you cannot slander me like this.

815
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,440
I have never accepted

816
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,640
even a penny in bribes.

817
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,920
I am completely innocent

818
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,230
as heaven and earth can attest!

819
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,560
Lord Jiang, you may not have taken bribes,

820
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,290
but you're far from innocent.

821
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,960
The Wei family not only
ran a tea plantation,

822
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,900
but also built
a special tower to store books.

823
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,960
Lord Jiang has repeatedly

824
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,000
borrowed from the Wei family

825
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,920
precious manuscripts for printing.

826
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,280
However, "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

827
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,360
is the Wei family'
most treasured possession.

828
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,150
Lord Jiang requested
to borrow it 3 times

829
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,780
and was politely refused each time.

830
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,770
You were humiliated by the Wei family

831
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,960
and have harbored resentment toward them.

832
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,190
That's why you arbitrarily ruled that

833
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,650
Wei Kejian was a murderer.

834
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,570
When the Wei family continued to appeal,

835
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,280
you covered up your wrong judgment

836
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,900
by pressuring officials
to sentence the Wei family to death.

837
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,500
Any officials who disobeyed

838
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,070
were thrown into prison.

839
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,510
You also chose to ignore the fact

840
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,840
that Xu Song passed
a male corpse off as female

841
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,690
and and murdered witnesses

842
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,670
to silence them.

843
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,470
Even after the case was solved,

844
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,320
you still refused to spare Madam Yang.

845
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,580
You're slandering me!

846
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,110
These are all baseless accusations!

847
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,970
It's all false!

848
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,150
Lord Jiang, just now you

849
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,110
admitted with your own mouth

850
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,370
that this Song Dynasty edition
is authentic.

851
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,620
You personally gave this to Bai Yingsheng,

852
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,280
which serves as
self-incriminating evidence.

853
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,640
My Lord,

854
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,710
forgive me for my deception earlier.

855
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,570
This copy of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

856
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,010
was indeed given
to me by Lord Jiang Yiqian,

857
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,990
who instructed me
to implicate Lady Rong Shanbao.

858
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,480
Before this,

859
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
I had been staying
at the Provincial Governor's Office

860
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,060
actually to

861
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,670
collect evidence of Jiang Yiqian's crimes.

862
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,280
You're all in this together!

863
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,490
You're trying to frame me!

864
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,930
You're the murderers!

865
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,600
You are the ones
truly guilty of grave crimes!

866
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,270
What's going on?

867
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,950
Don't be afraid.

868
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,770
Everyone, please don't be afraid.

869
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,330
I am but a humble performer

870
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,100
skilled in the art of holding my breath
and feigning death.

871
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,310
Rong Shanbao.

872
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,320
What's going on?

873
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,630
My Lord,

874
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,360
I heard from Madam Yang

875
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,700
about the existence
of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku".

876
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,480
I later learned

877
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,670
that Lord Jiang
once requested it but was refused.

878
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,790
So when I discovered
this book was missing,

879
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,990
I became suspicious.

880
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,920
That's why I sent Bai Yingsheng

881
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,110
to Lord Jiang's side

882
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,570
to investigate the truth.

883
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,400
While searching for this book,

884
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,550
I learned from

885
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,610
an elderly clerk at the County Office

886
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,440
about the feud
between Jiang Yiqian and Wei Kejian.

887
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,300
I just lacked concrete evidence.

888
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,860
I knew Jiang Yiqian is narrow-minded

889
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,510
and has long seen me
as a thorn in his side.

890
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,040
That's why I set up this trap

891
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,510
to make Jiang Yiqian
produce evidence of his own crimes.

892
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,190
Now

893
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,590
we have both witness
and physical evidence.

894
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,580
Lord Luo, I request Your Lordship
thoroughly investigate

895
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,010
and arrest the true culprit

896
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,750
to avoid wronging innocent families

897
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,150
and perverting justice.

898
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,960
Jiang Yiqian has been
reckless in his actions

899
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,760
and brought harm to this region.

900
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,260
Guards!

901
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,070
Take him away!

902
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,480
My Lord, this is unjust!

903
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,630
My Lord!

904
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,710
Lord Luo, I've been wronged!

905
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,180
Lord Luo, this is unjust!

906
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,550
Lord Luo!

907
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,110
Lord Luo!

908
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,280
Rong Shanbao.

909
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,510
Although this case has hidden aspects,

910
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,230
your fabrication of a murder case

911
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,960
and mockery of this court
is also disrespectful.

912
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,360
I beg Your Lordship
to dismiss all those not involved.

913
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,960
I have something to tell you.

914
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,170
Everyone, withdraw!

915
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,920
All of you, go back.

916
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,630
That's enough.

917
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,360
Disperse now.

918
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,560
Go back. Hurry along.

919
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,760
Lord Lu.

920
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,840
Miss Rong.

921
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,970
What do you wish to tell me?

922
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,710
My Lord,

923
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,620
my gift to the Empress Dowager

924
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,590
is not merely

925
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,670
this precious
Song Dynasty book collection,

926
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,470
but the case behind these books.

927
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,370
Clean officials bring peace;
corrupt officials bring suffering.

928
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,020
The Empress Dowager and Emperor
bestow countless blessings,

929
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,150
yet with great power

930
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,300
comes both fortune and calamity.

931
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,950
Though I am but a commoner,

932
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,980
uninvolved in court politics,

933
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
I too wish for peace and prosperity.

934
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,530
My true gift

935
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,800
is to do what little I can

936
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,380
to remove corrupt officials

937
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,070
[Impartial Justice]

938
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,270
and preserve integrity in government.

939
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,630
I have indeed

940
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,490
underestimated the Rong family.

941
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,850
[Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku]

942
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,400
Is this book authentic?

943
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,320
I got this

944
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,030
from Wei Kejian before.

945
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,040
It's absolutely authentic.

946
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,760
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

947
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,170
[Why is "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"
so precious?]

948
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,000
is a large encyclopedia
from Southern Song Dynasty,

949
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,070
equivalent to today's encyclopedia.

950
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,400
The book contains

951
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,360
astronomy, geography,

952
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,320
poetry, health remedies,

953
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,840
and even food stories.

954
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,630
For example, Su Shi's Dongpo Pork

955
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,450
might have first appeared here.

956
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,550
It categorizes ancient wisdom

957
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,150
into over a hundred volumes.

958
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,350
Scholars can cite references from it.

959
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,510
Common people

960
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,270
can also learn some life hacks.

961
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,550
Unfortunately, most of the original books

962
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,920
have been lost.

963
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,030
The remaining parts

964
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,280
have become treasure maps

965
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,330
for studying ancient culture.

966
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,190
Even "Complete Tang Poems"

967
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,190
relies on it to fill in the gaps.
