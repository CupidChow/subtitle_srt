[Episode 12]

3
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,789
Since you've said you want to

4
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,710
be my wife,

5
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,580
will it last for one night,

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,789
one month

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,070
or a lifetime?

8
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,070
Well...

9
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,140
You're such a strange man.

10
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,430
As long as we're happy together,

11
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,120
why do you care whether it'll
last for one night, one month

12
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,030
or a lifetime?

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,120
Tea seeds
will be planted in a tea plantation.

14
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,579
No matter how skilled I am,

15
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,660
I still can't guarantee

16
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,910
every seed can grow into a tree
for plucking leaves.

17
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,630
As for how long we can be married,

18
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,400
even if I make a promise,
it still doesn't count.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,630
It's all up to fate.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,150
These words don't sound like
what a good person would say.

21
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,550
And I definitely won't
fall into your trap.

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
If you don't give me a definite time,

23
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,790
I'm sorry but I won't follow your order.

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,630
You're in the Xinfang Pavilion now.

Wen is here, too.

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,280
If you still disagree
despite all my coaxing,

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,870
do I have to force you?

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,329
If this doesn't work,
I can always find someone else.

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,070
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

Where have you been?

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,000
I woke up at midnight

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,480
that pine tree behind the courtyard

71
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,470

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,470
Unexpectedly...

73
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,409
Unexpectedly,
I fell asleep leaning against it.

I'm sorry
for being such a fool in front of you.

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,650
Just ignore him.

77
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,170
He always scolds whoever he meets.

78
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,180
He's suspicious and full of anger.

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,220
He's just taking it out on others.

81
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,460

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,310
He's dead.

86
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
Grandmother selected a husband for Shanbao

87
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,370
out of good intentions.

88
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,480
Besides,

89
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,070
the Yang family has been on friendly terms
with our family.

90
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,630
Even if Shanbao had been so picky that

91
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,760
she didn't like him,

92
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,870
she still should have treated him
with courtesy

93
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,390
and politely seen him off

94
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,070
in order to save face for both families.

95
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,390
However, Shanbao was so arrogant and rude,

96
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,560
treating her suitors
as if they didn't exist,

97
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,710
ordering them around

98
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,110
and offending everyone.

99
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,360
She agreed to the marriage herself

100
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,420
but changed her mind for some reason,

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,950
leaving Mr. Yang alone
in the bridal chamber.

102
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,409
That's why all this trouble
has been caused.

103
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,520
What nonsense are you talking, Yunyin?

104
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,510
Yang Dingchen occupied the Qilan Garden

105
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,549
and set the wedding date
without permission.

106
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,080
Did he inform Grandmother?

107
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,360
And did he get permission from anyone?

108
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,600
He was clearly a scoundrel,

109
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
who we couldn't hit or scold.

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,030
Couldn't we at least avoid him?

111
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,080
Since he came to the Rong family,

112
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,270
he has been domineering,
arrogant and jealous.

113
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,120
Every young master in the Xinfang Pavilion

114
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,790
was once

115
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,190
victimized by his plots.

116
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,240
He made too many enemies
and got poisoned to death.

117
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,100
He could blame no one but himself.

118
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,980
But he died in the Qilan Garden after all.

119
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,610
I'm afraid the Yang family

120
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,510
won't let us off so easily.

121
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,080
I've warned you before.

122
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,000
You rejected the one who was gentle,

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,550
modest, kind and generous.

124
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,920
Instead, you chose him.

125
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,280
No wonder trouble has occurred.

126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,450
Old Madam,
some men from the Yang family are here.

127
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,770
Grandmother, don't worry.

128
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,790

135
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,510
My father
suddenly heard about my cousin's death.

136
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,040
He was overwhelmed by grief

137
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,450
and lost his composure.

138
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,130
please forgive him.

Don't panic.

145

It's my fault

146
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,200
for not explaining this in advance.

147
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,510
Yitang and my late nephew

148
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,170
were actually twin brothers.

149
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,840
But when he was a kid,

150
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
he was adopted
into my branch of the family

151
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
and became my son.

152
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,390
The one who died
was his twin elder brother.

153
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,840
Everyone, don't panic.

154
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,030
Don't be afraid.

155

When Mr. Yang was a guest at our home,

156
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,480
he unfortunately passed away.

157
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,400
The Rong family
can't be absolved of the blame.

158
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
My condolences, Uncle Yang.

159
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,900
Let's discuss this further
inside the mansion.

Dingchen

161
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,000
was the most outstanding son
of our Yang family.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,130
His death cannot remain unexplained.

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,910
Under Lord Prefect's orders,
Magistrate Lang

164
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,750

Miss Rong, please allow it.

167
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,790
It seems to be a human footprint,

but only half of it remains.

169
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,610

00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,320
seek justice for you.

187
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,410
Just rest assured, my nephew.

188
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,150
I will definitely

189
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,000
seek justice for you.

190
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,440
How would you...

191
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,460
How would you expect me
to explain this to your...

192
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,190
After this incident,
I ordered servants to guard this place,

193
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,390
not allowing anyone to move the corpse,

194
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,520
so as to let the officials examine it.

195
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,910
As soon as the person I had sent
to notify the officials

196
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,770
just returned,

197
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,870
your sedan chair arrived.

198
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,350
My Lord, you came so quickly.

199
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,120
I bear a heavy responsibility

200
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,440
to protect the safety of the local people,

201
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,300
so it's my duty
to investigate the case personally.

202
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,320
My nephew!

203
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,180
Father! Father, you're an elder.

204
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,750
If you get so heart-broken for my cousin,

205
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,130
he would be unable to rest in peace.

206
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,990
Please take good care of yourself

207
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,810
so that you can take revenge
for my cousin.

208
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,300
He has passed away.

209
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,280
Master Yang, excessive grief is not good.

210
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Now that I am here,

211
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,000
I will certainly try to find the culprit

212
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,660
and seek justice for Mr. Yang.

213
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,680
Start examining it!

214
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,090
Father.

215
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,030
The coroner needs to examine the body.

216
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,560
It's not convenient
for outsiders to stay here.

217
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,760
Besides, Lady Rong Shanbao is delicate

218
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,610
and can't see such a scene.

219
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,440
You'd better go out first.

220
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,040
I'll watch over things here.

221
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,490
Jie You!

222
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,680
Yes!

223
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,600
Take our guests to the main hall for tea.

224
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

225
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,080
My Lord, please.

226
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,870
My Lord.

227
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,160
No rush.

228
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,840
How has Old Madam Rong
been feeling lately?

229
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,970
Since I took office,

230
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,080
I've been so busy with my work

231
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,550
and haven't had time to pay my respects.

232
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,750
I feel quite ashamed.

233
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,630
Now that I'm in the Rong Mansion today,

234
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,830
I must pay her a visit.

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,720
I'll...

236
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,640
show you the way, My Lord.

237
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,270
Thank you.

238
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,960
As per the routines, the County Office
needs to interrogate the servants.

239
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,200
which might cause some inconvenience.

240
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,360
Please allow it, Lady Rong Shanbao.

241
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,560
The inspection has been finished.

242
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,600
My Lord.

243
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,450
I'd like to have a word with my brother.

244
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,050
Could you let me do that?

245
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,920
Look.

246
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,510
Even the Sinan jade craftsmen

247
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,040
couldn't
tell these two pieces of jade apart.

248
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Back then, our mother said that

249
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
I was born only 15 minutes

250
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
later than you.

251
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,440
But because of these 15 minutes,

252
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,590
you became the official kiln porcelain
for protecting our house

253
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,310
while I became

254
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,030
the unpresentable counterfeit porcelain.

255
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,030
Everyone said

256
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,760
you were
the Yang family's most outstanding son.

257
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,110
However,

258
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,720
you're dead now.

259
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,350
You're dead now!

260
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
You're dead now!

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,720
It's so good that you're dead.

262
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,400
Just see

263
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,830
how I'll use your appearance

264
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,000
to inherit the family property

265
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,310
and use my own flesh and blood

266
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,570
to drink the wedding wine in place of you.

267
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,110
I will prove to everyone in the world

268
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,790
that I'm actually

269
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,250
the most outstanding son
of the Yang family.

270
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,960
My dear brother.

271
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,270
Mr. Yang

272
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,960
originally lived in the Xinfang Pavilion.

273
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,110
I'll take you both there to have a look.

274
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,480
Okay. Thank you.

275
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,400
What a big mansion!

276
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,160
It's truly the style of a great family.

277
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,920
Even heavenly palaces

278
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,400
could hardly be more magnificent.

279
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,200
Mr. Yang was truly unfortunate.

280
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,790
Mr. Yan.

281
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,190
Officers, this way, please.

282
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:32,710
Okay.

283
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,140
Look over there.

284
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,280
What's wrong with Mr. Lu?

285
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,460
He's sneaking around and is so secretive.

286
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,260
In my opinion,

287
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
Mr. Yang

288
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,200
must have been killed by him.

289
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,750
Shut up!

290
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,250
If the constables hear you,

291
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,860
you'll be wrongly accusing
an innocent man.

292
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,480
That magistrate
who came to Rong Mansion today...

293
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,270
What?

294
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,610
Do you know him?

295
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,910
He looks quite familiar.

296
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,480
But I...

297
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,230
But I just can't remember
where I've seen him.

298
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,750
Lord Lang

299
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,840
was promoted by Prefect Xu Song

300
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,880
to become the Magistrate of Chunning.

301
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,720
He sent his calling card here
several times

302
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,110
but was always turned away
by the Rong family.

303
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,920
Today, he could finally

304
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,450
use the investigation as an excuse

305
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,510
to insist on meeting my grandmother.

306
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,270
In the Chongxi Hall, he fawned on us

307
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,000
and tried every way
to ask for money and valuables.

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,930
His behavior is truly despicable.

309
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,640
Just now in the room,

310
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,290
did you find anything?

311
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,860
What are you...

312
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,610
The bloodstain
was in an inconspicuous place.

313
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,550
And only half of it remained.

314
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,350
Outsiders could hardly identify it.

315
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,200
But judging from the footprint,

316
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,500
this person wore shoes
with pointed toecaps

317
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,750
as well as flat and thin soles.

318
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,510
There were even patterns
carved into the wooden base.

319
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,310
It was such an intricate design.

320
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,880
This must belong to a woman.

321
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,350
Yang Dingchen
was highly skilled in martial arts

322
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,030
with incredible arm strength.

323
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,000
What kind of woman

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,110
could sneak into the mansion and kill him?

325
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,680
Besides,

326
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,310
many people
have carved patterns on their shoe soles.

327
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,320
Are we supposed to catch everyone
for comparison?

328
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
But this isn't an ordinary pattern.

329
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,200
My Lady! Lord Lang

330
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
summoned all young ladies
and young masters to see him.

331
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
He said
he would interrogate them in court.

332
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll look into it.

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,790
Grandmother gave him seven days
to investigate the case.

334
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,850
In the mansion, there will be constables
coming and going inevitably.

335
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,510
Your identity is still unclear,

336
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,400
and we also don't know
who your enemies are.

337
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,270
If you need anything,
just ask Jun Dai to do it.

338
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,940
Don't show yourself unnecessarily,

339
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,470
to avoid bringing trouble.

340
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,500
It's all my fault for being careless.

341
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,760
I didn't even notice such a small detail.

342
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,720
Did he really

343
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,580
not have that bodhi-bead bracelet on him?

344
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,110
Speaking of which,
this matter is so strange.

345
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,270
As soon as I got the message this morning,

346
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,160
I went there to search him.

347
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,560
But I truly didn't see it.

348
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,350
My Lady, do you think it might be...

349
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,960
Silence!

350
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,880
Yang Dingchen has done many evil things.

351
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,070
He deserved such an ending

352
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,440
due to his own deeds.

353
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,610
Mr. Yan, why do you have to
trouble yourself because of him?

354
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,200
Mr. Wen, please forgive me
for being outspoken.

355
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,310
People from the County Office came today.

356
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,160
They interrogated everyone

357
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,350
from the Xinfang Pavilion.

358
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,510
Only one person stayed in his room

359
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,640
without showing up.

360
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,310
He clearly has a guilty conscience.

361
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
In my opinion,

362
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,750
Mr. Yang

363
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,350
must have been killed by him.

364
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,160
If you continue to talk nonsense,

365
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,250
just get out of my sight,

366
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,980
and I won't keep you any longer.

367
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,950
I'm not a hereditary servant‌,

368
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,810
so I don't understand the etiquette
of a great family.

369
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,960
Young Master, you rescued me

370
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
from the pile of dead bodies.

371
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,810
Your kindness to me
is higher than the sky.

372
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,400
If Steward Lu really killed him,

373
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,890
he would harm you sooner or later.

374
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,350
How could I remain silent?

375
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,630
So you mean...

376
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,480
Lu Fusheng is the murderer?

377
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,880
Mr. Lu has helped you greatly

378
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
and is the loyalest and kindest person.

379
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
Don't listen to
this ignorant boy's nonsense.

380
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,030
He's still young and unsophisticated,

381
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,680
knowing nothing about importance.

382
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,940
Without any evidence,

383
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,270
we absolutely cannot
wrongly accuse an innocent person.

384
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,160
Mr. Wen! Mr. Wen!

385
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,900
Look at you. You keep talking nonsense.

386
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,310
You'll cause me trouble sooner or later.

387
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,270
One can't be kind
in a den of tigers and wolves.

388
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,280
Young Master,
just be careful and vigilant.

389
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,270
[Chongxi Hall]

390
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,070
One Yang died,

391
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,370
and another Yang has appeared.

392
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,570
This situation is truly frightening.

393
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,130
Yang Dingchen was unruly and rebellious,

394
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,780
like a wild beast
that had just been released from its cage

395
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,240
and was difficult to tame.

396
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,310
Though this young master looks similar,

397
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,230
his behavior is quite refined.

398
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,400
Routinely,
I need to ask you all young ladies

399
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
where you were at the time of the incident

400
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,930
and who can testify for you.

401
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,820
What a fool!

402
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,640
You...

403
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,350
Stop saying you.

404
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,590
You were summoned to the Rong family
to arrest the murderer.

405
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,320
But instead,

406
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,920
you mistook innocent people for suspects.

407
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,440
Where else could I be roaming
in the middle of the night

408
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,790
if I wasn't in my room?

409
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,070
Besides my personal maid,

410
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,330
where else could I find other witnesses?

411
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,960
Moreover,

412
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,340
I had no grudges against Yang Dingchen

413
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,030
and scarcely talked with him.

414
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,670
What benefit would I gain
from killing him?

415
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,790
Letting a foolish official like you
try the case

416
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,050
will only lead to wrongful convictions.

417
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,110
Lord Lang.

418
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,270
My cousin is straightforward

419
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,130
and outspoken.

420
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,030
She has offended you today.

421
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,160
Please forgive her

422
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,510
and don't mind it.

423
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,350
It's my fault
for trying the case improperly.

424
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,680
I've told you

425
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
we need to do the fortune-telling
for the wedding ceremony first

426
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,020
and get approval from our ancestors.

427
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,440
Mr. Yang

428
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,320
occupied our Qilan Garden
without permission.

429
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,790
Lady Shanbao ordered our maids

430
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,000
to withdraw completely.

431
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,480
We even gave him that courtyard.

432
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,540
That was already more than generous.

433
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,680
Even if something had gone wrong,

434
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,620
the Yang family's members
should be interrogated first.

435
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,850
They've been interrogated.

436
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,590
Young Master.

437
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,840
Lady Rong Shanbao hasn't returned yet.

438
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,790
Get lost!

439
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,770
All of you, get lost!

440
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,830
Last night, Yang Dingchen noticed that
Lady Rong Shanbao

441
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,540
still didn't return late at night.

442
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
He became furious

443
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,380
and drove away
all the Yang family's servants.

444
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,220
Lady Shanbao.

445
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,030
Lord Lang
isn't deliberately giving you a hard time.

446
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,070
Routinely,
everyone has to be interrogated.

447
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,530
Old Madam has agreed, too.

448
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,960
Since you all have a clear conscience,

449
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,840
What couldn't you tell others?

450
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,750
Xiangling.

451
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,640
Lord Lang hasn't interrogated you

452
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,550
in court.

453
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,640
That's already special treatment.

454
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,100
We'd better tell the truth

455
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,400
so that people won't say

456
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
we have a guilty conscience.

457
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,440
Lord Lang.

458
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,310
A few close friends of mine and I

459
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,240
held a tea party.

460
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,960
Yesterday,
it was my turn to host the party,

461
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,270
so I set up a tea banquet

462
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,680
in the Shanju Tea House.

463
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
We chatted under the moonlight,

464
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,970
enjoying tea and music.

465
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,830
We only returned at dawn.

466
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,880
Yunxi.

467
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,090
You're the owner of this tea house,

468
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,440
so you can say whatever you want,
can't you?

469
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,300
My tea house stays open all night,

470
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
specializing in
receiving aristocratic ladies‌

471
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,750
who enjoy night outings.

472
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,680
Many people in the city

473
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,920
can testify for me.

474
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,720
Yesterday, a servant from the greenhouse

475
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,790
suddenly came to report some good news,

476
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,880
saying that my rare epiphyllum
was about to bloom,

477
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,350
so I just invited Yunyin
to come and appreciate it.

478
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,900
We didn't leave until midnight.

479
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,750
Then we returned to our own rooms to rest.

480
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,480
Yunshu and I

481
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,070
went to the Yanyun Temple
to worship Buddha.

482
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,400
We listened to scriptures all day long

483
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,200
and closed our doors to rest early
after returning.

484
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
I suppose Yunshu did the same thing.

485
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,910
Alright.
Let's stop beating around the bush.

486
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,310
Am I the one who should be interrogated
most necessarily here?

487
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,270
Or it is Yunxi

488
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,480
or Yunshu?

489
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,550
All of you are trying to hide the truth

490
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,030
by making all kinds of excuses.

491
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,790
For whom are you putting on this show?

492
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,350
Fine.

493
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,680
Since none of you dare to ask,

494
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,640
then I'll ask.

495
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,160
Whose fiancé

496
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,830
is Yang Dingchen?

497
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,550
And in whose room did he die?

498
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,640
This is Lady Shanbao's order.

499
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Doctor Zhao has just changed it.

500
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,280
Young Master!

501
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,440
Mr. Lu!

502
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,310
B-Bad news!

503
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,960
Over there in the hall, Lord Lang

504
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,760
is...is interrogating Lady Shanbao
coercively.

505
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,980
Your identity is still unclear,

506
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,580
and we also don't know
who your enemies are.

507
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,980
Don't show yourself unnecessarily,

508
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,510
to avoid bringing trouble.

509
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,680
Did your young master tell you
to say this?

510
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,680
Mr. Lu.

511
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,270
The Yang family won't let this go.

512
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,890
And the officials keep interrogating her.

513
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,090
How can Lady Shanbao

514
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,640
accept this humiliation?

515
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,770
You need to find a way

516
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,680
to help her get rid of this plight.

517
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,880
I got it. You may go.

518
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,440
I...

519
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,430
Enough!

520
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,350
The young master already said he got it.

521
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,000
Why are you still pestering him?

522
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,350
You...

523
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,160
-Just go now!
-You need to find a way!

524
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,090
-Mr. Lu!
-Hurry!

525
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,350
Young Master,
Lady Shanbao repeatedly told you

526
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,300
not to show yourself unnecessarily.

527
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,720
This person is trying so hard
to stir up trouble outside.

528
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,320
He must have ill intentions.

529
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,230
I know.

530
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,550
Lady Shanbao has her own judgment.

531
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,680
Young Master,
please just eat your meal and don't worry.

532
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,080
The food is getting cold.

533
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,350
Young Master, won't you have your meal?

534
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,110
Young Master!

535
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,110
Shanbao.

536
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,890
I have trust in your moral character.

537
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,920
Let me just ask you one question.

538
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,580
Last night
should have been your wedding night.

539
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,920
Why did my nephew

540
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,800
die alone in the bridal chamber?

541
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,440
And where were you?

542
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
You should give me

543
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
and the Yang family an explanation.

544
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,480
What wedding?

545
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,440
Before getting married,
the couple must enter the ancestral hall

546
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,110
and pay respects to the ancestors
to complete the ceremony.

547
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,790
Without the elders' permission
or Lady Shanbao's consent,

548
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,480
he forcibly occupied the house
to hold a wedding.

549
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,030
How was he any different from a bandit?

550
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,880
You only know how to make things difficult
for Lady Shanbao.

551
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,270
There's someone even more suspicious,

552
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,200
who hasn't been interrogated yet.

553
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,000
Mr. Bai.

554
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,720
At 5 AM, Mr. Yan and I

555
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,150
saw you returning from outside
with our own eyes.

556
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,880
You claimed that

557
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,640
you had taken a walk
outside the Xinfang Pavilion.

558
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,110
But I noticed
that there was mud on your boots,

559
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,790
and there were several peach blossoms
in your hair.

560
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,310
You seemed to have returned
from the garden.

561
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,110
Mr. Wen, so you suspect that

562
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,750
I killed Mr. Yang?

563
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,680
In the martial arts arena,

564
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,720
everyone saw that my strength was so weak.

565
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
I was just lucky to survive.

566
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,370
How could I kill him?

567
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Moreover,

568
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,920
even after he died,

569
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,420
it wouldn't be my turn
to live in the Qilan Garden anyway.

570
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,880
Isn't Mr. Wen still there,

571
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,680
waiting for it eagerly?

572
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,840
Which fool would do such things

573
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,480
as working for someone else's benefit?

574
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,620
I didn't stay out all night.

575
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,030
Nor did I lie against my conscience.

576
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,960
As a scholar,

577
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,070
you tried to hide the truth
against your conscience like this

578
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,200
and said things inconsistent
with your thoughts.

579
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,400
Is this what the teachers have taught you?

580
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,160
Where on earth did you go

581
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,070
last night?

582
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
This is a murder case.

583
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,680
What can't you tell us?

584
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,070
Last night, he and I

585
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,560
were at the rockery
in the east corner of the garden,

586
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,160
gazing at stars and talking.

587
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,590
How dare you!

588
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,990
She admitted her own disgrace.

589
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,850
Yet you're still taking her side?

590
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,640
Yunshu, you're so pathetic.

591
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,160
As a daughter of the Rong family,

592
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,220
so what even if you had done it openly?

593
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,380
What kind of disgrace is this?

594
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,270
According to the age-old instructions
of the Rong family,

595
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,960
whoever dares to
hurt the Rong family's daughters

596
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,480
is trying to
cut off our family's bloodline.

597
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,540
No matter who he is,

598
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,790
we'll ensure
that his family property is all ruined

599
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,850
with no penny left.

600
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,290
Mr. He, you'd better think carefully.

601
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,500
At the tea party Yunxi hosted last night,

602
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,630
weren't you also a guest there, Mr. He?

603
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,280
Firstly,
you insulted my mother repeatedly.

604
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,210
And then you tried to fawn on Yunxi.

605
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,030
So only you're allowed to break promises,

606
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,750
but I can't find another better fiancé?

607
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,030
There's no such unfairness in the world.

608
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,750
Yunxi.

609
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,890
This is breaking a serious taboo.

610
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,790
Mr. He, you're so indecisive

611
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,920
and fickle-minded.

612
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,640
You've sown discord

613
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,400
between my two sisters

614
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,830
and broken the rules of the Rong family.

615
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,590
If Grandmother finds out about that,

616
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,880
the He family
definitely won't gain any benefit.

617
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,440
I advise you to back down

618
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,920
and avoid causing more trouble.

619
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,430
You forced me into this.

620
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,110
The family affairs among our sisters

621
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,550
can be discussed later.

622
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,510
Let's ask about
the important matters first.

623
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,270
Lady Shanbao,
we asked about your whereabouts just now,

624
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,130
but you were reluctant to answer.

625
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,160
Do you have something to hide?

626
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,940
I have nothing to hide.

627
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,770
I didn't fancy Mr. Yang,

628
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,400
and I was unwilling to
spend the weddning night with him,

629
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,960
so I simply stayed elsewhere last night.

630
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,000
Elsewhere?

631
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,720
Where exactly?

632
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,480
Whose place was it?

633
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,570
Even if I'm not asking,
they'll ask in court.

634
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,550
Shanbao.

635
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,880
If you didn't fancy Mr. Yang,

636
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,639
then who do you fancy?

637
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,080
Who did you spend the night with?

638
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,760
Young Master!

639
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,489
Young Master, you can't go!

640
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,560
Young Master!

641
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,360
Don't go!

642
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,820
You mustn't go!

643
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,500
You absolutely can't go!

644
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,880
I fell from a cliff
and was in a critical condition

645
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,150
while he became an official

646
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,350
and enjoyed success.

647
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,280
I can't believe
there was such a coincidence.

648
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,810
I'm afraid that was...

649
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,590
The Rong family only cares about
whether the daughters

650
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,850
respect their elders,

651
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,780
whether the sisters are united

652
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,040
and whether the family is prosperous.

653
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
It's up to you to choose who you love.

654
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,840
Unless you commit crimes

655
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,480
or disgrace the family's reputation,

656
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,190
otherwise,

657
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
the elders won't interfere.

658
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,020
Grandmother always commends you

659
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,540
for being sensible
and caring about the overall situation.

660
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,480
Now someone from the Yang family
has been killed.

661
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,550
All of us have revealed our whereabouts,

662
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,550
except you who keep hiding something.

663
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,280
Unless

664
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,470
your lover is a bandit or a thief,

665
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,840
and Mr. Yang was killed by him.

666
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,510
Tell us!

667
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,710
Don't give Lady Shanbao a hard time.

668
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,930
That person...

669
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,190
-That person is...
-Mr. Yan!

670
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,110
Was it you yesterday?

671
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,310
How dare you admit it?

672
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,840
I admit it.

673
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,800
Lady Shanbao, you and I were clearly

674
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,990
chatting, playing chess and painting
under the moonlight.

675
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,760
How come you refuse to admit it now?

676
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,020
What makes you think I'm unpresentable?

677
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,800
You...

678
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,910
You...

679
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,190
Magistrate Lang, what?

680
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,130
Do you know this man?

681
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,800
So you're

682
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,060
Lady Shanbao's lover?

683
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,840
No wonder!

684
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,550
Yesterday, I accompanied Lady Shanbao
to the tea mountain.

685
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,000
We only came down the mountain at 5 PM.

686
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,590
At 7 PM, we went boating
to enjoy the scenery.

687
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,460
When we returned home,

688
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,750
we heard the night watch drum
at the city gate strike twice.

689
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,070
Lady Shanbao complained
that my drawing had little likeness

690
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,800
on the boat,

691
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,380
so she asked me to redraw it in my room.

692
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,070
By dawn,

693
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,950
a maid came and reported the bad news.

694
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,150
Only then did Lady Shanbao
leave the Xinfang Pavilion.

695
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,710
Actually, regarding murderous intentions,

696
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,200
everyone here

697
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,500
is a suspect.

698
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,570
Why do you think we're suspects?

699
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,260
Lady Shanbao wanted to select a husband.

700
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,970
Without being selected, this person
didn't blame his own incompetence.

701
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,710
Instead, he was only jealous of others.

702
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,720
By framing me after killing Mr. Yang,

703
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,520
he could eliminate two enemies.

704
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,530
Moreover, the Rong family is wealthy.

705
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,980
Their tea mountains and silver
are so tempting.

706
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,000
If Lady Shanbao is charged with murder,

707
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,960
the substantial family property

708
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,560
will be inherited by others.

709
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,010
Guys, don't forget that

710
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,580
Mr. Yang was killed at midnight

711
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,380
and was only discovered at dawn.

712
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,420
Those who had left home
could return to kill him.

713
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,320
Those who met with each other
could collude in their statements.

714
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,150
Those who testify for their whereabouts

715
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,360
are all servants of the Rong family.

716
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,820
How can their testimonies

717
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,360
be easily trusted?

718
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,480
You're accusing

719
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,580
all of us at a stroke.

720
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,360
I've never said

721
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,220
you're the murderer, Lady Yunxi.

722
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,570
Why are you so angry?

723
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,220
You...

724
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,530
What we said is all not trustworthy.

725
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,500
Then the murderer of this case

726
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,570
can never be found.

727
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,190
Lord Lang!

728
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,630
The bloody footprint in the room

729
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,560
has been copied.

730
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,950
The County Office's painter
has complemented it, too.

731
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,960
This shoe sole is carved
with the five-poison patterns.

732
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,280
The craftsmanship is exceptional.

733
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,400
To solve this case,
please forgive my offense for asking

734
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,460
which lady of the Rong family
owns this cherished item.

735
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,550
No wonder you've gathered us all here

736
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,750
with all this gossip.

737
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,820
So it's about this?

738
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,750
I don't recognize it.

739
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,040
Everyone is watching.

740
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,970
Do you expect us
to take off our shoes for inspection?

741
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,330
The foot is 7.1 cun long.

742
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,000
It's not difficult to verify it.

743
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,800
Measurement is conducted every year

744
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,360
in our mansion to make shoes.

745
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
We can check the records to find out.

746
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,430
Lady Shanbao.

747
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,520
Thanks for your help then.

748
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,670
Xiu Qiong.

749
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,720
For the sake of fairness,

750
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,070
Lord Lang, please

751
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,900
dispatch two constables to accompany us

752
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,030
so that we won't be suspected anymore.

753
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,060
Lady Yunxi's worry makes sense.

754
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,480
Not only the young ladies
need to be examined,

755
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,710
but all female servants of the Rong family

756
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,970
must also be examined.

757
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,840
Mr. Lu.

758
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,510
I still have a few more questions

759
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,510
to ask you alone.

760
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,230
Please.

761
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,670
What?

762
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,030
-Go!
-Let go of me!

763
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,850
-Cut the crap!
-Let go of me!

764
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,880
You knew he was avoiding the officials
and constables everywhere.

765
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,270
He must have his reasons.

766
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,800
Why did you deliberately lure him
to come here?

767
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,070
Mr. Yan, you're such a gentleman

768
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,590
and are so honest and upright.

769
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,400
In your mind,

770
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,380
there are scarcely any villains
in this world.

771
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,590
But this man's background is suspicious.

772
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,920
His intentions are dubious.

773
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,030
With his evasiveness,
he's surely hiding some dirty secrets.

774
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,840
I've done this

775
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,550
because I'm worried
Shanbao might be harmed by a villain.

776
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,110
You've done this
for your own selfish motives.

777
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,760
Mr. Wen.

778
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,960
You weren't like this before.

779
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,440
When...

780
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,960
-Since when...
-All men have jealousy.

781
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,420
I'm not afraid to admit it.

782
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,710
I'm just worried

783
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,240
this man has ill intentions

784
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,090
and will harm Shanbao.

785
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,840
What are you doing?

786
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,500
Let go of me!

787
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,440
You guys may leave first.

788
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,340
So you want to kill me?

789
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,020
My Lord.

790
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,320
I finally found you.

791
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,680
Don't worry.

792
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,920
Those who entered the mansion today

793
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,180
are all my trusted men.

794
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,600
There will be no problem.

795
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,440
My Lord, you used yourself as the bait.

796
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,750
Indeed, you made Lady Rong Shanbao

797
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,880
take pity on you

798
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,090
and rescue you.

799
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,030
Later, as agreed, I sent some people

800
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,670
to wait in that Wukui Alley for 7 days,

801
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,200
but there was no sign of you.

802
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,030
I reckoned your injuries were too severe
to recover soon,

803
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,390
or the Rong family
was keeping a close eye on you,

804
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,840
making it difficult to send messages,

805
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,360
so I often sent people to scout
outside the mansion.

806
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,190
However, every time you left the mansion,

807
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,150
the Rong family's members
were always by your side.

808
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,010
My men was afraid of alerting them

809
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,000
and didn't dare to approach you.

810
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,590
Using myself as the bait?

811
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,850
So you mean...

812
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:20,870
My Lord.

813
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,550
You took the imperial order
to investigate the murder case

814
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,440
of Wei Kejian
beating and killing his wife, Madam Yang.

815
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,760
But the Rong family is powerful,

816
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,350
and Lady Rong Shanbao
is quite resourceful.

817
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,070
Xu Song repeatedly hindered you, too.

818
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,540
It was very difficult to handle this case.

819
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,150
You said, that page boy, Qing Yun,

820
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,710
often eavesdropped on our conversations.

821
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,190
He must have ill intentions behind this.

822
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,590
Therefore, you took the risk yourself

823
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,150
by secretly infiltrating into
the Rong family.

824
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,910
You also told me to take the opportunity
to defect to Xu Song.

825
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,770
Then we could collect evidence
both openly and secretly.

826
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,570
Have you forgotten everything?

827
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,330
My Lord!

828
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,360
If you die,

829
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,710
the great credit
for solving this major case

830
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,920
will belong to me.

831
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,550
Who told you

832
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,650
our lord was taking risks alone?

833
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,230
Under His Majesty's imperial edict,

834
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,250
I work as the magistrate superficially,
but actually, I'm the Imperial Inspector.

835
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,400
I'm telling you to open the coffin
and examine the corpse.

836
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,740
Anyone who dares to hinder it
is defying imperial orders.

837
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,320
My Lord,
you're not afraid of the powerful gentry

838
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,420
and refuse to shield your former allies.

839
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,480
You always recklessly
show your ability and talent.

840
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,680
But you might just get killed in the end.

841
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,130
Let's go! Hurry!

842
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,010
[Making Friends through Tea
and Treating People with Courtesy]

843
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,650
Routinely,
I need to ask you all young ladies

844
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,710
where you were at the time of the incident

845
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,240
and who can testify for you.

846
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,140
What a fool!

847
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:58,960
You...

848
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,640
Stop saying you.

849
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,880
Tea table etiquette

850
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,230
is an essential part

851
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,290
of Chinese tea culture.

852
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,710
[Unacceptable]

853
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,370
It embodies the traditional spirit
of making friends through tea

854
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,370
and treating people with courtesy.

855
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,410
The spout should not point at anyone.

856
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,190
The teapot spout

857
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,570
should face a space empty of people

858
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,340
to avoid suggesting guests should leave.

859
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,900
Never flip the cup lid upside down.

860
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,630
Do not touch tea pets casually.

861
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,020
The decorations on the tea table

862
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,300
can only be played with
under the host's guidance.

863
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,370
Avoid tapping cups or scraping saucers
to express dissatisfaction.

864
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,400
Do not repeatedly fiddle with tea leaves.

865
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,100
The first serving of tea
should not be refused.

866
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,500
We need to repsect the tea etiquette.
