Miss Xiu Qiong.

4
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,380
Don't throw them away.

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
These are all Mr. Lu's
treasured possessions.

6
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,430
I don't care about any Mr. Lu

7
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,150
or whoever.

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Go burn these things somewhere far away.

9
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,460
Don't dirty the Rong family's property.

[Hualin Courtyard]

11
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,560
Lady Shanbao isn't receiving visitors.

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Please leave now.

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,200
Mr. Lu has risked his life

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
for Lady Shanbao

15
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,480
many times.

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Surely that counts for something.

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
To hastily drive him away

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,880
based on a few slanderous words—

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,340
isn't that too heartless?

20
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,800
Mr. Bai,

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Lady Shanbao is not a rash person.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
When I was imprisoned before,

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,930
no one could save me.

24
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,150
Mr. Lu came to my aid in that crisis.

25
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,480
How righteous was that?

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,470
Could he do something

27
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,650
as terrible as abandoning
his wife and child?

28
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,710
I don't believe it.

29
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,840
No matter what you say,

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,130
I still won't believe it.

31
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,990
I'll go find him

32
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,450
and get to the bottom of this.

33
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,650
I advise you not to go.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,460
Mr. Bai, you're due for
the imperial exams next year.

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:35,960
Today is your

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,470
day to return to the academy.

37
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,310
Old Madam Rong said

38
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,190
you must earn an official title

39
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,190
to be worthy of Lady Yunshu in the future.

40
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,560
If you

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,910
speak up for this criminal today,

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,190
aren't you afraid of angering Old Madam

43
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,320
and ruining your promising marriage?

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,079
He makes sense.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,040
No need for you. I'll go find him myself.

46
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,000
Yan Bailou, you're so confused.

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,710
A true man knows
what to do and what not to do.

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,400
You know that woman's
origins are suspicious

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,280
and Mr. Lu might be wrongfully accused.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,430
How can you abandon and ignore him

51
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,030
because of your jealous, selfish heart?

52
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,030
What you're doing

53
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,920
truly violates the way of a gentleman.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,250
I cannot agree with you.

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,490
Mr. Yan, wait for me.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,450
I'll go with you.

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,800
Don't.

58
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,079
If you go,

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,430
you'll only increase
Old Madam's resentment

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,090
and make the situation worse.

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,750
Return to the academy as planned.

62
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,960
I will certainly find him

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
and send you word.

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,250
Don't worry.

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,960
If he's truly innocent,

66
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,010
who would deliberately frame him?

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,050
How foolish.

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,430
Lady Shanbao, that Mr. Yan

69
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,310
seems to be a gentleman.

70
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,680
My cousin has become
increasingly narrow-minded.

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,740
I've sent several letters to my uncle

72
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,350
but received no reply so far.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,910
I fear my aunt is
intentionally blocking them.

74
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,040
Send someone to Ningzhou with a letter

75
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,560
to urge the Wen family
to come pick him up soon.

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,030
Yes.

77
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,160
Go.

78
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,100

-Father, have some cake.
-Please try it.

81
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,410
Father, this cake is delicious.

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,600
-Have some cake, Father.
-Father.

83
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,159
Just one bite.

84
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,720
This cake is really tasty.

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,270
-Have some cake.
-Have some cake.

-Father.
-Father.

87
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,270
This cake is so delicious.

88
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,830
Just take one bite, Father.

89
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,270
-Father.
-Father.

90
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,410
Mr. Lu, please have some tea.

91
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,270
Mr. Lu.

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,160
Mr. Lu?

93
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,070
Come.

94
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,240
You may go now.

95
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,870
Thank you, sir.

96
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,090
Get out quickly.

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,830
Let's go.

98
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,040
Kill him!

99
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,460
Take him away.

100
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,920
Young Master, you've suffered.

101
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,800
How did you know

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,260
I had men waiting outside?

103
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,750
Who do you think Lady Shanbao is?

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,520
She's not easily fooled.

105
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,630
When you tapped me lightly during the day,

106
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,080
I knew exactly what was happening.

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,870
It was a trap to catch them all.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,160
That's hard to say.

109
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,920
When you were young,

110
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,390
you traveled to study in many places.

111
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,830
You lived at Dongquan Academy
in Qingzhou for a whole year.

112
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,950
Whether you deceived someone
into marriage and had children

113
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,210
is difficult to verify

114
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,610
with such great distance.

115
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,740
That's impossible.

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,120
I have extremely high standards

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,630
and even higher ambitions.

118
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,320
I must find one
who satisfies me in every way.

119
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,660
Otherwise, I'd rather remain alone forever

120
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,860
than settle for less

121
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,690
and end up despising each other.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,250
Rushing into marriage
only to regret it later

123
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,640
is something I absolutely would never do.

124
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,040
So, which one have you set your sights on?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,480
Move!

126
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,480
Hurry!

127
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,490
Lady Shanbao,

128
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,720
I need to borrow the Rong family's prison.

129
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,290
I want to interrogate them myself.

[Rong Mansion]

131
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,480
I am a clerk from the prefectural office!

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,160
How dare you privately imprison
an official of the Prefect!

133
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,490
Lord Xu won't spare you!

134
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Let me out! Let me out now!

135
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,360
Servants who plot to kill their masters

One causing grave injury to their master

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,680
first receives 100 strokes,

139
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,310
then be exiled to three thousand li away.

140
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,240
As a clerk,

141
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,510
conspiring with others
to harm your superiors

142
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,950
is an even more serious crime.

143
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,560
I was planning
to deal with current matters

144
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
before settling old scores.

145
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,790
But you've delivered
yourself to my doorstep.

146
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,950
First, 100 strokes. Then we'll talk.

147
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't know any of you.

148
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
You bunch of bandits!

149
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,390
I know nothing about what you're asking!

150
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,720
You could beat me to death
and get nothing!

151
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,010
With such solid evidence,

152
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
why would I need to interrogate you?

153
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,630
Since you hid
in the Prefect's Government Office

154
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,470
the one secretly committing murder

155
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,130
must be Xu Song without doubt.

156
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,240
Though he has some friction with me,

157
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,570
it wouldn't lead to risking
the murder of an imperial envoy.

158
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,620
Unless...

159
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,850
he is deeply implicated
in the old Wei family case.

160
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,180
When he heard about
opening Madam Yang's coffin,

161
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,270
he became completely distraught

162
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,110
and committed murder.

163
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,940
As I suspect,

164
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,080
the previous magistrates

165
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,790
also...

166
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,720
lost their lives at his hands.

167
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,170
After he receives 100 strokes,

168
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,790
give him one bowl of plain congee a day

169
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,960
to keep him alive.

170
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,160
The 3,000 cuts at the execution ground

171
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,180
are still waiting for him.

172
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,220
I'll talk! I'll tell everything!

173
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,030
It was Lord Xu who ordered me

174
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,390
to commit these terrible deeds!

175
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,120
My Lord, spare my life! My Lord!

176
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
It was Lord Xu who made me

177
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,030
commit these heinous crimes!

178
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,720
My Lord!

179
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,030
Young Master,
this villain is cruel and vicious.

180
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,430
We can't let him off easy.

181
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,600
I'll come every day

182
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,130
to give him 30 or 50 strokes,

183
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
just not letting him die.

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,960
It's just that I

185
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
am wholeheartedly devoted to your plans

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,320
and would brave any danger for you.

187
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,150
If you're reinstated
to your official position in the future,

188
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,810
please don't leave me behind.

189
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,890
Don't worry. I'll keep it in mind.

190
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,550
When people arrive from the capital,

191
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,810
that's when both sides will truly clash.

192
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,010
The most urgent matter now

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,680
is still to find Madam Yang.

194
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,480
[Linji Prefectural Office]

195
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,150
How could a living person

196
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,120
just disappear?

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Search.

198
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,450
Turn Linji upside down if you have to.

199
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,720
Alive or dead, I must see the body!

200
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,320
Yes.

201
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,750
Your Lordship appreciates Clerk Qing's

202
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,610
loyal service,

203
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,240
naturally bestowed him generous rewards

204
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,790
and exceptional promotion.

205
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,200
But he rose from humble origins

206
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
and lacks foresight.

207
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,550
That person is now
hiding in the Rong family.

208
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,790
We need a foolproof plan

209
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,650
to lure him out,

210
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,380
so we leave no evidence

211
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,520
and eliminate the threat completely.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,860
If he acts hastily out of anxiety,

213
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,780
I fear he might alert our target,

214
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,840
implicating Your Lordship

215
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,510
and causing endless trouble.

216
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,870
Useless fool!

217
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,670
The Rong family.

218
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,560
It's the Rong family again!

219
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
During my time in office,
I've benefited this region.

220
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,840
Receiving some tribute from tea merchants

221
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,870
is only proper.

222
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,030
But this Rong family
refuses to show respect.

223
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,910
Every year, leading those ignorant

224
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,110
mountain folk to cause trouble with me,

225
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,640
even daring to attack
the imperial tax officers—

226
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,080
they show me no regard at all!

227
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,770
Brilliant.

228
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,580
A perfect hiding place.

229
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,510
If he dares to reveal his identity,

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,000
it will give us the perfect excuse.

231
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,890
I can then uproot the entire Rong family

232
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,570
and eliminate the threat forever.

233
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,870
How wise, My Lord.

234
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,790
Didn't she say she was only
going to check the shop?

235
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,590
Why isn't Lady Shanbao back yet?

236
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
Indeed.

237
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,450
It's getting late.

238
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,220
Young Master.

239
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,990
The

240
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,730
rain outside is too heavy.

241
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,270
Young Master, Lady Shanbao is back.

242
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,670
Quickly, go inside.

243
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
There's been constant thunder

244
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,050
and relentless rain these days.

245
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,370
How dare you
go up the mountain in such weather?

246
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,170
Are you trying to risk your life?

247
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,080
It's been raining heavily
for a day and night.

248
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,720
Seeing that the rain wasn't letting up,

249
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
I was worried something
might happen to the tea plantation,

250
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,940
so I rushed there to check.

251
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,980
I still need to go to Chongxi Hall.

252
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,170
-Take it.
-Go in.

253
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,110
Change into dry clothes before we talk.

254
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,550
Xiu Qiong, have someone
prepare water quickly.

255
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,510
Lady Shanbao needs to bathe.

256
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,400
She's caught a chill.

257
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,440
Also, call for a physician

258
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,750
to prescribe medicine
to induce sweat and drive out the cold.

259
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,810
I'll go right away.

260
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,150
Jun Dai,

261
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,440
there's freshly brewed
ginger tea in the tea room.

262
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Go get it quickly.

263
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,820
If this rain doesn't stop,

264
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,330
can the tea plantation hold up?

265
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,480
The two tea plantations
at the foot of the mountain are flooded.

266
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,680
Along the riverbank,

267
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,910
many tea seedlings in the flatlands

268
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,370
have been washed away too.

269
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,550
Fortunately, I prepared early

270
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,390
and had people
raise the embankment beforehand,

271
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,790
so it's still holding up.

272
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,080
But if this rain doesn't stop soon,

273
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
forget about the autumn tea—

274
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,240
even next year's tea supply

275
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,370
will be in jeopardy.

276
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,030
The Rong family's
responsibility is immense,

277
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,890
and Lady Rong has invested so much
in nurturing you.

278
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,870
You refuse to fail
everyone's expectations,

279
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,870
never uttering a word of complaint,

280
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,270
always exerting yourself a hundredfold.

281
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,070
Even ten men could not match you.

282
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,360
I deeply admire you

283
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,910
and know I can't stop you,

284
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,920
but I have some heartfelt words to say.

285
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,140
No matter how capable you are,

286
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,120
you're still made of flesh and blood.

287
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,240
You can't possibly
handle everything in the world.

288
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,900
Others don't know your heart;

289
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,360
they'll only resent you
for being power-hungry

290
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,290
and autocratic.

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,510
Who will feel grateful or remember

292
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,370
your kindness?

293
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,730
Even if you risk your life,

294
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,360
you may not escape sisters turning distant

295
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,090
or petty people betraying you.

296
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,860
I don't need their gratitude.

297
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,190
But do you know there are
people who care about you?

298
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,510
I shouldn't interfere in this matter.

299
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,640
Once I get involved,

300
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,480
you'll surely suspect
I have ulterior motives.

301
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,010
But today I must intervene.

302
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,120
You only know how to
cultivate and rescue tea,

303
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,480
but you don't know how to manage people.

304
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,910
I manage thousands of mu
of tea plantations.

305
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,960
How could I not know how to manage people?

306
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,000
Then do you know
how to govern people's hearts

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,270
and make your sisters

308
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,750
behave properly and work together
in the future?

309
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,330
I do have a solution,

310
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,800
but I need you to agree to one condition.

311
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,440
What is it?

312
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,500
When two people spend every day together,

313
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,240
even if as close as lips and teeth,

314
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,440
there will inevitably
be friction and stumbles.

315
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,510
If I make mistakes in the future

316
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,000
and upset you,

317
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,610
please remember all my good deeds today

318
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,740
and forgive me once.

319
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,010
You can't hate me or resent me,

320
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,630
and especially can't ignore me.

321
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,250
Fine. I agree.

322
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,270
Is the tea plantation

323
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,800
really that easy to manage?

324
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,530
There are countless traps and troubles.

325
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,990
Just let go a little first,

326
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,349
let her feel smug

327
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,790
and do as she pleases.

328
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,280
After a month or two,

329
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,250
when she's suffered enough setbacks
and shown her weakness,

330
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,180
then you'll see.

331
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Put it there.

332
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,450
Usually by this time,

333
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,720
Lady Shanbao would have come to report.

334
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,050
Today is quite strange.

335
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,920
Hurry up and check on her.

336
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,070
How dare she keep Grandmother waiting?

337
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,640
Yes.

338
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,440
Don't worry, Grandmother.

339
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,830
The mountain path
is difficult in this heavy rain.

340
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,750
Lady Shanbao must have
been delayed by something.

341
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,210
She'll be here any moment.

342
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,880
Sorry I'm late, Grandmother.

343
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,290
The wheels got stuck in the mud,

344
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,400
so I had to walk down the mountain.

345
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,940
Fearing the dampness on me was too heavy

346
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,030
and might alarm you,

347
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,030
so I went to clean up and change first.

348
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,630
How is the plantation doing?

349
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,030
The rain is too heavy.

350
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,920
Many tea seedlings were washed away.

351
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,750
Fortunately,
we reinforced the embankments in advance,

352
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,110
saving all the plantations
at the foot of the mountain.

353
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,720
But if this downpour continues,

354
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,920
the waterlogged tea seedlings
will easily die.

355
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,970
If the old tea trees
soak for several more days,

356
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,240
we won't be able
to harvest the autumn tea,

357
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,040
and next year's tea will also...

358
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,110
She must have caught a chill in the rain.

359
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,640
Lady Shanbao looks unwell.

360
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,550
It's better not
to go up the mountain tomorrow.

361
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,550
Exposure to wind and rain
will add more chill—

362
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,480
wouldn't that only make you worse?

363
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
That won't do.

364
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,870
Grandmother,

365
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
if the mountain tea plantation
suffers damage,

366
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,310
it would be a devastating loss.

367
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,090
If this heavy rain
continues for two more days,

368
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,550
I fear mud and stones
will slide down the mountain.

369
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,920
I must go to properly
manage the situation.

370
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
We need to recruit
more workers below the mountain

371
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,960
to repair the river embankments.

372
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,560
How can it be done without me?

373
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,590
Doesn't Linji

374
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,120
have heavy rain every year?

375
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,270
The tea plantation has
survived in the past years.

376
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,200
What? Without you for just one day,

377
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,670
will the plantation
face a great disaster?

378
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,430
Shanbao,

379
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,990
everyone knows you're
in charge of the tea plantation.

380
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,850
Even if you don't go for a few days,

381
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,790
who could possibly take away

382
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,790
your authority?

383
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,070
How improper.

384
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,830
If you dare speak nonsense again,

385
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,160
you'll be kneeling in the ancestral hall.

386
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,000
We need to reinforce the embankments,

387
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,750
clear the flooded tea fields,

388
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,720
and take care of
the tea plantation on the mountain.

389
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,030
Major tea merchants from all over

390
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,960
are also arriving in Linji
one after another,

391
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,160
all waiting for the autumn tea harvest.

392
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,170
No matter how capable Shanbao is,

393
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,130
even with three heads and six arms,

394
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,420
she couldn't manage it all without rest.

395
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,350
Yunyin was worried seeing this,

396
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,110
and spoke harshly
in the heat of the moment.

397
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,240
Shanbao wouldn't take offense at all.

398
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,000
Yunyin just wants to help you.

399
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,790
That's an exaggeration.

400
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,590
If she's not
at the newly opened plantation

401
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,520
on the mountain,

402
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,550
the workers below
will neglect their duties

403
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,960
and delay important matters.

404
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,830
Although you

405
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,830
all manage teahouses and estates,

406
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,830
and your skills
in management and accounting

407
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,690
are quite good,

408
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,160
your expertise in tea processing

409
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
is insufficient.

410
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,920
After flooding,
tea plants easily become diseased.

411
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,850
Which one of you could replace her?

412
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,750
That breathing doesn't sound right.

413
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,210
Quick, feel her forehead.

414
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,160
It's burning hot.

415
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,640
Lady Shanbao has a fever
and you didn't even know.

416
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
Has a doctor checked on her?

417
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,820
Lady Shanbao insisted on coming to report.

418
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,830
I couldn't stop her.

419
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,750
A chill invading the body
can be minor or severe.

420
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,830
Those who are usually healthy

421
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,680
often get hit the hardest
when they fall ill.

422
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,410
Rest at home for two days first.

423
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,460
As for the tea plantation,

424
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,750
leave it for now to Yunxi

425
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,950
and Yunyin to manage.

426
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,760
I blame my body for being so weak.

427
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,260
Sisters, I have to trouble you

428
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,580
to share my burdens.

429
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,720
Water.

430
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,300
Water.

431
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,330
Come.

432
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
Has the rain stopped?

433
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,960
The wind and thunder have ceased.

434
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,360
The rain has stopped too.

435
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,240
Now you don't have to worry
about your tea trees

436
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,700
being washed away, do you?

437
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,200
Take it easy.

438
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,270
Even if you weren't pretending to be ill,

439
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,240
you wouldn't be getting up
tomorrow anyway.

440
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,740
The doctor has already said,

441
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,640
you've taken three doses of medicine

442
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,900
but still can't sweat.

443
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,660
The cold has penetrated from outside

444
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,590
into your lungs.

445
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,150
You'll really have to go up the mountain.

446
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,910
To lie in the rear mountain cemetery.

447
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,360
You know,

448
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,690
you'd better recover quickly.

449
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,210
Otherwise I'll take an axe

450
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,710
and chop down your Tea King Tree myself.

451
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,710
You wouldn't dare.

452
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,850
But...

453
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,010
I can't stop worrying.

454
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,010
When I was young, my cousins bullied me
for not having a mother.

455
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,150
I beat them until
they cried for their parents.

456
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,230
Later my father died too,

457
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
and my uncles and elder cousins

458
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,060
came to fight over the estate.

459
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,800
I sold and gave away my meager fields.

460
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,790
They thought

461
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,650
they had gained a huge advantage.

462
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,240
When I passed the imperial exam
and became an official,

463
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,550
these opportunists

464
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,620
were scared out of their wits.

465
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,200
They offered back
the fields and properties

466
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,400
and were willing to be servants
just to seek forgiveness.

467
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,110
You see them as closest sisters,

468
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,600
so to you they are family.

469
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,410
If you disregard that kinship,

470
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,830
those people are worthless.

471
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,980
The Rong family wasn't like this before.

472
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,400
Sisters and brothers
were raised together from childhood,

473
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,880
with no distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate,

474
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,940
and no separation between branches.

475
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,730
Men and women knew their roles,

476
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,200
and the women would

477
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
take care of the children together.

478
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,110
The children could hardly
tell birth mother from aunt—

479
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,270
after all, they all called them Mother.

480
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,870
It doesn't matter
who's the biological child.

481
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,610
When the younger generation grew up,

482
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,480
they would elect
the smartest one to take charge.

483
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,610
Sisters would support each other

484
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,970
through thick and thin.

485
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,990
I don't know when it started,

486
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,040
but everything suddenly changed.

487
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
The men in the family
gradually adopted outside customs,

488
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,110
desiring imperial exams,
taking concubines.

489
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,720
The family developed distinctions between
legitimate and illegitimate lines.

490
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,850
Everyone wanted their own household.

491
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,200
For wealth and favor,

492
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,720
they valued profit over righteousness and
put self-interest above the common good.

493
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,580
The family spirit was corrupted.

494
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,950
What strange custom is this?

495
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,840
I've never heard of such a thing.

496
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,190
And what happened later?

497
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,880
Be quick about your work.

498
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,510
The rain has stopped,

499
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
but this work can't stop.

500
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,830
Why are you dawdling? Hurry up.

501
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,920
Can't you see the tea trees

502
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,830
have all been washed askew
by the heavy rain?

503
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,070
If the roots are damaged,

504
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,520
they won't recover next year.

505
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,510
Hurry and get people
to straighten them and add soil.

506
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,910
Lady Shanbao instructed

507
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,000
to gather hands first to clear the ditches

508
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,740
and drain all the standing water
from the plantation.

509
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,600
Too much water will rot the roots.

510
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,610
Don't use her name to pressure me.

511
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,980
Now I'm in charge of this plantation.

512
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,040
All the tasks I've assigned,

513
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,920
I will personally inspect tomorrow.

514
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,240
If there is even one thing

515
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,200
that doesn't meet my expectations,

516
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,240
it will be your fault

517
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,900
for being lazy and deceitful.

518
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,270
Then you won't need to manage
the plantation anymore.

519
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,000
Just pack your things and leave.

520
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,730
Lady Yunyin,

521
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm not trying to shirk my duties.

522
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,750
I truly can't manage it all.

523
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,550
Workers have been sent downhill
to build embankments.

524
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,270
The plantation needs
both dredging and replanting.

525
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,600
We don't have enough people at the moment.

526
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,300
Don't think you can fool me
because I'm young.

527
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,790
This area hasn't suffered from
floods or droughts for a century.

528
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,640
The tea plantation has always
enjoyed favorable weather.

529
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,960
My family just donated money
three months ago

530
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,830
to help the government
raise the embankments.

531
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,590
Now the heavy rain just stopped—

532
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,650
what embankments
are you fixing now?

533
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,680
Someone must be seeking glory

534
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,720
and embezzling money,

535
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,790
making up excuses

536
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,880
and deliberately fabricating lies!

537
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,310
Bring me the ledger
for the embankment repairs.

538
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,710
I will inspect it myself.

539
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,270
And call back the people

540
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,960
who are working on the embankments.

541
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
First straighten
and fertilize the tea trees.

542
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,000
Then check for
plant diseases after the rain.

543
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,110
Anyone who dares to be negligent or whine

544
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,170
will receive lashes of the iron whip!

545
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,400
All of you, stop for now.

546
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,660
Do as Lady Yunyin says.

547
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,750
I'll go down the mountain to get help.

548
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,510
Shouldn't we wait
for the soil to dry a bit?

549
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,310
Exactly.

550
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,440
The water isn't fully drained,
and the soil is too wet.

551
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,830
If we mound it now,

552
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,690
it could suffocate the tea roots.

553
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,110
The new boss is riding us hard.

554
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,330
Feels like we're walking on coals.

555
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,610
I've checked all over the plantation.

556
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,590
Dozens of tea trees

557
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,050
were knocked in this area.

558
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,710
Other areas are fine though.

559
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,680
With some repairs and tidying up,

560
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,590
the autumn tea harvest should be safe.

561
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,440
I'm going to meet the tea merchant soon.

562
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,770
You stay
and keep an eye on the plantation.

563
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,550
Alright.

564
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,760
Why get angry at a mere servant?

565
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,440
Aren't they deliberately
trying to provoke me?

566
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Bringing back such a bunch

567
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,840
of unruly troublemakers

568
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,530
who oppose me at every turn.

569
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,720
They're clearly building up
someone else's authority.

570
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,550
Someone, for the sake of

571
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,000
gaining a reputation
for respecting talent,

572
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,440
has allowed these lowly servants
to forget their place.

573
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,110
If the servants don't listen to you,

574
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,960
just drive them down the mountain.

575
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,720
It's not worth getting upset over.

576
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
You'd only cheapen your own status.

577
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,830
Focus on doing your work now,

578
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,030
so that Grandmother can see

579
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,310
that among the ten fingers,

580
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,830
the one that seemed long
isn't necessarily the longest,

581
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,290
and the one that seemed short
isn't necessarily the shortest.

582
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,070
Only when she falls will you
have the chance to stand out.

583
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,470
Let her stare helplessly
and stew in anger.

584
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,750
How difficult can tending tea trees be?

585
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,270
I grew up in the Rong family,

586
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,880
listening to Grandmother's
teachings every day

587
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,940
until my ears were calloused from it.

588
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,930
Just because Rong Shanbao can do it

589
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,690
doesn't mean others can't.

590
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,170
Don't worry.

591
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,030
The tea plantation will be

592
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,760
put in order within seven days.

593
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,680
It absolutely won't delay

594
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,010
the autumn tea harvest.

595
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,830
I've traveled from afar

596
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,760
to come to Linji.

597
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,440
Unfortunately, I knew no one

598
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,920
and had no connections.

599
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,880
I couldn't even meet

600
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,940
Lady Rong Shanbao.

601
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,480
Lady Yunxi, thanks to
your kind arrangement,

602
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,340
this large deal can be concluded.

603
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,690
I'm truly grateful beyond words.

604
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,000
This humble gift
is but a small token of respect.

605
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,830
I hope you will present it to Lady Rong

606
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
to express my sincerity.

607
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,560
Master He, your generosity

608
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,320
is too much for me to accept.

609
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,170
For the first autumn white dew tea,

610
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,660
the He family
arrived in Linji a month early.

611
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,570
With such sincerity and earnestness,

612
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
how could I not fulfill your wishes?

613
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,070
I'll report to Grandmother upon my return,

614
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,350
and good news will come within days.

615
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,690
Please go back and wait at ease.

616
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,830
Alright.

617
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,500
Lady Yunxi, please have some tea.

618
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,830
My Lady,

619
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
I heard that the He family

620
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,150
started as river pirates

621
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,510
and only later went into the tea business.

622
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,720
Lady Shanbao thinks
they're not presentable

623
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
and won't let them through the door.

624
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,830
How pedantic.

625
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,790
One can't stick rigidly to rules
in business.

626
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,390
Whether merchant or pirate,

627
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,480
they're bringing real money,

628
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,180
and there are guarantors.

629
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,030
We just sell tea

630
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,130
and ask no more.

631
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,200
Yes.

632
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,440
Let's go take a look at Lotus Lane.

633
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,880
Take a look.

634
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,790
Sweet and delicious pastries.

635
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,750
Be good, Li.

636
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,200
Here.

637
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,480
Here's your tea.

638
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,110
Thank you.

639
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,480
Excuse me,

640
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,440
we'd like some tea here.

641
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,270
Little bird.

642
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,150
Your tea.

643
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,230
Bitter,

644
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,520
and a bit astringent.

645
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,650
Bi.. Bitter?

646
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,490
I specially improved it.

647
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,389
The first brew does
have some mixed flavors,

648
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,500
but with the second brew,

649
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,360
you'll taste the roasted rice aroma.

650
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,159
Wait a moment.

651
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,510
I specially saved some magnolia tofu

652
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,370
in the ice bucket in the back yard.

653
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,620
Wait for me.

654
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,860
I'll be right back.

655
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,020
Be good, Li.

656
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,550
Play with her for a while.

657
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,360
You can only eat it in small bites.

658
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,230
If you behave,

659
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,880
I will give you this.

660
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,800
Okay?

661
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,400
In a few days,

662
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,320
I'll buy you again

663
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,730
these delicious candied hawthorns.

664
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,250
Okay?

665
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,929
Li'er is so good.

666
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,190
My Lady, they've left.

667
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,160
Let's go back.

668
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,510
She's one with sky-high standards,

669
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,000
picking over the gentlemen's

670
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
looks and wealth,

671
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,630
and none meets her approval.

672
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,560
Who would have thought she'd fancy

673
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,940
someone from a lowly household,

674
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,390
untalented in both civil and martial arts,

675
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,190
and a widower with a child?

676
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,280
A man who brings misfortune
to his mother and wife.

677
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,060
He'll never be accepted
into the Rong family.

678
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,290
No wonder they need to be secretive

679
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,420
and meet in private.

680
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
The fever has lasted for two days now,

681
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,000
and you've been coughing at night.

682
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,730
We should find another doctor.

683
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,690
It's nothing serious.

684
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
Lady Shanbao should take her medicine now.

685
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,400
Tell her I said
she must take the medicine.

686
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,460
No matter how important,
it can wait.

687
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,390
Other matters can be left to them,

688
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,450
but reinforcing the banks

689
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,580
must not be delayed.

690
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,690
If those two refuse to listen,

691
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,430
report to Grandmother for me.

692
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,590
Then ask Ms. Yan to supervise in person.

693
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,850
That's the most urgent matter right now.

694
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,600
I understand. Don't worry.

695
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,860
Young Master, what are you looking at?

696
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,130
At the rain clouds.

697
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,280
This area often has thunderclouds,

698
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,150
coming in waves.

699
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,070
A gust of wind and they're gone.

700
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,960
The raindrops on your face

701
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,290
haven't even dried yet.

702
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,560
When I was tuning just now,
the strings were loose.

703
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,250
The soundboard was very damp.

704
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
I couldn't tune it properly
despite several attempts.

705
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
There will definitely
be heavy rain within two days.

706
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,510
Look at the southern horizon.

707
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,840
The dark clouds have a faint reddish tint.

708
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm afraid

709
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,840
this rain will be most unusual.

710
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,440
What?

711
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,770
Mr. Lu can also read weather signs?

712
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,050
Lady Yunshu,

713
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,870
I'm not an expert in this field.

714
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,400
Just making casual observations.

715
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,670
I often hear elders say

716
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,590
that when hail clouds appear,

717
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,880
they always have high tops
and low bottoms,

718
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,510
growing like rolling snowballs,

719
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,960
heavily tilting downward.

720
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,510
Daisy,

721
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,850
are today's clouds like that?

722
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,030
My Lady, those clouds are quite far away.

723
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,120
They seem to be moving eastward.

724
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,730
Then it's not that.

725
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,880
Mr. Lu,

726
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,280
Lady Shanbao hasn't
recovered from the cold yet.

727
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,360
If all those complicated, trivial matters

728
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,440
are reported to her

729
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,360
and exhaust her spirit,

730
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,790
even if she takes medicine,

731
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,720
it won't help.

732
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,690
Please take extra care, Mr. Lu.

733
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,150
It's best to limit visitors these days

734
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,360
and let her rest peacefully.

735
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,570
My Lady, it's starting to rain again.

736
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,960
I love this gentle drizzle.

737
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,410
It's so refreshing.

738
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,190
Young Master, I'm too foolish

739
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,890
to understand Lady Yunshu's true meaning.

740
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,290
Young Master, is she...

741
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,740
Mind your own business.

742
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,110
Since we've taken on this responsibility,

743
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,170
none of us would dare not give our all.

744
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,960
It's just that our experience is limited.

745
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,360
Lady Shanbao
has worked hard for many years,

746
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,950
and her reputation in the tea business
has been growing.

747
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,350
She has always been a respected authority.

748
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,680
Some people inevitably abuse their power,

749
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,930
always boasting about
the Rong's tea talent,

750
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,330
refusing to take orders

751
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,320
from anyone but her.

752
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,690
Who's an outsider?

753
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,960
You were sent

754
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,890
by me to manage the tea plantation.

755
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,450
Who dares to be so insolent?

756
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,020
Pass down my words:

757
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,760
whoever refuses to obey,

758
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,400
no matter how great their skill,

759
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,130
cannot stay in the Rong family.

760
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,920
Yes.

761
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,900
With your words, Grandmother,

762
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,960
I can rest assured.

763
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,960
From now on, I'll keep a whip handy.

764
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,690
Anyone who doesn't obey

765
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,810
will behave after a good whipping.

766
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,150
To be honest,

767
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,630
Shanbao has been

768
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,630
far too lenient.

769
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,480
Every tea farmer should know their place,

770
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,710
yet the ones she recruited
are all troublemakers.

771
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,310
They rely on their tea skills

772
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,750
to do the opposite of what they're told,

773
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,800
refusing to be led,
backing away when pushed,

774
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,670
even daring to talk back to their masters.

775
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,630
I won't tolerate such stubborn behavior.

776
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,670
Even so,

777
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,670
they are all

778
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,880
experienced masters in our tea plantation.

779
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,920
They have real skill in growing tea.

780
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,760
You must act with propriety.

781
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,720
Grandmother, don't worry.

782
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,410
Yunyin may seem impulsive,

783
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,640
but she handles matters reliably.

784
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,590
She knows exactly who to keep, who to use,

785
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,960
and who needs discipline,

786
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,510
with perfect clarity.

787
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,270
Yunshu, you're here.

788
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,420
How is Lady Shanbao doing?

789
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,870
I went to Hualin Courtyard at noon,

790
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,400
and she kept asking me
all sorts of questions,

791
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,030
concerned only about the plantation.

792
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,510
I advised her

793
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,770
to mind her own health,

794
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,630
but she simply wouldn't listen.

795
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,230
She's better during the day,

796
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,710
but fever certainly returns after dusk.

797
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,590
The doctor said

798
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,620
she needs bed rest for a month,

799
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,850
otherwise the illness will linger

800
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,840
and become increasingly difficult to cure.

801
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,110
At this critical moment,

802
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,920
she can't be relied upon at all.

803
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,590
Regarding matters in the tea plantation,

804
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,190
you must pay more attention.

805
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
The autumn tea harvest cannot be delayed.

806
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,370
Don't worry, Grandmother.

807
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,110
As soon as the rain stopped,

808
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,110
I ordered people

809
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,590
to quickly clean up the plantation.

810
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,320
Yunxi has also been

811
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,450
busy running around

812
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,590
and entertaining

813
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,980
tea merchants from all over in town.

814
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,000
We work in perfect harmony inside and out,

815
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,200
and won't delay any important matters.

816
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,670
Invite Lady Yunyin to come.

817
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,310
Just say I have urgent business.

818
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:07,830
Yes.

819
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:08,810
Wait.

820
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,510
Tea farmers are often

821
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,190
free-spirited mountain folk,

822
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,230
and tea cultivation masters

823
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,560
are even more prideful.

824
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,280
Finding fault with her

825
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,400
is as easy as pie.

826
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Within two weeks,

827
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,880
they'll be begging at your door.

828
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,590
Then we'll be halfway there.

829
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,550
I know.

830
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,760
But the thunder outside is too fierce.

831
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,550
I'm worried.

832
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,630
I call her to give some instructions.

833
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,160
It won't hinder your plans.

834
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,010
Go quickly.

835
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,550
Yes.

836
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,150
Say what you need to say,
but don't get upset and harm yourself.

837
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,360
Otherwise, your illness

838
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,620
will never get better.

839
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,990
You may seem decisive,

840
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,410
but you're actually weak inside,

841
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,920
nowhere near your fifth sister,

842
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,230
who is cold-hearted and ruthless.

843
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,330
You mean... Yunshu?

844
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,960
She can't wait for your fourth sister

845
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,560
to cause a terrible disaster

846
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,880
and fall into a bottomless abyss.

847
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,460
[Mugwort]

848
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:05,550
The realgar wine shouldn't
be drunk in excess either.

849
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,600
[Realgar wine is toxic. Do not imitate.]

850
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,300
Drinking too much makes me dizzy.

851
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,320
Let the sisters go play.

852
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,140
Come,

853
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,030
accompany me for a walk in the garden.

854
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,800
Mugwort is an essential element

855
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,660
in Dragon Boat Festival customs.

856
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,560
Its main functions are

857
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,630
warding off evil and preventing disease,

858
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,280
as well as praying for good health.

859
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,360
The ancients discovered

860
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,110
mugwort's versatility long ago.

861
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,030
Its strong smell repels insects;

862
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,280
it relieves itching used in baths;

863
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,880
its smoke fumigates for disinfection;

864
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,230
and pounded, it makes moxa wool.

865
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,630
It's the ancient version
of a miracle herb.

866
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,250
Around Dragon Boat Festival,
there's a lot of rain,

867
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,000
easily breeding mosquitoes and insects.

868
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Hang it in your home,

869
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,990
and mosquitoes and insects
dare not come near.

870
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,510
Don't think it's just a custom.

871
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,920
This is pest control technology

872
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,840
proven effective over thousands of years.
