Master Jianglai.

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,940
Huiqing refused to toast you.

5
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,870
Let me give you a toast.

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,460
Will you accept it?

7
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,789
You're the bold one.

8
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,430
Do you know

9
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,289
that Miss Rong by Jianglai's side

10
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,000
always has a whip with her?

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,920
I've heard that every Rong Family woman
is extremely jealous,

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,980
and men fear her as if she were a tiger.

13
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm afraid Jianglai

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,720
won't dare to accept your toast.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,160
These are mere trifles,

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,190
not worth your anger, Master Jianglai.

17
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,310
Master Shuyu composed this music himself

18
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,360
and had someone bring out

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,750
this fine wine
that has been preserved for 10 years.

20
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,079
He has long awaited
this reunion of brothers.

21
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,520
Do not spoil his mood.

22
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,910
Please drink this up.

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,079

I think you're truly drunk.

26
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,120
You should rest early tonight.

Whatever it is,

28
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,829
we can discuss it when you're sober.

29

He is so cold.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,050
I did nothing to offend him,

31
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,390
yet he treated me
as if I were some filthy creature.

32
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,800

I will definitely eat it.

It's cold outside. Go back early.

Lady Shanbao, why are you not waiting
in your chamber

45
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,390
for Lord Lu to return?

46
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,790
He specifically asked you to wait inside.

47
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,430

when he left for the dinner?

53
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,630
Lord Lu lost his mother when he was young.

54
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,680
His foster father was killed
by a powerful clan.

55

Left all alone in the world
and with no one to rely on,

from his relatives

and cold stares from others.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,630
Against all odds, he passed
the imperial exam and became an official.

59
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,310
He avenged his father,
brought corrupt officials to justice,

60
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,600
and devoted himself to his duties.

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,430
Now he has finally reunited
with his own elder brother.

Along the way were grasslands, mountains,

I thought it meant

But actually, it meant

155

that he was born
in an unusual breech position,

156
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,200

That he bears such a name

Miss Rong, unlike you,
who have weathered many storms,

189
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,480
I am just a woman
confined to the inner quarters.

190
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,630
The sight of a corpse

191
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
startled me for a moment.

192
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,690
The smell of blood is indeed strong,

193
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,340
making people dizzy.

194
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,560
I have a vial of calming pills here.

195
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,320
Mrs. Xue, please take one.

196
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,910
It's excellent for settling your mind.

197
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,630
Thank you.

198
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,190
Son of a bitch!

199
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,860
This scoundrel somehow

200
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,840
changed into a guard's uniform

201
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,080
and snuck into the mansion
to carry out the assassination.

202
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,140
Truly despicable!

203
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Thankfully, Master Jianglai
was blessed by the gods

204
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
and thus spared from harm.

205
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,120
I'll go right away

206
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,240
to report this to the Duke!

207
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,510
We'll conduct a thorough search
of the Duke's Mansion tonight

208
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,440
and find the assassin's accomplices!

209
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,120
Do you really think his accomplices
would just linger here

210
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,780
waiting to be arrested by you?

211
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes.

212
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,000
It's late.

213
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,430
No need to make a fuss.

214
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,480
No need to disturb

215
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,630
the Duke and Master Shuyu.

216
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,140
Gather all the gatekeepers
and patrol guards.

217
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,270
Carry the body over there

218
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,480
and ask them to identify it.

219
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,610
Then send two men to keep watch over it.

220
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,850
Tomorrow I'll send for a coroner
to examine the corpse.

221
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,120
Master Jianglai,

222
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,200
you're truly thoughtful.

223
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
But after tonight's fight,

224
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,390
this chamber is hardly fit

225
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,440
for habitation anymore.

226
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,670
I'll immediately ask others

227
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,390
to get another room prepared for you.

228
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,790
That won't be necessary.

229
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,750
Tonight,

230
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,610
I'll make do with the study.

231
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,790
Huiqing, you were frightened

232
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,190
and should go rest early.

233
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,240
Steward Xue,

234
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,030
please escort Huiqing back personally.

235
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,630
Yes.

236
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,680
Young Madam, please.

237
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,130
I'll wait for you in the study.

238
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,640
I have questions for you.

239
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,360
Take it away.

240
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,830
Bao.

241
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,630
I was just kicked

242
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,630
by that assassin.

243
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,210
It seems the blow struck deep inside.

244
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,670
I didn't feel a thing then,

245
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,130
but now it suddenly hurts.

246
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,890
I can't bear it anymore, Bao.

247
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,490
I need to lie down for a while.

248
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,550
Bao,

249
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,030
don't you care about me at all?

250
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm in such pain.

251
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,270
Come take a look.

252
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,770
Is it swollen from the kick?

253
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,880
Look. Is it right here?

254
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,870
Bao, how heartless you are!

255
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,240
If you put on such an act
to dodge my questions,

256
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,640
then we're done talking.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,550
Bao.

258
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,080
Don't push me like this.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,270
Lu Jianglai, you dare not say it.

260
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,950
Fine, I'll say it for you.

261
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,200
Who hosted the feast you attended today?

262
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,960
What did you eat and drink there?

263
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,290
Someone wants you dead.

264
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,750
Are you truly unaware?

265
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,109
Or are you just playing dumb?

266
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,310
You elder brother, Master Shuyu...

267
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,200
Say no more.

268
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,270
You know everything perfectly well.

269
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,930
Why keep deceiving yourself?

270
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,920
Before I met you,

271
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,310
I was cold-hearted and arrogant.

272
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,200
Confronted by all the villains
in the world,

273
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,060
I struck them down without mercy.

274
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,580
So many corrupt officials at court

275
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,110
hated me and wanted me dead,

276
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,750
but I never flinched.

277
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,510
A person who is all alone

278
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,640
has nothing to fear.

279
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,240
But just now,

280
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,920
I was truly afraid.

281
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,620
For the first time in my life,
I felt fear.

282
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,680
What were you afraid of?

283
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,290
I was afraid that one day,

284
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,850
I would also become just a cold name

285
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,160
in those case files.

286
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,270
I was even more afraid

287
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,830
that my elder brother

288
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,830
was behind all this.

289
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,830
Bao, do you know what he did?

290
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,110
He made little Xun

291
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
bring me that jujube cake

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,000
laced with sedatives.

293
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
To reassure me,

294
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,640
he even put on a show
of humiliating his wife

295
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,830
and disciplining his son in front of me.

296
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,070
He is my only

297
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,440
blood brother

298
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
in this whole world.

299
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,790
But he wants me dead.

300
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,590
Bao.

301
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,590
He wants me dead.

302
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,640
I see.

303
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,260
You didn't eat that piece of jujube cake.

304
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,200
Well done.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
I kept that piece of jujube cake,

306
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,450
because I wanted to tell you

307
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,590
that you were worrying too much,

308
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,920
that my brother

309
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,120
was as kind-hearted as my mother,

310
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,660
that he valued the bond
between us siblings,

311
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,920
and that he was not as vile
as you thought.

312
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,440
But in the end...

313
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,270
In the end,

314
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,570
I, Lu Jianglai, am fated to be all alone

315
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,310
and cut off from all kin.

316
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,710
No one in this world loves me.

317
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,410
No one in this world will ever love me.

318
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
But I'm here, aren't I?

319
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,550
You're not all alone.

320
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,880
Then, will you

321
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,110
by my side forever?

322
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,400
Rong Shanbao!

323
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,050
Do you have another lover?

324
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,340
Why are you so hesitant and evasive

325
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,270
every time

326
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,030
I ask you?

327
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,640
What are you hiding from me?

328
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,840
Of course...

329
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,930
Of course...

330
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,200
This is exactly the tradition
of your Rong family.

331
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,680
The moment I'm not by your side,

332
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,400
someone will immediately

333
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,240
take my place!

334
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,730
Even if you're unwilling,

335
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,110
your grandmother, your sisters,

336
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,640
and those

337
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
foolish men with ill intentions

338
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,200
will all try

339
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,330
to deceive you with their sweet words.

340
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,350
Who is it?

341
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,500
Is it Cheng Guanyu?

342
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,210
Or is it your cousin Wen Can?

343
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,640
Who the hell is it, Bao?

344
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,440
Who the hell is it?

345
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,550
Or which stranger is it?

346
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,350
Tell me!

347
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,350
Who the hell is it?

348
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,170
I don't have another lover.

349
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,690
Then promise me

350
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,240
that if you do,

351
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,750
you must tell me.

352
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,470
And what if I tell you?

353
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
Then I will stuff

354
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,590
that despicable thief

355
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,850
back into his rat hole.

356
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,600
And then I will hide you

357
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,720
in a place no one

358
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,850
but me can ever find.

359
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Unless you swear

360
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,640
that you'll never leave me again

361
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,170

all claim they've never seen this person.

I've ordered people
to search the entire mansion.

I believe we'll get to the bottom of this
soon.

Your Highness, I hope

you can grant me three more days.

407
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,110
You just said

408
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,270
Jianglai had forbidden
anyone in the mansion to look into this

409
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,240
and intended to bring in outside help,
right?

410
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,830
Yes.

411
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,470
So, he suspects there's an accomplice
hidden in the mansion.

412
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,570
The fact that an assassin could sneak in
so easily

413
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,100
proves you're all nothing
but useless fools!

414
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:14,960
Yes.

415
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,920
The guards on patrol duty last night

416
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,520
will each receive 30 lashes.

417
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,270
Yes.

418
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,590
Including you!

419
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,480
Yes.

420
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,200
Get out!

421
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,720
Yes.

422
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,590
Xun.

423
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,040
Come over to me.

424
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,240
Grandfather.

425
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,030
I've finished all the homework

426
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,420
you assigned me.

427
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,530
Really? Let me have a look.

428
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,030
Well done. Quite impressive.

429
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,350
Your Highness, I heard from Xun

430
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,310
that you've been troubled lately.

431
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:57,790
I assume it's because

432
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,750
you're concerned about Jianglai's matter.

433
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,350
I've made some Fuling cakes.

434
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,350
The doctor says
they can strengthen the vital energy,

435
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,270
calm the spirit,

436
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,830
and even promote longevity.

437
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,030
This is the perfect season to have them.

438
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,590
You're thoughtful.

439
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,170
Leave them here.

440
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,220
Yes.

441
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,390
Xun.

442
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,510
Want some?

443
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,890
Here you are.

444
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,460
Xun, you eat one first.

445
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,000
Thank you, Grandfather.

446
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,590
No.

447
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,270
He hit you again?

448
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,270
No.

449
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,550
I hurt myself

450
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,550
by accident.

451
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,350
It had nothing to do with him.

452
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,150
-What a scoundrel!
-Mother!

453
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,170
It's all right.

454
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,400
Xun, don't be afraid.

455
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,080
I'm not talking about you.

456
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Grandfather, please eat it.

457
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,780
You'll feel better after eating it.

458
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,910
The Fuling cake tastes much better
than the jujube cake.

459
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,570
The jujube cake?

460
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
Father told me to send it
to Uncle Jianglai.

461
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,040
What happened to your manners?

462
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,880
Before your grandfather,
you must observe the strictest etiquette.

463
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,790
Do not speak recklessly of matters

464
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,650
your elders have not asked about.

465
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,380
Your Highness, Xun has been suffering
from indigestion.

466
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,510
He shouldn't eat too many pastries.

467
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,770
I'll take him back now.

468
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,480
Wait.

469
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,920
Xun, come over here.

470
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,530
You just said your father

471
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,490
told you to send a jujube cake
to your Uncle Jianglai.

472
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,720
[Harmonious Radiance]

473
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,550
Mr. Lang, this way, please.

474
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,120
You're walking so slowly.
It's driving me crazy!

475
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
Hurry up!

476
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,070
Shanbao chose to remain
at the Duke's Mansion.

477
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,530
She must have her reasons.

478
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,000
You

479
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
rushed over in such a panic

480
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,070
only because of the mission
Grandmother gave you.

481
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,070
Grandmother carefully selected

482
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,880
these men for Shanbao.

483
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,800
You already have Mr. Bai by your side.

484
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,260
Don't even think about it.

485
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,640
Grandmother said she was done meddling,

486
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,680
yet only a few days later,

487
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,270
she's already worrying again.

488
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,960
As long as Shanbao
doesn't neglect her duties,

489
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,820
what does it matter who she likes?

490
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,480
I wouldn't put it that way.

491
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,440
Lu Jianglai is about
to be formally recognized

492
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
as the Duke's son.

493
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,400
Soon, he'll be matched with some
noble lady from a prominent family.

494
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,930
Shanbao can't fall behind.

495
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,880
This time,

496
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,030
Grandmother personally selected
more than 10 candidates,

497
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,310
each rivaling him
in both appearance and talent.

498
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,240
Not just the families from Jiangnan
are eager to make a move.

499
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,750
Even Cousin Wen

500
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,680
has sent two letters to ask about it.

501
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,580
This is the Duke of Yongguo's Mansion.

502
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,310
Lu Jianglai isn't someone to mess with.

503
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,160
I advise you

504
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,240
to put away this precious booklet at once.

505
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,900
Otherwise, if he finds out...

506
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,550
How about

507
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,480
I take a look for Shanbao
and see which one stands out?

508
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,400
Hurry! Hide it away!

509
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,550
Excuse me,

510
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,480
could you please return my ball?

511
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,310
This little girl
has such beautiful features.

512
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,400
So pretty.

513
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,790
What's your name?

514
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,880
Why are you playing here alone?

515
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
My name is Xuanyu.

516
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,110
I'm not alone.

517
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm with...

518
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,650
Lady Xuanyu!

519
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,410
Lady Xuanyu!

520
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,880
Lady Xuanyu,

521
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,240
I just went back to fetch something,

522
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,030
and in the blink of an eye, you ran off.

523
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,760
Madam Chang will be worried
if she can't find you.

524
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,010
Let's go.

525
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,960
If only I had

526
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
such a clever and adorable daughter.

527
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,350
I should keep

528
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,350
one man from the booklet for myself.

529
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,170
What are you looking at?

530
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,670
Nothing. Let's go.

531
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,820
When did those outsiders arrive
at the mansion?

532
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,560
Find out and report back.

533
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,200
Yes.

534
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,480
The coroner retrieved

535
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,400
the silver needle that the deceased

536
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,270
had swallowed.

537
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,300
Since the pathways within the head

538
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,240
are all linked, even a needle this fine,

539
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,880
when driven
with precisely calculated force,

540
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
could pierce through the ear canal
into the brain,

541
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,310
causing instant death.

542
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,310
Afterwards, the needle could

543
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,970
be pulled out without a trace.

544
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,410
Even after the coroner's examination,

545
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,130
no evidence would be found.

546
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,350
Judging

547
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,680
from how the assassin committed suicide,

548
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,680
he was clearly very professional.

549
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,980
A highly paid assassin?

550
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,920
Who have you offended, My Lord?

551
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,830
They even dared to break
into the Duke's Mansion to kill you.

552
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,030
I'll be more careful.

553
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,210
Thank you for your help.

554
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,510
My Lord, since you've asked me
to be your helper,

555
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,110
why won't you speak plainly?

556
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,270
Is there

557
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,350
anything you can't bring yourself to say?

558
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,000
I...

559
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,710
My Lord, Mrs. Xue is here.

560
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,640
Let her in.

561
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,510
Jianglai, I've come unbidden
to beg for your help.

562
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,510
Please, don't say that.

563
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,570
You can just tell me what's happened.

564
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,200
Your brother

565
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,890
has been taken away by the Duke's men.

566
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,200
I beg you to put aside past grievances

567
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
and save his life.

568
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Save his life?

569
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,240
The Duke truly has sharp eyes

570
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,710
and sees through every ruse.

571
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,880
He knows

572
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,920
everything

573
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,400
you've done.

574
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,350
I advise you to admit your fault

575
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,360
and beg for forgiveness.

576
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,010
Father, I am foolish

577
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,640
and don't know what I've done wrong.

578
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,590
Father, I beg you to tell me my fault.

579
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,030
You asked Xun to send the jujube cake,
didn't you?

580
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,640
Yes, I asked him to send it.

581
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,640
Someone laced the jujube cake
with sleeping draughts,

582
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
which were enough
to make a person unconscious.

583
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,830
Do you know that your brother

584
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,550
was attacked by assassins last night?

585
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:27,960
I...

586
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,160
I knew nothing about it.

587
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,920
Fine.

588
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,920
Then the beating will continue,

589
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,210
until you admit what you know!

590
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,850
Father, you suspect

591
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,050
I'm the one who wants
to kill Jianglai?

592
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,110
Other than you,

593
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,280
who else hates him so deeply?

594
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,070
From the very day I brought

595
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,670
Jianglai into this mansion,

596
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,720
you've been guarding against him,
sowing discord between us,

597
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,920
and trying every means to drive him out!

598
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,770
His servant

599
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,240
managed to get out of the mansion
and send word outside.

600
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,300
Wasn't it you who pulled the strings?

601
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,400
I simply didn't bother

602
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,240
to expose such petty tricks.

603
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,200
I am a cripple,

604
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,790
who cannot uphold the Xue family's name.

605
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,400
Everyone in the mansion knows

606
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,640
that you brought him back

607
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,720
to replace me!

608
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,620
So it's only natural
that I was wary of him

609
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,960
and kept my distance!

610
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,810
Is that such a grave crime?

611
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,000
But I never sent anyone to kill him.

612
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,830
Never!

613
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,830
I can swear to God!

614
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,560
You still dare to deny it?

615
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,750
You're mediocre yourself,

616
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,620
yet you're jealous of those with talent.

617
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,950
You even want to harm

618
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,790
your own brother.

619
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,190
You're truly monstrous!

620
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,730
I'll give you one last chance.

621
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,950
If you did it, admit it.

622
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,100
Be a man
and take responsibility for your deeds!

623
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,050
It wasn't me!

624
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,730
I plead not guilty!

625
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,030
I never thought

626
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,790
that jealousy could breed

627
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,200
such a beastly heart

628
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,960
in my own son,

629
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,880
driving him to commit this inhumane crime.

630
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,280
Take him away!

631
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,200
Cleanse his wicked heart with water!

632
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,940
Master Shuyu, forgive me.

633
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,510
Father!

634
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,790
I didn't do it!

635
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,310
I never sent anyone
to assassinate my brother!

636
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,440
Someone was deliberately framing me!

637
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,480
Father, don't be deceived by them!

638
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,400
Father!

639
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
Look at this Mr. Ye.

640
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,440
He is handsome and well-educated.

641
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,310
His looks can rival those of the paragons
of male beauty.

642
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,270
It is said that every time he goes out,

643
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,870
he attracts crowds of women,

644
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,300
his carriage filled
with gifts from admirers.

645
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,960
He also comes from an esteemed family,

646
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,200
proud and arrogant.

647
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,340
He's determined

648
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,350
to marry a noble lady
of both beauty and talent.

649
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,880
Girls from ordinary families
could never hope to match him.

650
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,710
I'm discussing important matters
with Yunshu.

651
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,710
Do not disrupt us.

652
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,830
I'm here

653
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,200
on Grandmother's orders.

654
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,830
How is that disrupting anything?

655
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,890
Take another look.

656
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,070
If you don't like this one,
you can choose another.

657
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,260
Xiu Qiong,
you should have spoken up earlier.

658
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,880
I thought

659
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
it was that jealous man coming over.

660
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Lady Shanbao.

661
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,750
The Duke is interrogating Master Shuyu.

662
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,880
Lord Lu has rushed over to Baoshi Hall.

663
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,770
Lord Lu is facing a difficult matter,

664
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,030
and you won't help him?

665
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,960
Whether it's difficult, domestic, joyous

666
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,590
or disastrous

667
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,760
all depends on his decision.

668
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,950
Others can't help him.

669
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,210
In the end,
he must make the decision himself.

670
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,270
Yunshu, I have to trouble you

671
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,409
to look into someone for me.

672
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,389
I really didn't do it.

673
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,550
I really didn't.

674
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,330
I really didn't.

675
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,969
It's freezing cold!

676
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,050
You've finally come to see me.

677
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,360
This damn wretch

678
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,440
dared to plot to kill his own brother.

679
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,360
I am seeking justice for you.

680
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,450
You need not stop them.

681
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,960
Even if he were

682
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,290
truly guilty of murder,

683
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,670
you couldn't just take the law
into your own hands.

684
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,360
As for me,

685
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,940
I don't need you to seek justice for me.

686
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,030
You're unworthy.

687
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,030
How dare you!

688
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,260
Your Highness, be careful!

689
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,560
I truly did not misjudge you.

690
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,540
Our Xue family finally has a worthy heir.

691
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,360
Bring Xun out!

692
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,400
Yes.

693
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,510
Look.

694
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,320
Even your own son

695
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,080
isn't willing to plead for you.

696
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,710
What a pathetic failure

697
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,230
you are as a father!

698
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,150
Jianglai, this is your own nephew.

699
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,400
When you inherit my title,

700
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,850
you must treat him and his mother well.

701
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,880
As for your

702
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,480
good-for-nothing brother,

703
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,760
he shall be exiled to a monastery
to live in seclusion

704
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,290
and atone for his sins
for the rest of his life.

705
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,490
How do you know I am capable
of shouldering the responsibility?

706
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,370
I have kept a close eye on you
for quite some time.

707
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,300
What you've done in Linjin

708
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
shows that you're resolute

709
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,320
and decisive.

710
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,230
You are the spitting image

711
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,400
of my younger self!

712
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,000
How could I possibly be mistaken?

713
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,590
Fine.

714
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,100
You asked me to treat Xun well.

715
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,680
But when Xun grows up

716
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,760
and asks me

717
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,220
why I seized his father's title

718
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,940
and drove his father out
of the Xue family,

719
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,270
how should I answer him?

720
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,060
Shuyu is willing to step aside.

721
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,860
You didn't seize anything.

722
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,910
Everything in this household

723
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,160
will be given to you by me.

724
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,690
Who dares to question that?

725
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,630
Jianglai, what I want is a wolf.

726
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,690
I want a leader wolf
that can command the pack.

727
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,760
Everything I earned on the battlefield

728
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,440
can only be given to someone

729
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,570
who will bring glory to our Xue family.

730
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,070
Xun is too young,

731
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,360
but you are in your prime!

732
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,000
So your plan is
that I replace my elder brother,

733
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,340
and my nephew succeeds me.

734
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,050
But what if I have children
of my own in the future

735
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,850
and refuse to give the title to Xun?

736
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,730
Power and titles

737
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,630
only breed more hatred

738
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,210
and agony,

739
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,260
just like they did to you.

740
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,280
You already had

741
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,550
a beloved wife,

742
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,990
yet to get more heirs,

743
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,770
you took one concubine after another.

744
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,850
You brought them into this household,

745
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,850
but you did nothing
to stop your wife's jealousy,

746
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,390
standing by as they were bullied!

747
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,000
You drove my mother
into a life of wandering,

748
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
leaving her with no one to rely on.

749
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,740
You made me suffer
all the hardships of the world

750
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,800
and endure the cold stares of others!

751
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,930
They all said I was a servant's son.

752
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,250
But so what?

753
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,690
The lowborn servant

754
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,850
was willing to take my mother and me in.

755
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,660
He spent everything he had

756
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,630
supporting my education.

757
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,940
His moral character

758
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,000
was a thousand times nobler than yours.

759
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,800
What did you say?

760
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,080
I said you're selfish!

761
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,300
You imprisoned me in your mansion,

762
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,630
not because you missed

763
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,800
your long-lost son.

764
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,730
You never cared how much I had suffered

765
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,530
or what hardships I had endured.

766
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,300
You really think

767
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,950
that I would be grateful and overjoyed

768
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,310
when offered

769
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,540
this title?

770
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,920
You didn't even bother to ask

771
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,780
when my mother passed away,

772
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,040
or where she was buried!

773
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
You don't deserve to be her husband!

774
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,890
Your actions

775
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,440
have made my own brother fear me.

776
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,370
He fears
that I will usurp his noble title.

777
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,120
He even fears
that I'll drive him to his death.

778
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
He's my brother.

779
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,950
He and I share the same mother!

780
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,180
Yet you are

781
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,810
forcing us to turn against each other

782
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,880
with your own hands!

783
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,520
You

784
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,690
don't deserve to be our father!

785
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,840
I was fighting battles on the front lines.

786
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,440
How could I have cared

787
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
about my women's petty jealousies?

788
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,210
It pains me deeply
that you and your mother

789
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,060
were driven out of the mansion.

790
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,880
As for your brother,

791
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,920
his jealousy toward you

792
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,120
stems from his own narrow-mindedness.

793
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,690
Do you understand?

794
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,030
Shuyu.

795
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,440
Let's go.

796
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,800
Hate me if you must.

797
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,980
But if you give up everything

798
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,880
in the Duke's Mansion just out of hatred,

799
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
then you'll truly be

800
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,630
the biggest fool in the world!

801
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,810
Your Highness, this...

802
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,440
A man who has lost all hope

803
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,040
wouldn't argue so fiercely.

804
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
He cares about his brother

805
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,330
and even more about his nephew.

806
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,800
In the end,

807
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
he will lower

808
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,150
his proud head in front of me.

809
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,360
Here.

810
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,220
Hurry! Bring the brazier!

811
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,350
The brazier! Hurry!

812
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,880
Are you feeling better?

813
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,760
Master Shuyu,

814
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,070
I heard you had caught a cold,

815
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,030
so I specially prepared some ginger soup
for you.

816
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,690
Drink it while it's hot.
It'll ward off the cold.

817
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,110
You...

818
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,210
Get out.

819
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,000
Master Shuyu,

820
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,000
why is your face deathly pale?

821
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,200
It's so frightening.

822
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,840
Why not let me

823
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,960
stay here and attend to you?

824
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,550
Get out!

825
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,440
Yes, Master Shuyu.

826
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,880
Do drink the soup while it's still hot.

827
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,320
It won't be effective if it turns cold.

828
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,120
And all my effort will be wasted.

829
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,100
Let me do it.

830
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,590
When I was little,

831
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,130
Mother used to comb my hair.

832
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,490
It's a pity
that I didn't understand back then

833
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,120
why she always made two portions

834
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,340
of jujube cakes every time.

835
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,030
She would often stare at me blankly.

836
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,350
I only realized later

837
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,660
that Mother

838
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,400
was missing her other son.

839
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,560
Before Mother passed away,

840
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,890
she held my hand tightly,
refusing to close her eyes.

841
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,420
She was unwilling to go.

842
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,360
She couldn't accept that before she died,

843
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,540
she never got to see you one last time.

844
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,750
All right.

845
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,800
So, Shuyu, you don't need to worry.

846
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,550
I will never fight you for anything.

847
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,570
You don't want to fight me,

848
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,670
but I did think about killing you.

849
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,640
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

850
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,920
I hesitated.

851
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,050
Jianglai, believe me.

852
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,490
I never sent anyone to kill you.

853
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,230
If I really had done it,

854
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,860
may I be pierced by a thousand arrows

855
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,260
and die a horrible death.

856
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,100
All right. I see.

857
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,700
Don't be distressed.

858
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,190
It's getting late.

859
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,640
Shuyu, get some rest.

860
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,760
I'll come to see you another day.

861
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,500
Jianglai!

862
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,400
I know you don't believe me.

863
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:02,590
But

864
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,870
could you tell me more about her?

I was just kicked

868
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,900
by that assassin.

869
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,400
It seems the blow struck deep inside.

870
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,860
I didn't feel a thing then,

871
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,310
but now it suddenly hurts.

872
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,080
I can't bear it anymore, Bao.

873
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,680
I need to lie down for a while.

874
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:07,960
Bao,

00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,200
don't you care about me at all?

00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,670
I'm in such pain.

877
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,590
Come take a look.

878
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,970

With the global expansion

the development of tea culture

882
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,840
has also swept the world.

in different languages around the world,

885
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,670
with a few exceptions,

886
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,590
there are only two ways

to pronounce the words for tea:

"cha" or "tea."

889
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,200
For instance, it's "cha"

890
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,490
in Russian and Korean,

891
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,930
while it's "tea"

892
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,930
in French and Spanish.

893
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,130
Why does tea from China

894
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,190
have two different pronunciations?

895
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,320
This is mainly

896
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,550
because Chinese tea

897
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,920
was introduced to overseas regions

898
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
in different ways.

899

00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,030
to have interactions with
northern China.

904
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,030
Most areas in northern China

905
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,250
refer to tea as "cha."

906
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,100
