00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,930
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,120
Is that all?

4
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,000
I've been to several
secondhand clothing shops

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,479
to gather all these items.

6
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,410
Everything is inside.

7
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,680
My Lord.

8
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,710
Governor Jiang allows his soldiers

9
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,640
to arrest innocent people,

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,120
torture them for confessions
and falsely accuse them as thieves.

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,759
This is absolutely intolerable!

12
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,070
Deploying troops without authorization
and disturbing the peace

13
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,710
is one crime.

14
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,039
Harming the innocent and falsely accusing
honest people as thieves

15
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,870
is another offense.

16
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,039
The people of Linji
are now living in fear,

17
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,680
and their lives are in turmoil,

18
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
which adds to his crimes.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,039
The petition has been drafted

20
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,440
for your review, My Lord.

21
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,070
Alright. Dress up.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
Let's leave the mansion.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,560
Linji has always been peaceful,

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,650
a rare prosperous place in Jiangnan.

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,280
The Rong family contributes

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,870
substantial tea taxes
to the court every year.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,750
Now that the Rong family has been robbed,

28
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,680
local officials

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,750
are locked in endless accusations
with the imperial Prefect.

30
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,360
His Majesty would never

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,630
easily believe just one side.

32
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,840
The court will surely
send a new imperial envoy.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
We must find evidence

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,870
before the new imperial envoy

35
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,870
arrives at Linji.

36
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,710
Otherwise...

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,930
Otherwise what?

38
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,030
Otherwise, opposing my superior

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,000
means that I,

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
your lord, will lose my head.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,910
Jun Dai,

42
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,120
is that Kaitai Teahouse

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,870
really as busy as you described?

44
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,670
Young Master,

45
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,910
that Kaitai Teahouse

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,150
is right by the east gate.

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,310
Outside its doors,
there's a constant stream of traffic

48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,110
day and night.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,680
All the chief managers in town

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,140
like to do business there.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,440
Fine. Let's go to this Kaitai Teahouse.

52
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,400
Let's go.

53
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,560
My Lord,

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
this hat doesn't match my outfit.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,710
Could I have another one?

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,570
Change it then.

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,680
Steward Quan,

58
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,030
these are the finest goods

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,150
in all of Linji.

60
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,170
Not usually shown to just anyone.

61
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,000
Take a look.

62
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,870
This is quite nice.

63
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,030
This. This bead.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,740
The quality is excellent.

65
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,250
Such a bright bead.

66
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,310
These rice-sized ones are nothing.

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Have you ever seen ones
the size of pigeon eggs?

68
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,310
Have you seen them?

69
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,750
Don't exaggerate too much.

70
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,470
What did you say?

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,530
-What did you say?
-You’ve seen them?

72
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,190
These items are inauspicious.

73
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,470
I'll take all the rest.

74
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,750
Wonderful!

75
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,240
Really? So many?

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,900
Wonderful!

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
How generous!

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,910
Steward,

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,030
I have some excellent goods in my shop.

80
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,430
I'll send someone
to fetch them right away.

81
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,240
Would you honor us by taking a look?

82
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,590
Bring them quickly for me to see.

83
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,520
Yes, certainly.

84
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,280
I have more!

85
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,150
Look at mine!

86
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,680
Don't push!

87
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,510
I have more items too!

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,159
From Xiu Qiong?

89
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,620
Miss Xiu Qiong

90
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,190
was worried about the poor prison food

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,950
and specially prepared this meal

92
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,210
for you, Lady Shanbao.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,570
Miss Xiu Qiong also said

94
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,070
Lady Yunyin made a scene
at the Rong Mansion gate

95
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,200
and was driven away.

96
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,580
She's been depressed ever since.

97
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,790
Miss Yi sent a message saying

98
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,190
Lady Yunxi and Lady Xiangling

99
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,240
have both entered the plantation.

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,070
They're urgently recruiting workers

101
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,720
to ensure the tribute tea
is shipped on time.

102
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
Please don't worry, Lady Shanbao.

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
I understand.

104
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,870
Good thing you left when you did.

105
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,900
I heard you've become a clerk now.

106
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,600
Lady Shanbao, if you hadn't
been so generous

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,180
and released me from servitude,

108
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,310
I wouldn't have my current prospects.

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,680
Father just came yesterday to tell me

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
he's been promoted to estate manager

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,130
with a salary increase.

112
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,870
My sister

113
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,670
can now work in the tea house too.

114
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,800
Our entire family,

115
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,730
young and old,
relies on your care, Lady Shanbao.

116
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,990
We'll never forget your great kindness.

117
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me ask you again,

118
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,920
when will you give me

119
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
the travel permit to leave the city?

120
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,560
Don't worry. Don't worry.

121
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Things are very tense these days.

122
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,830
Just stay here calmly

123
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,720
and hide for a while.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
Bullshit!

125
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
If the case drags on for a year or more,

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
I and my brothers

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,560
will be trapped here like prisoners.

128
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Even a good man would be driven mad here!

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
I might as well kill you first

130
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,830
and be done with it!

131
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,630
-You...
-If you really kill me now,

132
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,830
I guarantee you

133
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,690
will never leave this city alive.

134
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,310
Let go!

135
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,560
Let go!

136
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,310
Alright. Alright.

137
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,200
Just be patient for now.

138
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,120
In another month or two,

139
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,270
I'll help you leave the city safely.

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,430
By then, with treasures in hand,

141
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,430
you'll have wealth beyond measure.

142
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,560
That jade tea set alone

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
in Old Madam Rong's room

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,390
would keep you fed for 2 years.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,060
Small impatience ruins great plans.

146
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,510
Can that powerful person

147
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,710
behind you really...

148
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,510
Cannot be discussed.

149
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:11,680
Fine.

150
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,870
Boss.

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
I sent you to gather information,

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,159
but you've been gone so long.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
If you're tired of living,

154
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,440
I'll finish you right now

155
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,930
to avoid trouble later.

156
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,600
Boss, have mercy!

157
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,510
We're not like

158
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,110
that spineless Yang fellow.

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,070
We've weathered

160
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,830
many storms.

161
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,190
These few soldiers can't scare us.

162
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,870
Boss.

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Boss.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,120
Boss.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,040
We risk our heads doing business.

166
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,070
We don't fear scars on our necks.

167
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,600
We only fear not selling our goods.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,070
Boss.

169
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,430
I found a big buyer.

170
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,140
A big buyer.

171
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,190
Selling now? Are you looking to die?

172
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,800
Boss.

173
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,830
I've selected

174
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,290
only unmarked treasures,

175
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,160
and the gold items
have already been melted down.

176
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,510
We'll find a middleman then.

177
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm sure the officials

178
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,320
can't trace anything back to us.

179
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,130
Is it reliable?

180
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:22,980
Scent pouches! Fragrant sachets!

Candied haws!

183
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,800
Candied haws here!

184
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,510
Go!

185
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,809
What's happening?

186
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,670
Lady Shanbao.

187
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,920
My lord requests your presence.

188
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,550
What?

189
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
Lord Lu, you want to
interrogate me tonight?

190
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,110
Yes, I'm going to interrogate you.

191
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,630
But considering our past relationship,

192
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,850
you can choose
your own torture instruments.

193
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,120
Come here.

194
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
Come here now.

195
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,090
See if you recognize this.

196
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,790
It's my family heirloom.

197
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,550
It's just an ordinary jade pendant,

198
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,250
commonly found in markets,

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,570
with nothing special about it.

200
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,320
People often like

201
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,200
to wear jade pendants as earrings,

202
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,660
but this one is different.

203
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,080
One of my ancestors

204
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
was shot in the right eye
on the battlefield.

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,480
When he was buried,

206
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
this jade pendant
was placed in his eye socket,

207
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,270
in the hope he would be

208
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,870
whole again in the next life.

209
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,340
Later, a flash flood collapsed the tomb,

210
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
and this jade pendant

211
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,790
eventually came into
my grandmother's possession.

212
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,390
She's kept it all these years.

213
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,940
I couldn't possibly mistake it.

214
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,070
If the owner says so,

215
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,280
then it must be true.

216
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,580
These cunning bandits

217
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,350
took only ordinary items,

218
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,390
thinking they could fool everyone.

219
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,440
You caught the thieves so quickly?

220
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,080
Listen.

221
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,060
Injustice!

222
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,630
The officials are wrongly
accusing innocent people!

223
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,160
Injustice!

224
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,720
Injustice!

225
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,840
The officials are wrongly
accusing innocent people!

226
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,440
My Lord.

227
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,200
It's him! It's him!

228
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,630
The gold and jade in that box

229
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,760
were brought by him.

230
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,270
The precious gems

231
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,330
were all pried out.

232
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,440
So you're a master thief!

233
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,750
You've ruined me!

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,080
My Lord, please see clearly.

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
You must bring me justice!

236
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,440
I travel far and wide doing business,

237
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,090
collecting gold and gems
through hard work.

238
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,840
This dishonest merchant
tried to lowball me,

239
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,030
and when I refused,
he accused me of being a thief.

240
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,550
You

241
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,510
shameless bastard!

242
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,650
My Lord, this is unjust!

243
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,550
I'm innocent, My Lord!

244
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
Continue beating him.

245
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Yes.

246
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,980
You're killing an innocent man, My Lord!

247
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,720
My Lord,

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,850
He Cifu refuses to confess
even if it means death.

249
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,630
My grandmother is bedridden after a stroke

250
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,630
and cannot speak.

251
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,480
I'm already a prisoner,

252
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,700
so my testimony isn't credible.

253
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,050
If you can't make the thieves talk,

254
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,230
how will you solve this case?

255
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,320
My Lord,

256
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,080
these thieves are extremely cunning.

257
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,270
They're hiding separately

258
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,790
and can't be caught all at once.

259
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,670
Even those two

260
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,750
were only caught

261
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,030
while they were trading
with the jewelry shop,

262
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,510
when we quietly apprehended them.

263
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,960
I fear if we delay too long,

264
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,820
the rest of the bandits will flee.

265
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,150
It's the first watch already.

266
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,850
Caught red-handed
yet still refusing to confess.

267
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,200
They must have powerful backing.

268
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,750
Well, encountering these vicious

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,260
and heinous criminals

270
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,720
gives me a chance to show my skills.

271
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,630
Before the third watch tonight,

272
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,030
I will make those bandits

273
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,570
voluntarily confess to their crimes.

274
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,960
You said it yourself

275
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,570
that you believe I can
distinguish right from wrong

276
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,430
and give justice to the innocent.

277
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,020
How could I possibly disappoint you?

278
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,620
Then I'll wait and see.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,790
Water.

280
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,200
I need water.

281
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
I need water.

282
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,100
What are you yelling
about in the middle of the night?

283
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,050
Until you sign,

284
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,670
you won't get a drop of water.

285
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,600
Keep yelling and I'll cut out your tongue.

286
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,120
The officials are wronging
an innocent man!

287
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,050
Shut your mouth!

288
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,480
Mr. Xu, give him some water.

289
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,550
Then we'll all have some peace.

290
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,940
So he won't make a racket
in the middle of the night.

291
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,980
It's so annoying.

292
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,080
You...

293
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,490
If you want to live, don't ask questions.

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,240
Hurry, put on his clothes.

295
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,920
I'll lead you out of the city
under cover of darkness.

296
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,150
Someone will meet you
in the west of the city.

297
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,480
I knew Mr. Yang

298
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,850
would keep his word.

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,120
That patron of his

300
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,200
truly has incredible

301
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,960
influence.

302
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,930
Where's my man?

303
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,040
Everything's arranged. Hurry!

304
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,870
I'll go check ahead.

305
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,070
Don't wander around.

306
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,770
Let's go.

307
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
As if they

308
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,150
could make me talk.

309
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,030
I fear neither fire nor water,

310
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,160
nor blade nor spear!

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,550
This way.

312
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,960
The two ringleaders know they are sinful.

313
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,270
They assaulted the guards late at night

314
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,670
and escaped from prison.

315
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,200
They can be executed immediately
according to the law.

316
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,530
Execute them on the spot

317
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,790
to set the public's mind at ease.

318
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,510
No, no, no!

319
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,840
You haven't even tried
my case in court yet!

320
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,250
You... You can't kill me!

321
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,960
Before, you were a suspect,

322
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,870
so naturally you needed to be questioned.

323
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,720
Now you're an escaped prisoner.

324
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,850
What's wrong with killing you?

325
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,670
Do it.

326
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll talk! I'll talk!

327
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,910
I'll confess everything!

328
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,560
Please don't kill me!

329
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,480
It was... It was Yang Yitang.

330
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,150
He approached me first for the deal.

331
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,960
He said he had powerful backing.

332
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,280
That if we were caught by officials,
it wouldn't matter.

333
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,560
Someone would save me.

334
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,170
So there really is
a powerful patron behind this.

335
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,120
However, I had already

336
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
suspected all of this.

337
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,890
No need for your redundant words.

338
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,440
Jun Dai.

339
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,030
I know

340
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,170
where that Yang fellow is hiding!

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,510
Please, My Lord, don't kill me!

342
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,870
It's the third watch already.

343
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,600
Coming, coming!

344
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,790
Who are you people?

345
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,390
Seize him!

346
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,960
Everyone,

347
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,330
what are you doing?

348
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,860
Don't move!

349
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Search the place!

350
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,390
Who are you people anyway?

351
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,750
My Lord, there's no one inside.

352
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,950
Nothing here either.

353
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,300
The suspect climbed
over the wall and escaped.

354
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,849
After him!

355
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:10,380
Yes, sir!

356
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,230
The fugitive is ahead! Hurry!

357
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
I'll wait until five at most.

358
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,640
Please pass on my message.

359
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,099
If I don't see Lady Yunshu,

360
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,240
then I'll meet her at Chongxi Hall.

361
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,400
Lady Yunshu, Mr. Bai is...

362
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,520
You may leave.

363
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,800
Why have you come here?

364
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,800
Lu Jianglai is hunting me down.

365
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,030
You need to help me leave Linji quickly.

366
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,760
Your patron has abandoned you,

367
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,750
so now you come to me seeking refuge?

368
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,240
Lady Yunshu, you're mistaken.

369
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm not here seeking refuge.

370
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,840
After all, we were once allies.

371
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
If I'm captured,

372
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,110
I'm afraid you

373
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,910
won't have a good ending either.

374
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,920
You're threatening me?

375
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm just helping you see

376
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,720
the current situation clearly.

377
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,510
You just said

378
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Lu Jianglai is hunting you down.

379
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
You escaped from him?

380
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,000
That's right. Before he discovers me,

381
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,280
help me leave the city quickly.

382
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,330
I deliberately left

383
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,280
one side of this trap net open

384
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,270
so Yang Yitang could go

385
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,730
where he's supposed to go.

386
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,720
Where?

387
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
I have men watching
the Provincial Governor's Office.

388
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,090
If Jiang Yiqian

389
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,220
is truly his patron,

390
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
then he must be

391
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,160
caught at
the Provincial Governor's Office.

392
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,420
That would be catching them red-handed.

393
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,170
You people

394
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,790
are so cunning.

395
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,340
What if he doesn't dare

396
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,960
go to the Provincial Governor's Office?

397
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,750
Then he must have

398
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,200
other accomplices in the city.

399
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
Catching them all would be convenient.

400
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,750
I suspect this person

401
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,880
might be at...

402
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,240
Where?

403
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,830
My Lord, that Yang fellow

404
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,760
is heading toward the Rong family.

405
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,400
My Lord,

406
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,200
since the trouble is at my home,

407
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
please allow me to capture them myself

408
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,500
to prove my innocence.

409
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,110
You're afraid I might
let the criminal escape

410
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,510
and implicate yourself?

411
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,210
Now that I'm useful to you,

412
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,440
Lady Shanbao,

413
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,630
you're finally being nice to me.

414
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,090
I fear that someday

415
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,750
when you clear your name,

416
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
you'll throw me over the wall again.

417
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,510
I won't.

418
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,910
You're not lying to me?

419
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,850
Fine, I believe you.

420
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,790
But Lady Shanbao, don't be impatient.

421
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,840
It's better to catch someone in the act.

422
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
You've made up your mind?

423
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,030
You used threats and inducements.

424
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,160
How could I not come?

425
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,370
Are you reluctant?

426
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,550
What you're asking me to give up

427
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,680
is wealth and status,

428
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,960
and the noble identity
of Lady Rong Yunshu.

429
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,270
Even if I'm reluctant,
what difference does it make?

430
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,600
Would you let me go back?

431
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,400
The luggage and boat have been waiting

432
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,670
at the dock for some time.

433
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,400
Let's go.

434
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,070
Yunshu, don't be mad at me.

435
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
After the spring examination is over,

436
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,260
I'll bring you back

437
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,410
to apologize to Grandmother.

438
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,350
You're just afraid I might

439
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,070
poison that wicked old woman.

440
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,550
That's why you're in such a hurry

441
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,650
to force me to leave,

442
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,380
not even daring to say goodbye.

443
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,680
Now that things have come to this,

444
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,540
why still pretend to be virtuous?

445
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,640
I know you talk tough
but have a soft heart.

446
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,550
You certainly wouldn't do

447
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,280
something so unconscionable.

448
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,750
Yunshu.

449
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,510
You've been mad at me the whole way.

450
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,770
Have some water first.

451
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,070
You're wrong.

452
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,110
What?

453
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,830
Come out.

454
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,510
Don't move, Mr. Bai.

455
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,790
This boat is small and the river is deep.

456
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,070
Fall in and your body will never be found.

457
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,670
You agreed to come with me

458
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,030
just to help him escape?

459
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,650
Lady Yunshu and I

460
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,980
are on the same side.

461
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,110
If you're smart,

462
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,110
you should know your place.

463
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,640
Don't you know

464
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,040
what kind of person he is?

465
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,880
How could you

466
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,140
get involved with him?

467
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,350
Did he threaten you?

468
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,410
You're no different from him.

469
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,640
You're both threatening me.

470
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,690
Don't worry. Once I'm safe,

471
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,440
I'll naturally be discreet

472
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,610
and won't make things
difficult for Lady Yunshu.

473
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,440
You poisoned me.

474
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,620
I despise being threatened
more than anything.

475
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,430
My life

476
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,160
must remain

477
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,350
in my own hands.

478
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,800
Hasn't Lord Lu caught up yet?

479
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
-Lady Yunshu, no sign of him.
-Fine.

480
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,860
You dare to scheme against me.

481
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,300
Then don't expect to get away with it.

482
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Yunshu.

483
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,200
You'll keep it a secret,

484
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,880
right?

485
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,020
I'll send you back to the capital.

486
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,830
You'll swallow

487
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,200
what you know, okay?

488
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,680
No.

489
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,720
I want you to leave with me.

490
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,400
I told you,

491
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
I hate being threatened most of all.

492
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,550
I don't know how I offended him.

493
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,640
Last night he broke into my house

494
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,440
and forced me to help him escape.

495
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,720
Fortunately, I'm always cautious

496
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,460
and carry sedatives with me,

497
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,280
so I was able to capture him.

498
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,770
Such a villain disrupts public order.

499
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,560
I hope you'll punish him
properly, Lord Lu.

500
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,390
Of course.

501
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,250
Where is Bai Yingsheng?

502
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,000
Bai tried to protect me

503
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,640
but was thrown into
the water by this villain.

504
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,030
I've been searching but found nothing.

505
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,480
Now that I've handed the criminal over

506
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
to you, Lord Lu,

507
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,890
I'll continue searching for Bai.

508
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,750
Get more people

509
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,030
to search for Bai Yingsheng.

510
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,880
Yes, My Lord.

511
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,490
Let's go.

512
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,270
This sister of yours

513
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,680
is truly extraordinary.

514
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,140
I fear she already saw through

515
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,070
my intentional release of Yang Yitang,

516
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,070
so she deliberately planned

517
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,400
to hand over Yang Yitang

518
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,200
to clear herself of suspicion.

519
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,600
If Yang Yitang implicates her later,

520
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,030
it will only be seen as

521
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,640
an act of personal revenge.

522
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,590
She managed to stay in Rong Mansion,

523
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,790
keeping a low profile for over a decade.

524
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,060
She's certainly no ordinary person.

525
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,890
I won't let any of those

526
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,750
involved in this case off easily.

527
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,720
Bai Yingsheng's fate remains unknown.

528
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,780
This case will not be closed hastily.

529
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,330
Come to think of it,

530
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,240
you two have been

531
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,700
sisters for over a decade.

532
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,380
If she remains obstinate,

533
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,270
could you bear to take action yourself?

534
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,170
[Imperial Inspector Luo Deze,
newly appointed by the Court,]

535
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,060
[will arrive in Linji tomorrow.
All preparations are in place.]

536
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,510
My Lord,

537
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,310
the new Imperial Inspector
sent by the court

538
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,040
will arrive in Linji tomorrow.

539
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,240
Bind him first.

540
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,250
I will interrogate him through the night.

541
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,630
This case is no small matter.

542
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
It involves the Emperor's
beloved officials.

543
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,680
It's not something that can be easily
handled by local authorities.

544
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,010
Please, Lord Luo, make a decisive action.

545
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,670
Please immediately send

546
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,960
a memorial to the imperial court,

547
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,220
requesting judgment.

548
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,550
My Lord.

549
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
My Lord, Prefect Lu Jianglai
requests an audience.

550
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,970
Good timing.

551
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,310
If he hadn't come,

552
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,870
I would have sent someone to question him.

553
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,470
Bring him in.

554
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,510
Yes.

555
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,640
Lord Luo, forgive me
for not greeting you properly.

556
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,550
My Lord, you carry
a heavy responsibility on this visit.

557
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,070
Let's skip the pleasantries.

558
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,240
Once the case is resolved,

559
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,440
I will host a welcoming banquet for you.

560
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,320
Guards, bring in the prisoner!

561
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,240
Lord Lu!

562
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,930
What is the meaning of this?

563
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,270
You're conducting a trial

564
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,860
in the Provincial Governor's Office?

565
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,520
Lord Jiang, please calm down.

566
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,310
Lord Luo,

567
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,750
He Cifu is the real

568
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,350
ringleader who robbed the Rong Mansion.

569
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,590
The remaining 16 criminals

570
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,920
have all been captured.

571
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,160
He confessed that

572
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,030
he was acting under orders
from the corrupt merchant Yang Yitang

573
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,350
and secretly hid stolen weapons
in the tea plantation

574
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,790
to frame Rong Shanbao.

575
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,210
Yang Yitang,

576
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,740
repeat what you told me

577
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,310
to the Imperial Inspector.

578
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,480
All the stolen goods have been found.

579
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,220
If you don't
name the mastermind behind this,

580
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,560
you alone will bear

581
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,570
the serious crimes of murder, robbery,

582
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,440
and falsely accusing the innocent.

583
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,170
You'd better think carefully.

584
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,160
Imperial Inspector,

585
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
I don't have the guts.

586
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,080
It was all...

587
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,240
It was all the order of Governor Jiang.

588
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,340
Preposterous!

589
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,750
Do you know that falsely accusing
a government official

590
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,480
is punishable by death by dismemberment?

591
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,240
Heaven knows

592
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I dare not lie.

593
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,640
Ten years ago, you arbitrarily ruled that

594
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,790
Wei Kejian was a murderer.

595
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,830
To quickly close the case
and quiet public opinion,

596
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,680
you instructed Xu Song

597
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,090
to substitute a male corpse for Madam Yang

598
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,440
and hastily closed the case.

599
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,680
You feared that Lu Jianglai
and Rong Shanbao

600
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,810
would continue investigating.

601
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,120
You also feared
those county officials in prison

602
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,510
might overturn the verdict
and take it up the chain.

603
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,200
Sooner or later,
it would come back to you.

604
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
So you decided
to eliminate all loose ends.

605
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,070
You keep saying I instructed you.

606
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,050
What evidence do you have?

607
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,790
For our regular communications,

608
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,260
you always sent him to find me.

609
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,920
I remember

610
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,070
every time and place clearly.

611
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,270
Imperial Inspector.

612
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,590
My Lord, I have no idea

613
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,320
what this man is talking about.

614
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,610
Lord Luo, you heard it with your own ears.

615
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,660
Now you understand

616
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,690
how difficult this case is to judge.

617
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,960
I came to Linji

618
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,590
originally to deliver
birthday gifts to the Empress Dowager,

619
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,920
never expecting to encounter such a case.

620
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,000
This tea farmer, Chen Asong,

621
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,400
has accused Rong Shanbao
of using tea cultivation as a cover

622
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,950
to secretly forge weapons
and store thousands of armors.

623
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,920
To be safe,

624
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,110
I have consulted with
the Provincial Governor

625
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,600
to immediately deploy troops
and search the mountains.

626
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,930
My Lord, this matter...

627
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,710
Take Rong Shanbao along.

628
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,320
Lord Lu, please.

629
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,070
Lord Lu, what should I do?

630
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,280
My Lord! My Lord!

631
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,190
Lady Shanbao isn't at the tea plantation.

632
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,800
The officials have arrested many people.

633
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,400
Everyone is scattered and in chaos.

634
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,040
Thankfully, you two ladies came to help.

635
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,179
Otherwise, when Lady Shanbao returns,

636
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,150
I wouldn't know
how to explain this situation.

637
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,610
We are sisters, after all.

638
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,000
No need to be so formal.

639
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,889
If I were in trouble,

640
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,880
your lady

641
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,610
wouldn't stand by idly either.

642
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Such a major incident has happened,

643
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,360
yet Grandmother is being biased,

644
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
ignoring Shanbao completely.

645
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,280
Who knows

646
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,590
what the Rong family

647
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,640
will become in the future?

648
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,270
Lady Shanbao is back!

649
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,440
Shanbao!

650
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,690
Shanbao, why have
the officials come again?

651
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,710
Lord Luo,

652
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,430
the troops inside
and outside the tea plantation

653
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,920
have already completed their search.

654
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,960
I fear this time

655
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,960
someone is afraid of being investigated

656
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,760
and deliberately wasting time.

657
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,590
Lu Jianglai,

658
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,840
don't think that because
you're favored by His Majesty

659
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,770
you can disrespect your superior.

660
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,800
As the saying goes,
a cunning rabbit has three burrows.

661
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,320
If the Rong family has tunnels,

662
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,360
wouldn't they have them
in the mountains too?

663
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,290
It's better to search thoroughly.

664
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,280
Bring the person up here.

665
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,690
Lady Rong Shanbao,

666
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,120
do you recognize him?

667
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,440
Traitor!

668
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,310
What nonsense

669
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,470
have you been telling the officials?

670
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,800
Lady Shanbao has been kind to you
because of your young age,

671
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,110
taking special care of you,

672
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,510
yet you dare to falsely accuse her?

673
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,440
Aren't you afraid heaven's lightning
will strike you dead?

674
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,110
Speak! Where are the weapons?

675
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,520
They're hidden in that cave over there.

676
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,400
Weapons?

677
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,720
How could there
be weapons on the tea mountains?

678
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,960
Search!

679
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
Take everything out!

680
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes!

681
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,400
Open it.

682
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,030
Yes.

683
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,670
This is aged green tea

684
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,240
that has been stored for 5 years.

685
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,770
Please be careful, My Lord.

686
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,980
If it gets chipped,

687
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,630
it won't sell for much.

688
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,150
Open them! Open all of them!

689
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,230
My Lord.

690
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,170
Zhang Zhong,

691
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,140
what exactly is going on here?

692
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,960
Where are the weapons you mentioned?

693
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,480
My Lord, this isn't right!

694
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,960
There must be weapons here!

695
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,800
This isn't right!

696
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,460
Quickly! Search everywhere!

697
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,070
My Lord.

698
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,250
Lady Rong Shanbao.

699
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,110
Please.

700
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,550
My Lord, spare me!

701
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,000
The Provincial Governor said

702
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,150
there must be weapons
hidden in the tea mountains

703
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,710
and that Lady Shanbao
was planning a rebellion.

704
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,970
If I couldn't confess,

705
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,430
he would beat me to death.

706
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,210
I've never heard anything

707
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,790
about privately making weapons

708
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,180
or raising troops.

709
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,810
To save my life,

710
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,760
I randomly pointed to

711
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,520
a cellar used for making tea bricks.

712
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,030
I just wanted to stay alive.

713
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,330
Please don't kill me, My Lord.

714
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,370
Don't kill me.

715
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
I only asked you to interrogate,

716
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,550
yet you used threats and bribes

717
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,590
to fabricate evidence.

718
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,650
You deserve to die!

719
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,480
Lord Luo.

720
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,890
Times have been hard these years.

721
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,320
The border regions
have suffered either natural disasters

722
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,720
or man-made calamities.

723
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,580
Whenever war breaks out,

724
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,550
the court urgently needs to transport

725
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,320
large quantities of provisions.

726
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,150
Others fear the dangers of war,

727
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,650
the long journeys and low profits,

728
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,050
avoiding it at all costs.

729
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,110
Only the Rong family
has wholeheartedly organized

730
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,640
and risked dangers
to transport provisions.

731
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,110
In just these 20 years,

732
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,220
the rice and grain
transported by our family

733
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,880
has exceeded a million loads.

734
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,920
The court still owes my family

735
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,120
for transportation.

736
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,100
Three years ago, the northern border
suffered a severe drought.

737
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,210
The court wanted to show benevolence
to pacify the people,

738
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,580
urging so urgently

739
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,150
that cotton and grain
couldn't be gathered in time.

740
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,450
Again it was the Rong family

741
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,760
who managed to rush
supplies from the south.

742
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,070
The Empress Dowager praised
our family's loyalty and courage,

743
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,870
calling us pillars of the state.

744
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,110
Lord Jiang instigated bandits

745
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,510
to plunder the Rong family.

746
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,280
When he failed to frame Lady Rong Shanbao,

747
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,540
he fabricated charges

748
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,630
and accused the Rong family of rebellion.

749
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,190
He's acting out of personal grudges,

750
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,320
framing the innocent.

751
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,550
misleading official business
and harming good people,

752
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,340
How dare he shamelessly remain
in a position of such power?

753
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,740
Lord Luo, according to our dynasty's laws,

754
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,450
those who falsely accuse
10 or more persons

755
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,670
shall suffer death by dismemberment, with
their head displayed in their hometown.

756
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,960
Lord Jiang has falsely accused

757
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,320
the entire Rong family.

758
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,510
Lord Luo, I hope you
will report to the court

759
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,560
and request severe punishment.

760
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,170
Ridiculous.

761
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,850
I came to investigate
after receiving reports.

762
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,150
How is it that when I arrive here

763
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,950
it becomes my false accusation?

764
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,560
The captured bandits
are heinous criminals.

765
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,560
They're smearing my reputation.

766
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,130
How can you believe them?

767
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,550
The tea farmers on these tea mountains

768
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,550
number 1,200.

769
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,840
Everyone is fabricating accusations
against you, Lord Jiang.

770
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,880
Lord Jiang, you truly

771
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,680
have lost the people's support.

772
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,760
The tea farmers on these mountains

773
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,630
are all your Rong family's people,

774
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,360
so of course they speak for you.

775
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,410
Since taking office,
I have been upright and honest,

776
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,380
never forming factions or cliques.

777
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,240
The Rong family

778
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,960
has absolute power in Linji.

779
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,380
Now you've brought Lu Jianglai

780
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,310
under your wing.

781
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,190
You're afraid that I, as Governor,

782
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,960
will block your money-making schemes.

783
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,550
So you've joined forces

784
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,270
to get rid of me.

785
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,710
Take a look

786
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,960
at this.

787
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,970
An heirloom jade seal.

788
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,360
Lord Jiang, to cover up his own mistakes,

789
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,890
falsely accused my family
of making weapons.

790
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,560
What are his true intentions?

791
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,980
Or do you think

792
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,180
by sacrificing a minor official,

793
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,360
you can shift the blame

794
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,820
and wash your hands clean?

795
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,800
Lord Luo,

796
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,150
are you just going to stand by

797
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,440
while loyal subjects are wronged?

798
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,150
Rise.

799
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,070
I represent the Emperor
on this inspection.

800
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,000
I never expected

801
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,230
to encounter such
a serious case of false accusation.

802
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,440
The truth is clear to all.

803
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,170
I must thoroughly investigate

804
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,140
and question those responsible.

805
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,840
Please rest assured.

806
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,590
I will never

807
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,380
wrong an innocent family.

808
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,700
Justice will not be compromised.

809
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,100
Lord Luo, you're wise.

810
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,430
I hope you'll examine
this case carefully, My Lord.

811
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,790
[Tea Brick]

812
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,230
This is aged green tea

813
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,760
that has been stored for 5 years.

814
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,290
Please be careful, My Lord.

815
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,570
If it gets chipped,

816
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,230
it won't sell for much.

817
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,440
[Tea brick;
Dense structure; Improves with age]

818
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,030
Why did ancient people

819
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,830
make tea leaves into tea bricks?

820
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,080
Just imagine.

821
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,030
In ancient times,
there were no refrigerators

822
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,150
or express delivery services.

823
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,960
If tea leaves weren't properly stored,

824
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,360
they would easily spoil.

825
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,070
And tea leaves are very fluffy,

826
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,280
taking up a lot of space during transport.

827
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
So clever ancient people

828
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,610
came up with a solution.

829
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,000
They steamed the tea leaves until soft,

830
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,150
then used molds

831
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,610
to press them into blocks.

832
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,980
Just like making cookies.

833
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,320
This made them easier to preserve

834
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,720
and convenient to carry.

835
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,190
Tea bricks were first used
in the imperial court

836
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,480
and by the nobility.

837
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,100
Then they spread to frontier regions.

838
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,150
They became treasures

839
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,480
that nomads couldn't live without.

840
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,760
They would carry tea bricks
while riding on horseback,

841
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,960
brewing a cup whenever they wished—

842
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,040
not only to quench their thirst,
but also to aid digestion.

843
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,680
The production process of tea bricks

844
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,600
preserves active ingredients

845
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,590
while creating a compact structure.

846
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,390
This achieved

847
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,150
the legendary quality
of improving with age.
