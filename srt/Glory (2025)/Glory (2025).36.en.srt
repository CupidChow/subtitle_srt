1
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,750
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,430
It was me.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,539
I was the one who killed Xue Shuyu.

5
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,950
You wicked woman!

6
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,430
I knew it was you!

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,870
Madam,

8
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,070
don't speak rashly out of anger.

9
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,530
You can't just
confess to crimes recklessly.

10
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,370
Xue Maotang.

11
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,130
You've neglected me for 20 years.

12
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,289
Now that I've killed one of your sons,

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,630
it's actually letting you off easily.

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,110
It's just that back then,

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,910
I should have

16
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,000
killed this honey-tongued

17
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,829
and evil-hearted

18
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,970
woman, too.

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,490
I didn't expect that

20
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,710
she would turn into a venomous snake today

21
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,680
and bite me back.

22
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,320
I shouldn't have pitied you at that time.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,750
I pitied you
for being a widow as a young girl,

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,550
so I often showed you extra care.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,920
Just let it be.

26
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,150
I was truly as blind as a bat.

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,690
It was my own fault
for misjudging this woman.

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,120
I am...

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,000
the real blind one here.

30
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,750
At this point,

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,520
I'll let you decide what to do to me.

32
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,190
But we've been husband and wife
for many years,

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,430
and I know a big secret

34
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,750
about Your Highness.

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,870
I suppose trading this secret

36
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,190
for my own life

37
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,390
would still be worthwhile.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,250
Stop playing tricks here.

39
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,530
Do you think I would trust you?

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,030
Don't you want to know

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,400
why Madam Han passed away
in her prime years,

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,030
being unable to wait for your

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,490
triumphant return?

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,520
Tell me.

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,100
Your Highness!

46
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,570
Your Highness!

47
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,750
Your Highness!

48
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,680
-Madam!
-Madam!

49
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,370
Your Highness!

50
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,390
Hurry! Hurry!

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,210
Hurry up!

52
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,329
Your Highness!

53
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,610
Your Highness!

54
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,370
Endure the pain! Endure the pain!

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,000
Madam!

56
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,280
Xue Maotang!

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
So you know the pain, too?

58
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,080
Hurry up!

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,680
How I wish I could...

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
Hurry up!

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,030
How I wish I could

62
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,600
bite your entire ear off!

63
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,570
For these 20 years,

64
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,410
you've resented and hated me

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,340
while I've been painstakingly
managing the household

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
for you.

67
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,220
But you couldn't see it.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,870
Nor could you hear it!

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,740
For these 20 years,

70
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,990
I've sacrificed so much for you.

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,890
But in the end,

72
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,360
you, Xue Maotang,

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
wouldn't even give me

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,310
a house to live in.

75
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,040
And now,

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,810
you actually want to...

77
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,600
you actually want to frame me

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
and kill me.

79
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,600
If you want me to die,

80
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,510
I can die.

81
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,600
But I refuse

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
to die like your Madam Han,

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,960
who passed away silently without a trace!

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,870
Even till now, you still don't know

85
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,750
how Madam Han died, do you?

86
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,040
She was...

87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,500
She was worn down by you to death.

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,540
Your houseful of concubines made her

89
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,110
so angry that she died!

90
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,890
If you want me to die today,

91
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,370
I'll die in front of you.

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,220
But let me tell you.

93
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,080
We are all human beings.

94
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
We are not stones.

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,270
Nor are we tools!

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,040
We are living people!

97
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,190
I would laugh and cry.

98
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,920
I would also be weak sometimes.

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,000
And I have feelings, too!

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Fine.

101
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,270
You want to die?

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,330
I'll grant your wish!

103
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,720
Come on!

104
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,720
Come on!

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Your Highness!

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,000
No!

107
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,890
Don't do this!

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,830
Step aside!

109
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,780
Your Highness!

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
She's a second-rank titled lady.

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,630
No matter what crimes she has committed,

112
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,280
she must be tried according to the law.

113
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,440
Your Highness, do you really

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,430
want to kill a titled lady illegally?

115
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,600
You rebellious son!

116
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,600
She killed your own brother
with her plots.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,950
Are you still trying to help her

118
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,150
harm your own father?

119
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,680
Step aside!

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,140
You brute!

121
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,480
Bad news!

122
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,530
Miss Sun...

123
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,500
Miss Sun fell into the lake!

124
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,510
Good child.

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,610
Go find your mother.

126
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,900
Mother!

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,310
Yu, are you alright?

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,000
Aunt's little dog

129
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,560
fell into the pond just now.

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,070
I wanted to pull it out,

131
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,430
but I carelessly fell into the pond.

132
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,040
Xiu Qiong.

133
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,680
Luckily, Miss Rong was passing by

134
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
and pulled me out.

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,650
Fortunately, the dog is fine, too.

136
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,020
I'm glad you're both fine.

137
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,200
As a mother,

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,120
one should

139
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
set a good example for her children.

140
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,510
Murder and false accusations

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,950
are things that we shouldn't

142
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,410
let the children witness.

143
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,430
Mrs. Xue,

144
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,830
you'd better ask someone

145
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,430
to escort Miss Sun back home.

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,440
Lian Xin, hurry!

147
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:35,960
Yes.

148
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,850
Come on.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,710
The sea of suffering is boundless,

150
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,630
but salvation awaits those who turn back.

151
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,760
Princess Jinxiang,

152
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,030
was he

153
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,750
truly killed by the duke's wife?

154
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,460
Miss Rong.

155
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,730
You're truly impressive.

156
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,680
I did it.

157
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,160
Xue Shuyu

158
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,180
was killed by me.

159
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,680
Yingchuan, you...

160
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,150
Why did you do that?

161
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,830
I originally planned

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,730
to blame everything on Mother.

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
After all, Father didn't care for her,

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,510
and she was already terminally ill.

165
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:39,870
Madam.

166
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,200
So what if she takes the blame

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
for all my crimes?

168
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,510
Who knew

169
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,630
she would be so strong-willed

170
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,650
and cause such big trouble?

171
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,790
Now I feel a bit guilty instead.

172
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,390
I don't understand.

173
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,220
You were obviously on such good terms

174
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,880
with Shuyu.

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
Why did you...

176
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,850
Others may not know,

177
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,010
but don't you know, Father?

178
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,670
You certainly know.

179
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,340
Back then,

180
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
you personally ordered

181
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,870
Xue Shuyu to take some men

182
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,440
to capture Mr. Wang and me.

183
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,080
Then you sent him

184
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
to the most dangerous battlefield,

185
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,150
causing him to die in a battle there.

186
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,480
You also took my newborn daughter

187
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,790
away from me.

188
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,510
She was only 7 days old!

189
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,600
Just 7 days old!

190
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,240
Your purpose was just to

191
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,270
quickly force me into

192
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,080
another man's bridal sedan.

193
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,910
I cried and begged.

194
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,180
But you all refused to spare me.

195
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,120
You are my own father.

196
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,890
My own younger brother did the same, too.

197
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,250
No one was willing to spare me.

198
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,880
Since you all wanted me to suffer,

199
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,200
then no one could live peacefully!

200
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,040
You...

201
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,920
You...

202
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,550
Xue Maotang!

203
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,080
Stop saying you.

204
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,830
All the members of the family

205
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,660
have been forced by you into such a state.

206
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,720
You're so nice.

207
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,170
You all...

208
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,030
Your Highness!

209
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,830
Hurry! Hurry!
Take him back to the Baoshi Hall now!

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,730
Madam, your illness is severe,

211
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,180
and you've been wrongfully accused.

212
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,870
It's understandable that you're outraged

213
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,270
and acting impulsively.

214
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,390
This is all because of the duke's
arbitrary actions that have harmed others.

215
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,520
Please go back first

216
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,100
and focus on your recovery.

217
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,120
As for Xue Yingchuan...

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Ever since Yingchuan

219
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,170
lost her child,

220
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,210
she has been suffering from hysteria.

221
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,920
Whenever she saw

222
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
Master Shuyu and the duke,

223
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,390
she would always talk about killing them.

224
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,650
She hasn't had an relapse for many years.

225
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,790
I thought she had fully recovered.

226
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,750
But seeing her today,

227
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm afraid she's having a relapse again.

228
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,840
Otherwise, how would she

229
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,970
be unable to recognize her own brother

230
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,200
and even kill him?

231
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,320
The duke

232
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,900
probably cannot make a decision now.

233
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,630
Sending the culprit to the police
would be inappropriate.

234
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,440
After all, the duke

235
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,240
cares deeply about his reputation.

236
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,460
With his wife's and children's
resentment and madness,

237
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,270
which might cause a scene in court,

238
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,670
wouldn't it become a laughingstock
of the entire city?

239
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,480
You'd better

240
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,100
handle this problem at your discretion.

241
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,110
She indeed suffers from hysteria,

242
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,370
but murder is such a serious crime
that she can't be pardoned.

243
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,370
Send her to the family temple first,

244
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,170
and find a doctor to treat her.

245
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,720
When her illness is cured,

246
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,900
she will face punishment for murder.

247
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,350
What are you all waiting for?

248
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,370
Although Ji Ping

249
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,550
also tampered with the brazier,

250
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,820
she's not the main culprit after all.

251
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,270
How should we deal with her?

252
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,800
Though she didn't kill him,

253
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,260
she did put the Valley Lily into it.

254
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,910
Send her to

255
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,510
the estate outside the city.

256
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,400
Sentence her
to five years of penal servitude.

257
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
Jianglai, Miss Rong,

258
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,480
thank you

259
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
for upholding justice here.

260
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,390
Now that the truth has been uncovered,

261
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,520
Master Shuyu can finally rest in peace

262
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,720
in the netherworld.

263
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,720
It's just that the duke

264
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,550
cannot manage affairs for the time being.

265
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,210
From now on,

266
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,220
this grand Duke of Yongguo's Mansion

267
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,770
will depend entirely
on your care, Jianglai.

268
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,320
Huiqing.

269
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,080
Shuyu's death...

270
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,710
You may leave now.

271
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,550
If there's anything in here

272
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,600
that you like,

273
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,910
just take it.

274
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,000
Such nice knee pads.

275
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,980
Does Madam not want them anymore?

276
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,030
Yeah.

277
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,050
From now on, these items

278
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,120
will never be used again.

279
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,530
Your Highness.

280
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,870
Your Highness! Your Highness!

281
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,930
Please be careful.

282
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,180
Your Highness.

283
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,390
The liver is the organ of wind and wood.

284
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,480
Irritability and rage
would cause internal liver wind,

285
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
and your stroke would become worse.

286
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
Even the greatest immortals

287
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,690
couldn't save you then.

288
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,320
I don't need a doctor.

289
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,150
Get out!

290
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,660
Ask Jianglai to come here.

291
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,630
Just go!

292
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,510
Last night,

293
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,319
my brother apologized to me.

294
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,110
I thought

295
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,000
we would still
have much time together in the future.

296
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,670
Jianglai.

297
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,530
Master Shuyu's death...

298
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,580
Don't say it.

299
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,710
Don't say anything.

300
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,800
Alright.

301
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,520
Let's both remain muddle-headed.

302
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,030
Master Jianglai.

303
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,440
Your Highness,
why have you summoned me here?

304
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,840
You don't need to
be so alert to everything.

305
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,410
I'm not trying to argue with you here.

306
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,420
I used to believe

307
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,590
a real man
should aspire to conquer the world

308
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,600
rather than worry about household matters.

309
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,530
Only until now have I realized that

310
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,840
in this household,

311
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,830
everyone resents me.

312
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm a bad husband

313
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
and a bad father.

314
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,110
As for your brother's incident,

315
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,790
I don't want to pursue it anymore.

316
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,030
It's up to you

317
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,960
how to handle it.

318
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,480
Tomorrow, I'll submit a memorial,

319
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,740
asking His Majesty

320
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,920
to let you be the duke's heir

321
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,160
so that you can rightfully
return to our family.

322
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,070
When I can walk again,

323
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,400
let's

324
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,050
go to Jiangnan personally

325
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,880
to move your mother's grave back here.

326
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,350
Though I know it's too late,

327
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,030
it might at least slightly make up for

328
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,200
the guilt in my mind

329
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,920
and your regrets.

330
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,900
What exactly do you want, Your Highness?

331
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,520
Just speak frankly.

332
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm getting old now.

333
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,720
My shoulders can no longer bear

334
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,650
the weight of this Duke's Mansion.

335
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,300
From now on,

336
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,370
I'd like to entrust the Xue family

337
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,400
and this child

338
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,400
to you.

339
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,160
Xun.

340
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,370
Go bow to your Uncle Jianglai.

341
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,130
Uncle Jianglai.

342
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,410
No need for this.

343
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,450
Your Highness.

344
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,310
The person who you should apologize to
has passed away.

345
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,110
Why do you have to put on this act?

346
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,850
I'm sorry but I can't stay with you.

347
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,930
Uncle Jianglai, don't go!

348
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
If you insist on leaving,

349
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,920
I know I can't keep you here.

350
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,830
However,

351
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,110
please think more about

352
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,880
this child.

353
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,120
He's only 7 years old.

354
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,880
Forcing him to bear such a heavy burden

355
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,790
will certainly

356
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,990
crush his young and fragile shoulders.

357
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,750
I know I'm not a good father.

358
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,670
I've failed to
educate your brother properly.

359
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,750
But can you bear to watch

360
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,960
his only child

361
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
also emulating him

362
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,510
in the future?

363
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,880
Uncle Jianglai, don't go!

364
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,070
Father is dead.

365
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,100
I'm so scared.

366
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,370
Could you please

367
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,480
stay with me?

368
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,480
Uncle Jianglai!

369
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,750
I'm begging you!

370
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,440
Uncle Jianglai!

371
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,590
Uncle Jianglai!

372
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,820
Uncle Jianglai!

373
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,780
[Imperial Yongguo Mansion]

374
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,000
Wait!

375
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,590
Yu.

376
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,680
Your auntie is leaving.

377
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,880
Go say goodbye to her.

378
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,790
Auntie.

379
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,370
Stay away from me.

380
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
Don't live like I did.

381
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
All of you, put these away properly.

382
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,490
-Yes.
-Yes.

383
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,110
Yes.

384
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,970
Your Highness.

385
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,010
Clean up everything

386
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,070
in the courtyard.

387
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,510
Don't leave any old items here.

388
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:10,960
Yes.

389
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,350
I will make an inventory of them all

390
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,080
and put them in the storehouse.

391
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,820
There's no need for such trouble.

392
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,050
Just burn them all.

393
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,690
Your Highness.

394
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,590
The Chi Dragon Pendant in this place

395
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,200
was fastened to Master Shuyu's waist

396
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
by you personally
during his coming-of-age ceremony.

397
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,790
I noticed that

398
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,880
Master Shuyu had kept it

399
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,240
in a precious brocade box.

400
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,830
I wonder

401
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,350
how to deal with it.

402
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,890
You've reminded me something.

403
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,500
At Jianglai's coming-of-age ceremony,

404
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,450
I didn't give him anything.

405
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,720
Go to the storehouse

406
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
and select the finest piece of jade.

407
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,750
Yes.

408
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,030
You may leave now.

409
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Yes.

410
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,920
Lady Shanbao.

411
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,030
Lady Yunshu said

412
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,960
she would
personally escort you to the dock.

413
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,090
Shall we depart now?

414
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,480
I got it.

415
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,960
Wait!

416
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,150
Rong Shanbao.

417
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,610
What do you mean?

418
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,880
Are you leaving now?

419
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,640
Are you really going to

420
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,770
leave me alone here?

421
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,760
What exactly do you mean?

422
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,180
Tell me, Rong Shanbao!

423
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,510
You two may leave now.

424
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,720
Yes.

425
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm talking to you.

426
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,040
Jianglai.

427
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,790
Listen to me.

428
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,330
The Duke of Yongguo

429
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,350
was once

430
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,040
a devoted husband
who quite cherished his first wife.

431
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,590
He withstood family pressure

432
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,920
for his infertile wife.

433
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,030
Though she passed away many years ago,

434
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,760
he still hasn't forgotten her.

435
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,920
Before my father came to the capital,

436
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,450
he also had lofty ambitions

437
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,740
with high spirits.

438
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,830
He aspired to be

439
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,720
a good official
that would be remembered in history.

440
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,850
They weren't born to be so detestable,

441
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,440
but as time went by,

442
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,920
they became so different from
what they had been.

443
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,510
You have your Duke's Mansion

444
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,710
and family ties that you can't let go of.

445
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,440
I don't hope to watch you

446
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,480
become the arbitrary

447
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,590
and annoying

448
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,830
Duke of Yongguo one day.

449
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,420
Rong Shanbao.

450
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,750
You and I will stop here.

451
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,410
In my mind, you will

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,270
forever be that upright
and determined man,

453
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,000
who never curries favor
with the powerful men

454
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,420
and always remains wise, decisive,

455
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,620
clever and adorable,

456
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,460
just like the way you were
when we first met.

457
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,590
So,

458
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
please let me leave.

459
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,360
Let our memories

460
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,880
stay on this day

461
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,210
when I love you the most.

462
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,640
What if I don't allow it?

463
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,210
Will you still continue
to look for a husband?

464
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,610
I have my own responsibilities.

465
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,250
But I will never forget you.

466
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,680
In this lifetime,

467
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,480
my love will never change until death.

468
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,680
The Rong family's carriage
is already waiting outside.

469
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Are you really going to
let Miss Rong leave?

470
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,110
I was even waiting for you

471
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,350
to go back to Linji with me

472
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,480
to achieve the aspirations
of eradicating corruption

473
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,010
and benefiting the people.

474
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,880
It turns out that I've waited in vain.

475
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,440
The humble position of Prefect of Linji

476
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,350
can hardly compare with

477
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,160
this grand and luxurious Duke's Mansion.

478
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,890
She has long intended to leave.

479
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,440
On the first day

480
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,640
when she arrived at the Duke's Mansion,

481
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,350
she knew

482
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,480
this day would come.

483
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,270
How can there be

484
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,330
such a heartless woman in this world?

485
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,920
Even when she's saying goodbye to you,

486
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,830
she still wouldn't forget to use

487
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,760
the sweetest words to deceive you,

488
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,680
making you unable to forget her,

489
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,750
unwilling to hate her

490
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,960
and even more unwilling
to become her enemy!

491
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,850
♪ The music of fairies and jade flutes ♪

492
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,750
She has done all these things

493
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,880
just to get rid of me.

494
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,680
♪ The wine in the cup is as clear
as jade dew with graceful sword dances ♪

495
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,880
It's all a lie.

496
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,880
Everything is a lie.

497
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,760
♪ There are refined scholars
in white robes ♪

498
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,830

505
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Miss Rong,
do you have something to tell me?

506
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,760
Xuanyu

507
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,970
is Princess Jinxiang's
biological daughter.

508
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
My child died at the time

509
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,030
of birth.

510
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,920
I bribed those who worked for the duke

511
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,030
and dealt with the girl's servants.

512
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,760
I secretly switched the babies.

513
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,740
Your grandfather
was the head of the Imperial Hospital.

514
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,660
Mrs. Xue,

515
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,740
you must be skilled in medicine, too.

516
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,160
The rumor of the men-only inheritance

517
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,560
is also groundless, huh?

518
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,510
I merely learned the skills
through observation.

519
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,110
Those are some insignificant skills.

520
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,110
How would I dare to boast about them
in front of others?

521
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,160
Miss Ji Ping

522
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,200
also wasn't really

523
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,790
at odds with you.

524
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,750
That night,

525
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,480
you told me about your feelings

526
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,640
not because
we felt like old friends at first sight.

527
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,440
You actually wanted to stall me.

528
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,790
Lady Shanbao,
you've seen through everything.

529
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,190
Why didn't you expose it?

530
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,400
You didn't kill anyone
with your own hands.

531
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,940
So what if I expose you?

532
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,880
Master Shuyu's cruelty
to his wife and concubines

533
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,080
is well-known to all.

534
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,170
As someone with a conscience,

535
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,510
Jianglai must be suffering the most

536
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,100
because while being stuck in the dilemma,

537
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,550
he has no choice but to
remain willfully ignorant like this.

538
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,030
Only with all the endurance and plots

539
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,030
did you manage to get what you wanted.

540
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,160
Are you truly happy?

541
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,350
Miss Rong,

542
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,680
not everyone has the luck

543
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,280
to be born in the Rong family.

544
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,680
Also, not everyone has

545
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,610
the freedom to live as they please.

546
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,600
I don't have
the Founding Emperor's jade seal.

547
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,790
Nor do I have a powerful natal family

548
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,450
that's willing to support me.

549
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,480
I don't even have

550
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,410
a husband that's worth relying on.

551
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,030
In this world,

552
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,960
there isn't even

553
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,890
a single person who truly loves me.

554
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,850
But I must love myself.

555
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,980
I must protect myself.

556
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,490
And above all, I must protect my children.

557
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,200
But I still have to thank you, Miss Rong.

558
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,150
Thank you for never

559
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,880
exposing me in front of others,

560
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,870
despite having countless opportunities.

561
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,460
The duke is still vigorous in his old age.

562
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,400
Mrs. Xue,

563
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,560
I'm afraid
you can't fulfill your wish so soon.

564
