[Episode 26]

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,460
My Lord, I have failed you.

4
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,479
I fell into Rong Shanbao's trap.

5
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,590
My Lord, please rest assured.

6
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,070
I will definitely

7
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,970
deal with Yang Yitang.

8
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,230
I absolutely will not allow him

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,170
to stand in your way.

10
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,770
You have served me for years.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,860
I've treated you well, haven't I?

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Yes.

13
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,430
Yes.

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,250
Do you understand what I'm saying?

15
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,710
I understand.

16
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,920
I understand.

17
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,140
I understand.

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,000
[Linji Prefectural Office]

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,370
I was blinded

20
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,070
by greed

21
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,240
and took Yang Yitang's bribes

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,700
behind Lord Jiang's back.

23
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,060
It is well-known that Yang Yitang
holds deep resentment

24
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,460
against the Rong family.

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,829
The Rong family is wealthy enough
to rival a nation.

26
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,400
I also wanted a share of that fortune.

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Therefore, I secretly assisted him

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,410
in seeking revenge
against the Rong family.

29
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,220
Now that my crimes have been exposed,

30
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,150
I have nothing to say in my defense.

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,740
So you are claiming

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,060
that Lord Jiang
was completely unaware of this?

33
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,210
That's right.

34
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,690
The bribes I accepted from Yang Yitang

35
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,220
are hidden in my residence.

36
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,090
You'll find them if you search my place.

37
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,020
For an official to neglect his duty

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,430
is to betray the Emperor's grace.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,630
I know my crimes deserve death,

40
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,300
and I dare not implicate others.

41
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,130
I only ask for

42
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,170
some dignity after my death.

43
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,850
You don't seem surprised

44
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,310
by Zhang Zhong's suicide.

45
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,370
Jiang Yiqian has served
as an official for 30 years.

46
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,130
If he couldn't handle

47
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,390
such a trivial matter,

48
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,350
then his 30 years of service
would mean nothing.

49
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,900
He understands
how the bureaucratic game works

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
and how his superiors think.

51
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,790
Even if he's under suspicion,

52
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,100
that alone isn't enough to convict him.

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
You allowed him to meddle

54
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,980
in the Rong Mansion.

55
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,060
Wasn't that all for nothing?

56
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,780
I allowed his meddling

57
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,240
because I had other plans.

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,260
I also used him

59
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,460
to purge the traitors
within the Rong family.

60
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,710
Yang Yitang has confessed

61
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,240
to conspiring with Yunshu.

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,690
Since this matter concerns your family,

63
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,060
do you wish to handle it yourself,

64
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,350
or should I intervene and make the arrest?

65
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,550
But I must remind you—

66
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,720
the current manager of the Rong family

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,400
is her.

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,230
There is no rush.

69
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,950
She'll invite me back.

70
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,210
Now that Jiang Yiqian
has revealed his true nature,

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,420
I'm afraid

72
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,330
he’ll be even more ruthless
in seeking revenge.

73
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,010
You must be extremely cautious.

74
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,210
If things get out of hand, come find me.

75
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,860
Right now, Jiang Yiqian probably

76
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,920
wants you dead more than anyone else.

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,100
I'm just collateral damage,

78
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,630
caught in the fight between you two.

79
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,420
Since I've implicated you,

80
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,740
why not punish me

81
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,310
by keeping me as your personal guard?

82
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,100
Lord Lu,

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,740
you should now turn your attention

84
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,000
to the Wei family case.

85
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,370
Although the truth

86
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,290
of the Wei family case has come to light,

87
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,770
there are still some inconsistencies.

88
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,250
First,

89
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,740
if Jiang Yiqian didn't take bribes,

90
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,370
why would he help the Yang family

91
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,300
frame Wei Kejian
for the murder of his wife?

92
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,180
Second, who is

93
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,370
still harassing

94
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,340
Madam Yang even after she's become a nun?

95
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,180
If you think about it,

96
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,380
both matters lead back to Jiang Yiqian.

97
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,410
Rest assured,
I'll surely get to the bottom of this.

98
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,020
The fox's tail will be exposed
sooner or later.

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,740
Thank you, Lord Luo,
for uncovering the truth

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,940
and clearing my name.

101
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,510
A toast to you, Lord Luo.

102
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,240
Well,

103
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
it was simply my duty as an official.

104
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,510
You've been stationed
in Linji for decades, Lord Jiang.

105
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,170
Your truly put a lot of effort.

106
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,570
But you should stay humble and cautious

107
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,440
to secure your future.

108
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,690
Thank you for your advice, Lord Luo.

109
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,690
I will surely keep it firmly in mind.

110
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,710
With the Yang Yitang
and Zhang Zhong cases resolved,

111
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,840
Lord Luo, this time,

112
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,860
you've solved another case

113
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,620
during the Empress Dowager's
birthday celebration.

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,130
Truly, it's the most capable people
who do the most work.

115
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,190
Speaking of which,

116
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,710
the Rong family's
hundred-year-old Tea King Tree

117
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,510
is truly a wonder of nature.

118
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,550
It's absolutely breathtaking.

119
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,250
But...

120
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,300
What is it?

121
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,330
Forgive me,

122
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,250
but the Rong family has recently
suffered a series of misfortunes.

123
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,710
You should keep a close eye

124
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,330
over the birthday tribute, Lord Luo.

125
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,770
You cleared my name,

126
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,050
so my warning is out of goodwill.

127
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,330
The Rong family has long
held grudge against me.

128
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,240
I'm worried they may stir up trouble

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,770
over the birthday tribute,

130
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,060
since they're unhappy with your verdict.

131
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,659
You could be charged

132
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,120
with dereliction of duty.

133
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,060
Linji is a complex territory.

134
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,770
I'm sure you'd prefer

135
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,350
to settle things quickly,

136
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,960
before they become more complicated.

137
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,740
That's a fair point.

138
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,740
Come.

139
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,300
A toast to you.

140
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,660
How's your health?

141
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,790
Here.

142
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,460
The drowned victim is here.

143
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,690
Take him away.

144
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,070
Have a drink first to warm yourself up.

145
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,270
Thank you, My Lord,
for giving me a second chance at life.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,910
Please sit.

147
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,690
As you instructed,

148
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,400
I've warned Lord Luo
about the birthday tribute.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,060
Do you really want to stay here

150
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,170
and not return to the capital?

151
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,370
But I've heard

152
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,900
that you and Lady Rong Yunshu

153
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,960
are still engaged.

154
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,690
Once I settle this old grievance,

155
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,950
I'll leave this place.

156
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,210
I treated her with sincerity,

157
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,240
yet she discarded me like a worn shoe.

158
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,900
Therefore,

159
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,419
I will no longer lower myself.

160
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,210
I will make her understand

161
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,000
that I am not someone

162
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,140
she can toy with.

163
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,220
Good.

164
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,810
That's how a man should be.

165
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,210
So, what's your next move?

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,040
The daughters of the Rong family
appear united but are divided within.

167
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,700
We can first observe
their internal conflicts.

168
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,790
When the time is right,

169
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,370
we'll cut off the foundation
of the Rong family.

170
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:03,970
By then,

171
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,780
if you wish to take over

172
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,710
the Rong family,

173
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,230
it will be effortless.

174
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,840
Mr. Bai, you are truly
a man of exceptional talent.

175
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,440
I believe that once you enter officialdom,

176
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,450
you will certainly reach the peak.

177
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,020
Come.

178
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,820
I miss Father.

179
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,910
Li.

180
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:38,810
Look.

181
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,560
Look at these vast tea fields.

182
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,920
One day,

183
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,220
you will have your share as well.

184
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,340
You're a bad person.

185
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,450
I don't want to play with you anymore.

186
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,180
I want to find Father.

187
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,210
Li! Li!

188
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,090
Li, come back!

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,430
Yun...

190
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,920
Lady Yunxi.

191
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,780
Why are you here?

192
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,730
Didn’t I tell you

193
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,930
not to come near the Rong Mansion again?

194
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,910
I prepared some mulian tofu.

195
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,250
I remember it's your favorite.

196
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,020
And Li,

197
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,700
she likes it too.

198
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,220
The Rong Mansion lacks nothing.

199
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,000
If you dare come here again,

200
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,500
I'll have you thrown out.

201
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,040
Lady Yunxi.

202
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,780
How is Li doing?

203
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,210
Does she still need

204
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,330
to hold someone's ear

205
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,860
before she can fall asleep?

206
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,660
Has she been eating well?

207
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,040
She used to have such a sweet tooth.

208
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,690
Every time I tried to feed her,

209
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,090
I had to chase her
all around the courtyard.

210
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,770
Has she grown taller?

211
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,800
Does she...

212
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,850
miss me?

213
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,530
Lady Yunxi.

214
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,590
May I just see her for a moment?

215
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,910
I won't say a single word to her.

216
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,110
A glimpse from afar will be enough.

217
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,830
I miss her so much.

218
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,030
An Cha,

219
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,090
when you allowed Rong Shanbao

220
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,970
to take Li away,

221
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,160
you gave up on Li,

222
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,860
and you gave up on me.

223
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,610
Grandmother has no patience

224
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,270
for those who refuse to let go.

225
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,560
If you truly care for Li's well-being,

226
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,420
then stay out of her life forever.

227
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,490
Don't give people a reason

228
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,420
to laugh at her.

229
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,140
Miss,

230
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,110
The method of harvesting the Tea King Tree

231
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,420
is a family secret,
known only to the Rong family heads

232
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,020
and passed down
from generation to generation.

233
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,180
In the past, Lady Shanbao

234
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,730
was the only one who took care of it.

235
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,590
The roasting method that follows

236
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,010
is also known only to her.

237
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,800
With the Old Madam now bedridden,

238
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,610
I'm afraid she is indispensable

239
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,070
to this imperial tribute.

240
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,290
The heads of the Rong family.

241
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,420
Very well.

242
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,740
Then go and invite her back.

243
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,580
Station guards at Chongxi Hall.

244
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,570
For Grandmother's well-being,

245
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,810
no one is allowed to visit her

246
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,020
except me.

247
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,110
If you're not careful,

248
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,610
the final result will be

249
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,940
the leaves falling off.

250
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,710
How dare you come here?

251
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,070
That outfit suits you well.

252
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:16,780
You!

253
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,490
Yesterday, Lord Luo

254
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,450
sent people to ask about the tribute.

255
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,780
Only Shanbao knows

256
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,020
how to harvest the Tea King Tree,

257
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,210
which is why I came

258
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,340
to ask you to return.

259
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,660
So you came to ask for help.

260
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,940
Presenting a tribute
to the Empress Dowager

261
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,330
concerns the future
of the entire Rong family.

262
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,380
Previously,

263
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,150
Grandmother expelled you
from the mansion,

264
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,790
but she is now ill.

265
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,680
So I'm making the decision in her stead

266
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,900
to bring you back home.

267
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,230
I hope you'll think of the bigger picture.

268
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,020
Since Yunshu is willing to compromise,

269
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,550
I shall graciously accept.

270
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
I wonder, Yunshu—

271
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,950
have you found Mr. Bai yet?

272
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,070
You don't need to worry about that.

273
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,030
I'll leave the tea plantation to you.

274
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,660
Please take care

275
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,740
of Yunyin and Wanwan.

276
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,540
Rest assured.

277
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,630
I don't need anyone to look after me.

278
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,570
As for you,

279
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,630
you must stay cautious.

280
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,890
You've already been fooled once.

281
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,470
Beware those

282
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,890
who appear kind
but have a serpent's heart.

283
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,380
All of the Wei family's seized assets

284
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,510
have been returned.

285
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,690
Now it's the Wei family members

286
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,020
who are taking care of him.

287
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,350
They've consulted
countless doctors lately,

288
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,080
yet his mental condition
hasn't improved at all.

289
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,220
Do you know Yang Yun?

290
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,590
No matter what you ask, My Lord,

291
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,650
I'm afraid he won't be able to answer.

292
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,470
What did Jiang Yiqian do to you?

293
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,020
Wei has been mentally unstable for years.

294
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,820
As you can see,

295
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,330
he doesn't respond

296
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,610
to any external stimuli.

297
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,380
But the moment he heard

298
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,850
the name "Jiang Yiqian,"

299
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,660
he showed a look of terror.

300
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,040
I suspect

301
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,260
there might be a deeper secret
in Wei's old case.

302
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,300
I'll interview
Wei's family members right now

303
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,900
to see if I can find any clues.

304
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,690
Has Bai Yingsheng still not been found?

305
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,770
Not yet.

306
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,050
I've already instructed my men

307
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,450
to continue searching downstream.

308
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,390
As soon as I hear anything,

309
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,650
I'll report to you immediately, My Lord.

310
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,140
My Lord, I also heard

311
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,660
that Lady Rong Shanbao
has returned to the Rong Mansion.

312
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,370
During your absence, Shanbao,

313
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,270
did I take proper care
of the Tea King Tree?

314
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,080
Not bad.

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,940
Grandmother is bedridden
with a serious illness.

316
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,210
For this imperial tribute,

317
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,210
we'll have to count on you, Shanbao.

318
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,470
But rest assured, Shanbao.

319
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,470
I'll stay right by your side

320
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,770
until the tea roasting is finished.

321
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,370
You want to learn the method?

322
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,290
Have you forgotten that

323
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,250
the tea-making method

324
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,010
belongs exclusively
to the heads of the family,

325
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,530
and cannot be shared with outsiders?

326
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,140
Shanbao,

327
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,510
I am now the Rong family's manager.

328
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,330
Why can't you pass it on to me?

329
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,010
Have you asked Grandmother about this?

330
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,940
As I said,

331
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,380
I am now the Rong family's manager.

332
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,340
Why is that so hard for you to understand?

333
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,800
What will you do

334
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,730
if I refuse?

335
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,010
Shanbao,

336
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,820
the moment you stepped back
into the Rong Mansion,

337
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,480
you lost your right to choose.

338
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,730
If anything goes wrong with the tribute,

339
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,390
you alone will bear the blame.

340
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,450
After all, everyone saw

341
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,790
that I personally welcomed you back.

342
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,740
Shanbao,

343
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,780
you should think carefully.

344
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,620
Will you choose

345
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,550
to teach me the tea-making methods

346
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,290
or delay the tribute

347
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,680
and be arrested for it?

348
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,740
You're competing with me

349
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,770
for control of the Rong family.

350
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,180
If the family falls, we all fall.

351
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,210
If the tribute is delayed,

352
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,820
the entire Rong family will suffer.

353
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,730
Even if you win,

354
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,270
what benefits would you gain from it?

355
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,300
The one who cares more
is the one who loses.

356
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,420
Shanbao, I know

357
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,890
you value the Rong family more than I do.

358
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:35,970
Miss Shen.

359
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,140
Lady Yunxi said Li is here.

360
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,500
Please, Miss Shen, do me a favor

361
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,370
and allow me to say a few words to her.

362
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,500
I want this one.

363
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,600
Here you go.

364
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,940
She's playing over there.

365
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,960
This one is pretty too.

366
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,680
Wanwan.

367
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,210
Xiangling.

368
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,420
Father.

369
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,930
Thank you, Miss Shen.

370
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,730
Father.

371
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,290
Li.

372
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,460
Li.

373
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,970
Li, I miss you so much.

374
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,600
Do you miss me?

375
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,450
Yes.

376
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,530
Yunxi must have been blind.

377
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,860
How could she fall

378
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,140
for such a weak man?

379
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Keep your voice down!

380
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,740
Let's pick a bit of this, too.

381
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,210
Wanwan.

382
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,320
Is the tea tree a toy to you?

383
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,480
Don't touch it!

384
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,360
No!

385
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,110
Stop it, you two.

386
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,140
Why are you arguing with a kid?

387
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,740
Come here!

388
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,730
Be careful.

389
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,100
You can't catch me.

390
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,140
Sit down and have some water.

391
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,920
Li,

392
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,020
I want to take you somewhere.

393
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,690
Come here.

394
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,100
Are you coming or not?

395
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,690
No!

396
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,330
Rong Yunyin.

397
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,420
Don't go too far.

398
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,900
You can't catch me!

399
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,500
Come here.

400
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,020
Come here!

401
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,380
Lady Shanbao.

402
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,050
Lady Shanbao.

403
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,180
We're here on Lady Yunshu's orders

404
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,780
to secure Hualin Courtyard.

405
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,050
Lady Yunshu personally
welcomed Lady Shanbao back home.

406
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,620
There is no justification

407
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
for keeping her confined like this!

408
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,150
Yunshu won't allow me to see Grandmother.

409
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,310
Mr. Yan, do you know

410
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,120
how Grandmother is doing?

411
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,060
Lady Yunshu

412
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,380
hasn't actually stopped me from visiting.

413
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:54,940
Every two days or so,

414
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,540
I pay a visit to Chongxi Hall.

415
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Old Madam Rong...

416
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,490
she is still unable to get out of bed,

417
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,140
but she's speaking

418
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,400
much more clearly now.

419
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,050
While you were away from the Rong Mansion,

420
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,690
I made sure

421
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,620
to take good care of Old Madam Rong.

422
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,430
Thank you.

423
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,530
Lady Shanbao.

424
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,620
If...

425
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,230
you ever need my help...

426
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,370
No need.

427
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,530
Xiu Qiong, you may leave now.

428
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,180
You can come out now.

429
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,500
How did you know I was here, Lady Shanbao?

430
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,330
Sneaking into my courtyard—

431
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,410
you've grown increasingly rude lately.

432
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,160
I came to pay a formal visit,

433
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,660
but your servant

434
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,460
drove me away.

435
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,010
The more I thought about it,
the more uneasy I felt.

436
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,340
I was worried about you,

437
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,530
so I slipped in.

438
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,290
I intended to leave

439
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,690
once I knew you were safe.

440
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,540
But you caught me first.

441
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,460
By the way,

442
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,490
where is your

443
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,350
Steward Cheng?

444
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,150
Whenever he hears that I'm here,

445
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,480
he's always the first one
to chase me away.

446
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,450
These days,

447
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,460
has Jiang Yiqian tried to harm you?

448
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,220
You're worried about me?

449
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,740
Xiu Qiong.

450
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,310
Wait.

451
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,250
Jiang Yiqian has been very quiet lately.

452
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,410
I deliberately made a show

453
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,560
of summoning the Wei family members,

454
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,360
but he hasn't made a single move.

455
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,830
There's something I need your help with.

456
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,030
Why are you smiling?

457
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,720
Because you're actually willing
to ask for my help.

458
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,070
That's nice.

459
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,600
You were eavesdropping
on my conversation with Mr. Yan.

460
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,460
I overheard it unintentionally.

461
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,860
You said

462
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,870
you needed my help with something?

463
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,380
I'd like to see

464
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,580
the inventory list
of the Wei family's seized assets,

465
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,670
and the list of items

466
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,870
that were returned

467
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,680
after the case was closed.

468
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,650
All right.

469
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,870
I'll go to the office
and retrieve them for you.

470
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,940
But Yunshu

471
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,050
has confined you to the Rong Mansion

472
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,210
and won't allow you to see anyone.

473
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,820
Since you won't let me
sneak into your courtyard,

474
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,080
once I get the records,

475
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,300
how am I supposed to deliver them to you?

476
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,790
It won't be long.

477
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Reading a book?

478
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Dear, listen to this.

479
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,820
Do you want to hold this?

480
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,450
Yes.

481
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,180
Good. I'll put it here.

482
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,660
Is it fun?

483
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,980
Yes, it's fun.

484
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,290
You see,

485
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,900
Lord Jiang is also very fond of children.

486
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,100
Would you like to try this?

487
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,940
You will be

488
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,450
very safe here.

489
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,690
No one can

490
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,100
take Li away from you.

491
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,510
Why did you help me?

492
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,090
The women of the Rong family
are mostly heartless.

493
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,530
Since we've both been betrayed,

494
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,250
helping you

495
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,880
is no different from helping myself.

496
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,860
Lady Yunxi is not

497
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,990
a heartless person.

498
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,310
It's just that I acted on impulse.

499
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,470
Only now do I realize

500
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,340
that I can't let go of Li,

501
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,630
and I can't let go of her either.

502
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,390
Eat slowly, take your time.

503
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,860
An Cha is
Li's biological father, after all.

504
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,660
He seemed so gentle and harmless,

505
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,490
and he claimed
that you were the one who sent him,

506
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,820
so I let down my guard.

507
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,620
I was busy stopping a fight,

508
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,660
and when I turned back, he was gone.

509
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,580
He has certainly grown bolder.

510
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,910
He even learned how to deceive people now.

511
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,670
It seems I underestimated him.

512
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,870
In your opinion,

513
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,010
now that Li has been taken,

514
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,140
where would they go?

515
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,100
Do we need to send people

516
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,490
to search for her in the city?

517
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,690
He won't leave Linji.

518
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,290
You don't need to worry about it.

519
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,550
I'll find them myself.

520
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,340
After Shanbao returned,

521
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,640
-did she say...
-Miss.

522
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,050
Miss.

523
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,710
Here's a letter for you.

524
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,890
What's wrong?

525
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,260
It's just a private matter.

526
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,640
I'll take my leave now.

527
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,690
What?

528
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,970
Is Shanbao still refusing to make the tea?

529
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,930
That's not the issue.

530
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,260
A servant just reported

531
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,940
that Lady Yunxi went
to check the Tea King Tree

532
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,600
and then left with the guards.

533
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,900
What is she up to?

534
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,700
I'm not sure, Miss.

535
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,820
I only heard Lady Yunxi mentioned

536
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,660
that a wall in her courtyard collapsed,

537
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,330
so she took the nearby guards

538
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,100
to clean up the debris.

539
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,530
Fetch my clothes.

540
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,770
I must see this for myself.

541
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,370
Yes, Miss.

542
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,250
Quickly!
Find people to extinguish the fire!

543
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,900
Help! Somebody help! Hurry!

544
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,470
This...

545
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,760
Come! Come!

546
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,050
Hurry! Hurry! Come on!

547
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,450
Hurry.

548
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,690
Hurry up!

549
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,730
Put out the fire! Come on!

550
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,490
We need more people!

551
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,550
Quickly! Quickly!

552
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,210
Hurry!

553
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,690
-Water! Get the water!
-Put out the fire!

554
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,180
Coming!

555
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,020
Hurry up!

556
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,820
Hurry up.

557
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Come on, quickly!

558
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,290
Get some water from the well!

559
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,420
Bring the water here!

560
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,940
Coming!

561
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,620
It's not enough!

562
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Get another bucket of water!

563
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,970
Carry the water!

564
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,970
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

565
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,100
-Coming!
-Hurry up.

566
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,730
-Coming!
-Hurry!

567
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,400
Come on.

568
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,110
Quickly!

569
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,990
Coming!

570
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,290
Get the water!

571
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,580
Mr. Yan.

572
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,380
Mr. Yan.

573
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,540
There's a fire.

574
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,740
Did you do this?

575
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,790
What nonsense are you talking about?

576
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,390
I had nothing to do with this!

577
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,860
My courtyard wall collapsed for no reason,

578
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
so I sent Cuiwei to seek assistance.

579
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,180
After they arrived,

580
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,820
Cuiwei and I

581
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,420
watched them the whole time.

582
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,550
It only took about 10 minutes in total.

583
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,140
Yunshu,

584
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,900
you are manager of the mansion now.

585
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,180
Even if you want

586
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,770
to evade responsibility
for your poor management,

587
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,490
you should not slander me like that!

588
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,380
If you hadn't

589
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,640
moved the guards away,

590
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,180
the Tea King Tree
would never have been ruined!

591
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,820
When Shanbao was in charge,

592
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,820
the Tea King Tree was never in danger,

593
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,420
even without a single guard!

594
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,080
Ultimately, this is a result
of your own incompetence.

595
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,470
You!

596
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,890
Are you satisfied now?

597
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,580
Didn't you refuse to teach me

598
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,690
the tea-making methods?

599
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,620
Does this incident

600
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,220
have anything to do with you?

601
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:56,770
You!

602
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,140
That slap

603
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,450
was for your failure

604
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,430
to prioritize what truly matters.

605
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,030
In times of crisis,
you only think of yourself.

606
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,920
You are so obsessed with our rivalry

607
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,860
that you ignore

608
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,820
the pack of hungry wolves outside

609
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,490
waiting to devour the Rong family.

610
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,900
The Tea King Tree is ruined,

611
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,250
threatening the century-old foundation
of the Rong family.

612
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,450
Now that disaster has struck,

613
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,170
you don't think about how to fix it

614
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,130
or investigate the security breach,

615
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,660
yet you have the nerve
to vent your anger on me.

616
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,450
All of this happened

617
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,690
because Rong Yunxi

618
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,140
moved the guards away.

619
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,290
Why didn't you slap her instead?

620
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,380
Your poor management was the root of it.

621
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,530
There is a traitor
lurking in this mansion,

622
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,930
yet you noticed nothing.

623
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,290
You don't need to lecture me.

624
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,700
You're living in the Rong Mansion.

625
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,290
Now that the Tea King Tree
has been destroyed,

626
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,900
and you are also responsible for it!

627
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,770
Instead of standing here,

628
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,630
calculating who is more to blame,

629
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,940
you'd better start thinking

630
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,070
about how to deal with what comes next.

631
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,000
The imperial tribute is now destroyed;

632
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,860
this is a matter of life and death.

633
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,460
Grandmother is now severely ill

634
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,490
and cannot handle any further bad news.

635
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,150
If this reaches Chongxi Hall,

636
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,700
you'll all be punished.

637
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,290
If you want your daughter to be safe,

638
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,140
at 7 PM,

639
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,980
move the guards away
from the Tea King Tree.

640
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,340
I thought he had finally
come to his senses.

641
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,410
It turns out he was used once again,

642
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,220
and dragged me down with him.

643
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,210
What happened today
must not leave this room.

644
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,410
Yes, Miss.

645
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,630
The Empress Dowager's birthday tribute—

646
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,690
how dare you treat it
with such negligence?

647
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,210
Do you have any idea
what penalty you'll face?

648
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,970
There was a traitor in the mansion.

649
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,230
Rest assured, My Lord.

650
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
I will investigate it thoroughly

651
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,840
and give you an explanation.

652
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,290
I don't care about that traitor.

653
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,350
I want the tribute!

654
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,280
The Tea King Tree has been destroyed,

655
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,630
thereby offending the Empress Dowager.

656
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,210
How many lives will the Rong family pay

657
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,580
to atone for this?

658
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Rest assured, My Lord.

659
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,290
The Rong Mansion has other

660
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,620
century-old tea cakes.

661
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,820
They're surely

662
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,220
no inferior
to the Tea King Tree's harvest.

663
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,640
Do you not understand?

664
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,580
Her Majesty specifically requested

665
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,440
tea leaves from the Tea King Tree.

666
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,620
Her Majesty values

667
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,330
the Tea King Tree's centuries-long history

668
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,860
and its enduring blessing.

669
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,900
How could

670
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,830
any other tea possibly replace it?

671
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,530
The Rong family has grown arrogant
under royal favor.

672
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,660
You even treat
the Empress Dowager's birthday

673
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,530
with contempt.

674
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,290
You failed to deliver the tribute,

675
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,350
yet you're trying to get away with it.

676
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,530
Guards!

677
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,730
-Yes.
-Yes.

678
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,410
Take every member of the Rong family

679
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,650
to the County Office for questioning.

680
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,830
Yes, My Lord!

681
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,530
Wait.

682
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,920
Lady Rong Shanbao.

683
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,960
The Rong family's Jade Seal
is an imperial gift,

684
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,290
not a Death Exemption Token

685
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,090
to protect you from your crimes.

686
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,660
By flaunting it again and again,

687
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,210
are you trying to use royal favor

688
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,580
to stand above the law in Linji?

689
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,710
Lord Luo, you misunderstand.

690
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,040
This Jade Seal—

691
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,080
I want to entrust it to you
for safekeeping.

692
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,950
What do you mean by that?

693
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,770
The fact that the Tea King Tree got burned

694
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,230
was due to our negligence.

695
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,060
This Jade Seal is
the Rong family's heirloom.

696
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,320
I'd like to use it as a guarantee.

697
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Within five days,

698
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,290
I will surely find a tribute

699
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,150
worthy of the Tea King Tree's tea.

700
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,840
There's still time
before the Empress Dowager's birthday.

701
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,900
Why not wait five more days, Lord Luo?

702
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
I believe Her Majesty

703
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,210
would rather see the tribute presented

704
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,670
than see people punished.

705
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,340
Lord Lu, you are the magistrate of Linji.

706
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,489
You shouldn't get too close to merchants,

707
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,620
or you may invite unnecessary gossip.

708
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,260
Lord Luo, you misunderstand.

709
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,780
Today,

710
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,050
I'm not here

711
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,510
in my capacity as Prefect.

712
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,900
Then what is your role?

713
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,679
As an admirer of Lady Rong Shanbao.

714
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,120
Lord Luo.

715
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,030
What do you think?

716
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,130
I'll take this Jade Seal.

717
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,670
I hope Lady Rong Shanbao

718
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,530
will not disappoint me.

719
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,100
You have my word.

720
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,210
What kind of birthday tribute
are you going to prepare?

721
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,810
That is none of your concern.

722
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,650
For the time being,

723
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,740
you should stay in the mansion

724
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,670
and reflect upon what you've done.

725
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,260
What kind of birthday tribute do you think

726
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,320
Rong Shanbao will offer Her Majesty?

727
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,850
No matter what she comes up with,

728
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,340
the Rong family's Tea King Tree
has already been destroyed.

729
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,300
After this,

730
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,650
the Rong family will be severely weakened

731
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,980
and will never recover.

732
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,240
That's not enough.

733
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,430
We have to take her life

734
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,450
while she's vulnerable.

735
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,230
Rest assured, My Lord.

736
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,010
I already have people watch Rong Shanbao.

737
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,970
No matter what kind of birthday tribute

738
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,370
she's planning to offer,

739
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,380
I won't let her succeed.

740
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,370
No wonder they say, "One should
never underestimate a scholar."

741
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,220
You truly are

742
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,170
a lucky star sent by God.

743
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,820
Thank you for your kind words, My Lord.

744
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,420
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

745
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,610
What is it?

746
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,220
Now that the Rong family
is under house arrest,

747
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,820
I'd like you to give me control
over the guards.

748
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,660
Are you concerned
that Lady Rong Yunshu may be mistreated?

749
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,090
No.

750
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,380
She used to trample upon me.

751
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,490
Now,

752
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,450
I want her

753
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,310
to get a taste of her own medicine.

754
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,020
You've done a great service.

755
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,640
This is a small thing to ask.

756
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,160
Just consider it done.

757
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,060
Lady Shanbao.

758
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,330
Lady Shanbao.

759
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,860
Are you leaving?

760
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,530
The Rong family is in trouble.

761
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,860
You're not a member of the Rong family.

762
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,790
You may pack your things and leave.

763
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,280
Are you going to look for another tribute?

764
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,260
I'm just buying time.

765
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,900
I have to find a way

766
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,230
to save the Rong family.

767
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,220
Is there anything

768
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,080
I can do to help?

769
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,260
All my past suitors sought marriage

770
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,320
only because my name is Rong Shanbao.

771
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,820
If the Rong family falls,

772
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,600
would you still stay at the Rong Mansion?

773
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,810
I see. I have my answer.

774
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,570
What did you two talk about?

775
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,100
It's none of your business.

776
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,550
It... it's you.

777
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,990
I thought the first thing you'd say

778
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,050
when we met again

779
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,110
would be whether I am human or a ghost.

780
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,250
You were the one
who burned the Tea King Tree?

781
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,470
Shouldn't you be asking me

782
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,700
how I survived?

783
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,320
Why did you burn the Tea King Tree?

784
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,950
You really don't care if I live or die.

785
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,380
Why that look?

786
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,190
Why don't you cry, show weakness,

787
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,720
or at least try to explain
that you didn't mean it?

788
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,410
In the past,

789
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,620
didn't you play that part quite well?

790
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,910
If you want revenge,

791
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,380
don't drag the whole Rong Mansion into it.

792
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,170
The thing you're most proud of

793
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,030
is the Rong family name, isn't it?

794
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,940
If I destroy the Rong family,

795
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,810
will you still be so high and mighty,

796
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,500
looking down on everyone else?

797
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,360
Bai Yingsheng.

798
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,860
You're not this kind of person.

799
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,780
You don't know me at all.

800
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,430
Bai Yingsheng.

801
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,550
Don't go against Rong Shanbao.

802
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,980
You're no match for her.

803
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,050
This is

804
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,260
what you asked me to get earlier.

805
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,860
The inventory list
of the Wei family's seized assets.

806
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,660
It's all here.

807
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,890
This scribe here

808
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,380
must've been with the County Office
for a long time, right?

809
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,440
That's Scribe Liu.

810
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,490
He has served in the office

811
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,490
for 30 or 40 years.

812
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,980
Shouldn't you be worried
about the birthday tribute?

813
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,910
How do you still have time for this?

814
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,510
Last night at the Rong Mansion,

815
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,380
someone actually

816
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,700
managed to burn down

817
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,220
the Tea King Tree right under your nose.

818
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,020
My courtyard was being watched.

819
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,850
How could I possibly know

820
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,860
everything happening in the mansion?

821
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,610
But I've always felt

822
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,020
that you're extraordinary—

823
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,220
capable of anything.

824
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,150
I'm not sure I can do it.

825
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,820
What?

826
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:48,820
I said,

827
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,970
about the
Empress Dowager's birthday tribute,

828
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,500
I'm not sure I can handle it.

829
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,100
So what?

830
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,290
Through thick and thin,

831
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,890
I'll be right there with you.

832
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,750
What about your career?

833
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,000
I've always been alone in this world.

834
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,960
Wherever you are

835
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,790
is where I belong.

836
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,530
Have you heard of

837
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,790
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku?"

838
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,530
What is it?

839
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,300
It's a rare Song Dynasty book collection.

840
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,920
For any book lover,

841
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,930
a single glimpse
would make one's life complete.

842
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,570
If I remember correctly,

843
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,660
the Empress Dowager
loves collecting books.

844
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,710
You're planning to...

845
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,340
Exactly.

846
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,630
Her Majesty doesn't truly care about tea.

847
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,170
She's just curious about the Tea King Tree

848
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,920
because of its century-old reputation.

849
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,240
If I cater to her true interests

850
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,510
and replace the tea
with something she loves,

851
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,310
I hope it will appease her anger,

852
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,700
and give the Rong family
a chance to survive.

853
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,570
So where is

854
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,650
this rare book collection now?

855
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,050
When Mrs. Yang was alive,

856
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,970
she happened to mention it once.

857
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,500
Wei Kejian had this book

858
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,800
collected in the Wei family library.

859
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,610
No wonder you wanted to see

860
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,820
the inventory list
of the Wei family's seized assets.

861
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
While reviewing the files earlier,

862
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,570
I learned
that the year Wei Kejian was imprisoned,

863
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,610
the Wei family servants

864
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,490
fled with stolen valuables

865
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,250
and accidentally set the library on fire.

866
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,570
Could this book have been burned?

867
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,100
This book is incredibly valuable.

868
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,700
The Wei family servants
surely knew its value.

869
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,470
If they were looting the place,

870
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,780
this book would've been
their first target.

871
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,380
Wait.

872
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,940
You asked for the inventory list

873
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,700
before the Tea King Tree was burned.

874
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,220
Did you already anticipate

875
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,260
that something
would happen to the tribute?

876
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,820
No.

877
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,450
I asked for the list earlier

878
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:55,910
to find the truth

879
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,370
behind Mrs. Yang's death.

880
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,830
I was hoping

881
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,020
if I could find any clues from it.

882
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,650
Now it turns to be a lucky coincidence.

883
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,140
Time is precious.

884
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,580
I need to post notices

885
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,470
and offer a large reward for this book.

886
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,800
As for Mrs. Yang's case,

887
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,850
I'll need your help to investigate it.

888
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,780
She would never
have taken her own life for no reason.

889
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,430
Don't worry.

890
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,750
Justice will be served.

891
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,090
Those who do evil deeds
will eventually pay the price.

892
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,030
[Tea Refreshments]

893
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,430
Eat slowly, take your time.

894
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,010
China's tea refreshment culture

895
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,010
can be traced back
to the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty.

896
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,740
During the Tang Dynasty,
the decoction method was popular.

897
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,110
Tea refreshments were mostly used
to cleanse the palate,

898
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,100
such as sesame cakes and Bo-tuo noodles,

899
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,680
as well as preserved dates
and dried lychees.

900
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,000
These helped balance the tea's bitterness.

901
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,030
By the Song Dynasty,
the whisking method became trendy.

902
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,380
Tea refreshments
became more delicate and elegant,

903
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,860
like fried butter shells and spring rolls.

904
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,050
They offer a rich variety of textures.

905
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,550
During the Ming Dynasty and Song Dynasty,

906
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,140
tea refreshments became more mature.

907
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,090
During the Ming dynasty, a Tea Bureau
was established for tea banquets,

908
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,590
serving various cakes and pastries,

909
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,530
such as osmanthus cake
and gorgon nut cake.

910
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:46,380
It also served nuts,

911
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,650
like fried ginkgo nuts
and salted pine nuts.

912
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,820
Suzhou-style tea snacks,

913
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,860
such as sesame biscuits
and rose crisps,

914
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,200
were paired with Biluochun tea.

915
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,440
Northern teahouses served

916
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,510
Manchu-Han pastries,

917
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,170
like sachima, tuckahoe pie,
and pea flour cake.

918
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,690
The iconic Qing imperial tea snacks,

919
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,420
known as the "Jing Ba Jian,"

920
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,780
were paired with jasmine tea.

921
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,820
Chaozhou lard sugar pastries

922
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,560
were paired with Fenghuang Dancong tea.

923
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,220
What do you think?

924
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,600
Out of all these tea refreshments,

925
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,810
is there anything you like?
