1
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,770
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,930
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,640
I, Lu Jianglai,

4
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,759
pay my respects to Your Excellency.

5
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,700
What is this about?

6
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,479
You've come at the right time.

7
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,880
I have a question for you.

8
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,430
Open it. Show it to Lord Lu.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,150
Weren't all the Yang family members

10
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,550
imprisoned and charged?

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,140
How is he the only one left?

12
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,000
And he specifically came to my office

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,150
trying to bribe me.

14
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,040
Look at this.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,590
Your Excellency, please forgive me.

16
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,790
It was my negligence.

17
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,030
I will take him back

18
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,300
and interrogate him thoroughly.

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,500
Come, carry him away.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,130
Take all the bribe money

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,870
to the Prefect's office

22
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,130
and seal it in storage.

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

24
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,430
Lord Lu, why?

25
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,790
Did you come specifically confront me,

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
or to check whether I

27
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,710
have taken bribes

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,050
to pardon the Yang family?

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,579
Your Excellency, I would never dare.

30
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,940
Since entering
the Provincial Governor's Office,

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,590
I ordered all rooms to be closed

32
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,910
except for three?

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,240
one for my wife and me

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,190
to live in,

35
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,360
another to care for my mother,

36
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,240
and the last

37
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,000
a study for receiving guests.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,080
In my 30 years of service,

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,910
I've never kept maids or taken concubines.

40
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,240
And I have no children.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,460
The most valuable things I own

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,120
are the ancient books

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,860
and paintings in my study,

44
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,310
most bestowed by His Majesty.

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,520
Ten years ago, as Prefect of Linji,

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,970
the Wei case was sent to me for review.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
I dismissed

48
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,470
Fan Wende who conducted the initial trial,

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,070
and later appointed Xu Song
to handle the case.

50
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,190
I also reported the case

51
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,150
and requested His Majesty
to execute Wei Kejian.

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,520
But I have never accepted

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
even a penny in bribes.

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,770
Every judgment
was based on law and evidence.

55
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,079
My heart is upright,
my conduct irreproachable;

56
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,880
I have never feared idle gossip.

57
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,910
Your Excellency speaks too gravely.

58
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,510
I would never dare doubt you.

59
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,470
However,

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,840
I still dare to ask:

61
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,910
since the case is closed,

62
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,190
when will Fan Wende, Yu Cheng,

63
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,990
Huang Guangzong, and Yan Ruhai,

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,870
the officials imprisoned
over the Wei family case,

65
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,520
be released without charges

66
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,770
and restored to their positions?

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,620
Those incompetent officials

68
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,430
who delayed the case
and neglected their duties

69
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,950
couldn't even judge the case clearly,

70
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,870
leaving troubles that persist to this day.

71
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,600
I intend to request His Majesty

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,150
to punish them severely.

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,400
Your Excellency,
during this time of celebration,

74
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,710
with His Majesty's birthday
and the Longevity Festival approaching,

75
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,280
even the Government Office's
suspending criminal proceedings.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,910
Please show mercy

77
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,800
and handle them leniently.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,880
It's rare to find someone
as magnanimous as you,

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,310
willing to plead for them.

80
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,390
I'm not heartless.

81
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,430
If there's an opportunity in the future,

82
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,830
I may consider leniency.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,430
If Linji had more

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,750
pillars like you,

85
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,230
there would be no unsolved cases

86
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,800
or unredressed injustice.

87
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
In a few days, I'll go to the capital
for the celebration.

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,080
I will speak highly of you

89
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,440
before His Majesty.

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,950
Rest assured.

91
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,360
Thank you for your support.

92
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,250
Don't touch my tea!

93
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,510
What's wrong with Lady Yunyin?

94
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,440
What's going on?

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,240
No idea.

96
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,240
Give it to me.

97
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,070
Give it to me!

98
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,630
Lady Shanbao,

99
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,480
look, they're fighting again.

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,160
Let go!

101
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,240
Shanbao! Shanbao!

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,530
Yunyin's mean. She's bullying me!

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,960
Wanwan,

104
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,250
did you pick tea buds recklessly?

105
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,600
Go apologize to Yunyin.

106
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,180
Go now.

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,950
Wanwan.

108
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,430
Now even Shanbao

109
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,830
doesn't love me anymore.

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,360
I don't want to stay here.

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,630
I'm going to find Ms. Liang.

112
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,160
I'm going to find Ms. Liang!

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,630
The tea plantation is no place

114
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,830
for children to play.

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,700
I've spoiled you too much.

116
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,060
Xiu Qiong, take Lady Yunwan
back to her room.

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,250
She may come out only

118
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
when she's willing to apologize.

119
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,510
Lady Yunwan.

120
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,600
-Lady Yunwan, let's go.
-Shanbao.

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,130
Shanbao,

122
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,510
I'll never pick recklessly again.

123
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,240
Lady Yunwan.

124
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,680
-I won't be naughty anymore.
-Let's go.

125
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
Shanbao!

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,310
You always

127
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,720
side with that silly girl,

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
and it's always my fault.

129
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,850
If I don't give in to her,
I'll be punished badly.

130
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Did the sun rise from the west today?

131
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,650
Your crooked heart
is finally straight for once.

132
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,610
As if anyone cares—you biased

133
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,070
hypocrite.

134
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,270
Stop.

135
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,690
Have you finished your work for today?

136
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,000
Come with me.

137
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,310
These chicken-claw branches
need to be trimmed cleanly.

138
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,650
Make the cuts clean and sharp

139
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,310
so the canopy surface stays even.

140
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,840
Understood, Lady Shanbao.

141
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,000
Everyone, work efficiently!

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,450
All these tea trees must be trimmed today!

143
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,580
Okay. Go over there.

144
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,510
I have some over here.

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,390
The tender branches

146
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,650
need to be cut back more

147
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,510
so they'll sprout better next year.

148
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,270
Yes.

149
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,560
Give it to me.

150
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,950
-Lady Shanbao, be careful!
-Watch out!

151
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,720
The ox is startled!

152
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
Careful!

153
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,480
-Don't get hurt!
-Watch out!

154
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Get away quickly!

155
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,789
Lady Shanbao's amazing.

156
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,530
Lady Shanbao.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,650
Take it away.

158
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,200
Yes.

159
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,310
During seasons
when camel caravans can't travel,

160
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,270
the northern route
relies on ox carts to transport tea.

161
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,510
Our Lady Shanbao can

162
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,150
handle six or seven ox carts on her own—

163
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,720
what kind of situation hasn't she seen?

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,580
You even know how to control oxen?

165
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,650
I learned from the local experts.

166
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,110
I'll teach you later.

167
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,780
I won't learn.

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,520
No, you must learn.

169
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
You've been expelled
from the Rong family by Grandmother.

170
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
You'll no longer
have fine clothes and delicious food

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,220
or servants at your beck and call.

172
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,480
The tea plantation doesn't keep idlers.

173
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,810
If you want to stay here,

174
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,000
you need to start
with the most basic work.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,630
Besides cultivating and processing tea,

176
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,910
you must also
learn various local dialects.

177
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,390
Yi,

178
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,750
get Manager Qiao to come tomorrow

179
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,670
to teach her how
to judge horses and find water sources.

180
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,730
Yes, Lady Shanbao.

181
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,790
Are you really making me

182
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,120
go with the tea caravan?

183
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,480
I won't learn it.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,530
I already know everything.

185
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,360
If you can lead the team back safely,

186
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,870
so can I.

187
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,370
Do you know what food

188
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,720
gives people
the most strength in the desert?

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,250
How to feed dogs and camels?

190
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,720
What to do when you encounter

191
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
poisonous snakes or desert bandits?

192
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,910
How to survive

193
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,460
in a raging sandstorm?

194
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,600
How to identify fake ginseng?

195
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,030
How to select quality furs?

196
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,960
Can you tell the weight of a sheep

197
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,420
just by touching its back?

198
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,270
You haven't even seen a travel pass.

199
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,800
Apart from arguing with me,

200
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,300
what do you actually know?

201
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,080
Either do the work or get out.

202
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,230
No one here will indulge you.

203
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,380
Yi, let's go ahead and check.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,730
Lady Yunyin,

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,270
once your sister enters the plantation,

206
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,240
she becomes a tyrant.

207
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,790
She always stands by her word

208
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,120
and truly won't feed those who don't work.

209
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Lady Shanbao,

210
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,750
the stable manure
and bean cakes are ready,

211
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,610
and the straw has been delivered.

212
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,720
If we can finish

213
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,030
cleaning up the back area today,

214
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,120
-it's almost done.
-Yeah.

215
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,380
-Good.
-That's right.

216
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,750
Don't worry.

217
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,870
If it's not enough, have two more bowls.

218
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,750
After a long day's work,

219
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,910
all I look forward to is this hot meal.

220
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,240
Thank you, Lady Shanbao.

221
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,600
Have more.

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,730
Try this tofu today—

223
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
it's fried especially well.

224
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,060
Have some more.

225
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,720
Here.

226
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,960
It's really delicious.

227
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,940
I don't want it.

228
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,910
Stop right there!

229
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,630
Don't think that by doing this,

230
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,290
I'll remember your kindness.

231
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,480
I hate you.

232
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,550
I hate you so much!

233
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,270
The Rong family's wealth

234
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
didn't fall from the sky.

235
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,710
Back in our
great-grandmother's generation,

236
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,240
some people sought comfort

237
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,430
and entrusted the tea caravans
to chief managers.

238
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,090
As a result, within ten years,

239
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,800
those once-loyal managers

240
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,000
either started their own businesses

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
or conspired to seize power.

242
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,390
For generations,
the Rong women have been in charge.

243
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,190
If they step back even slightly,

244
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,150
their descendants would be left with

245
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,870
just 20% of the annual profits to live on.

246
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,960
How could they ever
fulfill the ancestors' glory

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,360
and build a land of peace?

248
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,840
Traveling with the tea caravans
along the borders,

249
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,040
I witnessed that all kinds of downfalls

250
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,250
stemmed from internal family strife.

251
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,510
That's why

252
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,960
every time you argued with Wanwan,

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,910
I punished you.

254
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,960
You hate me for being unfair,

255
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,260
but you forget

256
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm only three years older than you.

257
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,340
The year I took charge,

258
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,400
I was still a child myself.

259
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,120
Grandmother taught me business,

260
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
but nobody told me

261
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,120
that the first time you plunge a blade

262
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,380
into a bandit's chest,

263
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
warm blood would splash into your eyes.

264
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,050
In the dead of night...

265
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,790
I get scared too.

266
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,920
And of course,

267
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,720
no one taught me

268
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
how to be your sister.

269
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,160
So,

270
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
I could never be

271
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,080
the loving, gentle sister

272
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,650
you want in your heart.

273
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,720
But I will be

274
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,780
a fair and just head of the household.

275
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,830
[Rong Mansion]

276
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,620
I've called you all here today

277
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,910
to celebrate wonderful news.

278
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,360
Yunshu.

279
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,870
Didn't the doctor say

280
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,000
that Yunshu's eye condition was improving?

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,670
Why is she using medicine again?

282
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,200
Every year in late autumn and early winter
when the fog is heavy,

283
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Yunshu's eyes

284
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,390
always become mysteriously
sensitive to light and tear up.

285
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,320
She often covers them
with a cloth to block the light.

286
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,570
Are you feeling uncomfortable again?

287
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,920
Take it off quickly.

288
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,730
Let me do it.

289
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,670
You... you can see?

290
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,090
Cousin Xiangling,

291
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,800
are you wearing

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,330
scarlet clothes today?

293
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,430
Yes, it is scarlet.

294
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,380
You really can see now.

295
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,380
That's wonderful.

296
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,630
Yunshu's eyes

297
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,670
get better and worse intermittently.

298
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,750
When she was 12,

299
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,170
she could still see distant views,

300
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,960
which means she wasn't born blind.

301
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,700
That Doctor Sun

302
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,220
truly lives up to his reputation.

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,250
He cures eye diseases
with remarkable skill.

304
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,490
If we had gone to him earlier,

305
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,670
those quacks wouldn't have

306
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,030
delayed Yunshu's treatment.

307
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,910
Has someone been sent
to deliver the news to the academy?

308
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,030
Such good news.

309
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,000
Mr. Bai will be overjoyed.

310
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,350
I've already sent someone
to deliver the message.

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,440
How long has
your eye condition been treated?

312
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,240
Yunshu, you

313
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,370
just think too much.

314
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,720
We all live under the same roof,

315
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,630
yet you kept your sisters in the dark.

316
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,630
Why couldn't you tell us about this?

317
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,870
Dr. Sun explained

318
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,400
that I had accidentally
ingested cat's eye herb as a child.

319
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
He said I would need
daily acupuncture to clear the toxins,

320
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,260
take Shenqu pills,

321
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,630
switch to a diet

322
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,430
of black beans and goji berries,

323
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,290
and use medicinal eye washes.

324
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,349
Only by persisting with this treatment
for half a year could I see results.

325
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,030
I was afraid of disappointing Grandmother,

326
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,359
so I kept quiet about it.

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,750
Thankfully, heaven took pity on me.

328
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,480
Yesterday after acupuncture,

329
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,030
I suddenly felt
a brightness before my eyes

330
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,829
and immediately

331
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,480
sent someone to inform Grandmother.

332
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,400
This is heaven rewarding
your kindness and filial piety

333
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,069
with special favor.

334
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,400
Before, when you couldn't see,

335
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,830
I thought of having you handle affairs

336
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,480
but worried it might be inconvenient.

337
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,000
Now I can rest easy.

338
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,410
Everyone, please sit down.

339
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,590
Were these really picked by monkeys?

340
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,830
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

341
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,280
I wouldn't have believed it either.

342
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,510
It's a pity tea trees need to rest

343
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,830
after Frost's Descent,

344
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,550
otherwise we could harvest more.

345
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,200
Lord Lu is truly capable,

346
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,720
even the wild animals on the mountain

347
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
follow his commands.

348
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,730
Lady Shanbao, he also sent people

349
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,200
to deliver wild tea seeds,

350
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,920
saying our deeply plowed soil

351
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,110
won't grow wild tea well

352
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,680
and specifically advised

353
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,340
sowing them in the mountains.

354
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,570
Don't say that. Don't.

355
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,850
What's wrong? Is your eye twitching?

356
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,630
Have someone divide the tea seeds in half.

357
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,360
Sow one half in the plantation,

358
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,510
the other half
in the wild land behind the mountain.

359
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,400
Assign people to weed and fertilize.

360
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,030
Whether they'll grow well or not,

361
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,090
we'll know in time.

362
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Lady Shanbao,

363
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,240
could you please help

364
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,960
ask Lord Lu?

365
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,030
Those mountain monkeys
are wild and hard to tame.

366
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,160
How did he train them
to be so obedient?

367
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,110
Lady Shanbao,

368
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,910
can monkeys find wild tea trees?

369
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,800
I don't know.

370
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,240
Go ask him yourself.

371
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
This is a good thing.

372
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,930
Why did she suddenly get upset?

373
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,590
Yunshu, starting tomorrow,

374
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,590
follow me and focus on learning

375
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,450
how to manage the tea plantation.

376
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,660
I want to show that ungrateful,

377
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,550
arrogant person that

378
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,680
the prosperity of a family is not
the achievement of a single individual.

379
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,410
The Rong family has plenty of

380
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,900
intelligent, filial granddaughters—

381
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,940
losing any one is no great loss.

382
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,780
What happened?

383
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,960
Grandmother, I was careless

384
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,750
and knocked over the teacup.

385
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,290
Don't be afraid.

386
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,750
No wonder I don't like her father.

387
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
Such a fine girl,

388
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,920
raised by him to be so timid,

389
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,540
cowardly, and ill-mannered—

390
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,640
nothing like a Rong young lady.

391
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,640
Yunxi,

392
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,010
your daughter
doesn't take after you at all.

393
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,960
She's unlike you.

394
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,390
Grandmother,

395
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,720
Li didn't grow up
in the Rong family

396
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,110
and hasn't learned
the etiquette for tea parties.

397
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,110
It's my fault.

398
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,480
Don't blame Li.

399
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,650
I will teach her properly from now on.

400
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,240
You can't nurture well

401
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,120
a tea seedling with rotten roots.

402
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,070
The child is innocent, after all.

403
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,800
What would a child understand?

404
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,300
You are indeed the one at fault.

405
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,710
A father's character

406
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,270
inevitably influences

407
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,530
his child's behavior.

408
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,430
Trying to correct it later

409
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,540
requires tremendous effort.

410
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
You all should take this as a lesson.

411
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,270
Don't get close to any

412
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,330
disreputable men.

413
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,610
Grandmother, Li doesn't know better.

414
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm sorry she spoiled your mood.

415
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,460
I'll take her back now.

416
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,990
Well...

417
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,800
I just criticized her a bit,
and she gets upset.

418
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,930
What kind of man did she choose?

419
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,030
An orphan with no proper upbringing

420
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,270
who sells poor-quality tea on the streets.

421
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,800
I just haven't exposed her.

422
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,320
How ungrateful.

423
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,800
Please calm down, Grandmother.

424
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,050
Yunxi didn't mean it.

425
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,260
It's not your place to speak here.

426
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,250
What's going on here?

427
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,590
Every single one of you

428
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,510
can't bear the slightest criticism

429
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,310
and dares to show attitude to me.

430
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,790
I said Li lacks talent.

431
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,870
What part of that isn't true?

432
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,020
She hides from people, always timid.

433
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,110
In what way is she like a Rong young lady?

434
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,240
At her age, Bao

435
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,440
could recite "The Classic of Tea"

436
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,640
from memory.

437
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,830
Don't be angry, Grandmother.

438
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,960
The entire Rong family depends on you.

439
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,830
If you fall ill from anger,
no one can take your place.

440
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,410
If you miss Shanbao,

441
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,230
I'll go invite her again.

442
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
Even if I have to beg on my knees,

443
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,480
I'll bring her back.

444
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,180
Who said I miss her?

445
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,810
That disobedient, unfilial girl.

446
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,960
I will never allow her to step foot

447
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,090
in this house again.

448
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,810
But the tea caravan is about to depart,

449
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,840
and the tea plantation
still needs managing.

450
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,370
There must be someone capable in charge.

451
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,000
Then I'll have you

452
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,480
go with the tea caravan
to the border town.

453
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,940
You've traveled this road
many times before.

454
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,210
With you going, I am at ease.

455
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,270
As for the tea plantation and shops,

456
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,350
the old managers are already there,

457
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,890
so there won't be any major problems.

458
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,510
Just have Guanyu keep an eye on things.

459
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,790
If anything serious happens,

460
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,650
come back and ask for my decision.

461
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,680
Yes.

462
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,440
Alright, I'm tired now.

463
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,790
You may all leave.

464
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,310
Old Madam.

465
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,480
I've been by your side every day.

466
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,590
Now I suddenly have
to go to the border town.

467
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,830
With no one by your side,

468
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,160
I'm truly worried.

469
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,550
I'm as tough as nails.

470
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,070
Even heaven can't knock me down.

471
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,550
You've had a long day.

472
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,400
Go back and rest early.

473
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,060
No need to keep watch tonight.

474
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,410
Who's there?

475
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,260
It's me.

476
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,110
Lady Shanbao, you're so busy
being angry with me

477
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,840
that you've forgotten
about Madam Yang's death?

478
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,610
Didn't the coroner say

479
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,240
she hanged herself?

480
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,350
That might be able to fool others.

481
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,110
But you are so sharp-witted, Lady Shanbao.

482
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,170
What could possibly be kept from you?

483
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,900
For 10 years,
Madam Yang lived in anonymity,

484
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,440
willingly enduring
public scorn and rejection

485
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,370
just to survive.

486
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,510
Her spirit was incredibly
resilient and strong.

487
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,200
After patiently waiting to clear her name

488
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,590
and see the light of day again,

489
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,450
how could she simply end her life?

490
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,400
Moreover,

491
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,480
she loved Lady Yunwan
like her own daughter.

492
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,410
How could she abandon her by dying?

493
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,970
She was clearly forced to her death.

494
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,200
You're not as confused as you seem.

495
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,310
If you know something is suspicious,

496
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,440
why haven't you arrested Yang Yitang?

497
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,440
Yang Yitang has already been captured.

498
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,240
But I believe

499
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,170
he's not the one
who drove Madam Yang to her death.

500
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,880
Why not?

501
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,680
Before Madam Yang took her own life,

502
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
Yang Yitang was in Linji City,

503
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,400
pulling strings everywhere

504
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,920
and asking officials
to exonerate the Yang family.

505
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,680
It was a matter of life and death.

506
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,590
How could he be in two places at once?

507
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,070
Besides,

508
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,930
I had men guarding the city gates.

509
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,370
He never left the city.

510
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,680
If not him, then who?

511
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,430
The implicated Yang family?

512
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,390
Or someone from the Wei clan?

513
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,400
Rest assured.

514
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,650
I will find the real culprit

515
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,740
and bring justice for Madam Yang.

516
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,310
Justice?

517
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
In this world,

518
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,440
for this poor woman,

519
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,170
when has there ever been any justice?

520
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,350
Thank you for telling me, Lord Lu.

521
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,150
It's late. I shouldn't keep you.

522
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,550
Please leave.

523
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,010
We've done with business.

524
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,760
Then I'll leave.

525
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
I-I'm really leaving.

526
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,530
Go ahead.

527
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm afraid you will have to

528
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,330
stay here for a few days, Lady Shanbao.

529
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,640
What you've lost because of me,

530
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,370
I'll help you

531
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,410
get it all back someday.

532
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,590
What I want,

533
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,920
I'll reclaim myself.

534
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,420
I believe you.

535
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,500
But before you reclaim your glory,

536
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
don't ever forget

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,490
it was because of me, Lu Jianglai,

538
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,270
that you were kicked out

539
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,270
by Old Madam Rong.

540
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,900
You must hate me every day,

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,710
remember me,

542
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,350
and not for a moment

543
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,950
are you allowed to forget me.

544
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,740
Someone's coming.

545
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,350
Lady Shanbao.

546
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,210
Is someone disturbing you?

547
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,240
It's nothing.

548
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,960
Just some wild monkeys
in the mountains causing trouble.

549
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,560
There are wild monkeys
in these tea mountains?

550
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,550
Get two people to guard the entrance.

551
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,410
Yes, of course.

552
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,870
If they come back,
we'll beat them to death.

553
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,160
Li, does this look good?

554
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,930
You can have it.

555
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,030
The reason I kept Li

556
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,560
outside the family mansion

557
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,880
was to prevent this kind of situation.

558
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,160
Grandmother values bloodlines so much

559
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
and constantly talks
about family background.

560
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,420
Li would never be happy

561
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,920
in the Rong family.

562
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,740
Li is a daughter of the Rong family

563
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,180
and must eventually return to her roots.

564
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,900
I couldn't sleep all night

565
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,440
thinking about this.

566
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,590
If you were the one

567
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,720
facing Grandmother's harsh questioning,

568
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,790
what would you do, Rong Shanbao?

569
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,680
See if you dare again.

570
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,550
Let's play together.

571
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,550
I want to play with them too.

572
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,160
Careful, Li!

573
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,820
Don't fall.

574
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,400
Let them play together.

575
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,750
-Let go!
-No, I won't!

576
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,600
Yunyin seems like a completely
different person.

577
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,930
I hardly recognize her.

578
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,770
Why didn't you try to stop her?

579
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,040
I used to interfere too much.

580
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,590
I think

581
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,400
Li has

582
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,550
her father's blood,

583
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
but she was nurtured

584
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
in her mother's womb.

585
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,160
Our ancestors used to say:
"Without rain from the sky,

586
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,690
grass won't grow on earth."

587
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,940
But no matter what kind of rain falls,

588
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,960
sweet, salty, or bitter,

589
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,030
a pine tree seed

590
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,370
will never grow into a cocklebur.

591
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,550
Li, like you and me

592
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,440
and our sisters,

593
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,030
shares the same bloodline

594
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,290
from our Grandmother.

595
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,530
She is destined
to grow into a towering tree.

596
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,160
With proper nurturing,

597
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,400
she will succeed one day.

598
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,320
Why can't you all

599
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,150
be a little more patient?

600
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,400
If only Grandmother were

601
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
as open-minded as you.

602
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,030
Perhaps the Rong family needs

603
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,360
a new head of household.

604
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,440
Why?

605
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,520
Let's chase her.

606
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,200
Don't run away!

607
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,480
Li, be careful!

608
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,590
Don't fall!

609
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,110
-Li!
-Lady Yunyin, be careful!

610
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,920
Run slower!

611
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,550
Don't run!

612
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,110
Stop running!

613
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,640
Li!

614
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,890
Look at this!

615
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,900
-I got you.
-Slow down.

616
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,350
That's impressive!

617
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,830
Grandmother ordered Ms. Yan
to escort the tea shipment.

618
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,360
They'll be departing soon.

619
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,480
Wanwan, slow down!

620
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,440
It's my turn!

621
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,770
Come on.

622
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,350
Why are there so many more

623
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,830
mules and horses prepared this year?

624
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,750
When Lady Shanbao left,

625
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,070
she specifically instructed us

626
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,920
that the harvest is poor this year,

627
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,050
and that heavy snow
and strong winds in the north

628
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,400
have made travel difficult.

629
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,750
So we need to prepare more

630
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,080
than in previous years.

631
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,590
We must also take care
with the mules and horses,

632
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,320
as they could perish
on the road in the blizzards.

633
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,310
Lady Shanbao also sent you

634
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,110
some items.

635
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Lady Shanbao said

636
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,930
we'll be gone for several months.

637
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,030
Ms. Yan,

638
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,440
you haven't traveled
the northern route for many years.

639
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,570
The border regions are bitterly cold.

640
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,830
She's worried about your rheumatic legs

641
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,640
and insists you wear these.

642
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,820
Lady Shanbao has always
been the most considerate.

643
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,270
Hurry up!

644
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,260
Yes, right away!

645
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,310
[Rong's Tea House]

646
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
These goods need to be

647
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,640
at the dock before dusk.

648
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,040
Be quick about your work.

649
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,160
Yes, understood.

650
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,080
All right.

651
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,030
Tea, in its use, is cooling in nature

652
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,240
and most fitting as a beverage.

653
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,910
Grandmother.

654
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,280
Lady Yunshu.

655
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,070
Grandmother listened
to the tea history for a while,

656
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,000
then said she was tired

657
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,030
and wanted to rest briefly

658
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,290
with no disturbances.

659
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,280
I'll bring her medicine later.

660
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,550
Grandmother just mentioned

661
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,930
a book called "An Account of Tea".

662
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,960
Please, Nianqiao,

663
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,890
go to the library and find it for me.

664
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,310
I'll take care of the medicine.

665
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,200
When Grandmother wakes up,

666
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,160
I'll help her take it.

667
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,090
It's no trouble.

668
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:38,830
Yes.

669
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,880
The Purple Dragon Lying in Snow
in the west garden

670
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,790
are in full bloom.

671
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,070
Grandmother loves them.

672
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,030
Cut two stems and bring them for the vase.

673
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,950
Then go to Chongxi Hall to get a cloak.

674
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,630
Be quick.

675
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,810
Yes.

676
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,750
Please.

677
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,480
No need to show me the way. You may go.

678
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,920
Yes.

679
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,420
What did you just do?

680
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,480
The medicine was cold and undrinkable,

681
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
so I poured it out.

682
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,230
Why did you come back so suddenly

683
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,340
without sending word ahead?

684
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,800
I could have welcomed you.

685
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,970
It's been days.

686
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,310
Why the stern face?

687
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,520
My eyes have healed.

688
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,920
Aren't you happy for me?

689
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,010
I'm happy. Of course I'm happy.

690
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,920
I was so happy that I immediately asked
the academy master for leave

691
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,650
and rushed back without delay.

692
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,890
But I never expected

693
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,070
to see you with my own eyes

694
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,200
switching Old Madam Rong's medicine.

695
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,670
Yunshu, what are you trying to do?

696
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

697
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,150
Would I really poison

698
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,280
my own grandmother?

699
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,100
Rong Yunshu!

700
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,840
Old Madam.

701
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,030
This medicinal soup

702
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,750
is similar to the tonic

703
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
you usually take.

704
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,960
Nothing was added except
2 herbs for blood circulation,

705
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,490
Chuanxiong and Kudzu root,

706
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,760
and some phlegm-reducing herbs,

707
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,420
Bile Arisaema and Earthworm.

708
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,040
It won't cause any harm?

709
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,360
I have served

710
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,890
under Ms. Yan for many years

711
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,330
and learned much about medicine.

712
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,880
The herbs Lady Yunshu added

713
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,430
will only benefit you
with no side effects.

714
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,630
She wanted me
to switch to Dr. Sun's medicine,

715
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,590
but I refused,

716
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,010
so she took matters into her own hands.

717
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,330
Such an obedient person usually,

718
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,570
where did she get such courage?

719
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,920
Ms. Yan is quite cautious

720
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,520
when prescribing medicine.

721
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,030
When Lady Shanbao was here,

722
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,030
she also often urged you
to change your prescription.

723
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,400
Lady Yunshu was being filial,

724
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,460
though she was somewhat rash.

725
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,360
Please forgive her, Old Madam.

726
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,510
If she truly cared about my health,

727
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,170
why act through someone else?

728
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,410
Her filial piety is clearly fake.

729
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,600
That wicked girl.

730
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,920
Have your studies made you foolish?

731
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,090
Grandmother loves me so much.

732
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,880
I wish her to live a hundred years.

733
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,110
Dr. Sun said

734
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,300
the elderly often
has shortness of breath and palpitations,

735
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,110
with phlegm issues,

736
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,190
and risk of stroke.

737
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,360
Yet she

738
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,480
has been taking tonic soup for years

739
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,550
that doesn't address her condition.

740
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,110
That's why I added a few new herbs.

741
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,480
If you were just
changing the prescription,

742
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,610
why did it secretly?

743
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,280
Would Grandmother listen to me?

744
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,000
The elderly can be terribly stubborn,

745
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,670
always thinking others want to harm them.

746
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,230
She only trusts Ms. Yan
to prescribe medicine.

747
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,960
But Ms. Yan

748
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
has gone on a long journey,

749
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,420
so we couldn't rely on her.

750
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
If you don't believe me,

751
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,550
the herb residue is still in my room.

752
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,480
We can find Dr. Sun

753
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,680
to verify it himself.

754
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,010
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

755
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,710
I apologize. I was wrong.

756
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,280
I wronged you.

757
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,670
All right.

758
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,540
I'll be leaving for the capital soon
for the imperial exam,

759
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,840
and we won't see each other

760
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,040
for quite a long time.

761
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,450
Please don't be angry with me anymore.

762
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,740
Let's go see Old Madam Rong first,

763
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,400
and then

764
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,340
I have something nice to give you.

765
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,320
Mr. Yan,

766
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,280
you eavesdropped on
our conversation just now.

767
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,190
Is this how a gentleman should behave?

768
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,280
You two really know
how to pick a place to talk.

769
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,010
If I hadn't happened to pass by,

770
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,400
your secret

771
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,960
would have been overheard by the servants.

772
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,480
Yunshu.

773
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,290
Mr. Yan and I have
a gentlemanly friendship.

774
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,090
He won't speak of this to others.

775
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,840
I was reckless earlier,

776
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,110
and troubled you to watch out for us.

777
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,710
Thank you.

778
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,880
When I arrived just now,

779
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,800
Old Madam Rong was sending people

780
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,920
to look for you everywhere, Lady Yunshu.

781
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,980
Lady Yunshu, you should go to her now.

782
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,100
Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Yan.

783
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,160
I'll go right away.

784
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,960
I think Lady Yunshu

785
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,490
has ulterior motives
and behaves strangely.

786
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,590
Mr. Bai, you should be cautious

787
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,050
when getting close to her.

788
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,920
Otherwise, one day

789
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,710
you might fall victim to her schemes.

790
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,840
She's often looked down upon
because of her background.

791
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,550
After much difficulty,

792
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,510
she's finally gained
Old Madam Rong's favor.

793
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,910
Who knows how much
slander this will bring?

794
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,090
Mr. Yan, you're an honorable man.

795
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,960
You shouldn't believe

796
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,290
those baseless rumors.

797
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,770
Even if everyone speaks ill of her,

798
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,660
I will still trust her.

799
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,190
So stubborn.

800
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,630
My Lord.

801
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,070
After 3 days of interrogation,

802
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,440
Yang Yitang still firmly denies

803
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
involvement in the Wei family case.

804
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,040
When the Wei case happened,

805
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,810
he was just an ignorant youth.

806
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,050
It's reasonable for him
to claim ignorance.

807
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,800
Having witnessed his family's misfortune,

808
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,320
he naturally sought help.

809
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,420
If we charge him with bribery,

810
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,670
wouldn't that implicate
Provincial Governor?

811
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,670
However, My Lord,

812
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,230
he falsely accused
Madam Yang of prostitution...

813
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,670
Yang Jisheng has already taken

814
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,200
all the blame upon himself.

815
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,070
You claim Yang Yitang was involved,

816
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,600
but where is your evidence?

817
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,080
Covering up for a close relative

818
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,120
follows the old tradition of filial duty.

819
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,590
Can you really sentence him
to death for that?

820
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,920
So, My Lord, you mean...

821
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,590
An insignificant pawn

822
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,760
should receive 40 lashes

823
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,230
and be released with minor punishment.

824
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,320
My Lord. My Lord.

825
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,820
Young Master, be careful.

826
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,410
Let's go.

827
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,980
Fragrant sachets! Perfume pouches!

828
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,320
Watch out!

829
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,110
Take a look!

830
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,880
Candied haws!

831
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,860
I'll take one.

832
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,760
Young Master, you predicted correctly.

833
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,160
Lord Lu indeed set a trap.

834
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,190
Don't worry.

835
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:28,630
Someone will

836
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,360
lead away those who are watching us.

837
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,150
I was never openly
involved in the Wei case,

838
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,880
so they can't sentence me to death.

839
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,540
Where is he?

840
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,280
He's on the second floor.

841
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
He's been waiting for you for 2 days.

842
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,940
Let's go.

843
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,400
Mr. He.

844
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,450
I've long admired you.

845
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,960
I was delayed by trivial matters.

846
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,110
Please forgive my late arrival.

847
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,230
Skip the pleasantries.

848
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,070
Mr. Yang, you said

849
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,880
you wanted to do

850
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,480
a huge business deal with me.

851
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,640
I took it seriously.

852
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,030
If you've made me
wait 2 days for nothing,

853
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,590
I won't let you off easily.

854
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,110
Good.

855
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,970
Straight to the point.

856
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,190
Previously, the Rong family ruined
your tea contract,

857
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,280
causing you heavy losses.

858
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,800
Don't you want to settle

859
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,120
this score with the Rong family?

860
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,800
Even a mighty dragon
can't defeat a local snake.

861
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,730
You think the Rongs are pushovers?

862
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,150
If you want to die, go ahead by yourself.

863
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,230
Don't drag me down.

864
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,340
Every spring and autumn,

865
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,550
the Rong family has
a large shipment of tea

866
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,400
to be escorted to the border regions.

867
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
Their most capable men

868
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,920
are all needed as escorts,

869
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,950
leaving their defenses quite vulnerable.

870
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,800
Mr. He,

871
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,030
you've dominated
the river trade for decades

872
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,880
and never misses a business opportunity.

873
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,610
Would you be willing
to miss such a golden chance?

874
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,760
You're truly arrogant.

875
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,400
The Rong family mansion
is heavily guarded.

876
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,070
The outer courtyard guards

877
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,480
are all top fighters.

878
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,450
You can't just attack whenever you want.

879
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,510
No wonder you've been
lingering near Linji,

880
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,570
refusing to leave.

881
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,340
So you've already scouted the place.

882
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,230
No rush.

883
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,230
I have my own methods.

884
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,590
Please, sit down
and let's discuss the details.

885
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,990
My Lord, I've failed you.

886
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,800
I let that Yang fellow escape.

887
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,320
I understand. Get up.

888
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,920
All right.

889
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,970
What's done is done.

890
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,760
What use is there in regret now?

891
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,510
When you go out on missions in the future,

892
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,710
just be more careful.

893
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,100
As for the bait we've let go...

894
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,400
The Yang family declined
because of the reversal of the Wei case.

895
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,330
This Yang Yitang

896
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,840
won't give up so easily.

897
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,360
My Lord, you're saying...

898
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,090
I expect the one he resents most

899
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,520
is Lady Rong Shanbao.

900
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,360
Have someone monitor the tea plantation.

901
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,310
He will certainly show up again.

902
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:06,920
Yes, My Lord.
