[Episode 30]

3
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,150
[Chongxi Hall]

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
They're back.

5
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,039
What did the chief managers

6
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,870
and the estates' supervisors say?

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,280
They came specially
to offer congratulations.

8
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Unexpectedly, before we could
even start the evening banquet,

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,080
such a serious matter occurred.

10
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,570
After this ordeal,

11
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,870
I'm afraid Grandmother
won't be able to manage affairs anymore.

12
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,560
Everyone agreed

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,759
to nominate Lady Shanbao
as the head of the family

14
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,070
and follow her lead.

15
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,430
While all the regional managers are here,

16
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,200
tomorrow, the Rong family
will open the ancestral hall

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,230
to worship
and inform the ancestors officially.

18
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,150
From now on,

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,400
our Rong family

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,729
will have a new hostess.

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,120
Shanbao, you truly deserve this honor.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,920
Then let me congratulate you first,
Lady Shanbao.

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,470
Xiangling.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,079
Tomorrow, I will inform

25
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,480
the Rong family's elders

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,329
to officially change your surname
and let you return to our clan

27
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,390
so that you can truly be member
of the Rong family again.

28
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,430
Really?

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,410
I knew you wouldn't deceive me.

30
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,190
I'll go back now
to bathe and change clothes

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,650
to get prepared properly.

32
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,540
Tomorrow, the Rong family

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,030
will still need to
perform an important pilgrimage ceremony.

34
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,190
My dear sisters, go back and rest early.

35
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,120
I'll go inside to see Grandmother.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,220
Old Madam, please drink some.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Lady Shanbao.

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,079
Grandmother,
if you refuse to take your medicine,

39
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,970
how will you recover?

40
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,390
Are you still trying to deceive me?

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Those people outside

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,710
can't wait for me to die soon

43
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,370
so that I can make room for you.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,000
You've suspected Wei Yao for a long time.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,280
Why didn't you

46
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,030
say anything about it to me?

47
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,750
Grandmother, you're getting old now.

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,520
I was afraid you couldn't bear to...

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,000
I think you just resent me
for being old and stubborn

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
and showing partiality.

51
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,360
I never thought
that after a lifetime of wisdom,

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,320
in my old age,

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,620
I would be deceived so thoroughly.

54
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,910
You really have such great patience.

55
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,190
You've been enduring it until today

56
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,390
before exposing him.

57
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,120
You want everyone

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,560
to see that

59
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm old and muddle-headed,

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,320
as I've mistaken thieves for relatives

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,870
and let villains come into our home,

62
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,330
and thus,
I can no longer hold this position.

63
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,570
You're trying to seize my power.

64
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,510
Grandmother.

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,970
I wouldn't dare.

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,180
You wouldn't dare?

67
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,950
I think you're quite bold.

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,220
What you've concealed from me

69
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,930
is probably more than just this, huh?

70
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,430
Tell me.

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,190
Grandmother, you're wise and insightful,

72
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,250
being as formidable as you used to be.

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,170
I do have something to report.

74
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you so eager

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,660
to show off your victory here?

76
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,770
Throwing cups around,
you have such a bad temper.

77
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,600
In this way, you would fail to live up to

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Mr. Bai's pure-hearted affection.

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't be so smug.

80
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,740
You and Bai Yingsheng

81
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,870
conspired to burn the Tea King Tree.

82
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,580
Let's see if Grandmother will spare you.

83
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,980
Since I've dared to do that,
I'm not afraid.

84
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,340
I've burnt the tree this time

85
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,800
mostly for the Rong family

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
and partly for you.

87
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,040
For me?

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,409
You've been clever since childhood,

89
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,470
but you tend to overthink everything

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,860
and have never been sincere with anyone.

91
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,760
One can't write two "Rong" characters
with one stroke.

92
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,090
I want you to understand

93
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,930
all members of a family

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,670
share a common destiny.

95
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,470
Although Grandmother wants

96
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,730
us sisters to compete,

97
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,130
with our home burning into ashes,

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
even if one of us wins,

99
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,730
she would just be a queen of ruins.

100
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,430
Yunshu, first of all, we're family,

101
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,920
and our competitive relation is secondary.

102
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,490
Shanbao.

103
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,159
I'm jealous of you.

104
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,450
I'm jealous because on your birthday,

105
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,810
you could always get a sachet
Grandmother embroidered for you.

106
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,710
I'm jealous because when tasting new tea,

107
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,360
you could always
get served half a cup of it before me.

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,690
And I'm even jealous...

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,909
And I'm even jealous
because when you stand there,

110
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,510
you would
naturally gain everyone's support.

111
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,700
I've lost this time.

112
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
But I won't accept it.

113
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,450
There's still a long way to go.

114
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll wait for you to come
and compete with me anytime.

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,980
That's what you've promised.

116
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
Yunshu.

117
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,010
Do you still remember that saying?

118
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,170
When the storm is coming...

119
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,210
Let's just share an umbrella.

120
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,180
Could you act this out with me?

121
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,520
Shanbao has been suspicious of Yan Bailou

122
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,650
for quite some time.

123
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,720
Actually, that day,

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,980
if Yan Bailou...

125
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,350
if Wei Yao had not pretended
to protect her,

126
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,159
Lady Shanbao would have only

127
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,670
suffered some minor injuries.

128
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,720
But in this way,

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,220
it made us more certain

130
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,320
that this man had great ambitions,

131
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,720
and we must be wary of him.

132
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,870
You just want to take revenge on me.

133
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,490
You won't let me have my way.

134
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,730
Out! Get out!

135
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,750
I don't want to see you.

136
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
Grandmother.

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,920
I intend to let Yunshu

138
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,380
manage the branch shop in the capital.

139
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,810
There aren't many days left

140
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,940
when you can see her.

141
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,300
Grandmother, please forgive me.

142
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,570
That day, I actually

143
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,780
thought about switching your medicine

144
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,810
to take revenge for my own mother.

145
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,960
But I hesitated.

146
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,930
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

147
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,350
Shanbao is right.

148
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,810
My father

149
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,740
was a gentle and affectionate man,

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,130
but he was not

151
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,880
a qualified member of the Rong family.

152
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,010
A man indulged in personal affections

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,720
could never be your son.

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,090
He disappointed you.

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,010
I am the same.

156
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,670
I'm not a qualified daughter,

157
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,930
being unable to take revenge
for my own mother.

158
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,630
I'm also not

159
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,760
a docile and obedient granddaughter,

160
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,150
being unable to please you, Grandmother.

161
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,680
I respect you,

162
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,580
but I also resent you.

163
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,620
This love and this hatred

164
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,090
have been tormenting me greatly,

165
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,120
so I've chosen to leave the Rong family.

166
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,010
I want to choose a path
where I can put down hatred

167
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,870
and move towards a peaceful life.

168
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,230
As long as you're still alive,

169
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,380
I will never return to the Rong family.

170
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,060
Please take good care of yourself,
Grandmother.

171
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,060
I'm bidding farewell to you.

172
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,880
You were truly reckless.

173
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,780
How dare you burn the Tea King Tree?

174
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,010
Are you trying to destroy the Rong family?

175
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,760
Grandmother,
the Tea King Tree is still there.

176
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,030
Although Yunxi
isn't good at running business,

177
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,280
she has a great gift

178
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,680
for nurturing tea trees.

179
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,010
Any twig she casually breaks off

180
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,210
can survive and grow.

181
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,710
Grandmother, in the past,

182
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,610
you always incited her to compete with me,

183
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,970
but you've never discovered

184
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,210
her true strengths.

185
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,540
You should get out, too.

186
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,350
Grandmother,
you must take your medicine properly

187
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,610
and recover soon.

188
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,330
In the future,
if you want to compete with me,

189
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,280
without good health,

190
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
how can you achieve that?

191
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,930
I'll come and greet you again tomorrow.

192
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,920
One day,

193
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,970
you will become the new queen.

194
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,610
Yes.

195
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,280
One day,

196
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,810
I will become the new queen,

197
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,640
a Tea Queen who protects her clansmen

198
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,440
and shelters the common people.

199
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,490
I'm getting old

200
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,680
and don't want to
be angry with you anymore.

201
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,090
When you have time,

202
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,610
don't forget to visit me often.

203
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,130
Tell me

204
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,910
about your future plans
for the tea plantation.

205
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,560
Tell me

206
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,490
about our homeland's sacred mountains
and palaces,

207
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,890
as well as those stories from the past.

208
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,730
I...

209
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,470
I've long failed to
remember them clearly.

210
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,690
Okay.

211
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,760
Have you

212
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,800
betrayed me?

213
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,520
Old Madam.

214
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,130
I will never

215
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,490
betray you.

216
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,330
It's just that I can't interfere, either.

217
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,640
Every generation's head of the Rong family

218
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
must go through the same trials,

219
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,400
being isolated from her family
and risking everything for just one goal.

220
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,970
She needs to have

221
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,900
enough perseverance and patience

222
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,570
to overcome this challenge alone.

223
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,660
Even back then, you also

224
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,420
went through the same trials.

225
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,010
The first rule
for the Rong family's daughters is

226
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,800
obeying neither monarchs nor elders,

227
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,290
but following the righteous path
in the mortal world

228
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,550
for the sake of morality and conscience.

229
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,040
She's doing so well.

230
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,450
From now on, just let Lady Shanbao

231
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,850
handle all the problems.

232
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,010
Please sleep.

233
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,170
I will stay here to watch over you

234
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,670
and won't go anywhere.

235
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,730
This girl...

236
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,180
Lady Yunshu.

237
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,070
Mr. Bai, are you here
to collect a debt or kill me?

238
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm here to ask for an answer.

239
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,210
Yunshu.

240
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,640

241
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,370

298
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,839
to stop getting in my way.

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
You may leave now.

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,010
Lady Shanbao, well...

302
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,670
So you're still not giving up?

303
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,099
It has always been none of your business.

304
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,010
Yes.

305
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,170
Let's leave.

306
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,490
Lord Lu.

307
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,420
What exactly are you trying to do?

308
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,650
Of course I'm moving in
to live with you.

309
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,290
Who allows you to move in?

310
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,130
You don't allow it, huh?

311
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,840
Fine.

312
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,730
Then I'll just tell them
to move everything back.

313
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,320
But I must warn you.

314
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,690
I came all this way

315
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,690
with the accompaniment of drums and gongs,
making quite a scene.

316
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,450
Everyone in Linji was watching.

317
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,760
If I move back now,

318
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,750
it will cause another sensation.

319
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:03,840
Go back!

320
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,170
Move everything back exactly as it was.

321
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,690
Hurry!

322
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,210
What?

323
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,830
Lord Lu is moving back again?

324
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,140
Lu Jianglai.

325
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,250
What tricks are you playing?

326
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,210
Now I'll go to the County Office
to sue you.

327
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,650
What accusation is it?

328
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,010
I'm suing you,
the head of the Rong family,

329
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,930
for breaking promises and abandoning me.

330
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,040
Not only did you cancel our engagement
to marry someone else,

331
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,840
but you also insulted my purity.

332
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,240
I've even prepared
the statement of charges.

333
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,080
Leave now!

334
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,820
Lady Rong Shanbao.

335
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,950
What would you say?

336
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,040
Fine.

337
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,050
Tell your people to leave.

338
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,280
Then we can discuss this properly.

339
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah.

340
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,370
They're really leaving.

341
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,010
Bao.

342
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,890
I'm not a man who you can

343
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,040
easily get rid of.

344
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,020
I have quite many tactics.

345
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,690
Before you make your decision,

346
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,420
you'd better think carefully.

347
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,560
From now on,

348
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,010
will we be inseparable lovers

349
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,810
who love each other deeply,

350
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,730
or will we be enemies who hate

351
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,220
each other to the death?

352
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,830
Which choice would be better?

353
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,560
Lord Lu,

354
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,600
don't you still have a good female junior?

355
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,210
Why do you keep pestering me?

356
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,250
Just now,

357
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,450
I already sent my junior to a new house.

358
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,450
I also explained everything
to her clearly.

359
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,930
If I had been a person who hesitated

360
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,060
and acted cowardly,

361
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,040
I wouldn't have dared to

362
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,450
be against Jiang Yiqian openly,

363
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,780
let alone seeking justice for the people.

364
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,730
If I can't even make decisions

365
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,760
for my own affairs,

366
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,290
what's the point of living?

367
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,090
I, Lu Jianglai, just love Rong Shanbao.

368
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,890
Except her,

369
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,210
I'll never fall in love with anyone else,

370
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,840
even if there might be huge flood

506
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,410
Either the fresh leaves
were damaged during picking

for legal action immediately?

519
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,170

but she's not deaf or blind.

528
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
In the past, she always boasted about

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
but Yunshu

553
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
finds it difficult to deal with him.

554
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,600
Who is this person?

555
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,320
Could it be...

556
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,890
It looks like I need to

557
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,290
go to the capital myself.

558
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,340
I'll go with you.

559
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,450
She still can't let go after all.

560
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,690
It makes me seem shallow in comparison.

561
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,730
What are you talking about, sir?

562
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,690
Lady Shanbao wants you

563
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,210
to accompany her to the capital

564
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,540
to solve the issue of inferior tea leaves.

565
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,040
I will go.

566
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,730
You may leave now.

567
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,410
Yes.

568
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,770
Since she has chosen to go to you,

569
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,330
I will just pave the way for her.

570
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,850
Lu Jianglai.

571
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,250
Don't let the stuff

572
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,650
I've buried underground

573
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,540
be dug out again.

574
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,490
Where are we now?

575
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,110
We've arrived in the capital.

576
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,840
[Capital]

577
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,930
Whose carriage is this?

578
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,760
Such fine horses

579
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,160
and such elegant luxury.

580
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,450
It's even more impressive than the way

581
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,210
an imperial princess travels.

582
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,890
Indeed.

583
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,080
Lady Shanbao, this is the shop.

584
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,170
[Rongzhai]

585
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,520
Miss,

586
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,840
the finest tea leaves in our shop

587
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,890
are all here.

588
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,410
I'm not bragging.

589
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,220
Rongzhai Tea Plantation
is a century-old shop.

590
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,080
These are the best tea leaves
in the world.

591
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,210
Even the aristocrats in the palace

592
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,410
all use tea leaves from the Rong family.

593
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,520
Wherever you go,

594
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,120
when people mention our tea,

595
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,050
they would all give it a thumbs-up.

596
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,760
These are rough tea leaves

597
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,420
from the northern Min Region.

598
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,730
They did put some efforts
into the craftsmanship.

599
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,740
Please look carefully.

600
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,800
These are top-quality Songluo Tea Leaves.

601
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,360
You really don't know
how to tell good from bad.

602
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,080
Rough tea leaves
are such inferior products.

603
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,560
How can you mix them up?

604
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,080
By using rough tea leaves' fresh bud heads

605
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,340
as Songluo Tea Leaves,

606
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,410
you can deceive

607
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,360
non-native merchants
who know little about tea.

608
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,080
This jar

609
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
contains tea leaves
from our Rong family indeed.

610
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,890
However, they're not

611
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,730
the fresh tea leaves
that have just been picked this year,

612
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,560
but aged tea leaves from previous years.

613
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,320
To make the tea leaves

614
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,850
look fresher and brighter,

615
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,080
you've dyed them,
added oil and pan-fried them again.

616
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,320
You've even added some iron powder,

617
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,250
making them look fresh green
after the pan-frying.

618
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,050
This is good enough
to fool ordinary restaurants.

619
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,970
In this jar of top-grade tea leaves,

620
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,730
there is the smallest quantity
of aged tea leaves mixed in them.

621
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,480
You were afraid it would be discoverd

622
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,010
by experienced tea customers
who know tea products well,

623
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,940
so you only slightly
fumigated them with fragrance.

624
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,639
You have different tricks

625
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,120
for different tea customers.

626
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,040
So you think
this is a righteous way to make money?

627
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,500
You're talking nonsense!

628
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,020
You're talking nonsense!

629
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,050
You're here to cause trouble, huh?

630
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,679
Guards!

631
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,969
Drive all these troublemakers away

632
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:31,810
right now!

633
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,000
Wait!

634
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,780
What... What are you all doing?

635
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,550
We're shutting down your shop.

636
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,670
Do you know where you are now?

637
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,150
How dare you be so impudent?

638
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,810
Do you know whose shop this is?

639
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,870
How dare you!

640
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,250
You can't even recognize

641
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,560
the true head of the Rong family.

642
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,820
How dare you use the Rong family's brand?

643
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,989
Take down that signboard.

644
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,160
[Rong Residence]

645
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,200
Shanbao, Xiangling.

646
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,550
Let's talk inside.

647
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,780
What are you doing?

648
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,160
This is the residence
of the Vice Minister of Personnel.

649
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,090
You have no rights to barge in here.

650
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,630
How dare you...

651
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,930
Are you blind?

652
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,550
Don't you even recognize Lady Shanbao?

653
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,110
Get lost!

654
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,600
L-Lady Shanbao?

655
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,560
They said she was Lady Shanbao

656
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,850
from the main family in Linji.

657
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,640
I was merely

658
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,080
following procedures
by asking them some questions.

659
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,140
But unexpectedly,

660
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,120
they immediately gave me

661
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,250
a big slap on my face.

662
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,130
Madam, look.

663
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,930
My face

664
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,890
is all swollen
from that wicked servant's slap.

665
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,040
As the saying goes,

666
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,120
even before beating a dog,
one has to consider who its master is.

667
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,890
My lowly status

668
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,330
[Liu Yishu,
Second Wife of the First Branch]

669
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,930
isn't worth mentioning indeed.

670
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,240
But what about you, Madam?

671
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,200
You are the hostess of this household.

672
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,730
Even out of respect for you,

673
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,890
they shouldn't have behaved

674
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,490
so rudely outside your house.

675
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,130
If this matter spreads out,

676
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,520
[Rong Yunzhen,
Seventh Lady of the Rong Family]

677
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,520
wouldn't it ruin the family's reputation?

678
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,930
Is that woman from Linji

679
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,790
truly so arrogant?

680
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,850
Zhen, she's your eldest sister.

681
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,410
When you see her later,

682
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,640
you must not be disrespectful,

683
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,200
giving her a reason
to find fault with you.

684
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,490
Since ancient times,
there have been hierarchical distinctions

685
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,850
and rules of respect for seniority.

686
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,080
I respect her as my eldest sister,

687
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,540
so I try to be polite to her.

688
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,900
But Mother, you are her stepmother

689
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,070
and her elder, too.

690
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Although she grew up
in the countryside of Linji

691
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,410
and has never been

692
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,340
educated by you,

693
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,520
the hierarchy and seniority
can't be ignored.

694
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,010
We can't let her be disrespectful to you

695
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,870
and offend you.

696
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,490
Throughout the four seasons,
she never sends respectful greetings.

697
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,890
Nor does she
pays respects during festivals.

698
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,680
This is already a serious breach

699
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
of etiquette.

700
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
Since she has come to the capital,

701
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,240
her first task

702
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,840
should be paying respects to you, Mother.

703
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,640
That is the filial duty of a child.

704
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
How dare she barge in
without informing us first?

705
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,970
She's not only ill-bred

706
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,110
but also utterly unscrupulous.

707
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,490
Mother, don't be angry.

708
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,640
I'll question her about this matter.

709
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,160
I'll make sure she's embarrassed

710
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,690
and feels utterly ashamed.

711
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,450
Her mother died early.

712
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,810
I suppose...

713
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,660
her manner is not quite proper,

714
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,670
and she's not well-versed
in social etiquette,

715
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,030
so your father has rarely mentioned her.

716
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,330
Whenever I suggest bringing her here,

717
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,730
he always finds ways
to change the subject.

718
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,560
But, Zhen,

719
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,160
she may not have been
undereducated since childhood.

720
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,620
Don't follow her example.

721
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,850
Have you forgotten the principles

722
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,930
I've taught you?

723
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,900
A woman should be virtuous and taciturn.

724
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,970
You shouldn't have spoken and behaved

725
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,930
so impetuously.

726
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,770
I'm just trying to

727
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,170
stand up for you, Mother.

728
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,950
She's being too overbearing.

729
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,680
I've heard your grandmother

730
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,870
thinks extremely highly of Lady Shanbao.

731
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,490
She has been managing the household
since childhood.

732
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,450
Let's just assume she's not
quite concerned about formalities.

733
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,650
I'll guide her gradually in the future.

734
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,770
But, Zhen,

735
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,160
when you see her later,

736
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,820
you must not be discourteous.

737
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,980
Yes. I'll just listen to you, Mother.

738
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,730
Who are you guys?

739
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,890
Madam Liu, please.

740
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,780
You guys...

741
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,720
You must be the eldest sister, huh?

742
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,770
How dare you remain seated
in front of Mother?

743
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,330
Bow and greet Mother now!

744
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,920
Why are you laughing?

745
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,810
I'm laughing at someone
who can't see clearly.

746
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,240
You don't even know who I am.

747
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,770
Yet you're already
throwing your weight around.

748
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,700
What did you say?

749
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,630
She said you had mistaken her
for the eldest sister.

[Ledger
of Rongzhai's Fujiu Gate Street Branch]

751
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,320
Y-You're deliberately making fun of me

752
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,290
and enjoying my embarrassment.

753
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,410
Are you Shanbao?

754
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,140
Your father treasures you very much.

755
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,600
He always talks about you.

756
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,850
I've long wanted to
bring you here from Linji

757
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,730
so that our family can be reunited.

758
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,490
But it was a pity that Old Madam
couldn't bear to be separated from you.

759
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,720
With all these reasons,

760
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,370
it has been delayed until today.

761
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,970
When your father sees you later,

762
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,160
he'll be overjoyed.

763
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,420
I've prepared the Hongyu Pavilion for you.

764
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,750
It's the most elegant and spacious house.

765
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,520
You can go see it yourself later.

766
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,930
If you need anything,

767
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,330
feel free to tell me.

768
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,370
No rush.

769
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,460
Let's wait until Father returns.

770
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,810
Mother has shown such earnest affection.

771
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,080
Yet you don't express any gratitude.

772
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
You're so rude!

773
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,330
Your sister has traveled a long way

774
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,330
and must be tired.

775
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,960
Come quickly!

776
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,340
Go to my room
and fetch the Yuye Changchun Tea.

777
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,480
-Yes.
-Yes.

778
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,050
That tea is also called Harmony Tea,

779
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,850
symbolizing family reunion and harmony.

780
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,180
Today, our family is reunited,

781
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,060
so it's quite suitable for this scene.

782
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,890
I've read the political essay

783
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,650
you wrote yesterday.

784
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,120
Compared with your previous essays,
it shows significant improvement indeed.

785
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,890
But when discussing

786
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,120
the achievements of our dynasty's founder,

787
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,640
one cannot speak freely

788
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,850
without caution.

789
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,080
As a commoner scholar,

790
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,350
you must be extra cautious

791
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,540
and avoid causing trouble.

792
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Do you understand?

793
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,170
Yes, I do.

794
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,370

795
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,290

Something serious has happened!

Why are you so flustered?

799
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,210
Speak slowly.

801
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,680
has arrived here.

802

and Lady Yunzhen.

804
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,040
She has confined them?
On what grounds can she do that?

00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,940
There are also many armed guards.

810
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,140
The servants are too scared to get closer.

811
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,030
Old Master, please

812
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,950

Bao, it's been several years
since we last met.

822
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,040
I've noticed your temper

823
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,050
is getting worse and worse.

824
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,410
Before entering the capital,

825
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,240
you didn't even ask someone
to inform us first.

826
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,290
Today, you've also brought
all these people here

827
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,450
to make such a scene at my home.

828
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,040
Do you still

829
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,160
regard me

830
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,160
as your father?

831
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,020
On Cheng'an Gate Outer Street,

832
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,320

and Dongshun House Front Street,

835
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,780
there is a Rongzhai shop at each location.

836
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,110
The best-selling item

837
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,440
is this kind of tea in front of us.

838
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,290
New tea leaves
are mixed with damp aged tea leaves.

839
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,580
Only experts can tell the difference.

841
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,160
Just in August and September alone,

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,330
the four newly opened shops in the capital

843
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,240
sold a total of

844
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,770
3,500 jin of tea leaves.

845
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,920
How have you been managing these shops?

846
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,970
I can't believe
such a major mistake has occurred.

847
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,370
You're ruining our Rong family's

848
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,770
century-old reputation!

849
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,560
Dear, it's all due to my negligence.

850
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,850
I'm a married woman
who always stays home

851
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,980
and rarely goes out.

852
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,990
All business matters

853
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,820
were entrusted to the shop managers.

854
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,570
I didn't expect

855
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,240
they would substitute
inferior products for good ones

856
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,040
and damage the Rong family's reputation.

857
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,890
Thankfully,
Lady Shanbao discovered it right away.

858
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,080
I will certainly investigate this case

859
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,540
and severely punish them.

860
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,520
Lady Shanbao.

861
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,610
As your family, let me be frank with you.

862
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,080
Since ancient times, being an official
has always been difficult,

863
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,240
especially in the capital
where it's even more difficult.

864
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,560
Your father
is an honest and upright official.

865
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,240
He rarely receives guests
or sends invitation letters,

866
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,930
but there are gift exchanges,

867
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,490
seasonal social engagements
and tributes in winter and summer

868
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,150
that are simply unavoidable.

869
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,450
There are so many people
coveting your father's position.

870
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,040
We have no choice but to

871
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,600
run a few shops privately.

872
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,600
Lady Shanbao, please be more understanding

873
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,460
towards your father's hard work.

874
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,640
Mother has always been soft-hearted.

875
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,330
She inevitably neglected things
when supervising the staff,

876
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,770
so those villains with ill intentions
managed to muddle through.

877
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,040
As for all our shortcomings,

878
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,600
we will correct them from now on.

879
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,480
We will never put you
in a difficult position again.

880
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,680
Since we're a family,

881
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,240
let's not
taint Grandmother's ears with this news.

882
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,570
That would only make her

883
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,100
get angry unnecessarily.

884

888
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,120
In the past, there were also the cases

889
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,920
of substituting inferior products
for good ones,

890
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,120
which damaged our family's reputation.

891
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,410
Father, do you still remember?

892
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,290

In this jar of top-grade tea leaves,

896

there is the smallest quantity
of aged tea leaves mixed in them.

897
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,040
You were afraid it would be discoverd

898
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,640
by experienced tea customers
who know tea products well,

899
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,340
so you only slightly
fumigated them with fragrance.

900
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,740
During the Ming Dynasty,

901
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,400
tea business was booming,

902
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,160
and fake tea also became rampant.

903
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,860
Some tea sellers

904
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,160
would dye ordinary tea leaves

905
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,040
and sell them as Longjing tea.

906
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,370
There were also some tea sellers

907
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,720
who would mix mud and leaves
into tea bricks

908
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,450
to increase weight
and counterfeit tribute tea.

909
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,680
The imperial court set rules

910
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,560
to severely punish this practice.

911
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,970
According to the Great Ming Code,

912
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,200
counterfeiters would receive 90 floggings

913
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,680
and be exiled to finish penal servitude.

914
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,330
They stamped official tea

915
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,790
with special steel seals,

916
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,130
creating anti-counterfeiting trademarks
in ancient times.

917
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,170
Besides that,

918
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,290
the imperial court also introduced

919
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,270
measures like inspections
by imperial tea commissioners

920
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,670
to crack down on fake tea.

921
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:19,960
In just one year
during the Zhengde Period,

922
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,330
[In the Ming Dynasty, the ones for
cracking down on fake tea mainly included]

923
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,850
over 300,000 jin of fake tea leaves
was confiscated.

924
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,560
These fake tea cases happened frequently

925
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:25,750
mainly because

926
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,040
[imperial tea commissioners
and the ‌Inspection Office.]

927
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
tea taxes were too high at that time,

928
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,490
the official institutions
monopolized the price to keep it low,

929
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,880
and regional price differences were huge,

930
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,680
which were all considered as
the systemic contradictions.

931
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,410
This also reflects

932
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,010
the deep conflict between Ming Dynasty's
monopoly system of tea selling

933
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,970
and the market economy.

934
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,890
It serves as a historical lesson

935
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,370
for modern food safety regulation.
