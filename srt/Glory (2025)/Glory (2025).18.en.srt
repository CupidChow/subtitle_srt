00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,000
-Okay!
-Cover them quickly!

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,720
Hurry up!

186
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,320
Act quickly, you all!

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,630
Unfold them all!

188
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,330
Okay!

189
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,320
Hurry!

190
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,460
Bring some stones here to block this area!

191
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,860
Okay!

192
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,830
Spread it over there.

193
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,100
-Okay!
-Spread it over here, too.

194
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,500
Okay!

195
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,110
You blind fool!

196
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,960
Song! Song!

197
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Song!

198
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,810
What are you doing?

199
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,010
How could you hit him?

200
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,110
He hasn't slept

201
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,910
for three consecutive days.

202
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,240
Do you have no humanity?

203
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,270
It's his own fault for being useless.

204
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,840
Why are you all

205
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,670
staring at me?

206
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,790
Hurry up and dig ditches to drain water!

207
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,510
If the roots of the tea trees
rot or wither,

208
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,830
all of you will be held accountable!

209
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,090
None of you can escape!

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,260
Get to work now!

211
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,280
Stand up! Take them to work now!

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,390
I'm quitting!

213
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,190
You hit people indiscriminately.
Let's quit!

214
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,290
I'm quitting! I'm quitting! I'm quitting!

215
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,300
You're all tea slaves of the Rong family.

216
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,010
Each of you
has signed the servitude indenture.

217
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,630
So what if I hit you?
What can you do about it?

218
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,310
I'm quitting! I'm quitting! I'm quitting!

219
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,290
Stop it!

220
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,710
I'm telling you all to stop it!

221
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,850
Stop it!

222
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,660
Stop it, you all!

223
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,710
It's Lady Shanbao!

224
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,040
Lady Shanbao is back!

225
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,080
Rong Yunyin.

226
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,300
Is this how you manage the plantations?

227
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,240
Buddies!

228
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,630
The Rong family
doesn't treat us as humans!

229
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,270
Lady Yunyin
is her own younger sister.

230
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,510
How could she possibly
speak for outsiders?

231
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,570
-That's right!
-Yeah! That's right!

232
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,380
-They're a family!
-That's right!

233
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,910
The tea plantations at the foot
of the mountains are all flooded.

234
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,640
Many tea trees on the mountains

235
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,370
have also been damaged by hail.

236
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,770
This year's autumn tea

237
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,660
depends entirely
on these several plantations.

238
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,800
Guys, please help to

239
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,970
dig ditches to drain water overnight

240
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,300
so that the tea trees
won't soak in water for too long.

241
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,030
We must find a way

242
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,250
to preserve next year's harvest.

243
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,870
Your Rong family
always abuses and exploits the workers.

244
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,290
How could you still expect us
to work hard for you?

245
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,600
That's right! I'm quitting!

246
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,630
Let's go down the mountains tonight!

247
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,000
-Let's go!
-Let's go! I'm quitting!

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,930
-Let's go!
-That's right! Let's go!

249
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,990
What rights do you have to hit others?

250
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,460
Stop!

251
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,390
Exactly!

252
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,790
The monthly wages in Rong's Plantation

253
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,720
are already 10% higher than the others'.

254
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
During every tea-picking season,

255
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,960
Lady Shanbao would even give you

256
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,750
extra five dou of rice each month.

257
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,170
Those who have elderly people at home

258
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,150
would receive
additional firewood, wine and meat.

259
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,480
Lady Yunyin may be overbearing,

260
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,270
but Lady Shanbao has never

261
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,550
treated any of you unfairly.

262
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,080
Besides, you all

263
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,500
have signed the servitude indenture.

264
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,510
Once you defy the tea plantation's owner,

265
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,720
sending you to officials for punishment
would be a minor consequence.

266
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,390
In the future, if Lady Shanbao

267
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,920
makes a statement about it,

268
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,200
which tea plantation
will dare to hire you?

269
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,700
For a momentary fit of anger,

270
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,480
you might make your family members
live a hard life.

271
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
It's not worth it.

272
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,700
That's truly not worth it.

273
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,630
Capture that ringleader

274
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,320
for me now!

275
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,990
I'd like to see who dares to do it!

276
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,510
W-Well...

277
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,670
Shanbao.

278
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,320
All of you, look carefully!

279
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,720
The mark on this whip

280
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,960
is in the shape of tea leaves

281
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,670
and has been passed down for 400 years.

282
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,750
The Rong family
has planted vast tea groves here

283
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,270
and established tea trade routes.

284
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,420
In the city, hundreds of

285
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,550
large or small shops

286
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,280
all make a living by tea leaves.

287
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,000
You are all mountain people,

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,030
who have lived here for generations.

289
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,620
You depend on the mountains for a living

290
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,030
by growing and processing tea leaves.

291
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,360
Without tea, you cannot survive.

292
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,960
Without tea,

293
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,030
up and down the mountains,

294
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,690
how many people would starve?

295
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,550
Tea is the lifeblood of tea artisans.

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,790
This tea plantation is my lifeblood.

297
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,840
Those who are willing to stay tonight

298
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
will receive extra two months' wages.

299
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,670
As for those who dare to
leave the mountains without permission,

300
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,150
if the autumn tea leaves
can't be delivered

301
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,940
and the reputation
of the Rong family's tea is damaged,

302
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,500
they would be considered as destroying

303
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,360
the livelihood of countless tea farmers

304
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,510
and making enemies

305
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,440
with me forever.

306
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,680
Just see if I would spare him.

307
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,390
What Lady Shanbao said makes sense.

308
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,960
Yes.

309
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Lady Shanbao truly

310
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,750
shows solicitude
for rough fellows like us.

311
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,030
With Lady Shanbao here,

312
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,320
we don't need to worry.

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,200
Yi.

314
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
Give her a hoe.

315
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,090
Tell her to go down there
and clear the silt too.

316
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,720
Take a hoe!

317
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,830
I'm not going!

318
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,490
I'm not going, Shanbao!

319
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm your own sister.

320
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,670
How could you treat me like this?

321
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm sorry, Shanbao!

322
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
I'm not going! I'm not going!

323
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,360
Shanbao!

324
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,890
This boy just fainted from shock.

325
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,560
His life is not in danger for now.

326
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,760
Take him down to bandage his wounds now.

327
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,850
Lady Shanbao.

328
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,870
Get to work now.

329
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,390
Let's get to work!

330
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,360
Come on!

331
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
Let's get to work!

332
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,180
Just disperse.

333
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,330
Having whipped her this time
will deepened her hatred.

334
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
If you want her to truly submit to you

335
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,380
and try to make peace with her,

336
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,170
I don't think
you can achieve that in the future.

337
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,200
Her feelings for me are worthless.

338
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,080
But my tea leaves are extremely valuable.

339
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,550
I can't afford to wait.
Nor do I dare to wait.

340
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,730
Your kindness has been wasted.

341
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,079
However, as for what I've promised you,

342
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,560
I will definitely keep my word.

343
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,589
Rong Shanbao, you'd better

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
truly remember

345
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,780
this promise well.

346
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,430
The weather has cleared up.
Guys, act quickly!

347
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,770
-Okay!
-Okay!

348
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,560
[Rong's Tea Plantation]

349
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,110
Lady Yunxi, Lady Xiangling.

350
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,160
Mr. Yan.

351
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,350
Wasn't there some trouble

352
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,920
in the tea plantations on the mountains?

353
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,850
Where is Yunyin?

354
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,310
Yunxi!

355
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,220
Yunxi!

356
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,860
Yunxi, save me now!

357
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,220
Save me now!

358
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,510
Yunxi!

359
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,800
I... I can't stand it anymore!

360
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,090
Take me back home now!

361
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,160
Yunyin.

362
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,980
You were sent here
to manage the tea plantations.

363
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,750
How did you end up
looking like a mud monkey?

364
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,680
What happened?

365
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,300
It's all Rong Shanbao's fault.

366
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,970
I fell into a mud pit.

367
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,550
Shut up! All of you, shut up!

368
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,030
Who dares to laugh?

369
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,550
Shut up!

370
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,750
Shut up!

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,030
Believe it or not,
I'll slaughter all of you!

372
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,760
Lady Yunyin.

373
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,550
I'm afraid
what you're saying doesn't count.

374
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,510
That's right.

375
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,400
Yeah! That's right! Exactly!

376
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,360
Where is Lady Shanbao?
How come she's not here?

377
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,160
Lady Shanbao
was worried about the new plantation,

378
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,290
so she asked Mr. Lu to go there with her.

379
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,200
Is there any medicine for wounds here?

380
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Mr. Yan is badly injured.

381
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,240
He must have got injured

382
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,830
from clearing the obstacles
on the roads previously.

383
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,000
I told you not to do it personally,

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,870
but you refused to listen to me.

385
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,960
How are we supposed to explain this
to Grandmother?

386
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,030
Hurry! Take him

387
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,490
to the tea shed over there
to apply medicine.

388
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,310
Young Master, you're too honest.

389
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,750
Look how cunning that guy is.

390
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,400
He always chooses the perfect moments
to curry favor.

391
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,130
It's not Lady Shanbao's fault.

392
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,920
Yunxi, take me back home now!

393
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,440
Yunxi!

394
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Yunxi!

395
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,270
You withdrew all the workers
who were repairing the embankments,

396
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,960
which caused the 800 acres of tea fields

397
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,700
at the foot of the mountains
to be flooded.

398
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,720
Tonight,
you've been left here to dig ditches,

399
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
which could barely count as
atonement for your mistakes.

400
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,190
Otherwise,
if Grandmother hears about this,

401
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,850
you'll be in serious trouble.

402
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,860
After you've made such a big mistake,

403
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,350
except for

404
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,830
your own sister born from the same mother,

405
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,590
who else would help you clean up the mess?

406
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,590
This is not just punishment for you,

407
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,450
but she's also trying to save you.

408
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,690
Rong Yunyin,

409
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,930
you've been muddle-headed
for so many years.

410
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,590
Who is close or estranged?
And who is good or bad?

411
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,220
It's also time for you to wake up.

412
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,280
My Lady, he's the one from the He family.

413
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,910
Tell him to go back.

414
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,400
Haven't we already asked someone
to deliver the message?

415
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,510
When Lady Yunxi has time,

416
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,750
she will surely meet with you.

417
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,880
Master He, please wait patiently
for a few more days.

418
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,940
Please go back now.

419
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,110
No more nonsense.

420
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,960
The tea mountains are all flooded.

421
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,280
You're still trying to fool people, huh?

422
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,540
Bring her down to talk.

423
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,760
Come down!

424
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,550
Lady Yunxi!

425
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,200
Previously, I heard that your He family

426
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,420
was a powerful non-native,

427
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,550
specializing in gaining improper benefits

428
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,790
on the waterways.

429
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,810
I thought it was just a rumor,

430
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,240
but now I'm seeing it with my own eyes.

431
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,090
Who do you think my Rong family is?

432
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,920
How dare you, a non-native,
act so impudently?

433
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,510
I can't worry about all that now.

434
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,310
After this year's autumn-tea-leaf picking
is finished,

435
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,070
if the Rong family
can't deliver the tea leaves,

436
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,200
half of my assets

437
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,790
will be lost in there.

438
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,840
Unlike you,
I wasn't born with a silver spoon.

439
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
I've earned every copper coin

440
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
by fighting through wind and waves.

441
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,440
Lady Yunxi, I'm sorry but you have to

442
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,240
come with me.

443
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,350
When Old Madam Rong
gives me a definite answer,

444
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,240
I promise I'll send you back home
safe and sound.

445
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,000
Stop it!

446
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,920
Lady Shanbao has said
these several days might not be peaceful

447
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,550
and has specifically ordered me

448
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,280
to escort Lady Yunxi back home.

449
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,270
Alright.

450
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,790
I've also lived my life
on the edge of a knife

451
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,450
and have never feared anyone.

452
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Truth has never depended on
how loudly one speaks.

453
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,140
Your Rong family
owes me 1,000 jin of tea leaves.

454
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,710
It's all clearly written

455
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,070
on the paper.

456
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,750
We may have to settle this
at the County Office,

457
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,440
which will cause you great trouble.

458
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,960
Go ahead and file charges if you want.

459
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,720
There are still a few more questions

460
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,250
Lady Shanbao
would like to ask you, Master He.

461
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,480
He Gui!

462
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,720
Have you settled

463
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,750
the murder case

464
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,120
you committed in Pingjiang?

465
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,000
Your 5,000-tael stolen money

466
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,350
can't be used to buy our legal tea leaves.

467
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,310
I suggest you to keep the money
to buy your life instead.

468
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,600
In Linji's territory,

469
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,050
even a powerful non-native
would become a struggling scoundrel.

470
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,070
Lady Shanbao
wasn't going to deal with you,

471
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,360
but you're
asking for trouble here yourself.

472
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,890
Your deposit
has been sent back to your place.

473
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,510
Your eight sworn brothers

474
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,400
who traveled with you

475
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,270
are now tied up

476
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,390
under the big willow tree
at the Shili Slope outside the city.

477
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,310
In the future, if you dare to be violent
and aggressive again,

478
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,110
killing innocent people

479
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,590
and breaking
the Rong family's cardinal rules,

480
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,440
even with the 100 thievish guards

481
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,750
you've brought,

482
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,760
just see
whether you can leave the city or not.

483
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,000
Was it really Rong Shanbao

484
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,460
who asked you to pick me up?

485
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,970
Lady Yunxi, please.

486
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,630
[Rong Mansion]

487
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,010
Thankfully, my dear Bao is here.

488
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,930
If we had relied on those several girls,

489
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,330
who can't tell right from wrong,

490
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,160
I'm afraid they would have

491
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,240
made terrible mistakes

492
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,590
and would ruin
our Rong family's century-old business

493
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,520
sooner or later.

494
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,750
I was right about you.

495
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
You are truly
the pillar of our Rong family.

496
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,640
We can't be without you even for a day.

497
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,030
Grandmother, I'm back.

498
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,460
You boasted about it in front of me,

499
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,550
but you didn't even show up
after causing trouble.

500
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,000
Is this
how you sisters take responsibility?

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,660
Kneel down!

502
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,830
Grandmother, please let me explain.

503
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,690
It was Yunyin who swore to Heavens

504
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,030
and asked me to entirely entrust
the tea plantations to her.

505
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,510
She said even if the sky fell,

506
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,170
she would be able to handle it.

507
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,480
It's my fault for being gullible

508
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,330
and believing in her boastful words.

509
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,670
And I was too focused
on the autumn tea business,

510
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,200
so I didn't monitor the work
in the plantations on a daily basis.

511
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,110
Laster, I became so soft-hearted that

512
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,510
I was deceived by others,

513
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,680
signing a contract with the He family.

514
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,480
I didn't know he was such a brute,

515
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,510
who somehow

516
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,830
heard some gossip

517
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,510
and believed that the Rong family
couldn't deliver the tea leaves.

518
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,110
It almost led to big trouble.

519
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,440
Because of that,
Lady Shanbao had to work while being sick,

520
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,240
and you got so worried and angry.

521
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,550
Please forgive me, Grandmother.

522
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,480
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,400
Yun'e.

524
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,030
Intercede for me now.

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,930
Three days ago, right in this hall,

526
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,790
Yunxi and Yunyin firmly made a guarantee,

527
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,310
only saying
for a hundred years in Linji,

528
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,070
there had never been heavy rain
destroying the tea leaves.

529
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,960
You even withdrew the people

530
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,480
Lady Shanbao had sent
to repair the embankments.

531
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,640
It showed that you only cared about
immediate benefits

532
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,040
with no long-term plans.

533
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,440
Unfortunately, Heaven wasn't on your side.

534
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
The tea plantations at the foot
of the mountains are all destroyed.

535
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,590
The tea trees on the mountains

536
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,250
were all damaged by hail, too.

537
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,270
Now that this disaster has happened,

538
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,930
with all this mess left there,

539
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,200
what should we do?

540
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,750
Your knees

541
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,350
aren't made of gold and jade.

542
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,680
The tea trees that were washed away

543
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,930
won't come back
no matter how long you kneel.

544
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,560
Besides,

545
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,890
you've always been close to Yunyin.

546
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
You two are on the same side.

547
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,590
How would you bear to let her

548
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,480
suffer alone in the tea plantations?

549
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,920
Perhaps you'd better

550
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,780
share some of the burden with her.

551
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,750
Please don't be angry, Grandmother.

552
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,480
When a newbie tries to pan-fry tea leaves,

553
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,310
he might scorch them,
make them too yellow,

554
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,070
overdo it

555
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,170
or fail to dry them thoroughly.

556
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,110
No newbies could do it perfectly
without any mistakes.

557
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,070
At this point,

558
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,700
blaming Yunxi won't help.

559
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,790
Let's just find a way to make up for it.

560
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,270
But please don't worry, Grandmother.

561
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,500
I've already asked people

562
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
to urgently transfer tea leaves
from the prefectures and counties

563
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,060
that are unaffected by the disaster.

564
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
However,
the Longjing tea leaves produced elsewhere

565
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,570
are not as good as those from Linji.

566
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,070
Yunxi, I'd like to ask you

567
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,950
to visit our old customers one by one

568
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,760
and discuss

569
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,410
how to make up
for this year's autumn tea leaves first.

570
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,740
We absolutely cannot
damage the Rong family's reputation.

571
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,050
Of course.

572
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,330
Watch your step.

573
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,160
Come here.

574
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,080
There's another matter

575
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,910
I need to tell you, Grandmother.

576
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,850
This child's mother

577
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
was a tea worker in our plantations.

578
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,100
She often delivered meals
and did trivial work at the embankments.

579
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,070
A few days ago, she was unfortunately
washed away by the flood.

580
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,680
Seeing that this child has nowhere to go

581
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,510
and she's so adorable and beautiful,

582
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,970
I want to keep her by my side

583
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,770
and adopt her as my daughter

584
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,480
to prevent her from being homeless

585
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,010
and all alone in this world.

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,960
She's just a child.

587
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,860
If you like her,

588
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,660
just keep her by your side.

589
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,040
It's her good fortune as well.

590
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,110
Did you hear that?

591
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,680
From today onwards,

592
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,940
you are a daughter of the Rong family.

593
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,240
Look.

594
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,350
It wants to eat something.

595
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,200
Put it here.

596
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,550
It's all spilled out.

597
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,790
Rong Shanbao.

598
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,790
You were aware of Mr. He's background.

599
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,790
You also knew
Yunyin's temperament very well.

600
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,030
Obviously, you set up a trap

601
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,640
and tried to make us fall into it.

602
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,040
Do you think I can't sense

603
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,960
these schemes of yours at all?

604
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,960
Sooner or later, I'll expose everything
in front of Grandmother.

605
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Then none of us can get any benefits.

606
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,540
Now I understand,

607
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,020
three years ago,

608
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,180
when you went all the way
to Fuzhou to learn tea skills,

609
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,110
you truly benefited a lot from it.‌

610
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,620
A moment of passion

611
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,440
resulted in this romantic entanglement.

612
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,240
Even if Grandmother finds out about it,

613
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,920
I'll just be labeled as

614
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,320
a rebellious young girl.

615
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,580
It won't shake my foundation.

616
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,880
Grandmother will still have to
keep me around

617
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
to compete with you.

618
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,130
This is what an heir

619
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,080
must go through.

620
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,110
Just like a whetstone,

621
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
I'm still of great use to Grandmother.

622
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,410
How would she easily give me up?

623
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,980
Don't think that

624
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,870
you can threaten me

625
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,660
with this child.

626
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,330
Call her Mother.

627
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,570
You...

628
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,790
In the past, children from our Rong family

629
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,360
were treated by all sisters
as their own kids

630
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,820
and were raised together.

631
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,490
If you teach her
to call us Mother or Aunt,

632
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,060
it would just create alienation instead.

633
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,520
Since she calls me Mother,

634
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,530
calling you Mother as well

635
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,420
is simply following the old custom

636
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,750
of the Rong family sisters
raising children together.

637
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,190
What right do outsiders have to comment?

638
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,200
Mother.

639
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,310
Regardless of what kind of person

640
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,770
her birth father might be,

641
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,920
and whether Grandmother
would allow him to join our family,

642
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,850
I only acknowledge this one thing.

643
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,400
The offsprings of the Rong family

644
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,330
cannot be left abandoned outside.

645
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,400
Let's raise and teach
our daughter properly.

646
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,880
Don't let her become as wilful

647
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,240
and undisciplined as Yunyin
when she grows up.

648
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
By that time,
it'll be too late to regret it.

649
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,920
Pack up the young master's things

650
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,520
properly.

651
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
Then take them to the Xinfang Pavilion.

652
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,410
When did I say I was moving out?

653
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,060
Who told you to touch my things
without permission?

654
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,230
Jun Dai! What's going on?

655
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,820
Say something.

656
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,790
I ordered them

657
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,440
to move your belongings

658
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,100
back to the Xinfang Pavilion.

659
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,440
Lady Shanbao,
you haven't recovered from your cold yet.

660
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,750
There should be someone
taking care of you by your side.

661
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,610
I'm not moving.

662
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,280
Go ahead.

663
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,840
Put them down!

664
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,290
I've thought carefully
about what you said.

665
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,070
Though we are sisters

666
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,790
from the same family,

667
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,500
I can't always give in,

668
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,140
which might pose a threat.

669
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
Those who should be suppressed
must be suppressed, too.

670
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,060
Those who should be restricted
must also be restricted.

671
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,790
I have to make plans decisively

672
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
and implement them appropriately.

673
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,750
I can't damage our sisterhood

674
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,480
or break Grandmother's heart.

675
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I also need to handle everything
nicely and decently.

676
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Therefore, I've made up my mind.

677
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,040
I'll keep Yunyin

678
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,160
in the tea plantations
to atone for her mistakes.

679
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,590
She always complains
that Grandmother favors others

680
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,480
and doesn't allow her
to enter the plantations.

681
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,920
So I'll just ask her to start with

682
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,590
such trivial work as digging ditches
and planting tea trees.

683
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,480
Once she understands others' hardships,

684
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,440
she'll realize what mistakes she has made.

685
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,550
We'll discuss this matter later.

686
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,409
But Lady Shanbao, I'm not moving.

687
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,770
Delivery of this year's autumn tea leaves
will inevitably be delayed.

688
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,920
Some of our old customers
are difficult to deal with.

689
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
I'm afraid they won't save face for Yunxi.

690
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,760
I'd better visit them personally
to smooth things over.

691
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
Rong Shanbao, today, why are you...

692
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,630
Xiu Qiong,
stay home and make preparations.

693
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,920
You don't need to come with me.

694
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,440
Yes.

695
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,030
Rong Shanbao.

696
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,920
I haven't finished speaking yet,

697
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,520
and you're already leaving.

698
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,020
You used me and then dumped me.

699
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,010
How could there be such a person
in this world?

700
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,620
Congratulations, Mr. Lu!

701
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,770
Mr. Lu, there will be a wedding.

702
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,880
A wedding?

703
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,840
Once we finish the ceremony
in front of the paired pillars

704
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,880
in the Rong family's ancestral hall,

705
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,010
we'll be husband and wife officially.

706
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,590
In the hundred years
of the Rong family's history,

707
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,150
there has never been another case
like this.

708
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,080
That's not okay.

709
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,510
My Lord, you are a distinguished official
in the imperial court

710
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,150
and a close minister to the Emperor

711
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,670
with limitless prospects.

712
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,670
You're only gaining experience
in the provinces for a few years.

713
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,440
You'll return to the capital
sooner or later.

714
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,800
If you're truly going to get married,

715
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,030
you can choose a prime minister's daughter

716
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,630
or even a prince's daughter.

717
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,150
How could you stay in Linji

718
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,070
and become a son-in-law
to that Rong family?

719
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,320
As an official, I strive to
bring benefits for the local people.

720
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,030
It doesn't matter

721
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,560
where I work as an official.

722
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,760
Even though there are many powerful people

723
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,700
and beautiful ladies in the capital,

724
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,670
how could I possibly find

725
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,920
another Lady Rong Shanbao from there
to be my match?

726
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,250
Fortunately, I've been

727
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,960
steadfast in my principles
and cautious from the start.

728
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,630
I never curry favor with the powerful men

729
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,360
or make marriage promises easily.

730
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,190
I've been determined to wait for someone
I truly love.

731
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,300
Otherwise, if I were to change my mind
and get engaged to Lady Rong Shanbao now,

732
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,180
wouldn't I become

733
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,780
a person who breaks his word?

734
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,830
What did you just say?

735
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,970
I think you're just jealous

736
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,830
and trying to stand in my way.

737
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,630
My Lord!

738
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,840
Alright, alright.

739
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,190
I know no matter how hard you've tried,

740
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,400
you still can't get into the Rong family.

741
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,190
Being able to see Bao once

742
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,960
should be considered as your good fortune.

743
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,880
If one constantly
harbors jealousy and anxiety,

744
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,080
it's easy for illness
to develop in his organs.

745
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,550
That would be unfortunate.

746
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,840
What are you implying?

747
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,280
My Lord, you're going to marry a beauty

748
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,440
and are quite satisfied,

749
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,230
but you mustn't
forget the important matters.

750
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,670
The Wei family's old case
remains unsolved,

751
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,150
and Madam Yang is still missing.

752
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,840
Nor do we know what tricks

753
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,240
the Rong family has played
in this process.

754
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,730
As the presiding judge,

755
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,130
you will eventually face her in court.

756
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,750
If you two truly get married,

757
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,110
how will the Wei family's grievances
be redressed?

758
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,770
And how will you make a ruling?

759
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,430
I will certainly be fair and impartial,

760
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,760
showing no favoritism.

761
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,400
Even if you maintain absolute fairness

762
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,940
and show no favoritism to relatives,

763
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,980
Lady Rong Shanbao

764
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,160
is extremely proud.

765
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,030
She will surely suspect that

766
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,030
you have ulterior motives
for infiltrating into the Rong family.

767
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,560
Let alone becoming lovers,

768
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm afraid

769
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,130
she might confront you with weapons.

770
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,130
She won't do that.

771
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,250
And I certainly won't.

772
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,630
Even if that doesn't happen,

773
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,320
how will you handle the situation?

774
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,710
Therefore,
this wedding with the Rong family

775
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,310
absolutely cannot proceed.

776
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:11,900
No way.

777
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,950
My Lord!

778
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,150
You haven't even thought this through.

779
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,110
The Rong family is prestigious

780
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,550
with great power throughout Linji.

781
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,510
How would they tolerate me
refusing the marriage arbitrarily?

782
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,240
Although I've infiltrated into
the Rong family now,

783
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,670
I haven't seen Madam Yang yet.

784
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,180
My household has even been attacked,

785
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,830
and my status remains unclear.

786
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,150
Before reinforcements
arrive from the capital,

787
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,950
can I even leave the Rong family?

788
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,520
My Lord, you're right.

789
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
I've failed to consider it thoroughly.

790
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,380
What should we do then?

791
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,900
To find Madam Yang,

792
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,520
I already have a plan.

793
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,000
However, there's an important matter

794
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,400
that I need you to handle.

795
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,400
Last night, while interrogating Qing Yun,
I got his confession

796
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,320
that after his success,

797
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,670
anyone who wanted to
curry favor with Xu Song

798
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,110
must first pay him a visit.

799
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,360
He also didn't reject anyone's visit

800
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,810
and has benefited greatly from it.

801
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,630
He even keeps

802
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,670
an opera performer as his mistress
in the Zhenhe Street.

803
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,500
She possesses

804
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,020
a ledger secretly,

805
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,630
which has records about all bribe money
Xu Song has received.

806
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,400
But you can't deal with it in person.

807
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm afraid Xu Song

808
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,670
has already become suspicious of you.

809
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,010
Since it's the vital physical evidence,

810
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,180
I should go myself.

811
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,710
My Lord, don't worry.

812
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,320
I will be extra cautious.

813
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,900
It's getting late.

814
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,880
My Lord, you should go back now

815
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,140
lest the Rong family's members
should become suspicious.

816
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,510
Fragrance pouches and sachets!

817
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,970
Come and take a look!

818
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,630
Fragrance pouches and sachets!

819
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,550
Fragrance pouches and sachets!

820
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,590
[Baozhi Pharmacy]

821
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,390
Young Master.

822
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,110
After the heavy rain,

823
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,000
Lady Shanbao has been incredibly busy.

824
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,590
Her daily medicine

825
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,920
is all decocted in the tea plantations.

826
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,670
There are available doctors
accompanying her.

827
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,840
Why did Miss Xiu Qiong

828
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,970
go to the Baohe Hall?

829
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,780
Let's talk when we get back.

830
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,630
Young Master.

831
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,090
These two men are acting suspiciously.

832
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,290
There must be something fishy going on.

833
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,270
Lady Rong Shanbao
is difficult to deal with.

834
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,110
This is a perfect chance
to let those two men

835
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,230
be my vanguards.

836
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,360
It's also good
to have them test the water.

837
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,690
Keep a close eye on them.

838
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,390
If there's any unusual activity,

839
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,790
report it to me immediately.

840
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,270
Yes.

841
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,590
-Young Master!
-My tofu!

842
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,800
What's wrong with you?

843
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,710
You knocked over my tofu.

844
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,640
You can't leave!

845
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,650
Take this.

846
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,480
This is not okay.

847
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,960
Tofu means "gathering luck."

848
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,360
You've knocked over my container,

849
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,030
and my luck has run away.

850
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,800
We've given you the money.

851
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Why are you still trying to pester us?

852
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,150
Such a small sum of money is not enough.

853
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,960
Do you know how hard it is

854
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,800
to make tofu?

855
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,800
You can't leave!

856
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,600
That's right.

857
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,110
Mr. Hu, stop moving around.

858
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,340
Let me carry this stuff there for you.

859
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,650
What's that noise?

860
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,370
It seems to be coming from the tea house.

861
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,770
Let's go check it out now.

862
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,360
Isn't this Yang Yitang?

863
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,200
Did you two see that?

864
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,940
A thief tried to attack me.

865
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,700
You ungrateful scoundrel!

866
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,400
We usually treat you as an honored guest

867
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,320
and provide you
with the best food and drinks.

868
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,030
I can't believe
you turn out to be a thief.

869
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,510
Tell me!

870
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,710
Why did you sneakily

871
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,570
follow us here?

872
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,910
Could it be that you want to steal

873
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,070
the Rong family's tea-making methods?

874
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,280
Lady Shanbao, I'm innocent.

875
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,960
Help!

876
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,440
How dare you still tell lies?

877
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,990
Xiangling, stop it!

878
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,590
I... I followed Mr. Lu

879
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,230
in here.

880
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,480
Everyone in this mansion is saying

881
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,320
Lady Rong Shanbao has allowed him
to pay respects at the ancestral hall

882
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,150
and complete the wedding ceremony.

883
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,320
It's such wonderful news.

884
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,380
I... I was going to congratulate him.

885
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,590
But I saw him change into casual clothes,

886
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,800
avoid people
and sneak around suspiciously,

887
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,920
so I followed him in here.

888
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,550
You're still lying?

889
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,920
Lady Shanbao, if you don't believe it,

890
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,230
ask Mr. Lu to come over here.

891
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,440
I'm willing to confront him face to face.

892
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,190
Just ask him to come over here.

893
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,320
Then you'll know the truth.

894
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,400
Heaven is watching above us.

895
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,070
If anything I've said is untrue,

896
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,930
just let that lightning
strike half of my body down.

897
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,550
Do you know this trick

898
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,060
has been used by someone else before?

899
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Why on earth

900
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,150
did you follow him here?

901
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,360
My...

902
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,670
My... My cousin was perfectly fine

903
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,060
when he entered the Rong Mansion.

904
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,960
Then he died
and was carried back home on a board.

905
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,800
After that, the elders sent me here,

906
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
hoping that I could accomplish something.

907
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,320
Last time, a woman visited the house
and claimed to be a relative.

908
00:42:59,320 --> 00:42:59,880
I thought

909
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,680
Mr. Lu was keeping someone here.

910
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,150
I expected to get something on him

911
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,550
so that I could threaten him.

912
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,510
But unexpectedly,

913
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,840
I offended Lady Rong Shanbao.

914
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,090
What are you talking about?

915
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,300
You're talking nonsense.

916
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,960
I think you've lost your mind.

917
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,590
Mr. Hu has been working on
pan-frying tea leaves

918
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,980
in our plantations for 30 years.

919
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,340
He unfortunately injured his leg.

920
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,600
I accompanied Shanbao here to visit him.

921
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,710
Amazing!

922
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,440
No matter how many plasters I used,
it wasn't effective.

923
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,230
Thankfully, Lady Shanbao brought me

924
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,860
the prescription from the Baohe Hall.

925
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,190
It's really effective.

926
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,610
Look at this leg.

927
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,990
I can even walk a few steps
without any pain now.

928
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,800
In this way,

929
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,830
it won't hinder me
from pan-frying tea leaves.

930
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,910
I'm glad it's effective.

931
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,190
Lady Shanbao,
we've searched the entire courtyard

932
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,960
and found no outsiders.

933
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,150
The footprints on the low wall

934
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,880
belong to just one person, too.

935
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,800
You shameless liar!

936
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,350
What else can you say now?

937
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,000
I saw him enter the alley
with my own eyes.

938
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,400
He must have been trying to mislead us.

939
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,920
Lady Shanbao, if you hurry back now,

940
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,050
I'm sure you can catch him red-handed.

941
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:01,120
Go!

942
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,230
[Rong Mansion]

943
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,480
Those dragon-and-phoenix

944
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,510
and marital-harmony patterns
are too vulgar.

945
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,260
It's better
to choose the Magnolia patterns.

946
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,030
Let's also not waste

947
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,050
that pair of phoenixes
you've carefully drawn.

948
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,220
Make them into shoe uppers.

949
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,320
I'm sure Lady Shanbao will be pleased.

950
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,110
I got it.

951
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,530
Thank you for your guidance, Young Master.

952
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,320
If you want to use flowers,

953
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,650
why not choose peonies?

954
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,480
That would symbolize
wealth and prosperity.

955
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,880
It must not be too vulgar.

956
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,400
Okay. I got it.

957
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,630
Alright.

958
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,200
Fortunately,
I didn't go in there recklessly.

959
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,330
It was indeed a trap.

[West Lake Longjing Tea]

961
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,400
I've already asked people

962
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,960
to urgently transfer tea leaves
from the prefectures and counties

963
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,020
that are unaffected by the disaster.

964
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,670
However,
the Longjing tea leaves produced elsewhere

965
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,600
are not as good as those from Linji.

966
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,070
Yunxi, I'd like to ask you

967
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,860
to visit our old customers one by one

968
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,750
and discuss

969
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,360
how to make up
for this year's autumn tea leaves first.

970
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,230
We absolutely cannot
damage the Rong family's reputation.

West Lake Longjing Tea

972
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,440
is one of our country's top 10
famous tea types.

973

natural environment,

975
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,530
embodying the essence

and the wisdom
of the West Lake's tea artisans.

977
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,480

making it famous worldwide.

983
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,120
That's why it's deeply loved

984
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,590
by people
both domestically and internationally.

good varieties selection,
diligent cultivation

989
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,840
and meticulous picking processes

990

through long-term production practices.

991
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,800
Especially during the pan-frying process,

992
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,400
they gradually developed

993
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,880
a set of distinctive technical

Its production technique
is a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage

1001
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,630
