[Glory]

00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,930
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,310
What?

4
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,310
For a mere servant,

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,130
Miss Rong is interrogating me now?

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,310
Who said Mr. Lu

7
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,039
is a servant of the Rong family?

8
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,210
Steward Cheng,

9
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,600
does our household have
his indenture contract?

10
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,340
No.

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,870
Since there's no indenture contract,

12
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,870
he is a free man.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,320
Mr. Yang, you should speak
with more respect.

14
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,870
What does it matter
if he's a free man?

15
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,450
People get hurt and die
in martial arts arena all the time.

16
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,050
My shoulder was injured too.

17
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,550
Blood had soaked through my clothes.

18
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,950
Who can I complain to
about this injustice?

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,280
Just a scratch,

20
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,050
and he's hiding behind a woman

21
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,560
while lording it over everyone.

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,890
What kind of man are you?

23
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,890
Well, you...

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,400
You hurt someone
and still speak such vile words.

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
You're far too arrogant.

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,750
A real man is one
who poisons his blade

27
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,840
and schemes tirelessly to kill?

28
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
Such a real man,
being so ruthless and vile,

29
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,190
I think,

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,170
I'd better off not being one at all.

31
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,329
This is clearly a false accusation!

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,220
Yang Dingchen,

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,590
no matter how wronged you feel,

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,690
you should just talk about it.

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,150
Don't frighten my cousin.

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,030
Truth is only revealed through debate.

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,240
Resorting to force is a vulgar descent.

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,710
Mr. Yang,

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,280
do not be impudent here.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,800
Take this.

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,990
No way.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,370
Manzhu, go invite Doctor Zhao, hurry.

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Yes, Miss Rong.

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,780
Stop putting on an act.

45
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,140
When did I ever poison my sword?

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,210
It's you, pretty boy, who's lying!

47
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,370
Let go! Let me go!

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,190
Miss Rong.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,710
This is slander and a setup.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,260
You can't believe him.

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,940
Show him.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,690
Yes.

53
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,400
You issued the challenge yourself.

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
The weapon that caused the injury
was your favorite sword.

55
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
We have the doctor's testimony
and physical evidence too.

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,730
How could anyone frame you?

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,530
Would someone really frame you

58
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,950
by risking their own life?

59
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,360
Perhaps someone

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,760
is lying behind our back.

61
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,660
It's you?

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
It's you?

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Or you?

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Fine.

65
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,120
You're all ganging up

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,190
against me alone.

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,110
When a thousand fingers point at someone,

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,110
even the innocent can drown in spit.

69
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,070
Those with clear consciences

70
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,670
don't fear midnight knocks.

71
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,310
If you truly have nothing to hide,

72
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,710
why fear confronting us?

73
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,520
Only mad dogs bite randomly.

74
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,020
You...

75
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm kindly enough to try to help you.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,130
How does it have anything to do with me?

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
This is evidence.

78
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,780
We can testify as witnesses.

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,680
Once we go to court,

80
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,040
you'll surely
be charged with attempted murder.

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,159
According to our dynasty's law,

82
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,420
those who plot murder shall be beheaded.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,780
Those who injure
but don't kill shall be hanged.

84
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,750
See? How should this be handled?

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,810
Miss Rong.

86
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,130
I have treated you with sincerity

87
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,210
and came to
propose with honest intentions.

88
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,870
You must believe me.

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,010
I was set up by someone.

90
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,960
If you apply the poison,

91
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,870
then you are

92
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,800
a scheming, treacherous villain.

93
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,730
If you were framed,

94
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,430
you couldn't even
protect your own sword,

95
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,240
so how could you protect Miss Rong
and the Rong family?

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Either you're evil or incompetent.

97
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,140
Is this Mr. Yang's sincerity?

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,970
You...

99
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,630
Miss Rong.

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,570
The Rong and the Yang families
have business dealings

101
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,830
and deep connections.

102
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,680
How do I matter?

103
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,960
Let's pretend this never happened today.

104
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,409
I can endure this slight injustice.

105
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,480
Don't ruin the friendship
between two families.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,560
Mr. Yang.

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,430
If it weren't for the histories

108
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,830
and connections between our two families,

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,300
I wouldn't be the one handling this case.

110
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,650
Miss Rong.

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,810
Young Master, think twice.

112
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,000
We have witnesses and evidence.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
If this goes to court,

114
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,150
it will cause
a scandal throughout the city.

115
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,810
You'll not only fail in marriage
but'll also experience more disgrace.

116
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,640
Think and act wisely, Young Master.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,840
I told you,

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,710
I'll handle this matter.

119
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,310
No need for you to worry.

120
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,470
Take good care of your wound.

121
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,950
Yang Dingchen, don't you still understand?

122
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,810
Do you want to
be bound and sent to the County Office?

123
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Miss Rong, since you choose to
listen to only one side,

124
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,090
I have nothing more to say.

125
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,960
You injured him.

126
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,390
Are you just leaving like this?

127
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,830
I apologize.

128
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I'll have someone deliver

129
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,560
the compensation money.

130
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,630
Thank you all for standing up

131
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,840
for justice.

132
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Young Master.

133
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,270
It's you?

134
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,610
Who is he to you

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,150
that you personally treated his illness

136
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,740
and even gave him
the longevity pill, Young Master?

137
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,660
What a waste!

138
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,300
We're both guests at Rong Mansion.

139
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,630
Our meeting is destiny.

140
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,750
When I clearly have

141
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,360
good medication to cleanse poison
and heal wounds,

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
how could I turn a blind eye to him?

143
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
What kind of person do you think I am?

144
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,070
Young Master, you're too kind-hearted.

145
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,510
Not all guests are equal.

146
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,870
That freeloader at Rong family

147
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,090
is just a penniless outsider,

148
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,919
how could he be compared to Young Master?

149
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,980
You are Lady Rong's

150
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,120
personally chosen grandson-in-law.

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,840
Don't talk nonsense.

152
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,419
Don't run!

153
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,880
It's only a matter of time.

154
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,700
Come here!

155
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,180
Mr. Yan, help!

156
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,240
My Young Master wants to kill me!

157
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,360
If you didn't add the poison,
then who did?

158
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Come here now!

159
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,150
Mr. Yan, please show mercy

160
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,030
and save me!

161
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,100
You won't come?

162
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,030
It must be this wretch

163
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,910
who resented Lu for releasing the snake

164
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,510
and caused all this trouble.

165
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,510
Today I must

166
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,750
punish him severely.

167
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,010
Get out of my way!

168
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,910
Quickly, invite the doctor over!

169
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Miss... Miss Rong!

170
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,330
What are you doing?

171
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,090
You're as cunning as a fox,

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,230
how could you be completely
off guard against Yang Dingchen?

173
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,680
If you really got poisoned,

174
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,740
show me your wound.

175
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,470
I...

176
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,430
I risked my life for you, Miss Rong,

177
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,880
and finally removed your thorn.

178
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,920
You should be thanking me, Miss Rong.

179
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,670
Yet you're suspicious of me?

180
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,060
I just want to check your wound.

181
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,500
Why are you so nervous?

182
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,270
Men and women should keep their distance.

183
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,080
Miss Rong, you absolutely can't do this.

184
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,540
If others were to see this,

185
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,790
it'd be most inappropriate.

186
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,630
Our family doesn't have such rules.

187
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,360
Let go.

188
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,820
Hurry! He's vomiting blood!

189
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm afraid he won't...

190
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,960
Doctor Zhao!

191
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,390
In my presence,

192
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,320
examine his wound again.

193
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,360
Miss Rong.

194
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,600
You...

195
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Do you really not trust me at all?

196
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,440
Miss Rong.

197
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,830
Lady Rong requests Young Master

198
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,760
to go to Chongxi Hall immediately.

199
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,320
See?

200
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,920
Your tricks may fool others,

201
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,260
but they won't fool my Grandmother.

202
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,750
That's truly
bringing trouble upon yourself,

203
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,600
and cutting off your own path to survival.

204
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,030
Is Lady Rong really that frightening?

205
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,480
Grandmother despises nothing more than men

206
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,160
who stir up trouble out of jealousy.

207
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
It's a disaster that you can't escape.

208
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,800
Let's go.

209
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,290
I, Fusheng, pay my respects to Lady Rong.

210
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,010
It was my fault.

211
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,490
I saw that he was all alone in this world,

212
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,890
with no family to rely on,

213
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,500
so I couldn't help
but take extra care of him.

214
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,000
This angered Yang Dingchen

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,370
who became extremely dissatisfied.

216
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,360
In the competition,
Yang Dingchen poisoned his blade,

217
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,890
which nearly killed Mr. Lu.

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,720
Fortunately, Mr. Lu was forgiving enough

219
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
to spare us from this legal trouble.

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,440
Grandmother.

221
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Wait.

222
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,340
I have a few questions for him.

223
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,140
This has nothing to do with you.

224
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,260
Stand aside.

225
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,220
Is everything truly as she described?

226
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,330
I'm grateful to
the Rong family for taking me in,

227
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,680
and for Miss Rong's
kindness and compassion.

228
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,640
I can't be more grateful.

229
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,080
Who knew
trouble would arise out of nowhere,

230
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,010
causing Mr. Yang to become jealous

231
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,410
and bringing about this disaster?

232
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,600
I deeply regret what happened

233
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,960
and sincerely apologize to Lady Rong.

234
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,850
Grandmother, he's seriously injured.

235
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,380
Let him sit while he speaks.

236
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,130
I dare not deceive you, Lady Rong.

237
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,530
Everyone suspects Mr. Yang.

238
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,770
Though there is indeed evidence,

239
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,630
I still have my doubts in my heart.

240
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,180
I've been wanting to inform Lady Rong

241
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,160
and Miss Rong a long time ago.

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,280
Mr. Yang publicly challenged me.

243
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,030
Everyone knew that

244
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,550
he wanted to compete with me.

245
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,750
If someone
really died in martial arts arena,

246
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
Mr. Yang would be held accountable.

247
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,320
Though I'm not familiar with

248
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Mr. Yang's temperament,

249
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,690
given the outstanding candidate
the Yang family has put forward,

250
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,260
he is unlikely to be a fool.

251
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,540
Only because he saw you
as a servant of the Rong family,

252
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,400
whose life and death
are at his master's discretion,

253
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,550
killing a servant

254
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,370
would never cost him his life.

255
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,630
That's possible.

256
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,550
But more likely,

257
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,840
someone wanted to
use him to do their dirty work,

258
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,800
killing two birds with one stone.

259
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,460
Let them in.

260
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,570
Lady Rong.

261
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,710
My lack of guile made me

262
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,550
an easy target for foul play.

263
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,410
I implore you, Lady Rong,
to uphold justice on my behalf.

264
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,960
Tell Lady Rong exactly

265
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,700
what you just told me.

266
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Don't worry. Just tell the truth.

267
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,790
Yes.

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,730
At that time,

269
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,790
I was upset

270
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,540
that the other servants
were drinking and gambling,

271
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,830
leaving only me
to polish the master's sword.

272
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,230
Chang Hong stood up for me

273
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,900
and tried every possible way

274
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,960
to trick me into giving him the sword.

275
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
He is from my hometown

276
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,440
and we've always been close.

277
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,720
How could I know that

278
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,960
he plotted against
our master behind his back?

279
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,200
It was him who applied the poison.

280
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,530
It must be him!

281
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,390
Was the pain of
the whip not enough for you,

282
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,520
or do you wish to try the water dungeon?

283
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,210
Even if you had nine lives,

284
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,430
once you're
in the Rong family dungeon, you will talk.

285
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,890
Now, who asked you to do so?

286
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,670
I...

287
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
Mr. He, how cruel of you.

288
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,100
Mr. Lu has done nothing to you,

289
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,270
yet you're so vicious.

290
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,510
He not only

291
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,910
wants Lu Fusheng's life,

292
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,270
but also wants me to take the blame.

293
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,240
I issued my challenge

294
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,200
fair and square.

295
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,890
I disdain resorting to

296
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,200
stabbing people
in the back with underhanded tricks

297
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,930
Miss Rong,

298
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,050
now you know you've wronged me?

299
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,130
Take them away.

300
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,110
Go.

301
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
I did it.

302
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
So what?

303
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,140
I've been waiting for
your Rong family's son-in-law selection.

304
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,520
If one wants to be the final winner,

305
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,050
they must give it their all.

306
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,750
Isn't that right?

307
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,119
You're truly shameless.

308
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,829
When did I ever tell you

309
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,160
that if you eliminate all your opponents,

310
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,720
you could become

311
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,880
my husband?

312
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,400
Those who turn upon each other

313
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,470
when forced into close quarters
are the serpents and scorpions.

314
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,800
What sets humanity apart from mere beasts

315
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,790
is our capacity for knowledge and wisdom,

316
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,190
our understanding of propriety and shame.

317
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,140
To be exposed without feeling ashamed,

318
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,430
yet rather
projecting your own flaws onto others

319
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,690
and gloating about it.

320
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,390
When the heart is crooked,
no deed can succeed.

321
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,200
When the character is warped,
no enterprise can stand.

322
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
If this is
the family motto of the He family,

323
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,590
no wonder your Huqiu Tea

324
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,130
falls short of others.

325
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,270
What gives a wretched, short-lived

326
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,180
bastard like you the right to lecture me?

327
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,730
Say that again.

328
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,370
Your wound...

329
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,680
I'm fine.

330
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,720
The fault lies entirely in

331
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,850
my momentary indignation and rash words.

332
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,050
I can't blame others.

333
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,380
Miss Rong,

334
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,680
Mr. He and Mr. Yang

335
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,350
are both here as candidates.

336
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,720
Please, do not let more discord arise

337
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,680
because of me.

338
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,070
Let's not pursue this matter further.

339
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,270
Mr. He,

340
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,850
I don't blame you.

341
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
You may leave now.

342
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,680
You just let that go?

343
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,310
If kindness answers malice,
what answers kindness?

344
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,880
How can you, Mr. Lu, indulge

345
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,860
such a vile creature

346
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,140
who shows no remorse?

347
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,070
Do you intend for Lady Rong

348
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,070
to keep him around

349
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,160
to harm Miss Rong in the future?

350
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,150
Your false magnanimity is your own affair.

351
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,890
Don't be generous with
what isn't yours to give.

352
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,550
I haven't forgotten
the grudge of being falsely accused.

353
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,210
But what makes you any better?

354
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,750
Which of your underhanded deeds

355
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,960
is clean?

356
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,910
How about I just

357
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,730
expose them all right here and right now?

358
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,830
Wasn't it all
your instigation to begin with!

359
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,560
What are you all talking about?

360
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,240
Mr. Yang and Mr. He

361
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,140
were invited by the Rong family

362
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,870
to attend the Tea God Festival.

363
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,260
After enjoying the ceremony,

364
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,390
both of you will leave the Rong family.

365
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,130
There was never
any matter of marriage proposal.

366
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,510
Alright.

367
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,870
I'm tired too.

368
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,160
Please make yourselves comfortable.

369
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,900
How wise are you, Grandmother.

370
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,590
Allow me to
respectfully see you out, Grandmother.

371
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,270
Lady Rong!

372
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,060
He Xingming was born to be wicked,

373
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,310
plotting against
people behind their backs.

374
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,330
But I've done nothing wrong.

375
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,590
Why am I also being dismissed?

376
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,270
Lady Rong!

377
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,810
Miss Rong!

378
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,270
I've been utterly devoted to you.

379
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,720
Wouldn't you even

380
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,480
say one word on my behalf?

381
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,050
You know Mr. He's nature well,

382
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,340
but you still get close to him.

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,890
This is just like
bargaining with a tiger for its skin.

384
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,960
You know perfectly well

385
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,020
what you're after.

386
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,720
I...

387
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,550
Being impulsive and jealous is one thing,

388
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,750
being easily
influenced by instigation is another.

389
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,790
Grandmother naturally dislikes this.

390
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,030
This is Chongxi Hall.

391
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,540
Please leave immediately.

392
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,680
Don't disturb Lady Rong's peace.

393
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,590
So the two of us

394
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,320
have been working for nothing.

395
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,610
We both end up wounded

396
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,790
while a third party reaps the benefits.

397
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,390
So many strive
and scheme with all their might,

398
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,220
but none can match your cunning.

399
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,290
I, He, concede defeat.

400
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Young Master.

401
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Thank you, Mr. Yan,
for righting this wrong

402
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,050
and upholding justice.

403
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
In this world,

404
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,910
it's rare to have good people like you.

405
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,770
That servant ran into me himself,

406
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,850
so I then reported to
Lady Rong for a thorough investigation.

407
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,380
If you want to thank someone,
thank Lady Rong.

408
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,130
Everyone, leave.

409
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,750
-Yes!
-Yes!

410
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,850
Miss Rong, I...

411
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,030
Why are you upset again, Miss Rong?

412
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm still injured.

413
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,440
Just now you were barely breathing

414
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,900
as if you were about to die.

415
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,350
But in front of Grandmother,
you were perfectly fine.

416
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,030
You knew from the beginning

417
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,630
it was He Xingming's scheme.

418
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,190
Why didn't you expose him?

419
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,310
How dare you still go fight in the arena?

420
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,040
I took an antidote beforehand.

421
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,240
The wound only looks frightening,

422
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,970
but it's not actually serious.

423
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,460
I took the disaster meant for Mr. Wen,

424
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
but that was only a stopgap measure.

425
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,070
Until the root of the trouble is removed,

426
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,350
how can there
ever be a single day of peace?

427
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,640
Unfortunately, Yang and He

428
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,920
come from prestigious families.

429
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,580
Lady Rong values them highly,

430
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,920
and you can't
easily drive them away either, Miss Rong.

431
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,530
With this self-sacrifice strategy,

432
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,300
it would be easier to drive them out.

433
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
Were you so confident

434
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,030
that Grandmother would drive them out?

435
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
When you're choosing a husband,

436
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
you'll certainly need to
choose someone of

437
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,160
good character and true integrity.

438
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,690
Today in the hall, those two

439
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,590
showed their
ugly nature with false accusations.

440
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,750
What examiner in the world,

441
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,920
upon seeing such students,

442
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,470
wouldn't fail them both?

443
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,880
Aren't you afraid
Grandmother might get angry

444
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,140
and drive you away too?

445
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
You're banking on me to protect you,

446
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,550
right?

447
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,110
You are the most deceptive man

448
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,480
I have ever met.

449
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,040
Your truth is mixed with lies,
and your lies are mixed with truth.

450
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
There isn't
a single honest word from your mouth.

451
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,750
Perhaps even this injury

452
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,950
was part of your plan.

453
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,110
Why don't you stand up?

454
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,710
I...

455
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
It was a lie that my life was in danger,

456
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,760
but it was true that I sacrificed myself
to get the target.

457
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,720
You saw
the wound with your own eyes, Miss Rong.

458
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,850
How could it be fake?

459
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,670
I sacrificed myself
all for you, Miss Rong.

460
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,000
It's one thing for you not to thank me,

461
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,530
but how can you
bring yourself to blame me?

462
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,520
With those two nuisances gone,

463
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,120
no one will stand in your way.

464
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,480
Miss Rong, you'll be free

465
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,210
to choose a husband as you wish.

466
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,160
I understand.

467
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,530
Then I wish Miss Rong

468
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,380
to find a good match
and success in all things.

469
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,290
What should I say about you?

470
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,970
How can you still smile?

471
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,030
What being aloof and free?

472
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,780
I think you're just lazy and negligent.

473
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,250
Look at all of them,

474
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,310
using every trick they could think of

475
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,510
and make every effort to win her favour.

476
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,670
You're always so passive,

477
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,720
when will Bao

478
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,380
ever see your good qualities?

479
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,730
If I were truly
a good match for Miss Rong,

480
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,610
and even if I were just

481
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,050
a silent and motionless stone,

482
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,610
when she grows tired from walking,

483
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,680
she would still stop to lean against me.

484
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,810
If I were not for her,

485
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,030
and even if I were to

486
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,790
attend to her every need daily,

487
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,180
trying everything to please her,

488
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,200
it'd be like
pouring cold water on stone.

489
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,790
Even a thousand years of devotion

490
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,050
would still be in vain.

491
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,470
Go away, leave.
Your presence irritates me.

492
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,070
Take care, Lady Rong.

493
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,240
Lady Rong,

494
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,580
I think that Lu guy

495
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,210
isn't one to behave himself.

496
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,920
Since Bao likes him,

497
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,460
let's keep him and observe more for now.

498
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,470
I watched her grow up.

499
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,320
She's always been obedient and sensible.

500
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,760
She knows what matters.

501
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,480
If there's anyone to blame,

502
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,610
blame Bailou for not fighting for her.

503
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,500
I'd like to see

504
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,560
how long he can endure this.

505
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,980
Yes.

506
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,680
Miss Rong

507
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,030
understands your intentions best.

508
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,090
She definitely will not let you down.

509
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,670
I thought I could delay a while longer,

510
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,490
but that damn Lu has ruined everything.

511
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,800
Now I must act earlier.

512
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
I failed in my duty to guard,

513
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,060
please forgive me, Young Master!

514
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,560
My little Jifa, stand up.

515
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,200
Get up.

516
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,150
What are you afraid of?

517
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,850
That He Xingming is cunning and ruthless.

518
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,280
After suffering this setback,

519
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,680
he won't let it go easily.

520
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,180
Just keep a close eye on him for me.

521
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,040
Report to me instantly
if anything abnormal happens.

522
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,930
And that'll make up for your mistake.

523
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,480
Yes.

524
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,620
But... But Young Master,

525
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,110
Lady Rong

526
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,730
has already asked you to leave.

527
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,650
Are you really not going back?

528
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,930
Lady Rong hasn't given a final word yet.

529
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,060
There are still three days
until the Tea Ancestor Festival.

530
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,390
Who's the final winner is still a mystery.

531
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,750
What are you up to?

532
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,830
Miss, do you remember?

533
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,030
This is where we first met.

534
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,000
The night was deep and the dew was heavy.

535
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,510
Miss,

536
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,130
you should rest now.

537
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,440
Let's go.

538
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,720
Miss is having nightmares again?

539
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,160
Miss.

540
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,200
-You blind thing!
-Let go!

541
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,660
Watch where you‘re going!

542
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,640
Miss.

543
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,770
Don't be scared.

544
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,940
Mum is here.

545
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,070
Who's there? Breaking in at night!

546
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,470
You frightened our Miss.

547
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,600
Who are you?

548
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,610
I'm not finished questioning you.

549
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,610
-What are you running for?
-Go away!

550
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,270
Go! Hurry!

551
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,090
In the middle of the night,

552
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,200
Mr. Yang,

553
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,960
you're chasing after my little sister.

554
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,490
What exactly are you doing?

555
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,860
Miss Rong, please calm down.

556
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,000
That He guy

557
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,690
was acting suspiciously at night.

558
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,770
I was following him

559
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,070
and entered this garden.

560
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,880
I wanted to catch the intruder for you.

561
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,030
But who knew this guy

562
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,310
just vanished in the blink of an eye?

563
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,350
Miss Rong,

564
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,400
not even a "thank you'?

565
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,440
I was sincerely trying to help you.

566
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,240
Mr. Yang, please.

567
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,190
My respects to you, Young Miss.

568
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,270
Has anyone come by tonight?

569
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,440
We've been standing guard as ordered

570
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,240
and haven't seen any strangers.

571
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,800
Miss Rong,

572
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,170
we've searched around the tea forest

573
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,700
but found no trace of Mr. He.

574
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,550
Miss.

575
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,860
It must be Yang Dingchen,
bitter about being expelled.

576
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,840
So he's deliberately causing trouble

577
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,640
and trying to implicate others.

578
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,440
Whether it's true or false,

579
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,550
before the Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony,

580
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,300
anyone who dares
approach the Tea King Tree,

581
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,560
no matter who they are,

582
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,330
will be arrested and punished.

583
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:43,930
Yes.

584
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,290
No, there is still one more place.

585
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,780
Young Master.

586
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,630
It was the Rong family

587
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,630
who stole our Huqiu Tea's business.

588
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,070
I'm the one who took your business.

589
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,800
If you want revenge,
come after me, Rong Shanbao.

590
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,290
It has nothing to do with my Grandmother.

591
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,090
You lost fair and square.

592
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,510
Coming here to make trouble?

593
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,780
Even I feel embarrassed for you.

594
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,010
Rong Shanbao.

595
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,989
If this grievance can't be unraveled,

596
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,070
nor a bond forged through marriage,

597
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,480
then I'd rather be your lifelong enemy.

598
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,460
You forced me to do this.

599
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,610
Mr. He.

600
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,150
Well,

601
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,010
Mr. Lu can't sleep either at night,

602
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,000
so you're taking a moonlit stroll?

603
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,200
The tea trees in this garden thrive well

604
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,510
thanks entirely to
the Four-Eyed Sweetwater

605
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,310
ancient well in this old estate.

606
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,530
Especially this Dragon Eye well,

607
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,020
whose water
is crystal clear and inexhaustible,

608
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,280
and its sweetness is said to be
unmatched in the world.

609
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Even the most precious tea cultivars

610
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
transplanted from a thousand miles away

611
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,260
can take root
within seven days when irrigated with it.

612
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,940
I fear someone with ill intent

613
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,870
might come skulking
in the dead of night to do mischief.

614
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,610
If the Dragon Eye is ever damaged,

615
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,870
forget about the precious Tea King Tree,

616
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,490
but the entire
tea plantation would be ruined.

617
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,280
What are you hiding

618
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,140
in your sleeve?

619
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,890
Come closer and check it out.

620
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,760
Who's there?

621
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,850
Let me go!

622
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,440
You dare undermine
the root of the Rong family,

623
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,900
and you think
you can walk out of here intact?

624
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,430
Do you want to know what I did?

625
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,080
There're so many things in this world

626
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,960
that can make tea trees die of disease.

627
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,710
I guarantee the officials

628
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,370
won't be able to figure it out.

629
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:31,960
However,

630
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,200
I have an antidote myself.

631
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,150
Tell me your price.

632
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,480
I want

633
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,370
to share your bed.

634
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,510
Shut up!

635
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,010
Rong Shanbao, how about it?

636
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,300
Have you made up your mind?

637
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,000
You claim to
love the tea plantation above all else

638
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,480
and always put your family first.

639
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,770
What difference does it make
who you're with?

640
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,710
When it comes to
intelligence, strategy,

641
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,790
martial skills, and abilities,

642
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,050
I'm ten thousand times

643
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,800
better than your cousin.

644
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,570
And that Lu Fusheng,

645
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,110
who does he think he is?

646
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,630
Why he can,

647
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,930
but I can't?

648
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,780
How dare you humiliate me?

649
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,590
You'd better decide quickly,

650
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,960
or all the tea plants

651
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
will die.

652
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,130
Even if
you grew a thousand eyes and hands,

653
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,010
you couldn't save them in time.

654
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,770
Send word immediately.

655
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,840
Seal all the wells in the estate.

656
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,040
From tomorrow,
bring water from outside for irrigation.

657
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,320
So be it.

658
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,110
I'm the only one

659
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,130
who can make Miss Rong hate with

660
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,760
such piercing agony,

661
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,110
yet remain beyond your power to kill.

662
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,370
I could even say this is your unique,

663
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,430
perverse form of favor,

664
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,090
which is something
others could never achieve.

665
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,960
For that, I have gotten my worth's fill.

666
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,030
In my life,

667
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,370
I hate being threatened most of all.

668
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,510
Mr. He is very drunk tonight.

669
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,090
I'll leave him to you.

670
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,920
Help him sober up properly.

Sure, right away.

nor your own heart.

No wonder despite all your advantages,

you still failed completely.

before disaster struck.

Now it's pouring outside,

691
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,070
and he's still abandoned
in the tea plantation.

It's imperial tea?

699
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,590
It's more than just imperial tea.

Three days from now,

00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,000

This day is also the most

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,770
important day of our tea business.

705
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,000
If you had been half a step late tonight,

the hopes of thousands of tea farmers

How malicious
this man's intention is!

The He family has shown
good will repeatedly

and voluntarily sent him for selection.

711
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,520

to take this opportunity

00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,480
to end the feud and reconcile.

He Xingming harbored evil intentions?

When the Tea King Tree was in trouble,

723
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,710
Miss Rong could sense it
before anyone else,

724

into good fortune in times of crisis.

the Tea King Tree,

742
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,100
no matter who they are,

743
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,960
will be arrested and punished.

744
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,790
Our Rong family

745
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,550
has planted

746
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,510
a Tea King Tree that's over 100 years old.

747
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,280
In today's tea industry,

748
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,920
many places still preserve

749
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,550
ancestral Tea King Trees.

750
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,190
For example, in Zhenyuan, Pu'er,

751
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,230
there's a 2,700-year-old

752
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,440
wild Tea King Tree.

753
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,960
In West Lake's Longjing Village,

754
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,240
there're 18 Tea King Trees
designated by Emperor Qianlong.

755
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,210
And the Mother Tree Da Hongpao
in Wuyi Mountain, and so on.

756
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,710
Tea farmers in some regions

757
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,030
even hold annual ceremonies

758
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,520
during specific seasons
or before and after tea picking

759
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,960
in front of these Tea King Trees

760
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,120
to worship and pray for blessings.

761
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,070
They pray for abundant tea harvests

762
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,630
and smooth picking processes.

763
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,190
For instance, tea farmers in Wuyi Mountain

764
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,710
hold a mountain-calling ceremony

765
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,570
every year during
the Awakening of Insects season.

766
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,830
The tea is sprouting!

767
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,920
Before Grain Rain,
when it's time to pick tea,

768
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,450
they shout together again:

769
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,670
Time to pick tea!

770
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:17,710
This set of rituals

771
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,620
passed down from the Five Dynasties
and Ten Kingdoms period

772
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,070
is the mountain-opening tea ceremony,

773
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:22,750
which has been preserved until today.

774
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,920
As for the Zhenyuan area in Pu'er

775
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,000
with its 2,700-year-old Tea King Tree,

776
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,710
generations of local tea farmers
and merchants

777
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,800
also offer incense and wine to it.

778
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,710
They sing blessings for it

779
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,590
with utmost devotion.
