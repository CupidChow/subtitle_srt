00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,979
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,700
What a pity.

4
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,030
If only we could have died

5
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
together.

6
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,630
Miss Rong!

7
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,680
Miss Rong!

8
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,160
Hurry!

9
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,330
Go check on him!

10
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,910
My Lord.

11
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,840
The suspect is already dead.

12
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,190
Miss Rong, please forgive the fright.

13
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,710
Guards!

14
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,240
Take his body back
to the Government Office.

15
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,710
Yes.

16
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,250
Miss Rong, please forgive me

17
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,510
for arriving too late.

18
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,430
It's all because Jun Dai
is so inexperienced.

19
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,230
He panicked like a headless fly.

20
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,579
If I hadn't stopped him to ask questions,

21
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,000
who knows

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,860
where he would have gone for help.

23
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,520
Mr. Lu.

24
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,590
I know you pride yourself on being capable

25
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,100
and making decisions on your own.

26
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,230
But this matter is extremely serious.

27
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,590
You knew He Xingming

28
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,400
was suspected of murder.

29
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,030
Why didn't you report it earlier?

30
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,710
If Miss Rong had been harmed,

31
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,980
could you have borne the responsibility?

32
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,950
I'm fine.

33
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,810
There's no need to make a fuss.

34
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
Miss Rong, you look pale.

35
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,250
We should call for a doctor.

36
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,500
Then what are you waiting for?

37
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,920
Okay.

38
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,800
Mr. Lang, you've just arrived here

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,730
yet you've already investigated

40
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,920
the case in person and brought justice.

41
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,390
Having a magistrate like you

42
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,240
is a blessing to the people of Linji.

43
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,210
You flatter me.

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,010
Fortunately, Miss Rong was prepared

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,830
and the assailant failed.

46
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,120
Since the culprit has been caught,

47
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,950
I'll need Miss Rong

48
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,950
to testify later,

49
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,630
so we can close the case.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
I have official matters to attend to,

51
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,430
so I can't stay long today.

52
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,630
I shall take my leave.

53
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,630
Of course.

54
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,000
After I've taken care of things at home,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,860
I'll come to the Government Office
to give my statement.

56
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,130
Xiu Qiong, please see Mr. Lang out for me.

57
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,060
Mr. Lang, this way please.

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,900
Hua and Hesi have been in jail.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,460
How did you get their confession?

60
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,870
Jun Dai.

61
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,430
Miss Rong.

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
The Government Office arrested the people

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,890
from Xinfang Pavilion.

64
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,270
I followed Mr. Lu's orders

65
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,830
to paid 20 taels of silver as bail.

66
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,630
Hua did the same, trying to escape,

67
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,890
which led Hesi to kill.

68
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,320
That's how the truth came to light.

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,080
In my haste to gain merit,

70
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,930
I put you in danger, Miss Rong.

71
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,270
Please forgive me.

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,940
This isn't your fault.

73
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,050
You did well.

74
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,159
Go collect your reward.

75
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,750
Thank you, Miss Rong.

76
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,830
Go.

77
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,830
Is there really a secret passage

78
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,680
in your room?

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,360
Is there really treasure
in that secret chamber?

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,090
And that mechanism just now...

81
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,230
What's wrong?

82
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,160
Quick, sit down.

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,390
You look so pale.

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,130
And your hands are cold.

85
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
I'll get the doctor to check you.

86
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,140
Why don't you think more about yourself?

87
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,430
You've been constantly appearing

88
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,890
in front of Lang Zhusheng.

89
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
He may not be able to kill you openly,

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,520
but behind the scenes,
he could strike again.

91
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,270
Lu Jianglai, the Inspector General,

92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,400
died in a shipwreck.

93
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,950
Everyone knows that.

94
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,920
Now I'm

95

neither an official nor do I have

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,310
any attendants to bear witness.

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,390
Impersonating an imperial envoy
is a capital crime.

98
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,000
They're just waiting for

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,460
me to walk into their trap.

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,190
Right now,

101
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm counting entirely
on you to keep me safe.

102
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,570

[Hualin Courtyard]

Young Master.

105
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,430
The doctor said

106
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,020
Miss Rong's only been frightened

107
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,120
and is fine.

108
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,120
Why are you still lingering here?

109
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
If you're so worried,

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,470
just take your bedding

111
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,530
and sleep in there.

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,560
Spare me, Young Master.

113
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I won't dare speak out of turn again.

114
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,720
Before dying,

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,060
He Xingming said something strange.

116
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
He said that before the killing,

117
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,409
Yang Dingchen had a sudden attack,

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,190
and was on the verge of death.

119
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,360
He is full of tricks.

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,240
It must be his excuse
to escape punishment.

121
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,170
I don't think so.

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,909
Young Master, do you mean that

123
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,920
it was Miss Rong?

124
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,120
One must think things through.

125
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,450
If Miss Rong intended to kill,

126
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,070
why would she let him die in Qilan Garden?

127
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,600
Then,

128
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,710
I'll go and see

129
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,390
whether Mr. Yang has any chronic ailments.

130
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,830
It seems something has been missed.

131
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,100
But what exactly is it?

132
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,000
Fusheng.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000

What's wrong?

139
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,270
Jun Dai.

140
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,360
Has Lady Yunwan's funeral

141
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,000
been handled entirely

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
by Miss Rong herself?

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,330
Yes, indeed.

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,360
Miss Rong loved Lady Yunwan the most.

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
She personally took care
of all the funeral matters

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,840
and wouldn't let anyone else handle it.

147
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,550
She also said the Rong family

148
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,790
had no place for Lady Yunwan,

149
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,270
so she would bury her in person
on Tea Mountain.

150
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,790
Right?

151
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,350
What's wrong?

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,150
Where are you going, Young Master?

153
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,740
Young Master!

154
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,070
Young Master, where are you going so late?

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,080
Come here.

158
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Young Master.

159
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,120
This... this is Lady Yunwan's grave.

160
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,870
If Miss Rong finds out,

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm afraid I'll be

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,750
skinned alive.

163
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,090
I don't dare.

164
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,560
I really don't dare!

165
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,520
Young Master.

166
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,120
I'm sticking with you

167
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,510
and won't change my mind.

168
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,830
If Miss Rong holds us to account,

169
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,690
I'm counting on you to protect me.

170
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,040
Let's go.

171
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,730
Every time I close my eyes,

172
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,740
I see you smiling at me.

173
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,480
I reach out, wanting to pinch your cheek,

174
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,680
but then you're gone.

175
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,360
I thought

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
you must be afraid

177
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
here alone,

178
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,390
wanting to talk to me.

179
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,370
So I came through the night.

180
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
I buried you behind Tea Mountain

181
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,320
only because this is where

182
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I often come to.

183
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,020
From now on,

184
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,660
I'll come to keep you company every day.

185
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,180
Then you won't be afraid anymore.

186
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,240
Wait.

188
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,670
Didn't you say

189
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,120
Lady Yunwan's death was suspicious

190
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,850
and you wanted to investigate?

191
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,260
Never mind.

192
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,990
Perhaps I was overthinking.

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,630
Let's go.

194
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,700
Young Master, wait for me.

195
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,790
Mr. Bai, I'm sorry for your trouble.

196
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,130
You must be tired, Mr. Bai.

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,520
Please have some tea.

198
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,360
Lady Yunshu, you set this trap

199
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,730
without giving me any warning.

200
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,920
I don't mind being imprisoned.

201
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,030
But my heart

202
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,260
feels so cold.

203
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,840
I...

204
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,040
Cold?

205
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,540
Where?

206
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,140
Let me warm it for you.

207
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,940
Don't be angry, Mr. Bai.

208
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,960
If you get sick from anger,
no one can take your place.

209
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,220
Where else could I find

210
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,320
someone who cares for me

211
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,250
as much as you do?

212
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,430
You... tell me first.

213
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,260
When did you discover
He Xingming's treachery?

214
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
It wasn't difficult.

215
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,670
Although I've always

216
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,360
tried to please Yunxi,

217
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,590
I was born to a servant after all.

218
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,620
I've never earned Grandmother's favor.

219
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,500
Even my maid Daisy

220
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,380
often faces cold stares outside.

221
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,320
That day she was

222
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,590
deliberately led to the back door.

223
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,440
Several maids from
the second branch were there,

224
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,670
chatting and teasing her,

225
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,200
even snatching her hairpin.

226
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,920
That's when I grew suspicious.

227
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,450
Daisy is naturally clumsy.

228
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,600
The letter I sent you

229
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,390
was switched by someone

230
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,920
and she didn't even notice.

231
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,630
So I hurried to Tea Mountain

232
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,580
and intercepted Shanbao's carriage
on the way.

233
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,250
Shanbao.

234
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,510
I have something urgent to tell you.

235
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,440
Get in.

236
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,390
Shanbao only said she understood

237
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,430
and told me to go back,
pretending not to notice.

238
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,510
She'll handle the rest.

239
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,360
After thinking it through,

240
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
I realized

241
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
you'd have to suffer a little

242
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,000
to make this scene convincing.

243
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
You suffered for three days

244
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,180
but offered a favor to Shanbao.

245
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,220
Shanbao never accepts favors.

246
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,540
I suspect

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,800
the recommendation letter for
your appointment to the capital

248
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,590
is already on your desk.

249
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,810
Once you take it to the capital,

250
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,960
your career

251
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,320
will be much smoother.

252
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
The one who pledged loyalty

253
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,850
to Miss Rong was you.

254
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,400
But this can't be right.

255
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,240
Miss Rong is so perceptive,

256
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
how could she simply

257
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,320
let her own sister be harmed?

258
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm not greedy.

259
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,780
Whatever Shanbao doesn't want me to know,

260
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,910
I simply won't know.

261
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,330
Why are you pinching me again?

262
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,150
See if you dare do that next time.

263
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,000
I dare.

264
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,880
Godmother.

265
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,140
Shanbao!

266
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,570
Miss Rong, what you did

267
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,740
was too risky.

268
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,200
If anything had happened to Lady Yunwan,

269
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
I could never have atoned for it.

270
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,270
Don't worry, Ms. Liang.

271
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,830
I've been swimming

272
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,200
in the river since I was four.

273
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,790
A simple water jar

274
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,390
couldn't possibly drown me.

275
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,280
Everyone says I'm foolish,

276
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,680
but he's the real idiot.

277
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,070
But he is

278
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,880
a vicious madman.

279
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,610
What if he draws his knife?

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,380
Don't worry about it, Madam.

281
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,210
We had already positioned our men

282
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,750
inside and outside the East Corner Gate.

283
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,810
Lady Yunwan wouldn't have been hurt.

284
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,420
No matter how many guards,

285
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,240
we can't prevent all accidents.

286
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,830
However, you and Wanwan

287
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,220
can no longer stay in the Rong family.

288
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,720
Since He Xingming

289
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,710
conspired with Rong Yunxi,

290
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,770
I went along

291
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,890
and used a ruse

292
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,190
to keep you

293
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,670
away from the Rong family.

294
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,730
Let's go.

295
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,660
With Ms. Liang and Shanbao,

296
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,750
I'm the happiest

297
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,880
person in the world.

298
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,740
I don't care about the Rong family at all.

299
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,680
Of course it's better
to leave the Rong family.

300
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,790
But I'm afraid that

301
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,360
the Yang family won't give up.

302
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,820
They've already taken action.

303
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,230
[Rong Mansion]

304
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,000
This is?

305
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,200
Lady Rong.

306
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,510
Thanks to Shanbao's kindness

307
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,880
in agreeing to our families'
marriage alliance.

308
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
They were said to be a perfect match.

309
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,750
Yet my nephew was unfortunate.

310
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,530
The match has suddenly come to nothing,

311
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,420
leaving endless regrets.

312
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,640
Our Yang family has been
in business for generations.

313
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,790
Though we're not as prestigious
as official families,

314
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,790
in Linji,

315
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,200
we are also respectable

316
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,730
and well-mannered people.

317
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,400
We wouldn't dare

318
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
disappoint your good intentions
for marriage.

319
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,540
So we've prepared these gifts

320
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,240
to honor the alliance
and uphold our promise.

321
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,920
Honor the alliance?

322
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,210
Yitang, come
pay your respects to Lady Rong.

323
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm Yang Yitang.

324
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,860
Greetings, Lady Rong.

325
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,420
Lady Rong, I've already

326
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,990
informed you about Yitang.

327
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,440
He surpasses his elder brother

328
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,650
in both scholarship and business.

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,720
But his pride has kept him

330
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,530
from accepting the marriage.

331
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,550
Today I've brought him
for your approval, Lady Rong.

332
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,280
If you agree,

333
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,230
he'll stand in for his brother

334
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,920
and complete the union.

335
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,270
It is admirable that the Yang family

336
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,000
honors its word so faithfully,

337
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,080
even willing to offer another son
for this marriage.

338
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,550
But my eldest granddaughter

339
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,960
has her own mind.

340
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,890
I fear she may harbor reservations,

341
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,600
so I can't agree at once.

342
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,450
How about this?

343
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,590
Let Yitang stay
at Xinfang Pavilion for now.

344
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,350
Let the two meet first,

345
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,050
then we'll see if they're compatible.

346
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,720
It is only right that
a younger brother succeed his elder

347
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,780
in family affairs,

348
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,680
and just as fitting that he take his place

349
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,640
in marriage.

350
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,790
This was made possible
entirely by the your approval.

351
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,440
Thanks for your great kindness,

352
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,640
Lady Rong.

353
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,030
Father.

354
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,370
You know I'm unwilling to do this.

355
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,350
No matter how beautiful Rong Shanbao is,

356
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,720
or how rich the Rong family may be,

357
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
I won't live under another's roof,

358
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
spending my life at a woman's mercy.

359
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,160
Not to mention that for this marriage,

360
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,510
my skilled brother

361
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,680
paid with his life.

362
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Can you really push me

363
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,120
into the same misery?

364
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,590
Sit down.

365
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,110
Sit.

366
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,000
Stay here.

367
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,480
I know

368
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,460
you appear gentle on the surface

369
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,480
but are proud and aloof at heart.

370
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,110
That's why I entrusted
this marriage matter

371
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,440
to your second brother.

372
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,590
Today has proven I was right.

373
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,020
Who do you think you are,

374
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,920
that you can treat the Rong family
however you like?

375
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,250
If your elder brother had not
already been married,

376
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,940
I would never have sent you.

377
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,670
To be frank with you,

378
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,710
the Rong ancestors were from
the Kingdom of Women.

379
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,200
They later settled here,

380
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,600
and married into prominent
local clans for generations,

381
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,270
changing their ways over time.

382
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,400
That's how the Rong family was formed.

383
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,630
I've heard these women

384
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,760
all possessed great treasures.

385
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,840
Let alone sending just you,

386
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,920
I would gladly

387
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,790
send all your brothers to be chosen,

388
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,750
if only they could all stay.

389
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,790
Father, such words

390
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,400
might fool others, but not me.

391
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
The story is from

392
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,110
hundreds of years ago.

393
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,400
The Rong family probably

394
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,110
just made it up to show off.

395
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,110
Do you know that Dingchen

396
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,200
once secretly sent a trusted aide
back to our Yang family

397
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,550
to handle a matter?

398
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,920
He had the aide find Madam Liu,

399
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,550
who tends the rear garden,

400
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
to identify a string

401
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,440
of Bodhi prayer beads.

402
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,350
Madam Liu's family

403
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,510
originally served as attendants

404
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,440
to your aunt when she married
into the Wei family.

405
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
They returned to the Yang family
after the incident.

406
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,370
As for this string of prayer beads,

407
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,270
it was a keepsake

408
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,530
your grandmother left for her daughter.

409
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,750
Inscribed with sutras,

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
one bead

411
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,070
bears a tiny character 'Lan'.

412
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,510
That was your aunt's given name.

413
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,590
It's one of a kind.

414
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
Father, is this true?

415
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,980
Listen carefully.

416
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,460
I asked you to stay at the Rong family

417
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
not just for the marriage alliance.

418
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,200
More importantly, you need to find

419
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,960
the whereabouts of the owner
of this string of Bodhi beads.

420
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,590
This concerns the very survival

421
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,440
of our Yang family.

422
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,790
It must not be taken lightly.

423
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,520
You must be extremely cautious.

424
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,830
Father.

425
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,820
My aunt, she...

426
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,680
Your aunt

427
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,710
was murdered by Wei Kejian long ago.

428
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,600
You must find that impostor quickly.

429
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,110
She must not

430
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,840
fall into anyone else's hands.

431
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,680
If necessary...

432
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,620
I understand.

433
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,400
Send these tea leaves

434
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,270
in my room.

435
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,160
Yes.

436
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,310
Tea appreciation is no simple matter.

437
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,920
Outsiders have to examine leaves,

438
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
color, and aroma.

439
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,230
But Miss Rong can tell

440
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,750
its origin in a glance.

441
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,440
She can even describe

442
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,550
the local climate

443
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,350
and rainfall.

444
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,550
Since Miss Rong is willing to teach you,

445
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,240
Young Master,

446
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,750
you should learn diligently.

447
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,550
I know.

448
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,470
I don't need your advice.

449
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,640
You know it well enough.

450
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,970
I've spoken out of turn.

451
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,220
These are premium teas. Be careful.

452
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,160
Put them there.

453
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,070
Let me.

454
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,860
I don't care about

455
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,540
your past or where you came from.

456
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,890
As long as you never deceive me,

457
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,910
lie to me, or hide things from me,

458
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,970
that's enough.

459
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,640
Obviously, Miss Rong

460
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,430
can't be easily tricked.

461
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,150
Do you really want to try the impossible?

462
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,260
Shanbao's

463
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,960
tea appraisal skills
surpass even the masters.

464
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,550
Even Old Madam Rong

465
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,950
can't stop praising her.

466
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,570
But this skill is never
taught to outsiders.

467
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,400
I wonder what tricks he used

468
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,440
that now she's willing to teach him.

469
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,550
When you entered the household,

470
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
Miss Rong treated you

471
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,810
with special favor too.

472
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,580
In this world, love and hate

473
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,120
never come without reason.

474
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,220
Mr. Lu must have his merits

475
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,480
that made Miss Rong change her mind

476
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,280
and her heart.

477
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Reflect on yourself rather than

478
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
holding grudges.

479
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,440
Try to see things
from others' perspective,

480
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
and you'll have fewer restless nights

481
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,900
torn by desire and longing.

482
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm not as magnanimous as you.

483
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,110
He took away the one I love,

484
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,570
and you want me
to admire and understand him?

485
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,380
That's truly a dream.

486
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,830
It's he who suffers from

487
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,360
his own jealousy and greed.

488
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,750
Why bother persuading him, Young Master?

489
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm not persuading him,

490
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,810
I'm persuading myself.

491
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,070
Be careful, slow down.

492
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,040
Watch your step.

493
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
Wipe this area clean.

494
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,250
He reminds me of that dead man.

495
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,530
If I look any longer,

496
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,550
I'll have nightmares tonight.

497
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,920
Take it slow.

498
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,420
Mr. Wen, Mr. Yan.

499
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
I've been so busy here

500
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,550
that I haven't paid you a visit yet.

501
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,070
Please forgive me.

502
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,830
The old must leave for the new to come.

503
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,070
As they say, money moves people's hearts.

504
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,070
It is indeed true.

505
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,030
Mr. Yan.

506
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,880
I heard that Mr. Lu

507
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
personally captured the murderer.

508
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,750
Is that true?

509
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,720
Yes.

510
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,310
Mr. Lu obtained

511
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,040
confessions from Hesi and Hua.

512
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,110
He only made the arrest
after getting solid evidence.

513
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,640
Luckily, he arrived in time

514
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,480
and saved Miss Rong from danger.

515
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,960
In that case,

516
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,000
Mr. Lu

517
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,510
not only saved Miss Rong,

518
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,590
but also avenged my cousin.

519
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,830
He is a great benefactor
to our Yang family.

520
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,640
I must personally visit him
to express my gratitude.

521
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,750
To be honest with you,

522
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,000
I even went to the Government Office
three times

523
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,160
and tried every means,

524
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,010
but I couldn't dig up a single clue.

525
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,830
Mr. Lu is indeed shrewd and capable,

526
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,370
well-versed in all matters.

527
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,630
No wonder he's gained Miss Rong's favor.

528
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,870
Jie You.

529
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,000
Go fetch my

530
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,330
Fang Lanting inkstone.

531
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,790
I'll need it shortly

532
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,850
to pay my respects to our benefactor.

533
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,740
Young Master, it's not in the box.

534
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,030
Don't mess up the books.

535
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,160
I'll find it myself.

536
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,960
Excuse me.

537
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,860
I'll take my leave.

538
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Please, go ahead.

539
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,190
He just reminded me.

540
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,930
Magistrate Lang made arrests,

541
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,450
filling the place with people.

542
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,520
How did he get the upper hand?

543
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,250
Didn't I tell you earlier?

544
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,960
The moment Lord Lang got the confession,

545
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,680
he immediately sent someone

546
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,160
to the Rong family with the news.

547
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,000
He just

548
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,310
ran into the messenger.

549
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,310
It was just a coincidence.

550
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,270
Neither you nor I happened
to be in the right place,

551
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,600
yet he just happened to?

552
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,680
Shanbao keeps defending him.

553
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,810
Are you seriously buying his lies too?

554
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,720
If he knew what was going on

555
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,250
in the prison ahead of time,

556
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,790
he must be colluding with someone
in the Government Office.

557
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,480
Or worse,

558
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,590
he could be a spy for the government.

559
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,990
If he's a government spy,

560
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,470
then why would he
infiltrate the Rong family?

561
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,600
And why has he helped you so many times?

562
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,070
After saving people multiple times,

563
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,070
to be met with such suspicion,

564
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,700
even I would feel disheartened.

565
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,160
Mr. Wen, everyone feels jealous sometimes,

566
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,550
but don't let it make you lose yourself.

567
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,230
What you're saying is absurd.

568
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,840
Don't mention it again.

569
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,880
Mr. Yan is a good person,

570
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,420
so he sees goodness in everyone.

571
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,460
But little does he know

572
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,720
that people in this household
hide their true intentions.

573
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,790
Lu Fusheng is strange.

574
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,200
If Shanbao won't investigate,

575
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,260
I'll get to the bottom of this myself.

576
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,790
Send a letter to Lord Lang.

577
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,400
Immediately. Off you go.

578
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,960
Yes.

579
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,200
Quick! Have someone follow him.

580
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,720
Yes.

581
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,110
Please don't blame him, Young Master.

582
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,790
Mr. Wen

583
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,310
might be feeling a bit jealous,

584
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,240
but he treats Miss Rong

585
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,700
with complete sincerity.

586
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,590
What he said makes sense.

587
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,310
Ever since that Mr. Lu
came to the Rong family,

588
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,170
there have been two murder cases.

589
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,550
You mean no harm, Young Master,

590
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,950
but you must be cautious.

591
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,660
Try to find a chance
to talk to Miss Rong about it.

592
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,590
Is that so?

593
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,400
Indeed.

594
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,790
You helped her complete

595
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,160
the tea manual that had been
lost for a century.

596
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,070
And you memorized

597
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,720
all those tea-making recipes

598
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,920
from Mount Mengding.

599
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,350
Every time, you had
Miss Xiu Qiong deliver them.

600
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,160
All the good deeds you do in secret

601
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,940
end up letting others take the credit.

602
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,670
Everyone thinks you're a fool.

603
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,120
You make a good point.

604
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,030
Some things I can let go if I don't know.

605
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,960
But now that I do,

606
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,960
how can I just stand by and do nothing?

607
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,830
You're wise, Young Master.

608
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,030
You should go to Miss Rong

609
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,270
and report him thoroughly.

610
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,680
I need to remind Mr. Lu.

611
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,710
Young Master.

612
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,510
Oh no.

613
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,480
It's too late.

614
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,260
This is tea made
by the mountain villagers.

615
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,980
Take a look.

616
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,210
How does it differ from
our tea plantation's?

617
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,920
The mountain tea leaves
are somewhat scorched.

618
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,650
And the aroma is also inferior.

619
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,960
It's clearly the same tea variety.

620
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,440
Normally, it's nourished
by the mountain dew,

621
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,830
and the villagers have been
making tea for generations.

622
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,000
But they often use iron woks

623
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
and high heat to roast it,

624
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,960
which makes it hard
to control the temperature.

625
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,720
They also dump it into bamboo baskets

626
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,000
while it's still hot.

627
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,720
Even if the leaves are tender and fresh,

628
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,250
they can't produce
the top grade tea this way.

629
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,890
However, the villagers are carefree

630
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,270
and disregard rules.

631
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,010
Even a small mistake

632
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,000
can ruin an entire batch of tea.

633
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,200
This is also the difficulty
in starting a new tea plantation.

634
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,160
These few batches are also from

635
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,510
well-known tea plantations in Linji City.

636
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,440
See if you can tell the difference.

637
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,070
Go in.

638
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,160
Shanbao, you have guided him carefully,

639
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,640
but do you know
he has harbored ill intentions

640
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,770
and had other plans?

641
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,350
Mr. Wen,

642
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,920
who's being scolded?

643
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,110
You are.

644
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,680
Thank you for

645
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,030
all your help in the past.

646
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,960
But for the sake of
Shanbao and the Rong family,

647
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,440
there are things I must ask you,

648
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,500
and I hope you'll answer truthfully.

649
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,310
Today you ordered him

650
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,550
to sneak out of the household,

651
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,350
avoiding the patrols along the way.

652
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,680
What were you planning?

653
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,160
The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching.

654
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,750
I sent him to deliver festival gifts

655
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,640
to Mr. Xu, Mr. Liu

656
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
and the others at the tea plantation.

657
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,830
What's wrong with that?

658
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,510
That's right.

659
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,480
I came to deliver the festival gifts,

660
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,610
along with a letter.

661
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,720
It's right here.

662
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,930
Miss Rong, please take a look.

663
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,640
My Lady.

664
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,550
It's just a few words

665
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,440
expressing my greetings.

666
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,670
You're here only for this?

667
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,710
The Rong family has always
treated tea masters well.

668
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,110
The festival gifts have already been sent.

669
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,480
So why trouble yourself, Mr. Lu?

670
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,440
Miss Rong respects talented people

671
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
and pays close attention to detail.

672
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,070
She often gives
the tea masters generous gifts

673
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,280
like jewelry and fine clothes.

674
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,110
Everyone in Linji knows about it.

675
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,110
But the Rong family's generosity
to tea masters

676
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,880
is simply a host
showing courtesy to guests.

677
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,630
My festival gift, however,

678
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,110
is meant to express

679
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,440
my personal gratitude.

680
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,280
During my previous visits
to the tea plantation,

681
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,920
these masters shared all their knowledge

682
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,030
without holding anything back.

683
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,510
My gift is both a festival gift

684
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,510
and a token of my gratitude.

685
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,440
How could it be sent together
with the Rong family's?

686
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,070
Is that so?

687
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,400
Open it.

688
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,190
Mr. Wen, I've answered

689
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,320
all your questions honestly,

690
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,650
without hiding a thing.

691
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,030
This is the festival gift
I intend to give,

692
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,070
how dare you ruin it like this?

693
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,880
Why are you so anxious?

694
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,920
It contains nothing but some cakes.

695
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,680
I can simply compensate you if needed.

696
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,550
I'm just worried

697
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,920
there might be something inside

698
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,480
that you

699
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,150
wouldn't want anyone to see.

700
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,650
Even a clay figure has its dignity.

701
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,710
I've yielded again and again,

702
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,030
yet you refuse to let it go.

703
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,230
We are both guests at the Rong Mansion.

704
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,910
How can you just search as you please?

705
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,850
Ruining the festival gift
is a small matter,

706
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,110
but damaging my reputation is serious.

707
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,570
If this spreads tomorrow,

708
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,630
will people gossip that you,

709
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,110
Mr. Wen, repay kindness with betrayal,

710
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,170
or will they suspect that I'm a thief?

711
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,960
Mr. Wen, I suggest you reconsider.

712
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,640
What if I insist on searching?

713
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Do you trust me or not?

714
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,240
Shanbao.

715
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,670
We've grown up together

716
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,320
without any suspicion between us.

717
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,180
He's an outsider

718
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,670
with an unknown background.

719
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,800
You should trust me.

720
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,510
Wen.

721
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,400
Stop it.

722
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,640
You've been completely blinded by him.

723
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,030
This is absolutely unacceptable!

724
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,710
Wen.

725
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,790
Give it to me!

726
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,540
How dare you!

727
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,190
My Lady.

728
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,190
Is there anything else you want to say?

729
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,960
Lu Fusheng.

730
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,640
Who exactly are you?

731
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,150
Why did you deliberately
get close to Shanbao?

732
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,550
When did you bribe the servant?

733
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,640
And where was that
wax-sealed letter headed?

734
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,200
Shanbao kindly saved you,

735
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,040
only to find you're a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

736
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,570
You witnessed all of this.

737
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,980
Shanbao, do you believe me now?

738
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,280
I saw it.

739
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,710
All of you, out.

740
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,550
You should be more careful from now on.

741
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,810
You're not questioning me?

742
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,000
I want to know,

743
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,530
but I'd rather hear it from you.

744
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,510
I sent it to my mentor,

745
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,110
Minister Xu, in the capital.

746
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,280
The officials in Linji are all in cahoots,

747
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,590
forming factions for personal gain.

748
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,400
I can't tell who's friend or foe.

749
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,530
So I can't show myself yet.

750
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,280
I have to ask him

751
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,760
to come to Linji personally,

752
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,170
only then can he verify my identity

753
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,300
and give me justice.

754
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,800
But

755
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,660
this matter is confidential.

756
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,230
I'd rather let others misunderstand me

757
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,510
than reveal the truth.

758
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,550
Sorry for putting you
in a difficult position.

759
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,230
Enough.

760
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,600
I said I believe you,

761
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,880
so I don't need to check.

762
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,730
Now that the secret letter

763
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,930
has been discovered,

764
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,720
I fear I'm under surveillance.

765
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,850
I'll need you, My Lady,

766
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,280
to carry a message for me.

767
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,120
I understand.

768
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,710
You're staying at Xinfang Pavilion,

769
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,190
and my frequent visits
have indeed drawn attention.

770
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,760
You'd be better off moving

771
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,220
to Hualin Courtyard soon.

772
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,840
My Lady, are you really
not going to check?

773
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,760
I won't.

774
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,400
Even if I had ten lives,

775
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,280
I'd still be scared to death today.

776
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,400
Alright, alright.

777
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,590
You're a grown man.

778
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,030
Why are you crying like this?

779
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,960
Wipe your tears.

780
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,000
Mr. Yan.

781
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,320
My place is a bit messy.
Excuse the appearance.

782
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,070
Jun Dai, we have a guest here.

783
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,400
Go prepare some tea now.

784
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,110
Mr. Yan, please have a seat.

785
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,040
I wouldn't dare.

786
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,070
Mr. Wen has harbored resentment

787
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,200
and caused trouble.

788
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,050
I failed to stop him is my fault.

789
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,030
If I had warned you in time,

790
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,710
you could have avoided this trouble.

791
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,880
I came too late,

792
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,080
causing you to be wrongfully accused.

793
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,490
These are...

794
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,030
You've misunderstood, Mr. Yan.

795
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,360
There were guests from the Yang family

796
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,560
at Xinfang Pavilion.

797
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,480
And moving ledgers
back and forth is inconvenient,

798
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,940
so I'll temporarily stay in
the side room of Hualin Courtyard.

799
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,110
Mr. Yan.

800
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,230
Miss Rong trusts and values you

801
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,110
far more than anyone else.

802
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,920
How could a few words

803
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,720
of provocation change her mind?

804
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,660
I'm being meddlesome.

805
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,550
No.

806
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,460
Mr. Yan, you are honorable and upright.

807
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,860
You are a true gentleman.

808
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,470
With anyone else,

809
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,760
it would've been lucky enough
not to be kicked while down.

810
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,800
Everyone fears losing their own advantage.

811
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,030
Who else would go
out of their way to help a rival?

812
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,800
If there were more

813
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
like you, Mr. Yan,

814
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,570
the world would see far fewer disputes.

815
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,190
Please don't mock me, Mr. Lu.

816
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,210
I came to the Rong family
at my mother's request,

817
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,070
originally hoping to forge a lasting union

818
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,700
between our two families.

819
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,150
Upon meeting Miss Rong,

820
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,530
with her beauty and talent

821
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,070
that shines so brightly,

822
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,950
how could anyone not admire her?

823
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,280
Unfortunately, her heart
belongs to you.

824
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
I can't force her.

825
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,210
I cannot force what isn't meant to be,

826
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,890
so I'll let go of this infatuation.

827
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,400
After Lady Rong's birthday,

828
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,030
I'll be leaving.

829
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,460
However, I have a few words for you.

830
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,510
Being the Rong family's eldest
grandson-in-law isn't easy.

831
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,230
If you wish to marry Miss Rong

832
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,360
and be united like a pair of phoenixes,

833
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,230
Mr. Wen's difficulties

834
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,560
are just the beginning.

835
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,660
There will be countless hardships ahead.

836
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,050
Lady Rong's approval
will be even harder to obtain.

837
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,450
You must be very careful.

838
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,650
I appreciate your thoughtfulness, Mr. Yan.

839
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,490
I will hold it close to my heart.

840
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,410
[Hualin Courtyard]

841
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,360
The wax-sealed letter
incident is over now.

842
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,510
It's just a small matter.

843
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,230
Miss Rong wouldn't

844
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,480
kick you out for that, would she?

845
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,680
Why are you so afraid?

846
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,190
Young Master, you're being too bold.

847
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,920
What if Miss Rong

848
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,120
had believed Mr. Wen?

849
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,290
Then all our efforts would be in vain.

850
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:55,960
Move.

851
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,090
What...

852
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,160
What are you doing?

853
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,360
We're moving these things
to Miss Rong's room.
