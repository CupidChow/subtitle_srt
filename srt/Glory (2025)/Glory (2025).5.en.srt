[Glory]

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,759
Let's go.

4
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,070
Since he's gone to Chongxi Hall,

5
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,000
we should leave.

6
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,759
Let's go.

7
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,200
So it's that Yan family.

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Which Yan family?

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,590
The Yan family was also

10
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,039
a prestigious clan in Linji.

11
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,200
But for some reason,

12
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,479
they suddenly moved

13
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,070
to Shuzhong over a decade ago.

14
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,759
I didn't expect

15
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,479
they would send someone here too.

16
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,590
This is terrible.

17
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,510
The Rong and Yan families

18
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,400
have been intermarrying for centuries.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,790
This one is a formidable rival.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,079
It seems you can't avoid

21
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,740
this kind of person anywhere.

22
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,460
What bad luck.

23
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,410
What's wrong?

24
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,150
Even with the cover of medicinal
and sandalwood incense,

25
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,079
that scent of blood still lingers.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,000
I caught a hint of it during our earlier

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060
encounter as well.

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
After all the effort
you went through to find it,

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,810
you just smashed it?

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
You really could let it go?

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,380
I wanted to please her,

32
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,190
but she cares about
that useless person instead.

33
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,310
Afraid I might hurt him,

34
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,590
she even had someone else
fight in his place.

35
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,630
Not only did it break
the Rong family's rules,

36
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,290
but it was also an insult to me!

37
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,800
No matter how passionately
you bare your heart,

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,400
she will still

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
protect her dear cousin.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,329
What can you do about it?

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
If you care about the Rong family's

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,910
tea plantations in the south

43
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,470
and their maritime tea routes,

44
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,530
you might have to swallow your pride.

45
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,520
No matter who she cares for in her heart,

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,250
just focus on winning her over.

47
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,310
If you truly love Miss Rong,

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,750
then use patience and persistence,

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,550
and you'll surely win her heart.

50
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,800
So you're envious of

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
Mingzhou's deep-water harbor

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,579
and the endless wealth
from maritime trade.

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
No wonder the He family
is willing to set aside grudges

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
and desperately wants their bloodline

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,560
to merge with the Rongs.

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,750
You really are up to no good—

57
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,630
repeatedly provoking me to take action

58
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,230
so you can reap the benefits.

59
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,510
You covet his cousin,

60
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,640
while I want the Rong Family's tea.

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,050
There's no difference between us.

62
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,400
Compared to that pretentious

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Yan Bailou from the east courtyard,

64
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,430
I'd rather deal with you.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,430
At least your wickedness
is straightforward.

66
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,630
We need to think about

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,240
how to deal with

68
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,590
that hindrance.

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,510
Spies.

70
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,850
Miss Rong, lower your voice.

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,970
Be careful of eavesdroppers.

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,040
Forgive me, Miss Rong.

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,440
I have confidential matters to report.

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,170
Please allow me to come closer.

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,500
Please consider this carefully.

76
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,870
Mr. Wen's tea

77
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,930
was tampered with,

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
He Xingming bribed others

79
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,610
for assistance in advance,

80
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,270
and they even knew the Rong family's

81
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,470
examination topics.

82
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,390
Someone must have

83
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,780
leaked the martial contest details.

84
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,220
[Xinfang Pavilion]

85
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,390
All you do is gamble and drink.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,630
I was only gone for a short while,

87
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,120
and you couldn't even
guard the room properly!

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
What's the point of keeping you all?

89
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,750
You, come here. Perfect timing.

90
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,940
I've lost several gold ingots,

91
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,720
worth about 1,000 taels of silver.

92
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
Those gold

93
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,180
and heavy lumps

94
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,440
would make a sound
if dropped on the floor!

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,430
Yet they've vanished from this room.

96
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,680
Those who know think I'm a guest here;

97
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,630
those who don't

98
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,310
would think I've
fallen into a den of thieves!

99
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,270
That's right.

100
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,480
Whoever took them, speak up now.

101
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,010
Speak up.

102
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,730
How do you explain this?

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,650
Mr. Yang, please calm down.

104
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,690
Since the items were lost
within the Rong Mansion,

105
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,420
it's our duty to help find them.

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll give orders immediately

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,070
to search Xinfang Pavilion thoroughly.

108
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,470
Searching isn't enough.

109
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,680
The servants must be questioned too.

110
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,310
Of course.

111
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,070
We'll certainly give you an explanation.

112
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,530
Go quickly.

113
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,440
Yes.

114
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,480
Once that thieving servant is caught,

115
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,120
I'll tear his arms off.

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,120
I want to see what's happening

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,850
in that room.

118
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,120
Why are you stopping me?

119
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,340
Gold ingots were stolen from his room.

120
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,400
Did you steal them?

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,950
No?

122
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,460
Then stay out of this mess.

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,480
Get involved will only bring trouble.

124
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,240
What you're saying

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,500
is quite interesting.

126
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,000
What's that in your hand?

127
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,990
First comes the martial contest,

128
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,070
then there will surely be a literary test.

129
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,390
How are your studies, Young Master?

130
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,590
Can you pass the test?

131
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,670
These are the questions
my cousin leaked to me?

132
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,159
The Rong family's questions seem simple,

133
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,720
but they carry deeper meaning.

134
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,310
Since ancient times, one's character
is revealed by how they handle wine.

135
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,000
Those who misbehave when drunk

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,560
will be the first to be expelled.

137
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
On the martial arts arena,

138
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,870
they'll naturally test...

139
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,390
Naturally,

140
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,800
they'll test whose
martial skills are superior.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
That Mr. Bai who lay on the ground

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
playing dead during the martial contest

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,880
still passed successfully, didn't he?

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Well...

145
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,770
Those who train diligently

146
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,230
and show courage can pass.

147
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Those who are shrewd

148
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
or favored by luck can also pass.

149
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,220
Clearly, the Rong family has no fixed
rules for choosing a son-in-law.

150
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,120
However, the Rong family
possesses vast wealth,

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,130
and Lady Shanbao bears
tremendous responsibility.

152
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,530
She still needs to choose
a worthy partner—

153
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,310
someone

154
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,200
who can win everyone's approval.

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,880
The Rong family is in business.

156
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,160
Poetry and essays
are just icing on the cake.

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,960
Are you decent at calculations?

158
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,710
The Rong family's horses
and ships are loaded with tea.

159
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,840
How much do you know about tea affairs?

160
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,909
Well, um...

161
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:39,909
I...

162
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,830
Better late than never, I suppose.

163
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,890
What about that Yang Dingchen outside?

164
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,990
Are you really not going to deal with him?

165
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,120
Tonight I'll have extra candles

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
sent to your room.

167
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,040
You should focus on studying.

168
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,110
Stop worrying about others.

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,140
Steward Lu!

170
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,630
Something terrible has happened!

171
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,480
There's a poisonous snake

172
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
in Mr. Wen's room!

173
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,170
Steward Lu!

174
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,750
Get him!

175
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,390
Get him!

176
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,360
Quick, bring the lantern over here!

177
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,870
Who...

178
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,420
Who are you people?

179
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,480
Don't waste words with him.

180
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,890
Let's go to the hall to talk.

181
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,420
Let's go.

182
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,780
Wanwan.

183
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,450
Beautiful.

184
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,750
Mrs. Yan, look.

185
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,000
Sister made this for me.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Isn't it pretty?

187
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,670
Yes.

188
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,700
It looks lovely on you, My Lady.

189
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,890
Lady Shanbao,

190
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,360
at Xinfang Pavilion...

191
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,540
Wanwan's flower crown

192
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,160
needs a few more pink camellias.

193
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,360
I'll go pick some from the garden for you.

194
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,560
Be good and wait here.

195
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Hurry back then.

196
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,150
I'll be waiting.

197
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,700
There are many visitors
in the house lately.

198
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,760
Don't take Wanwan wandering around
unless necessary.

199
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,040
Yes.

200
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,790
Mrs. Yan.

201
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,430
Mrs. Yan,

202
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,270
I want this yellow one.

203
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,440
Alright.

204
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,850
I heard shouting outside at night,

205
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,910
saying that there was

206
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,900
a poisonous snake in Mr. Wen's room.

207
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,090
I hurried to check,

208
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,690
but someone ambushed me halfway.

209
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm just as confused.

210
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,120
I don't know which

211
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,510
house rule I've violated

212
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,310
to be seized without any reason.

213
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,960
What happened tonight

214
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,270
is witnessed by
all the young masters here.

215
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,440
How dare you

216
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,300
tell such lies?

217
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,590
That's right.

218
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,210
There was indeed a snake,

219
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,410
but it was in

220
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,670
Mr. Yang's room.

221
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,140
Someone did

222
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,910
plant a snake in Mr. Yang's room.

223
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,840
Everyone saw it.

224
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,330
This is bad.

225
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,320
Steward Cheng,

226
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,350
I led people to search

227
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,810
and found this in his room.

228
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,170
Well, well!

229
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:52,920
I...

230
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,730
So it was you who stole them,

231
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,210
making the rest of us suspects!

232
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,140
How vicious an inside thief can be!

233
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,560
You...

234
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,830
I see now.

235
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,840
It must have been him
who stole my valuables.

236
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,170
After I made such a fuss this afternoon,

237
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,250
he feared someone would
search and find them,

238
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,710
so he planted
a green bamboo viper in my room.

239
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,240
Fortunately, my servant
was alert at night

240
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
and so he failed.

241
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,320
Truly, heaven protects the virtuous!

242
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,720
If Mr. Yang really suffered

243
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,440
from poison because of five gold ingots,

244
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,270
then the Rong family

245
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,400
would be guilty of harboring thieves.

246
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,960
It's pitiful that such a young child

247
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,470
had to take the calamity for his master.

248
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,480
Bear with it.

249
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,500
My little Jifa.

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,150
Fusheng,

251
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,000
we have both witnesses
and evidence right here.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,530
Do you have anything to say?

253
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,770
Steward Cheng,

254
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,600
I was well aware that the mansion
was searching for stolen goods.

255
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,670
If I had taken the gold ingots,

256
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,480
I would've buried them
in a secluded place

257
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,360
and retrieved them
after things had calmed down.

258
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,390
Why would I openly hide them in my room?

259
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,080
Moreover,

260
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,840
the entire garden is full of tea trees.

261
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
Spring thunder could
startle snakes to slither about.

262
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,720
It's possible they might
have disturbed the guests.

263
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,480
Why insist

264
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,390
that I did it?

265
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,840
Besides,

266
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
he could catch the slithering snake,

267
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,150
yet somehow

268
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,440
he let the culprit
who planted the snake escape.

269
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,970
Isn't that rather strange?

270
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,840
With both stolen goods and witnesses,

271
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,670
how dare a mere servant like you argue!

272
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,270
Everyone,

273
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,550
if this happened in my household,

274
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,750
he'd be beaten to death on the spot!

275
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,390
Exactly!

276
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,440
Just stealing the gold would be one thing,

277
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
but using snakes
to harm people is unforgivable.

278
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,670
This servant stole from his own household.

279
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,080
He should be flogged 100 times!

280
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,000
According to the law of theft,
he should be sentenced to be hanged!

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
Mr. He speaks rightly.

282
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,550
Drag him away and beat him to death!

283
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,270
Which of his points is unreasonable

284
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,960
that he must be punished?

285
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,910
Even the County Office

286
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,390
allows the accused to plead their case.

287
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:42,910
You...

288
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,550
You're more tyrannical
than the county magistrate!

289
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,390
You're actually trying

290
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,150
to take someone's life so casually.

291
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,910
All of you here are educated men.

292
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,170
Did the sages teach you

293
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,550
to be arrogant with your talents

294
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,150
and treat human lives so lightly?

295
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,910
All... all your

296
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,440
learning has gone to waste!

297
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,480
What are you saying?

298
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,510
You're so eager

299
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,630
to defend a thief.

300
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,720
I wonder

301
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,790
are you the one who told him
to plant the snake?

302
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,870
-I...
-Yes, it was him!

303
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,080
Seeing he couldn't measure up to others,

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,200
he incited his servant to harm people.

305
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
We haven't even started on you yet.

306
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,790
Reckless behavior!
You're in this together!

307
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,440
We should tie you up and charge you both!

308
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,150
That's right! Exactly!

309
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,790
Am I wrong?

310
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,840
Have you forgotten what you just said?

311
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Let go!

312
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,340
Steward Cheng,

313
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I am lowly and insignificant,
not worth mentioning.

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,200
But they have

315
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
treated Lady Shanbao's cousin

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,750
like a thief.

317
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,750
All this talk of thieves' dens,

318
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,120
stealing from one's own household...

319
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,240
Which family are they insulting?

320
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,960
Who exactly are they disrespecting?

321
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,530
Insulting me alone is one thing,

322
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,390
but they've also

323
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,510
insulted my masters as well.

324
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,190
How is this a marriage proposal visit?

325
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,850
It's clearly troublemaking!

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,860
Steward Cheng,

327
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,300
things have gotten this far.

328
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,500
Are you just going to stand by and watch?

329
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,230
Gentlemen, mind your words.

330
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,580
If you speak inappropriately again,

331
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,850
don't blame the Rong family
for disrespecting guests.

332
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,150
Nonsense!

333
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,720
Are you trying

334
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,910
to shift the blame?

335
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,960
We're scolding

336
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,150
only you, this servant.

337
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,440
Guards! Take him away immediately!

338
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,440
Tear out his filthy tongue!

339
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Give him 100 lashes before questioning!

340
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,480
Wait.

341
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,200
Mr. Yang,

342
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
if not for his sake, then for mine.

343
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
This man is from Qilan Garden.

344
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,000
I cannot decide his fate.

345
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,130
This is not allowed.

346
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,200
He used poison to harm others,
which is a heinous crime.

347
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,390
Consider it as doing your lady a favor,

348
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,480
punishing evil.

349
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,870
We'll handle it ourselves

350
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,470
and won't trouble you at all.

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,380
But this...

352
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,740
Do it now!

353
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,720
Arrest him!

354
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,410
Let's see who dares!

355
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,360
-Let go!
-Seize him!

356
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,160
Drag him away!

357
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,100
Let's see where you can go!

358
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,270
-Release me!
-Don't try to escape!

359
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,990
You too!

360
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,950
How dare you!

361
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,390
Let go!

362
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,670
Guards!

363
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,550
-Yes.
-Mr. Wen!

364
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,480
If you can't subdue him,

365
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,510
each of you will take

366
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,770
20 lashes in his place.

367
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,690
Let go.

368
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,080
Go!

369
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,240
Mr. Wen!

370
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,870
Let me go!

371
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,960
Mr. Wen!

372
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,069
Stop!

373
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,109
Serves you right!

374
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,930
Lady Shanbao is here.

375
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,810
Won't you stop now?

376
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,990
Lady Shanbao, this is...

377
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,990
Are you all here as guests

378
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,640
or to cause trouble?

379
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,590
Fighting like this, losing all dignity—

380
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,920
where are your manners?

381
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,680
Get up.

382
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,550
Mr. Wen.

383
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,000
Are you alright?

384
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,870
Thank you.

385
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,090
Where's the doctor?

386
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,720
Coming, coming!

387
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,350
Coming.

388
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,160
Shanbao, don't worry about me.

389
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,270
I'm fine.

390
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,350
I just took a few sneaky punches.

391
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,570
Please don't worry.

392
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,240
D-Doctor,

393
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,540
go check on him.

394
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm fine. I'm fine, Shanbao.

395
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,110
Young man, where are you hurt?

396
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm fine too.

397
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,530
Go get medicine for Mr. Wen.

398
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,480
Go.

399
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,440
Lady Shanbao,

400
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,310
that scoundrel stole my gold,

401
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,510
yet your cousin blatantly shielded him,

402
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,970
stirring public outrage.

403
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,500
I hope you'll handle this fairly,

404
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,430
without bias,

405
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,450
to quiet the public outcry.

406
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,720
We spoke out against injustice.

407
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,240
We tried to reason with him,

408
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,370
but he insisted on helping that thief.

409
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
We are outsiders here.

410
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,350
Please make a fair judgment, Lady Shanbao.

411
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,880
I've always trusted those I employ

412
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,680
and not employ those I distrust.

413
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,730
By accusing him of theft today,

414
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,210
you're questioning my judgment,

415
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,160
suggesting I can't tell
loyalty from treachery,

416
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,890
and that I've harbored a thief?

417
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,080
As we live in this world,

418
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
our words can cut like an axe.

419
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,960
Speak with malice

420
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,040
and you'll inevitably
face the retribution.

421
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,240
Fusheng,

422
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,750
Public clamor can melt metals;
Slander can destroy one's reputation.

423
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,550
If you can prove your innocence,

424
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,420
then let everyone know

425
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,540
that Lady Shanbao hasn't
trusted the wrong person.

426
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,920
I owe Miss Rong my life,

427
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,310
and I'm willing to repay her kindness
with my life.

428
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,200
My own life and honor are trivial matters,

429
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,070
but I cannot allow Miss Rong

430
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,600
to be wronged because of me.

431
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Since the stolen goods
were found in my room,

432
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,260
I humbly request everyone to come

433
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,010
and take a look inside my room.

434
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,640
Lady Shanbao,

435
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
it was me and Jingzhong who

436
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
discovered the stolen goods

437
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,800
tied with a red string
hanging under the bed board.

438
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,660
Right here.

439
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,920
W-Why… Why is the cinnabar

440
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,580
scattered all over the floor?

441
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,480
Cinnabar? What cinnabar?

442
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,200
Where did this cinnabar come from?

443
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,510
Please forgive me, My Lady.

444
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,590
At noon he reported that

445
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,440
Mr. Wen wasn't sleeping well at night

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,920
and asked for some

447
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,830
cinnabar, coptis, and roasted licorice,

448
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,310
requesting me to make a sachet

449
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,960
to help Mr. Wen calm his mind.

450
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,510
I thought it was too much trouble,

451
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,910
so I told him to put it
in the pillow instead,

452
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,310
then sent him away.

453
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,160
It's my fault for not being careful.

454
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,620
I didn't realize
it had spilled everywhere.

455
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,110
Right!

456
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,240
This is providence.

457
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,830
Someone waited until I left

458
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,310
to plant stolen goods in my room.

459
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,480
We only need to check the shoe soles

460
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
to know who the real thief is.

461
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,530
-That makes sense.
-He's right.

462
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,130
One check and it'll be clear.

463
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,370
Don't be afraid.

464
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,840
Those who searched should be innocent.

465
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,240
But those who deliberately framed others

466
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,700
won't escape punishment.

467
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,840
Take off his shoes.

468
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,960
There's cinnabar.

469
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,730
-It's him.
-It was actually him.

470
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,940
Lady Shanbao!

471
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,920
I've been wronged!

472
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,380
I know nothing about this!

473
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,640
So you're the greedy thief

474
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,970
who has been fooling all of us.

475
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,750
I knew someone as shifty-eyed as you

476
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,700
couldn't be trusted.

477
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,920
You stole my belongings

478
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
and even dared to frame someone else!

479
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,510
I can't believe there's

480
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,680
such a shameless

481
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,960
and ungrateful thief in this world!

482
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,920
Speak! Why did you frame him?

483
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,670
Is this truly what happened?

484
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,000
I was in charge of
the food in this pavilion,

485
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,580
with a monthly wage of one tael,

486
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,520
plus additional tips
from the noble guests.

487
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,590
But all of it was taken by that

488
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,590
backdoor dealer.

489
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,920
I wish I could tear him to pieces!

490
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,350
It was all a misunderstanding.

491
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,640
My rush to catch the thief

492
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,770
ended up wronging an innocent person.

493
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,230
Wronging a servant or two is no big deal.

494
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,340
However, Mr. Yang,

495
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
you shouldn't have believed others' gossip

496
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,850
and falsely accused Lady Shanbao
of poor judgment and harboring thieves.

497
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,310
If this spreads tomorrow,

498
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,070
it will damage
the Rong family's reputation.

499
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,600
If Old Madam Rong finds out,

500
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
she wouldn't approve of those

501
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,860
troublemakers

502
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,160
and dishonorable men

503
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
becoming her granddaughter's husband.

504
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,490
Should her anger flare,

505
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,720
may I ask, how could

506
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,680
any of you rest easy?

507
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,160
Please calm down, Lady Shanbao.

508
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,960
We were too gullible.

509
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,670
It's just a trivial matter.

510
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,270
We wouldn't dare
disturb Old Madam Rong.

511
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,920
Please forgive our rashness.

512
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,270
We won't disturb you any further.

513
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,670
We'll take our leave now.

514
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,640
Yes.

515
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,010
We'll leave right away.

516
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,510
Be my guest.

517
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,160
Let's go. Let's go.

518
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,790
Hurry up.

519
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,310
What is it?

520
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,290
Mr. Yang, you still have grievances?

521
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
It seems the Rong family
hasn't been hospitable enough,

522
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,500
and has mistreated our esteemed guest.

523
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,990
Why don't you come with me
to see my grandmother

524
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,120
and let her be the judge of this matter?

525
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,340
Lady Shanbao, never mind.

526
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,360
I'm simply too kindhearted and gullible,

527
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,670
easily influenced
and manipulated by others.

528
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,150
I've rashly offended you,

529
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,030
and should apologize profusely.

530
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,000
But my poor Jifa

531
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,640
is suffering terribly from snake venom.

532
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,070
I'm extremely worried

533
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,640
and want to hurry back to check on him.

534
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,370
I'll come tomorrow
to properly apologize to you.

535
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,830
Thank you, Lady Shanbao,
for clearing my name.

536
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,590
Mr. Yan,

537
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,330
thank you for speaking up for justice.

538
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,070
You're becoming increasingly useless,

539
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,730
can't even handle
such a small matter properly.

540
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,380
I handled this poorly

541
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,330
which led to such a mess.

542
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,920
I know I've made a serious mistake.

543
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,480
I'll accept whatever
punishment you see fit.

544
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,740
Go find the steward for your punishment.

545
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,690
Yes.

546
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
Lady Shanbao,

547
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,000
besides those who planted evidence,

548
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,200
the servants who searched

549
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
this room tonight

550
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,550
should also be detained

551
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,640
and interrogated strictly.

552
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,100
Also, those responsible for night patrols—

553
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,000
how exactly was the snake let in?

554
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,960
They should all be questioned too.

555
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,290
Please forgive me, Lady Shanbao!

556
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,730
I'm innocent!

557
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,820
Innocent or not,

558
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
we'll find out after interrogation.

559
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,000
Guards!

560
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,480
Move! Get up!

561
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,200
Lady Shanbao, please save us!

562
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,860
We had nothing to do with this!

563
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,520
Go!

564
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,980
Lady Shanbao!

565
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,270
Look at that glare—

566
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,180
as if I were some scheming

567
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,160
consort whispering
poison into the emperor's ear.

568
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,960
You still have the mood to joke?

569
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,730
After all this commotion,

570
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
how is your old wound?

571
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,550
I...

572
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,440
Quickly, get Mr. Zhao.

573
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,720
Yes.

574
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,650
No need for that.

575
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,090
I can treat this wound.

576
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,230
I didn't expect Mr. Yan

577
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,830
would know medicine as well.

578
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,910
The mountains are full of herbs.

579
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,440
I've read a few medical books
in my spare time.

580
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,180
I can handle minor ailments.

581
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,500
But your injury is too severe.

582
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,530
You need to rest properly for half a year.

583
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,920
If the wound reopens,

584
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,750
not even Hua Tuo himself could save you.

585
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,570
Well, I just

586
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,800
have a restless nature
and can't stand being idle.

587
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,260
Just give me some
more hemostatic medicine.

588
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,680
External wounds are easy to treat;
internal organs are not.

589
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,080
Your regular medication

590
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,030
needs to add sour jujube seeds

591
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,400
and albizzia bark.

592
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,730
Has my condition changed?

593
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,100
When the five senses are clear,
gold easily transforms.

594
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,590
When the three minds are unsettled,
water hardly dissipates.

595
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,640
Your inner fire is too strong,
and your senses are restless.

596
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,230
You must calm your mind and worry less.

597
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,490
You speak like a Buddhist,

598
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,200
so why do you still come
to propose marriage?

599
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
If you truly have no desires,

600
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,130
why would you still want a wife?

601
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,170
When others insult me and bully me,

602
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,970
you still tell me to stay calm.

603
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,280
If a villain were to spit on you,

604
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,170
could you really endure it?

605
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,200
My master said my earthly
ties aren't yet severed,

606
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,960
so I came.

607
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,360
This is called following fate.

608
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,750
When someone spits on my face,

609
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,040
just let it dry by itself.

610
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,130
It saves me effort

611
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,790
and spares others trouble.

612
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,550
This is called accepting one's lot.

613
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,200
Step away from right and wrong conflicts,

614
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,130
and you'll find true peace of mind.

615
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,000
Stop.

616
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,920
You truly are magnanimous.

617
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,950
As for me,

618
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,930
I'm just a narrow-minded mortal.

619
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,800
I tally every slight
and repay every grudge.

620
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,400
You'd better

621
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,530
not waste your words

622
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,080
trying to persuade me.

623
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,990
How is he?

624
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,720
He's fine.

625
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,870
Lady Shanbao, come with me for a moment.

626
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,480
What's up?

627
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,830
If you have insomnia
or palpitations again,

628
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,090
just massage the Baihui acupoint,

629
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,910
the Shuaigu acupoint above the ear tip,

630
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,840
and the temples.

631
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,080
They all help calm the mind
and soothe the spirit.

632
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,370
In the past,

633
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,640
I was only

634
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,440
close to deer in the wilderness.

635
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm not used to dealing with people.

636
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,630
I acted impulsively.

637
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,180
However,

638
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,100
peace of mind is essential for good sleep.

639
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,070
These men

640
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,120
have thrown the Rong family into chaos

641
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,840
and it's truly disgusting.

642
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,190
Since ancient times, the problem
has never been scarcity, but inequality.

643
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,720
Your excessive favoritism
toward one person

644
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
not only harms him

645
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,000
but also provokes everyone's anger.

646
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,380
You blame me for being biased?

647
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,880
Rong Shanbao,

648
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,180
you are indeed biased.

649
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,160
Childhood sweethearts
may share deep feelings,

650
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,410
but latecomers may not
necessarily have shallow connections.

651
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,670
You should treat me...

652
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,600
and others

653
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,960
more fairly.

654
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,150
Lady Shanbao, Steward Zhang is here.

655
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,040
The person you asked about

656
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,810
was originally a servant in the household

657
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,940
of Luo Zhan, the Governor of Yingtian.

658
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,020
From the age of five,

659
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,610
he accompanied
the eldest grandson of the Luo family,

660
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,240
Luo Chuance, as his study companion.

661
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,890
But the absurdity

662
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,880
of it all is that

663
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,480
Young Master Luo
had no interest in studying,

664
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,920
yet that little page boy
had exceptional talent

665
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,180
and remarkable intelligence.

666
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,530
He earned Luo Zhan's
high regard and appreciation,

667
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,810
who graciously granted him
a certificate of freedom.

668
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,610
Indeed, at fourteen,

669
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,510
he topped the provincial examination.

670
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,310
The countryside was astounded.

671
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,400
Sadly, he couldn't take
the metropolitan examination.

672
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,580
According to local rumors,

673
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,080
Young Master Luo
resented his grandfather's favoritism,

674
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,720
often beating and scolding

675
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,740
the page boy as a child.

676
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,310
After Luo Zhan passed away,

677
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,120
the family held a grand funeral.

678
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,010
He deliberately played tricks on

679
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,680
Mr. Lu who came to pay respects,

680
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,410
accidentally causing a death.

681
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,770
Father! Wake up!

682
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,270
Father, wake up!

683
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,230
Father!

684
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,840
Father, wake up.

685
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,670
Father.

686
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
Father!

687
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,240
Father.

688
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,550
What happened then?

689
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,000
After the three-year
mourning period ended,

690
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,370
he successfully passed

691
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,410
the metropolitan, provincial
and palace examinations,

692
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,940
achieved the highest rank,

693
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,480
and was appointed to the Imperial Academy.

694
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,720
As for Luo Chuance,

695
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
he spent his days
bullying men and harassing women,

696
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
committing all kinds of evil deeds.

697
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
The people despised him deeply.

698
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
Then one day,
he fell into the water while drunk.

699
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,060
Don't worry.

700
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,890
I won't kill you.

701
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,210
The Luo family's inheritance

702
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,470
has been completely gambled away by you.

703
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,470
For the rest of your life,

704
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,420
you can suffer in hell.

705
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,020
Lord Lu put aside past grievances

706
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,430
and rescued that villain from the water.

707
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,670
Later, when the Luo family fell into ruin,

708
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,800
it was also Lord Lu

709
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,190
who remembered
Governor Luo's past kindness

710
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,990
and provided support and care.

711
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,240
When locals talk about this,

712
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,290
who doesn't praise his generosity

713
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,210
and how he returned good for evil?

714
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,070
Sadly, heaven envied his talent.

715
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,830
Earlier this year, he hurried
back to the capital from Linji.

716
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,400
When his boat reached the middle
of the river, a sudden wave struck.

717
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,130
The boat was destroyed,
and all aboard perished.

718
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,440
Allperished?

719
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,220
He's dead?

720
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,290
Minister Xu himself
presided over the funeral

721
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,820
and personally wrote
the memorial couplets.

722
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,500
I see.

723
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,230
You may go now.

724
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,270
Yes.

725
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,590
No wonder not a single person

726
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,790
came looking for him.

727
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,210
He went from a living person
to a dead one.

728
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,350
Lu Jianglai,

729
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,880
what kind of enmity
have you actually incurred?

730
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,800
If I send you back now,

731
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,440
it would undoubtedly

732
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,639
lead you to a dead end.

733
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,920
Just stay here

734
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,190
at the Rong Mansion.

735
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,710
You have no idea

736
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,620
how lively it was last night.

737
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,630
Unfortunately, I was in deep sleep

738
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,110
and didn't witness it myself.

739
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,400
Poor Cheng Guanyu

740
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,120
who has always been

741
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,750
so faithful to Lady Shanbao.

742
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,170
Now he's been dragged down by them.

743
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,940
I heard Ms. Yan will personally
carry out the punishment.

744
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
That's not right.

745
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,150
What's wrong with that?

746
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,080
The Yang family is of noble lineage

747
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,489
and often does business with our family.

748
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,510
A mere servant

749
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,800
who offended Mr. Yang

750
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,070
should just be dealt with quietly.

751
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,230
For what reason

752
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,010
must they make such a big fuss about it?

753
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,720
Of course it's for Cousin Wen.

754
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,590
Could it be

755
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,920
for that lowly servant?

756
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,400
Yunyin, did you get a clear look

757
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,840
at that person's look?

758
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,030
Cuiwei,

759
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,150
keep an eye on that Fusheng.

760
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,280
Yes.

761
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,840
Don't think I don't know

762
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
what you're thinking.

763
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,500
You deliberately stood by,

764
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,350
letting those people
reveal their ugly sides,

765
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,920
all to make Lady Shanbao
despise them even more!

766
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Isn't that right?

767
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,400
They're nothing but

768
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
bloodsucking flies drawn by the scent.

769
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,410
They covet the Rong family's
tea mountains and wealth.

770
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,130
All I did

771
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,050
is simply letting Lady Shanbao

772
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,360
see their true faces.

773
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,190
Who do you think you are

774
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,720
to meddle in their affairs?

775
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,980
You must always remember

776
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,640
you're just a beggar
taken in by the Rong family.

777
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,610
Lady Shanbao provides
for your basic needs,

778
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,380
the Rong family has educated you,

779
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,580
so you should repay them with your life.

780
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
Don't interfere with
your masters' affairs.

781
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,120
And don't you dare

782
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,190
have even the slightest

783
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,790
filthy thought in your mind!

784
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,530
I won't forget.

785
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,200
I wouldn't dare forget in this lifetime.

786
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,150
I raised you myself,

787
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,230
so I must warn you.

788
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,840
You grew up with her when you were young.

789
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,230
You were like her brother

790
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,630
and her close companion.

791
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,960
But Lady Shanbao is the master
and you are the servant.

792
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,620
Master and servant
are ultimately different.

793
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,480
This boundary cannot be crossed.

794
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,840
In the future,

795
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,980
she will be matched
with a noble young master.

796
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,040
How could you possibly aspire to her?

797
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,780
If you continue to harbor
inappropriate thoughts,

798
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,140
you'll end up with no place
for your body to rest.

799
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
Think carefully.

800
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,300
Steward Cheng!

801
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,000
I merely

802
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,530
drove away a swarm of flies.

803
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,670
What did I do wrong?

804
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,420
It's all your terrible idea.

805
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,800
That vicious hound wouldn't die,

806
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,660
and it ended up biting us instead.

807
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Why do you keep following me?

808
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,320
Aren't we here
to apologize to Lady Shanbao?

809
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Mr. Yang, have you made up your mind?

810
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,250
Lady Shanbao?

811
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,600
Lady Shanbao.

812
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,930
The mountain land that you've chosen

813
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,590
can be cleared within a month.

814
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,070
Those 3,000 tea plants

815
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,930
will be transplanted there soon.

816
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,550
Though the land by the water
on the east side of the mountain

817
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,550
is occupied by mountain villagers,

818
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,430
in my humble opinion,

819
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,920
we can hire the men from the mountains

820
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
to clear the land

821
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,440
and send some skilled workers

822
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,760
from our tea plantations

823
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,190
to teach the women
how to pick and process tea leaves.

824
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,590
We must not delay
the picking of the first spring tea.

825
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,510
Discuss it with Yi
and proceed accordingly.

826
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,510
Lady Shanbao, please rest assured.

827
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,200
Lady Shanbao.

828
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,200
Lady Shanbao!

829
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,230
Lady Shanbao, could it be that

830
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,760
you're still angry with me?

831
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,000
Why were all

832
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,660
the gifts I sent returned?

833
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,360
Yesterday was a misunderstanding.

834
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,510
I upset you,

835
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,240
and I feel deeply uneasy.

836
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,200
If you haven't forgiven me,

837
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,030
I can neither eat nor sleep...

838
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,480
Mr. Yang, you worry too much.

839
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,800
It's been raining for the past few days,

840
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,030
but today the sky has cleared up.

841
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,890
And there's a north wind blowing.

842
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,070
The tea plantation must be busy

843
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,760
harvesting the first spring tea.

844
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,670
I've heard Lady Shanbao

845
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,230
handles everything personally.

846
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,630
You must be heading
to the tea mountain now.

847
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,550
Lady Shanbao, please.

848
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
Truly worthy of being
the heir to Huqiu Tea,

849
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,510
explaining everything about

850
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,190
the tea plantation so thoroughly.

851
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,630
Lady Shanbao is busy
with important matters.

852
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,590
You and I should leave now.

853
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,440
Let's go.

854
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,360
What? Reluctant to move?

855
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,480
I heard the Rong family has

856
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,080
a tea tree over 300 years old.

857
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,360
They've also sent people everywhere

858
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,000
to collect precious tea varieties.

859
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,360
In order to transplant

860
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,070
a thousand-year-old
wild tea trees from Yunnan,

861
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,960
they actually relocated

862
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,800
an entire village,

863
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,670
just to secure

864
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,590
the best tea cultivators in the world.

865
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,590
Such determination—

866
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,450
your He family could never match.

867
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
You've been following me

868
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,150
around the tea plantation

869
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,280
since early morning.

870
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,800
Don't tell me you're after the tea.

871
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,200
You...

872
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,670
Lady Shanbao.

873
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,000
Lady Shanbao has invited you

874
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,190
to tour the tea mountain today.

875
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,790
Please go back and get ready.

876
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
This tea mountain

877
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,630
has over 80 tea plantations,

878
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,560
large and small,

879
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,920
with over 1,000 tea workers.

880
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,280
The tea plantations
provide food and lodging.

881
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,440
The workers' children

882
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,880
can study at
the Rong family's private school.

883
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,590
In the prefectures and counties
near Linji alone,

884
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,590
there are 6 more such tea mountains.

885
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,780
Now is the spring harvest season.

886
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,150
Although it's said in the trade

887
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,590
that picking tea
before Qingming Festival is too early,

888
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,880
and after the Beginning of Summer
is too late,

889
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,190
with the best time
being around Grain Rain.

890
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,760
But rarity brings value.

891
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,760
Tea leaves picked before Qingming Festival

892
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
are tender, fresh, and sweet,

893
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,330
and more favored by people.

894
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,280
Just one jin of tea bud heads

895
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
requires seven or eight people

896
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,740
picking for an entire day.

897
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,630
And it must be done

898
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,630
during these few days
when the leaves are most tender.

899
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,810
So many young masters here.

900
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,030
Gentlemen, please wait a moment.

901
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,090
I'll go ahead and make preparations.

902
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
Wasn't Lady Shanbao supposed to be here?

903
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,670
Why hasn't she shown up yet?

904
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,760
It's so muddy here.

905
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,920
With such a grand estate,
how could the Rong family

906
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,880
let their precious daughter

907
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,840
suffer like this?

908
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,510
Even a country gentry's daughter

909
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,550
keeps her feet clean.

910
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,190
Let's stop and rest for a while.

911
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,150
My new robe.

912
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,100
Take a rest.

913
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,110
Mr. Wen,

914
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,160
that night Mr. He invited me for drinks.

915
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,370
I had a few too many and fell asleep.

916
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,960
It almost caused a big mistake.

917
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,230
If I had been there then,

918
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,000
you wouldn't have been left helpless.

919
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,440
I blame myself for being so gullible.

920
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,550
One can be a thief for 1,000 days,

921
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,070
but who can guard
against thieves for 1,000 days?

922
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,380
My good brother, you're pure-hearted,

923
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,150
certainly no match for others' schemes.

924
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,950
Don't mind it.

925
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,420
Who was so cruel?

926
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,810
Let me see your injury.

927
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,340
It's fine. Already healed.

928
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,910
Young Master,

929
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,280
look at that tea-picking girl.

930
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,860
She's teaching how to pick tender leaves.

931
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,840
This is the Rong family's

932
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,360
foundation of livelihood.

933
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,490
Since we're here at the tea plantation,

934
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,550
why not learn about tea cultivation?

935
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,880
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

936
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,410
Why should I listen to that?

937
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,690
Do you expect me to compete with the girls

938
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,490
in dexterity?

939
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,840
Exactly.

940
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,840
And no beautiful ladies in sight either.

941
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,040
What a waste of a trip.

942
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,880
Let's go find Steward Cheng.

943
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,630
Okay.

944
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,480
Let's go.

945
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,550
Young Master,

946
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,700
stop wandering around.

947
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,650
Why not listen for a while?

948
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,140
Since we're here,
we might as well settle in.

949
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,880
I noticed the tea workers

950
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,870
are extremely respectful
to that tea-picking girl.

951
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,110
I suspect her position
in the tea plantation

952
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,770
is unusual.

953
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,150
Be patient.

954
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,150
Let's go.
