[Episode 13]

3
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,070
My Lord.

4
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,440
It's gone wrong.

5
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,229
You chose the daily route

6
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,229
Miss Rong takes

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,310
because you wanted to

8
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,770
get close to Rong Shanbao.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,510
Everything happened
just as you predicted,
My Lord.

10
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,710
After your accident,

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,820
no one dared to investigate

12
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,419
the Wei family case anymore.

13
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,870
I offered a pair of precious pearls
as a gift

14
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,080
and revealed several of

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,210
your mistakes as my pledge of loyalty.

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,079
Xu Song accepted my surrender

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
and entrusted me with important tasks,

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,090
promoting me all the way up.

19
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,750
You successfully infiltrated
the Rong family

20
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,210
and won Miss Rong's favor.

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,890
Cracking the Wei family case
is within sight.

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,040
His Majesty will surely
reward you generously.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,700
Nothing seems bad at the time.

24
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,430
If I hadn't hit that sharp rock

25
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,630
and injured my brain,

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
the situation wouldn't have become

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,329
so complicated.

28
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,870
I'm no deity

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,450
who can foresee everything under heaven.

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
It's all because I was too arrogant,

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,940
so heaven played a trick on me.

32
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,960
I wove my own net

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,520
only to trap myself in it.

34
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,630
My Lord, are you worried about

35
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,890
Yang Dingchen's case?

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,680
Please rest assured, My Lord.

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,710
Once we find the owner of
those embroidered shoes,

38
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,590
the case will be solved.

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,190
Yunshu.

40
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,400
You know I've

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,060
always cared for you the most.

42
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,910
It's all Mr. He's fault
for flattering me so much.

43
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,640
I couldn't resist for a moment.

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
It's my fault.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,120
I'll find you a better match
in the future.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,380
Please don't blame me.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,370
How would I dare?

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Mr. He comes from a noble family.

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,840
How could I be worthy of him?

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,730
Xiangling, I have a headache.

51
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,550
I have some medicine for headaches.

52
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,410
It's perfect for your symptoms.

53
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,740
Guaranteed to cure you.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,570
Come with me.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,030
Yunyin.

56
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,690
What are you thinking about so intently?

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,250
I think I've seen the mark
on the shoe soles

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,600
somewhere before.

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,010
[Hualin Courtyard]

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,240
Shanbao!

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Shanbao, help me!

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Shanbao.

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,390
Shanbao!

64
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,390
Miss Rong.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,190
All your account books and belongings

66
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,250
have been moved to Hualin Courtyard.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Miss Rong.

68
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,270
Lady Yunwan made a scene
for half the night,

69
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,530
crying for Mrs. Liang.

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,310
The entire back courtyard

71
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,640
was turned upside down.

72
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,630
She only settled down late at night.

73
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,070
When I just closed my eyes,

74
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,530
Lady Yunwan disappeared.

75
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,070
Mrs. Qiu.

76
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,720
Have two people watch over Yunwan

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,750
without leaving her side for a moment.

78
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,270
Don't let strangers frighten her.

79
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,870
Yes.

80
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,070
Miss Rong! Miss Rong!

81
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,280
How can this be my fault?

82
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,520
Lady Yunwan is so unstable,

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,240
who could possibly keep watch over her?

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,770
Miss Rong, please don't worry.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,520
I've burned those shoes,

86
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,010
so they won't be found.

87
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,160
Do you think Lady Yunwan

88
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,920
might have seen something?

89
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Wanwan was about to find Mrs. Liang.

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
She must have stumbled upon

91
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,420
Yang Dingchen's death

92
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,290
and got frightened.

93
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,560
Fortunately,
you weren't in the room that night.

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,220
Otherwise,

95
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,840
the Yang family would have implicated you.

96
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,870
How can you be sure the murderer

97
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,800
only wanted to kill Yang Dingchen?

98
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,850
What if he specifically chose
our wedding night

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,159
to kill me as well?

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,080
Miss Rong.

101
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,470
Miss Rong.

102

[Madam Yang]

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,510
Is Wanwan throwing another tantrum

104
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:44,640
because she can't see me?

105
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,909
[Mrs. Liang]

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,710
Did she sleep well at night?

107
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm afraid no one
can watch over her properly.

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,750
When can I go out?

109
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,000
I just want to take a quick look.

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,270
I miss her.

111
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,070
I'll be careful.

112
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,670
I won't let them see me again.

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,480
Godmother,
people from your family is here.

114
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,290
It's your brother this time.

115
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,420
Do you want to see him?

116
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,600
No, no, no!

117
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,000
No, no!

118
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,480
No!

119
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,750
I won't go out.

120
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,350
Miss Rong.

121
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,480
I'll never dare again!

122
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,940
Please don't let me go out.

123
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,430
I won't go out.

124
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,680
Godmother, please get up.

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,070
You can't hide forever,

126
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
without seeing daylight again.

127
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Let me wash your feet.

128
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,670
You ungrateful, disobedient thing!

129
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,600
Are you trying to scald me to death?

130
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,180
Mother.

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Why have you upset

132
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Mother again?

133
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,570
She's disrespectful and contradicts me.

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
You are my son,

135
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,000
so you must teach her a good lesson.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,550
Mother.

137
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,390
Go on, go!

138
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,930
Quickly, go!

139
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,170
Not long after I married into the family,

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,460
I accidentally discovered my mother-in-law

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
having an affair.

142
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,240
She forced me to sleep with her lover,

143
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,300
and when I refused,

144
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,670
she incited Wei Kejian to beat me.

145
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,440
I passed out several times.

146
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,450
Each time, he would revive me,

147
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,730
begging me to understand
he couldn't disobey his mother.

148
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,910
After all these years,

149
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,820
whenever I close my eyes,

150
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,440
I can still smell

151
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,630
the badger oil used to treat my wounds.

152
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,390
Yes, he was a kind-hearted man.

153
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
He was forced into it.

154
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,510
But did I deserve to die?

155
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,910
What did I do wrong?

156
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,380
You did nothing wrong.

157
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,910
I had begged Father

158
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,910
and my brothers.

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,140
I pleaded with them to save me.

160
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,360
But they just said

161
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,030
it was my bad fate,

162
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
and I could change my husband

163
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,200
and his mom's attitude towards me.

164
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,960
As long as I'm willing to endure

165
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,160
and obey everything,

166
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,270
even hearts of stone

167
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
can be moved.

168
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,090
They would treat me well eventually.

169
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,440
But I can't bear it. I can't bear it.

170
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,990
Only the Rong family,

171
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,250
and your mother,

172
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,550
who was my dearest friend,

173
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,030
my only hope.

174
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,000
Only she would help me,

175
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,630
but now she's dead too.

176
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,670
She's dead.

177
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,630
You're my only hope now.

178
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,320
Please save me.

179
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,440
Save me, please save me.

180
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,920
Miss Rong!

181
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,870
Miss Rong!

182
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,280
Steward Lu was taken away by Lord Lang.

183
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,910
Greetings, Miss Rong.

184
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,960
Did that Lord Lang

185
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
give you any trouble?

186
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,720
No.

187
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,250
Then what did he say to you?

188
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,970
You've successfully
infiltrated the Rong family

189
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,600
and gained Miss Rong's favor.

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,930
The Wei family's case will be solved soon.

191
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,880
As for what you did before

192
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,790
or where you came from,

193
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,520
I don't care.

194
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,040
As long as you never deceive,

195
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,950
cheat,

196
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,890
or hide things from me,

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,860
that's enough.

198
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,910
He asked

199
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,480
who Mr. Yang had conflicts with

200
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,790
and who in Xinfang Pavilion

201
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,910
might be suspects.

202
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,910
I just told him the truth.

203
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,770
He didn't ask about anything else?

204
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
He also asked about
my background and origins,

205
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,500
but I managed to evade the questions.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
I wonder if they found

207
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,720
the owner of those shoes.

208
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,090
Adult women's shoes

209
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
with phoenix or flower designs
on the sole are common,

210
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,840
but those carved with
the Five Poisons are rare.

211
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,000
They're more like what's used
during the Dragon Boat Festival

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,510
to ward off evil.

213
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,080
There are no children with seven-cun feet

214
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,810
in my family.

215
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,750
Wait a sec.

216
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,160
You may go now.

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,960
They don't seem to be searching for shoes
or matching footprints,

218
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
but looking for someone.

219
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
With a clear conscience,

220
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,780
why fear any questioning?

221
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,630
Keep an eye on these people.

222
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,720
You mean, Lord Lang?

223
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,300
And Lu Fusheng.

224
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,840
The courtyard is in chaos,

225
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,750
yet Miss Rong is still
concerned about the accounts.

226
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,900
When you went out earlier,

227
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,100
did you notice how others looked at you?

228
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,180
They were jealous!

229
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,360
Mr. Lu, I heard them saying

230
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,480
the Yang family

231
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,200
is making a big deal
about Mr. Yang's situation

232
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,360
because they want to marry Yitang

233
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,560
into the Rong family.

234
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,510
Who's been gossiping again?

235
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,030
Yang Dingchen died suddenly.

236
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,790
If someone else

237
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,790
marries into the Rong family,

238
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,200
the connection between two families
will weaken.

239
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,280
How could the Yang family accept that?

240
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,010
All that scheming for nothing.

241
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,600
Mr. Lu, wait for me!

242
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,870
Mr. Lu!

243
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,790
Haven't seen you for a while.

244
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,590
You've clearly become wealthy.

245
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,630
Tell me.

246
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,910
When are you going to pay

247
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,970
the debt you owe us?

248
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,300
Who are you people?

249
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,350
When did I ever owe you money?

250
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,690
A year ago at Jixiang Casino.

251
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,440
You pawned your house and land.

252
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,390
Then borrowed more from us brothers.

253
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,320
With principal and interest,

254
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,910
it's at least 500 taels by now.

255
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,840
You dare refuse to pay?

256
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,000
What scoundrels are you?

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,670
Where's the debt note
with his fingerprint?

258
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,530
You're just trying to extort him.

259
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,280
The note?

260
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,810
Yes, I'll get it for you.

261
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,790
I'll get it.

262
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,160
-Take him away.
-Jundai.

263
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
-Take him away.
-Jundai.

264
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,210
Move! We'll talk at the County Office.

265
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,770
Mr. Lu!

266
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,790
Mr. Lu!

267
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,510
Come here.

268
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,150
Gentlemen, you didn't explain clearly

269
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,270
before dragging me here.

270
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,500
That's quite rude.

271
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,150
Lord Lu, don't blame us
for being ruthless.

272
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,220
You should have died earlier.

273
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,890
Since you're so hard to kill,

274
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,950
you'll just have to suffer more cuts.

275
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,460
Someone's coming! Run!

276
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,790
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

277
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,390
Don't run!

278
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,120
I failed to protect you properly,

279
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,450
letting you suffer greatly.

280
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,380
I deserve to die.

281
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,800
Why are you all here?

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,670
Miss Rong said

283
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,200
the mansion has been unsettled lately.

284
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
She feared that you

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,500
might get into trouble going out alone.

286
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,750
She ordered us to protect you secretly.

287
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,240
Thankfully they came quickly,

288
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,200
otherwise I wouldn't have the face

289
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,270
to see Miss Rong again.

290
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,200
I was terrified.

291
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,270
It's fine. Let's go.

292
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,770
Mr. Lu, let me help you.

293
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,690
Mr. Lu, you're injured.

294
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,450
Let's go.

295
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,860
[Rong Mansion]

296
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,570
Let me do it.

297
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,180
Miss Rong.

298
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,440
It's my fault.

299
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,550
You got hurt because of me again.

300
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,150
How could this be your fault?

301
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,880
No, it is my fault.

302
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,099
I should have told you the truth earlier.

303
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,040
Your name is Lu Jianglai.

304
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,609
You're the Imperial Inspector
sent by the Emperor to Jiangnan.

305
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,069
You fell off a cliff
due to someone's scheme.

306
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,369
I was afraid
you might have ulterior motives,

307
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,970
so I was constantly on guard.

308
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,270
Only when I was certain

309
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,120
that you truly remembered nothing,

310
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,580
did I finally feel at ease.

311
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,720
The debt of saving my life is immense.

312
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,950
If it weren't for you,

313
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,480
there probably wouldn't be

314
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,210
a person named Lu Jianglai
in this world anymore.

315
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,590
Besides, I was still
recovering from my injuries then.

316
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,850
I would be defenseless

317
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,750
if you had pushed me

318
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,720
out the door.

319
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,530
It would have been easy

320
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,350
to kill me.

321
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,510
I don't want to waste

322
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
your two hundred-year-old ginseng roots.

323
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,400
That Lang Zhusheng

324
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,840
is probably a greedy man

325
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,590
who betrayed his master for personal gain.

326
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,790
For fame and fortune,

327
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,220
he sold you, his master,

328
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,680
to that scoundrel Xu Song.

329
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,070
The two of them conspired together

330
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,880
to make you
fall off a cliff and lose your memory,

331
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,270
and then hurriedly
reported your death to the capital

332
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,600
to confirm your demise.

333
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,190
Even if you leave the Rong family,

334
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,110
no one would dare recognize you
as Lu Jianglai.

335
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,160
Yesterday, Lang Zhusheng

336
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,420
saw you in the mansion.

337
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,250
He pretended not to know you,

338
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,030
but privately detained you
for questioning.

339
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,550
After confirming you truly don't remember
your past,

340
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,950
he simply set
his poisonous plan for today.

341
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,590
He planned to silence you permanently

342
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,450
to eliminate any future trouble.

343
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,310
This...

344
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,770
That isn't true, is it?

345
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,920
I had

346
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,550
the Jixiang Casino investigated,

347
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,680
but found no trace of those criminals.

348
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,150
Even at this point,

349
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,350
you still don't believe
he wants to harm you?

350
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,880
I feel dizzy.

351
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,010
Sometimes I remember things,

352
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,520
but other times it's all a blur.

353
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,310
If you hadn't sent people to protect me,

354
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,550
I would've...

355
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,140
He's very guilty-conscious.

356
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,180
From now on,
take more guards when you go out.

357
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,090
As long as
you remain part of the Rong family,

358
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,620
I don't believe he would dare harm you
openly.

359
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,160
Wait.

360
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Are you just leaving like this?

361
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,270
Shanbao will inevitably suspect me.

362
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,340
Your life is what matters most.

363
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,290
Then come with me now

364
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,130
and leave the mansion together.

365
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,930
I can't leave.

366
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,090
The case of Wei family is still unsolved.

367
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,260
Look at my face.

368
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,240
That fiery lady

369
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,440
spat right in my face.

370
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,510
I've never seen

371
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,920
such a fierce woman in my life.

372
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,640
And she's merely

373
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,070
a cousin staying with the Rong family,

374
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,330
yet she's so arrogant.

375
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,920
It's clear that Miss Rong

376
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,480
will be even harder to deceive.

377
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,080
Do you really want to
pluck a tiger's whiskers？

378
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,680
All right, all right.

379
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,880
I have my own methods.

380
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,830
Miss Rong is usually cold as ice,

381
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,310
who knew she could care for someone?

382
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,310
Mr. Lu, it's a blessing in disguise.

383
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,430
This isn't right either.

384
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,210
Not this one.

385
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,120
Not this.

386
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,540
How long will this checking take?

387
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,500
Steward Cheng.

388
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,830
Officer.

389
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,680
You just need to check the size

390
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,440
in the ledger.

391
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,790
Why make such a fuss?

392
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,200
These people still have work to do.

393
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
We can't afford the delay.

394
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,530
My Lord said that

395
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,750
since girls and boys

396
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,550
around 15 or 16

397
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,380
grow so fast,

398
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,160
we need to look...

399
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,960
To look for a steed with its portrait.

400
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,890
Yes, for a steed.

401
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,230
The ledger is from last autumn.

402
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,560
Trying to match things now might not work.

403
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Miss Rong.

404
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,110
Miss Rong.

405
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,360
They've gone too far.

406
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,270
They've even searched Hualin Courtyard.

407
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,070
Should we...?

408
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,510
Since Grandmother has given her orders,

409
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,970
let them do as they please.

410
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,530
I'll head back to the
tea plantation now.

411
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,080
The carriage is already prepared for you.

412
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,260
Xiu Qiong, you stay.

413
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,310
They took

414
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,370
shoemaking ledger

415
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,030
and went to

416
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,550
question Mrs. Cui from Zhegui Courtyard,

417
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,830
interrogating her thoroughly,

418
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,440
and insisting she was suspicious.

419
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,030
Miss Shen immediately lost her temper

420
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,160
and had them chased out

421
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
with a big broom.

422
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,680
Lord Lang personally pleaded with her

423
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,070
but was scolded terribly too.

424
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,680
They should know better

425
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,640
who we are.

426
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,790
Without any evidence,

427
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,310
they dare to barge in like this.

428
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,110
If they end up finding no evidence,

429
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,000
our Second Master in the capital

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,060
can have even the Prefect impeached.

431
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,680
Fortunately, the harvest
at the tea plantation

432
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,480
has finished before the Grain Rain.

433
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,330
If the tea production had been delayed,

434
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,460
Grandmother would have been truly furious.

435
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,790
Those people are making such a commotion.

436
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,590
I heard those women
in the courtyard gossiping

437
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,680
that those people kept staring at them

438
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,920
with strange looks.

439
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,430
If they're really looking for the culprit,

440
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,460
I don't think that's what they're after.

441
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,370
I just remembered!

442
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,070
Yunxi.

443
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,590
I knew I'd seen those shoes

444
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,650
somewhere before.

445
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,250
They belonged to Rong Yunwan!

446
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,980
They're Wanwan's.

447
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,510
I'll go tell Grandmother right away.

448
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:46,970
Not now.

449
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,260
Rong Yunwan was born simple-minded.

450
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,440
It's not strange that she wanders around.

451
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
Besides, you two

452
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,030
are at each other's throats all the time.

453
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,630
If you make a fuss about this,

454
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,480
and implicate the Rong family,

455
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,410
Grandmother will blame you for it.

456
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,680
We'd better wait a bit

457
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,560
and see how things develop.

458
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Did you hear that?

459
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,270
Yes.

460
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,830
That night when I hosted the tea party,

461
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,400
you left early...

462
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,450
Lady Yunxi,

463
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,840
please don't get me in trouble.

464
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,870
Our He's tea shop

465
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,440
is located

466
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,370
just west of your Shanju Tea House.

467
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,590
The first batch of tea
has just been harvested over there.

468
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,640
As a young master,

469
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,680
how could I not make an appearance?

470
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,260
It's not like I am sold to your family.

471
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,080
Sit down.

472
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,540
You're holding such leverage

473
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,710
over Rong Shanbao.

474
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,730
Don't you want to make use of it?

475
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,160
The leverage I have

476
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,590
is far more than you think.

477
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,050
It's not time to use it yet.

478
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,600
So cautious, aren't you?

479
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
What if I told you

480
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,110
I could help you

481
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,830
bring that formidable Miss Rong down

482
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,910
from her pedestal?

483
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,070
I'm all ears.

484
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,320
Lady Yune painted a picture

485
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,510
and asked me to embroider
a fruit and vegetable wall hanging.

486
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,200
The peaches and plums
are easy to embroider,

487
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,480
but the eggplants and Buddha's hands

488
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,880
are really tricky for me.

489
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,110
I know your special embroidery stitch

490
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,170
is the finest here,

491
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,550
so I came to you first.

492
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,880
Miss Rong's favored maid,

493
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,200
Xiu Qiong,

494
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,270
is the one with the best needlework.

495
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,450
Why don't you ask her instead?

496
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,820
I don't like her.

497
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,160
I only like you.

498
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Lady Yunxi, Lady Yune,

499
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,310
what brings you here?

500
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,110
Yunxi invited you here

501
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,640
because she has something for you to do.

502
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,650
I've always said Manzhu is talented.

503
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,430
She's determined to
take you into her service.

504
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,390
I don't deserve Lady Yunxi's praise.

505
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,830
Last December,

506
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,200
when you helped Miss Rong
with the New Year gifts,

507
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,460
you took quite a few “gifts”,
didn't you?

508
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,120
I wonder if Miss Rong knows about that?

509
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,750
Look at this girl.

510
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,680
She's terrified.

511
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
Don't worry,

512
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,740
I just need you to do a small favor.

513
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,130
I won't make things difficult for you.

514
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeju,

515
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,470
I was just about to look for you.

516
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,960
At the back door,

517
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,090
that peddler has come again.

518
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,070
The pearl hairpin

519
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,880
and red silk handkerchief you want

520
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,070
have all been brought.

521
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,920
Everyone's picking through them now.

522
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,160
Xiang'er, I still have business here.

523
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,340
What business could be so urgent?

524
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,930
Let's go.

525
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,430
I...

526
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,240
Come on.

527
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,470
That damned Lang Zhusheng,

528
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,160
a pretentious scholar

529
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,030
out of nowhere,

530
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,030
made mountain out of a molehill,

531
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,490
causing such a commotion.

532
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,570
And Grandmother even tolerates him.

533
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,360
Xiangling, don't be upset.

534
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,260
Our Rong family has had a death case.

535
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,750
To quell public gossip,

536
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,090
and placate the Yangs,

537
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,590
we have to at least
make a show of cooperating.

538
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,000
Besides, Magistrate Lang

539
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,460
is only following orders.

540
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,910
Look how cautious he is being.

541
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,040
He's quite pitiful.

542
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,520
You are actually

543
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,530
speaking up for an outsider now.

544
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,760
Miss Shen,

545
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,180
the letter has been delivered to Mr. Bai.

546
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
That floral hairpin in your hair
looks pretty.

547
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,380
Come closer and let me see.

548
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,030
The pearl hairpin

549
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,430
was snatched by Yang'er.

550
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,030
I was flustered in the moment

551
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,510
and couldn't hold off so many of them.

552
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,640
So I only managed to grab this small one.

553
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,270
It's quite exquisitely made.

554
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,130
Who's Yang'er?

555
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,000
She's the needleworker

556
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
from Lady Yunxi's courtyard.

557
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,310
Three or four of them came,

558
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,890
surrounded me and wouldn't let go.

559
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,240
Tell me everything that happened today,

560
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,400
in exact detail.

561
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,930
Not a single word omitted.

562
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,640
Yes.

563
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,400
Yunshu.

564
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,930
Where are you going?

565
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
The last batch of first spring tea
has been picked.

566
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,750
All the fresh tea from every plantation

567
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,030
needs to be sent to Hualin Courtyard.

568
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,360
I'm going to check on it.

569
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,970
She went to the tea plantation.

570
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,960
I see.

571
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,110
What's going on with Yunxi's people now?

572
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,640
So many account books and letters.

573
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,540
How long will it take
to go through them all?

574
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,240
Your mistress

575
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,830
is rushed off her feet every day.

576
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,890
Look how late it is,

577
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,760
but she's still not back
from the tea plantation.

578
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,890
Just think about it.

579
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,790
Running such a large family business

580
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,650
is no easy task.

581
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,630
What's the big deal

582
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,400
about sharing a little of her burden?

583
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,160
Mr. Lu, you really care for her.

584
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,750
Look, isn't that Mr. Bai?

585
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,480
That servant leading the way

586
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,410
looks familiar.

587
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,690
Do you know him?

588
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,790
That's

589
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,470
He Si, who serves Mr. He.

590
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,370
He Xingming and Bai Yingsheng

591
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,360
are like fire and water.

592
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,890
How could they be together?

593
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,240
You didn't see wrong?

594
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,310
No mistake about it.

595
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,830
That He Si

596
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,310
loves gambling more than anything.

597
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,680
Whenever we servants
feel like a little gamble,

598
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,810
he's always around.

599
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Go quickly and see

600
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,070
if He Xingming

601
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,480
is looking to cause trouble
for Bai Yingsheng.

602
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,880
Report back to me at once.

603
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,890
I'll be right back.

604
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,520
Mr. Lu.

605
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,750
This evening, Mr. He

606
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,810
ordered a table of fine food and wine.

607
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,480
He Xingming is hosting Bai Yingsheng?

608
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,100
Now that's something new.

609
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,400
Mr. Bai, come on,

610
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,650
have some more.

611
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,050
Bring another pot of wine!

612
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,550
Mr. He.

613
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,450
It's getting late.

614
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,680
I need study later,

615
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,530
so I really can't drink anymore.

616
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,990
If you don't drink my wine,

617
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,790
it means
you're still holding a grudge against me.

618
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,590
That's not it.

619
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,340
In this world,

620
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,200
there's no one more magnanimous

621
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
than you, Mr. He.

622
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,830
I'm flattered.

623
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,270
My verbal agreement with Lady Yunshu

624
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,350
doesn't make us truly married.

625
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,270
Since I can change my betrothal
to Lady Yunxi now,

626
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,450
why don't I allow you two

627
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,640
who have feelings for each other

628
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,770
form your own match?

629
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Lady Yunxi kindly advised me today.

630
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,680
In the future, when you marry Lady Yunshu,

631
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,400
we'll become brothers-in-law!

632
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,070
Both under the Rong roof,

633
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,480
we're bound to help each other out.

634
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,930
Why be enemies?

635
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,850
Mr. He,

636
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,230
a true gentleman indeed.

637
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,160
But I really

638
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,290
have something to do later,

639
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,950
because I have an appointment

640
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,020
with Lady Yunshu.

641
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,360
Alright.

642
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,860
I won't delay your
important business.

643
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,820
Let's have three more drinks.

644
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,690
From now on,

645
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,350
let's put our grudges behind us

646
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,140
and renew our friendship.

647
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,640
Lady Yunwan, don't be upset anymore.

648
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,700
Look at what I have.

649
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,030
I don't want it.

650
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,920
I only want Mrs. Liang!

651
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,160
I only want Mrs. Liang!

652
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,960
Lady Yunwan,

653
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,720
these are all specially

654
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,030
found for you by Miss Rong.

655
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,510
Let's stop making a fuss, shall we?

656
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,440
No more fussing.

657
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,240
Lady Yunwan, it's alright.

658
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,590
Mrs. Liang will come back.

659
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,170
Well...

660
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,740
isn't that nice?

661
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,990
How could you break

662
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,480
the teacups given by Lady Rong!

663
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,240
You were the one who broke them.

664
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,500
Enough, stop arguing.

665
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,360
What's happening outside?

666
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,210
Move aside.

667
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,110
When I was going to get bird's nest soup
for Lady Yunwan,

668
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,680
I saw two women

669
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,000
arguing in the kitchen.

670
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,200
I tried to reason with them,

671
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,750
but they started fighting instead.

672
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,400
Just look!

673
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,440
I was just trying to separate them,

674
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,040
and they even pulled my hair!

675
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Go check quickly.

676
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,370
With that sharp tongue of yours,

677
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,830
you always pour oil on the fire.

678
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,080
Miss Rong will be back soon.

679
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,590
What will happen if she finds out?

680
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,920
You stay here

681
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,780
and take good care of Lady Yunwan.

682
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,890
It's scalding!

683
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,350
Go get a cooling fan.

684
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,680
A cooling fan?

685
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,030
Don't you know what a cooling fan is?

686
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,020
Mrs. Qiu put them away.

687
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
Go ask her for one.

688
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,510
Yes.

689
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,970
Lady Yunwan?

690
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,040
Lady Yunwan?

691
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,750
If you eat it up,

692
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,720
I'll take you to see Mrs. Liang.

693
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,580
How about that?

694
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,510
Really?

695
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,240
Mr. Bai?

696
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,640
Mr. Bai?

697
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,810
Idiot.

698
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,590
Time to make our move.

699
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,159
Let's go.

700
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,310
Lady Yunwan,

701
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,590
Mrs. Liang is waiting for you there.

702
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,920
Didn't you two used to

703
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,360
play hide-and-seek here?

704
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,090
Hurry up now.

705
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,710
Mrs. Liang?

706
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,960
Lady Yunwan.

707
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,280
Lady Yunwan.

708
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,610
Who's there?

709
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,240
Who is it?

710
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,510
Stop!

711
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,150
Help! Someone help!

712
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,550
Go!

713
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,070
Lady Yunwan. Lady Yunwan.

714
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,590
Come and help quickly!

715
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,510
Help!

716
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,920
Save Lady Yunwan!

717
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,320
Lady Yunwan!

718
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,550
Lady Yunwan!

719
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,150
Hurry to Chongxi Hall
and inform Lady Rong!

720
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,150
Something terrible
has happened to Lady Yunwan!

721
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,670
Go now!

722
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,940
-Go!
-Yes.

723
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,640
Let's go!

724
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,920
Lady Yunwan!

725
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,920
Lady Rong!

726
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,880
Lady Rong!

727
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,800
Lady Rong!

728
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,840
Lady Yunwan is gone.

729
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,710
Mr. Bai!

730
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,550
Mr. Bai! Wake up!

731
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,220
Bai Yingsheng!

732
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,150
Bai Yingsheng! Wake up now!

733
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,430
Pull yourself together!

734
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,430
Wake up right now!

735
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,230
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

736
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,070
Miss Rong is surrounded in the garden!

737
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,600
Lady Rong has been alerted.

738
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,500
You stay and watch him.

739
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,410
I'll go check the garden first.

740
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:22,800
Yes.

741
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,200
Grandmother!

742
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,350
Enough! This is no time for that.

743
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,440
Go quickly and see what's happening.

744
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,240
As soon as I got the news,

745
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,510
I was shocked to my core,

746
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,920
completely beside myself.

747
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,120
Only upon seeing you have I calmed down.

748
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,150
The garden is slippery.

749
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,480
Please watch your step.

750
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,070
The Rong family now

751
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,470
depends entirely on you.

752
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,230
Wanwan!

753
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,760
Wanwan!

754
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,480
Wanwan!

755
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,440
Wanwan!

756
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,460
Wanwan!

757
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,580
Miss Rong!

758
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,620
Lady Rong has arrived.

759
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,670
Grandmother, I just arrived home

760
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,620
when I heard

761
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,670
about Wanwan...

762
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,230
Lady Rong,

763
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,710
Mrs. Liang who served Lady Yunwan

764
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,120
fell ill and returned to her hometown.

765
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,710
Lady Yunwan missed her too much,

766
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,280
so she went to their

767
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,880
old play spot to look for her.

768
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,690
By the time we maids found her,

769
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,790
Lady Yunwan had fallen into

770
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,440
the large vat normally used

771
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,650
for collecting rainwater

772
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,380
and drowned.

773
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,180
The wicked live a thousand years.

774
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,650
How could she be dead?

775
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,760
Is she really dead?

776
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,410
I don't believe it.

777
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,880
I need to see for myself.

778
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,710
No matter how much you resent Wanwan,

779
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,840
she's already dead.

780
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,590
Can't you let her

781
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,880
rest in peace?

782
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,840
Quickly pull Lady Yunyin away!

783
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,160
Yunyin, Grandmother is grieving.

784
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,620
Please don't make a scene.

785
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,360
I know you sisters can't bear
to part with Yunwan,

786
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,000
but don't forget

787
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,750
the old rules of the Rong family.

788
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,810
Women shouldn't be involved in this.

789
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,110
Right.

790
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,260
I forgot in the confusion.

791
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,920
Wanwan's face looks terrible.

792
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,030
I wouldn't dare disturb you, Grandmother.

793
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,190
Better take her away.

794
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,240
Is everyone in Hualin Courtyard dead?

795
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,150
Grandmother entrusted Yunwan to you.

796
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:27,960
Why did you let her

797
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,820
run here alone?

798
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,430
Where were the people
supposed to be with her?

799
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,760
I know she was born

800
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,480
afflicted.

801
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,990
She'd caused so much annoyance to others.

802
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,590
Some have long wished for her death

803
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,920
to be rid of this burden.

804
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,760
It's my fault.

805
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,940
Had I known this would happen,

806
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,110
I should have kept Yunwan

807
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,240
in my own courtyard.

808
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,230
Day and night,

809
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,970
I would have watched over her myself.

810
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:47,710
I would never have let her

811
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,710
go alone, so desolate and wretched.

812
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,840
Grandmother, my poor Yunwan.

813
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,550
She was so young.

814
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,230
These people

815
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,920
have such cruel hearts.

816
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,360
You claim to care so much for Yunwan,

817
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,800
but in the past year,

818
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,600
you never visited her even once.

819
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,670
Yunwan's drowning

820
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,530
was something no one could have foreseen.

821
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,670
Shanbao was at the tea plantation.

822
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,280
She can't be in two places at once.

823
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,960
You can blame the servants for negligence,

824
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,800
so be it.

825
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,630
But is this insinuation,

826
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,880
necessary here?

827
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,400
You,

828
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,150
Xiangling.

829
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
Yun'e is just heartbroken about Yunwan.

830
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,250
She's flustered

831
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,670
and misspoke.

832
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,880
Shanbao will understand.

833
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,500
But tonight,

834
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,070
who was on duty?

835
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,310
How could such a lapse occur?

836
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,360
They must not go unpunished.

837
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,840
Lady Rong.

838
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,370
I was on watch tonight.

839
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,000
Everything is my fault.

840
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,710
I accept whatever punishment you deem fit.

841
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,190
You will be punished, of course.

842
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,320
Stand aside for now.

843
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,570
Where are tonight's patrollers?

844
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,800
Your Ladyship,

845
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,710
when the two of us

846
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,010
were patrolling near the east corner gate,

847
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,550
we glimpsed a figure in the darkness,

848
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,880
dressed like a scholar.

849
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,550
His silhouette looked very familiar.

850
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,150
He was hurrying away,

851
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,320
coming out from the side gate.

852
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,760
The more we called out,
the faster he fled.

853
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
We were about to chase after him

854
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,030
when we heard commotion in the garden

855
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,320
and couldn't pursue him further.

856
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,510
Did you get a clear look?

857
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,440
Who it was?

858
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,550
I recognized him.

859
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,130
It was Mr. Bai from Xinfang Pavilion.

860
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,040
Miss Rong.

861
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,590
Go bring him here.

862
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,590
Yes.

863
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:19,840
Fusheng.

864
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,960
Yunwan

865
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,070
was murdered.

866
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,640
Go.

867
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,650
Go.

868
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,890
Steward Cheng.

869
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,690
What has happened?

870
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,770
Nothing serious.

871
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,050
Lady Rong wishes to speak with Mr. Bai.

872
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,970
Everyone should return first.

873
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,450
Don't wander around tonight.

874
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,020
The Rong family is truly
going through difficult times.

875
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,910
One disaster follows another.

876
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:26,780
Mr. Yan.

877
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,150
Indeed.

878
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,960
Since ancient times,
fortune rarely comes in pairs,

879
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,380
but misfortune never travels alone.

880
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,780
Too much comfort always leads to calamity.

881
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,560
However, Miss Rong

882
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,220
is blessed with good fortune.

883
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,400
She'll certainly get through this safely.

884
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,770
Lady Rong, Mr. Bai's here.

885
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,350
Was it you who killed my granddaughter?

[Five Poisons and Fortune Pattern]

887
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,190
I wonder if the owner of those shoes

888

is found.

889

shoes with phoenix or flower designs
on the sole are common,

891

but those carved with
the Five Poisons are rare.

892
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,840
They're more like what's used
during the Dragon Boat Festival

893
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,360
to ward off evil.

894
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,670
In ancient times, people believed

895
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:02,630
the Fifth Lunar Month was a poisonous one,

896
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,710
when insects multiplied
and diseases spread easily.

897
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,530
To help children
safely get through summer,

898
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,230
people commonly had children wear

899
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,280

symbolizing
fighting poison with poison for safety.

904

They also wore
five-colored thread bracelets.

905
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,880
These five colors
correspond to the Five Elements:

Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water.

907
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,300
Ancient people believed

908
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,550
they could balance yin and yang,

909
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,500
prevent illness and extend life,

Besides the Dragon Boat Festival's
Five Poisons patterns,

there were also some

00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,480

aspiration for a better life.
