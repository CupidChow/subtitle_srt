1
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:27,330
In the bumpy train.

2
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,905
Teacher Intern - Gang Rape

3
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:36,575
Three years ago.

4
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:05,670
You pervert.

5
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:09,072
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:14,011
Someone touched me.

7
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,220
I'm a pervert?

8
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,949
How could I have touched you with
all these in my hand?

9
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:24,063
Who do you think you are?

10
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,928
I couldn�t have touched her.

11
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,059
You're imagining things.

12
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:04,897
I still haven't forgotten
that incident till this day.

13
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:10,437
I dared not ride on trains
from then on.

14
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,275
However, I can't help it.

15
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,743
Perverts wouldn�t stop
harassing me.

16
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,518
I was delighted when the

17
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:24,283
''women only'' carriage
was implemented.

18
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:31,022
But now I've to take the
normal trains again.

19
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:37,597
And, perverts aren't the
only annoying things.

20
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,143
There he is.

21
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:40,760
Here comes another boring day.

22
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,395
I've started my teacher internship
last week.

23
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,373
I chose to be a teacher
because I went with the flow.

24
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:54,269
I'm regretting it now.

25
00:03:56,082 --> 00:04:01,952
The bad students
are putting me off.

26
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:43,854
I was going to return home
to teach at a high school.

27
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,928
But my alma mater

28
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:50,426
was closed after it
merged with another school.

29
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:54,741
and I was recommended
by my professor

30
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:58,074
for a 2-week internship.

31
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:02,138
I started my first day last week.

32
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:05,445
I'd rather train monkeys than

33
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,120
teach these students.

34
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,635
This Lady is too much.

35
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:29,041
It's awesome.

36
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:41,852
You're pretty good, Fuji.

37
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,718
You got that.

38
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,224
What are you going to do with it?

39
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:55,558
Can't you tell?

40
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,262
He's going to do that again.

41
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,243
Of course...

42
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,370
You don't want it anymore?

43
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,757
Right here.

44
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,481
I'm coming.

45
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,517
Come.

46
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,920
He's the principal�s grandson.

47
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:30,028
Teachers dare not report him.

48
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,121
He's too much.

49
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:36,031
This is the way
private schools work.

50
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:41,237
The other kids follow him around
Like his little soldiers

51
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,668
and cause trouble.

52
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,475
And they do some mean things.

53
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:52,917
Well that's better than
school violence.

54
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:55,820
Bear with it,
it's only two weeks.

55
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:02,588
It's not easy to
get this internship.

56
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,754
I'm just complaining.
I'll do my best.

57
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:12,004
Since I've accepted the internship

58
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,932
I have to try my best

59
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:19,168
though I've no idea
where to begin.

60
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,277
That's my girl.

61
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,183
Is there any teachers
you can talk to?

62
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:47,965
I'm not as motivated as
what Akira thinks.

63
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,840
I joined the internship because

64
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:55,106
because my parents are
teachers too.

65
00:13:56,115 --> 00:14:00,245
That's why I've always wanted
to be a teacher.

66
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,752
However,
after I came to Tokyo,

67
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:07,994
My ambition has faded.

68
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,621
I can't help it.

69
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,992
There're too much
distractions here.

70
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,499
After I started
teaching in this school

71
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,142
I feel Like I don't actually
have to be a teacher.

72
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:29,578
But I can't continue my studies
without doing this.

73
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:35,420
I really regret coming here.

74
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,249
I can't carry on Like this.

75
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:01,344
Good morning...

76
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,538
Miss Meisei.

77
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,708
What's happened?

78
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,262
So what if he's the
principal�s grandson?

79
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,468
He can't interrupt the class
Like that right?

80
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:34,069
And he's causing trouble
all the time.

81
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,015
I know that
but we have no choice.

82
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,980
What do you mean?

83
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:49,225
Though he's a trouble maker,

84
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,694
he hasn't got into fights

85
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,892
and he's got good grades.

86
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,699
He's got good grades
without cheating in his tests.

87
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,397
Like what you said,

88
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,603
I've seen his grades during the
last semester

89
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,235
that's why I can't forgive him.

90
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,511
Why can't we have class in peace?

91
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,944
If we were to punish him,

92
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,182
the entire school
will be affected.

93
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:23,061
No one would do anything if
it isn't something high profile.

94
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,826
Even so,

95
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,661
I'm sure
he�ll destroy the evidence.

96
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,267
The principal will definitely
cover up for him.

97
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,374
I'm sorry.
I can't give you any advice.

98
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,168
Don't worry about it.

99
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,975
Thanks for Listening to me.

100
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:47,508
Bear with it.
They are only high school kids.

101
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,921
You�ll never know.

102
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:52,185
They may cry on your last day!

103
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:55,158
Goodbye.

104
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,840
Two more weeks to go.

105
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,597
Quiet class!

106
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,601
Please lower your volume!

107
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,356
I've been here for a week

108
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,924
and I don't know about other class.

109
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:07,259
But I'm very disappointed with
all of you.

110
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:12,429
I've heard that many of you
want to further your studies.

111
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,640
But I already have an idea of

112
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,844
how you will end up.

113
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,242
Shut up.

114
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,613
No one cares about what you think.

115
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,689
Nobody cares.

116
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,822
It doesn't matter.

117
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:45,768
I'll accept your criticism.

118
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:51,172
I'll continue to do my job

119
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:56,412
and finish my
two-week internship.

120
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:15,799
I won't care if you absent
from my class today.

121
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,165
That's Miss Takara.

122
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,805
Good morning...

123
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:53,865
I haven't seen Miss Takara
next door

124
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,797
on the train before.

125
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,937
Use your tongue properly.

126
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,877
Just Like what you did
to your affair.

127
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:51,446
Hurry up.

128
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:52,745
I'm next.

129
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,510
Hurry, we're going to be late.

130
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,686
So what?

131
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:05,454
What are you looking at?

132
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:16,602
Good morning.

133
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,605
Good morning.

134
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,563
Excuse me...

135
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:45,093
What is it?

136
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:49,236
I have something I'd Like to
discuss with you.

137
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,371
Are you free for lunch?

138
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:34,786
It's really unbelievable.

139
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:37,017
It's real.

140
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:41,249
I'm really shocked
because I know her.

141
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,622
What should I do, Miss Meisei?

142
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:57,473
Don't worry,
I'll ask Fuji about it.

143
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,471
We can't let him carry on Like this.

144
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,578
Give me sometime.

145
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,987
I'm sorry about that.
Thank you.

146
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,658
I don't have a
good feeling about this.

147
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:33,861
He's a trouble maker,

148
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,476
and he's going overboard.
It's a crime.

149
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,045
Can I come in?

150
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:48,543
No, I'm almost done.

151
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:51,583
I'm coming in.

152
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,396
What's up with you?

153
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,043
I said no.

154
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:53,184
Seems Like
you've gone overboard.

155
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:57,950
Aren't you afraid that woman
would call the cops?

156
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:05,397
Don't worry, I have proof
of her affair.

157
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:12,240
You let her see you on purpose.

158
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:17,209
You were on the same train.

159
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:25,851
It doesn't seem Like you.
Seems Like she matters to you.

160
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,816
I don't care about her.

161
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,424
If you say rubbish again,
I'll punish you.

162
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:39,835
I'm so scared.

163
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,299
You've got to know when to stop.

164
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,745
She's quite persistent.

165
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,202
Hi, Takara speaking.

166
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,845
Okay.

167
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:28,819
I can't do that.

168
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:35,885
You're making me very scared.

169
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:40,092
Please forgive me.

170
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:16,307
Miss Takara, what are you doing?

171
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:23,312
Why did you do that?

172
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:46,308
Fuji, it's you.

173
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:49,210
You forced her to do it,
didn't you?

174
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:29,709
Miss Morisaki, what happened?

175
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,969
It's troublesome.

176
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:08,538
I can't forgive him.

177
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:10,981
Absolutely can't!

178
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:04,466
Miss Takara,
it's me, Morisaki.

179
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,506
I'd Like to talk to you.
Please open up.

180
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:43,506
Miss Takara. Please open up.

181
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:13,870
Miss Takara, I'll come back.

182
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,433
I've something to ask you.

183
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:37,123
I'm sorry...

184
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:54,401
What's your problem?
I'm busy.

185
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:59,644
Fuji. Tell me why you did that.

186
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:02,850
Why did you do that to me?

187
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,145
Why did you make Miss Takara...

188
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:11,218
You're trying to frighten me?

189
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,491
Watch your limits.

190
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:21,998
Mind your own business and
return to university.

191
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,370
Mind my own business?
Your actions are disturbing.

192
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,581
This is a game. A game.

193
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:35,211
I play games because I'm bored.

194
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,331
Get out of my way.

195
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,185
What did she say?

196
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,788
Nothing much.

197
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:28,863
Is it something serious?

198
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:42,083
What is it?

199
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:47,887
Do you want to go to my room
if you want to do this?

200
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,184
It hurts.

201
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:46,909
I'm Morisaki.

202
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:50,173
Please don't hang up.

203
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:54,641
I'd Like to meet you in person.

204
00:47:56,053 --> 00:48:00,820
Please understand that
I'm not finding fault with you.

205
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:05,894
I just want to know
what this is about.

206
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:11,465
You don't want it to continue
Like that, do you?

207
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,119
I'm sorry.

208
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:15,161
It's all my fault.

209
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:19,035
Miss Takara.

210
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,838
What do you say that?

211
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:08,143
I'm responsible for this.

212
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:12,686
I was just fooling around.

213
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,491
This was the only time.
I didn't know...

214
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:42,114
Isn't this from
a hidden camera?

215
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:57,460
The students put the videocam
in the hotel room first.

216
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,530
And the followed me.

217
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:06,108
I got this a week later.

218
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:38,163
This is why you molested me.

219
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:45,138
I'm afraid that my husband
would find out about this

220
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,614
and I'm scared that they would
show it to my neighbors.

221
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:59,793
Therefore,
I dared not refuse them.

222
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:05,999
But this is a crime. Why didn't
you report to the police?

223
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:14,339
It was bad enough
that I was in it.

224
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:21,049
Now I've dragged you into it.

225
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:26,986
I'm very sorry.

226
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:31,861
I'm really very sorry.

227
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:54,244
I can't forgive those kids.

228
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:57,783
They shouldn�t be doing that.

229
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:00,518
They went way overboard.

230
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:06,356
But I really can't do anything.

231
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:10,957
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

232
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:17,165
Don't worry. Thanks for telling me the truth.

233
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:21,643
I'm not going to
tell anyone about this.

234
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:39,723
Though I don't know what
you're going to do,

235
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:44,499
it doesn't matter if
my husband finds out.

236
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:48,237
I was wrong.

237
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:51,164
Miss Takara.

238
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:57,669
I'm mentally prepared.

239
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:02,315
I can't stand it anymore.

240
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:06,856
I can't let them
control me anymore.

241
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:34,242
I can't stand it any longer.

242
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:43,092
You're right.

243
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:47,455
Ayame, what are your plans?

244
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,328
I've an idea.

245
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:59,441
But I don't know if
they will fall for it.

246
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:02,212
Can you do it by yourself, Ayame?

247
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,237
You�ll never know
what they�ll do to you.

248
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:08,440
You know what I'm Like.

249
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:11,749
I hate giving up.

250
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:18,787
Their actions can't be forgiven.

251
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:22,264
Ayame.

252
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:46,377
Teach, we're busy.

253
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:54,521
I've learnt from Miss Takara

254
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,057
about your blackmail.

255
00:55:57,534 --> 00:56:00,503
Blackmail? It sounds pretty bad.

256
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:02,636
We're all wlling.

257
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,734
You are despicable.

258
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,440
It's so cheap of you
to videotape her.

259
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:12,814
She's wrong in the first place.
She's an affair.

260
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:17,013
It's none of your business
even if she does.

261
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:21,650
And yet you videotaped her
and used it to blackmail her.

262
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:26,795
Do you know that it's a crime?

263
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:39,966
Looks Like someone
doesn't agree with us.

264
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:49,280
Let me go. This is a school!

265
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:51,678
What are you doing?

266
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:54,023
What do you want us
to do to you?

267
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,486
You want it here?

268
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,090
Or do you want to go to the hotel?

269
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:00,994
Fuji, you're too much,
aren't you?

270
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,568
You fool, shut up.

271
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,295
What are you afraid of?

272
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:48,602
Taichi, if you don't want to
do this, go keep a watch.

273
00:58:32,189 --> 00:58:34,714
You must have a lot of sex
in the university.

274
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:41,194
Teach, when was your first time?

275
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:45,001
Judging from you expressions,
you're quite experienced.

276
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:47,731
Have you had a threesome before?

277
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:51,864
Teach, you can't

278
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:54,103
That's right. That's it.

279
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:57,344
Stop it.

280
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:44,888
No one would know about this.

281
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,324
It will stay in the school.

282
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:54,335
Let me go. I don't want.

283
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:07,976
No...

284
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:23,825
Hey, you're in good form.

285
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:13,069
Taichi, are you going to betray us?

286
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,108
We've been good friends

287
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:18,740
but you've gone too far
this time.

288
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:28,515
Fuji, let me go.
This is way overboard.

289
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:35,431
Teach, he's a poor thing.

290
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,630
His mother dumped him
after she had a new boyfriend.

291
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:42,331
Teach, console him.

292
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:57,112
Taichi, you're pathetic.

293
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:59,255
You still can't get it up.

294
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:30,216
Come on, Teach.
Use your back.

295
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:35,553
Taichi, you can come inside.

296
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:37,159
You don't have to hold it.

297
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,316
I'm sorry.

298
01:05:56,299 --> 01:06:01,168
According to investigation,
Teen A and his friends

299
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:07,010
alleged to have locked
an intern teacher,

300
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:10,707
Miss M in a classroom

301
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,681
and gang raped her.

302
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:18,014
It's reported that Teen A is

303
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:21,054
the principal�s...

304
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:42,078
Is that what you called
the best solution?

305
01:06:46,983 --> 01:06:49,451
It wasn't the best solution

306
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,855
but I'll won't regret.

307
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:57,321
Really?

308
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:03,829
But I can't accept this.

309
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,096
Please give me some time.

310
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:12,566
No worries. It's normal.

311
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,177
You've helped me a lot, Akira.

312
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:24,181
Thank you so much.

313
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:03,677
Is it a gain or total Loss?

314
01:09:04,654 --> 01:09:08,590
Will I find the answer?

315
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:11,924
It's hard to find a perfect reason

316
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:15,294
for everything a person does.

317
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:19,126
I know it's almost impossible

318
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,702
to find someone who could
understand my actions.

319
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:25,639
But, I won't regret.

320
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:30,703
This is a solution
I come up with.

321
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,349
If it's possible,

322
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:37,244
I'd Like to continue
to be a teacher

323
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:42,013
and not be affected by anyone.

324
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:46,059
This is my decision.
