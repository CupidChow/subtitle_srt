19

181
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:01,033
So, why steal clients from friends?

182
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,533
- Okay.
- You'll see each other soon in hell.

183
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,233
Is Park dead, too?

184
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,567
You must have a specific
goal for you to go this far.

185
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,200
My goal? To become famous.

186
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,167
This is where sensitive
nerves are. You like that?

187
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,033
Please, spare me...

188
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,451
That, I can't do.

189
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:27,729
All I know is to kill slowly...

190
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,008
and painfully.

191
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:09,212
Where did he go?

192
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,350
What the...

193
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,675
Stop!

194
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,233
Okay! Stop!

195
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,733
You've trespassed. This is my turf.

196
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,700
Just as bold as I had heard.

197
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,733
You've heard of me?

198
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,500
An from Banpo, Yoon from Dongtan.

199
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
And even Gu, today.

200
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,767
Aren't you wasting your
skills on silly street fights?

201
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,500
So, you're a stalker fan?

202
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,967
Farewell.

203
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,800
Hold on!

204
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,967
Wait, hold on!

205
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's talk, okay?

206
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,533
Let's settle with this.

207
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,367
Are you sure? I don't go for cheap.

208
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,300
- I said no. Why do you keep doing this?
- Why not?

209
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,967
You know he's a disgusting pest.

210
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,567
So, why say no?

211
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,733
I know what you mean, but
you've got the wrong place.

212
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,267
I'll do whatever you say.

213
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:56,400
- Please kill him.
- You need to leave, now.

214
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,200
I can't.

215
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,267
I have to kill that
bastard, Han Seong-do.

216
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,867
I can't leave... My poor son...

217
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,767
Have you had something to eat?

218
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,600
If not, join us.

219
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,667
Isn't this a hassle?

220
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,067
It's easier to use the app.

221
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,767
You're the only one who does this.

222
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,067
This is going to take forever.

223
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,430
<i>Declined</i>

224
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,267
You cleaned it all up, right?

225
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,900
Any cameras or witnesses?

226
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,133
I mean,

227
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:12,233
I don't get why the client
asked us to kill him

228
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:15,400
- in such a crowded place.
- Don't worry.

229
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,467
I'll leave before I become useless.

230
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,900
I didn't mean that.

231
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,567
Is this about the woman out there?

232
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,767
It's nothing.

233
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,633
It's a woman named Madam Hong.

234
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:32,900
Her son's girlfriend
fell victim to druggies.

235
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,233
She died of an overdose.

236
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,000
<i>The son barged in, got pounded,
and now he's in a coma.</i>

237
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,467
I get why she's so upset.

238
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,000
But it's a tricky case,
so Sohn declined.

239
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,467
Satisfied?

240
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:50,267
By the way, I booked you a health
exam at Dr. Chang's hospital.

241
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,067
Mr. Sohn's orders.

242
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,433
You were showing off.

243
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:02,133
As if you wanted someone
to acknowledge you.

244
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:06,267
You chase after targets
and pressure them

245
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,433
until they're about to turn crazy,

246
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,867
then kill them in the most
painful way possible.

247
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,633
And that's why you're called Bullfight.

248
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,400
Enough with the crap. Get to the point.

249
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,667
Instead of those useless,
meaningless jobs,

250
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:25,000
join us in the good
cause of pest control.

251
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,467
Pest control?

252
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,967
To kill off insects?

253
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,633
Exactly. The cockroaches
of our society.

254
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,967
We seek to exterminate them

255
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,633
and save people from suffering.

256
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,733
Goodness.

257
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,833
Is this a house of salvation?

258
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,400
Come on.

259
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
You can't just leave.

260
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,567
You prick!

261
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,333
Then I'll kill you and leave.

262
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,767
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

263
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:04,400
Bullfight, you can't do this here.

264
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:12,767
I get that this place is serious.

265
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,300
He was just kidding around.

266
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,167
Cut him some slack.

267
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,633
Watch who you hire.

268
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>There's a lot of protein precipitate
in your cerebrospinal fluid.</i>

269
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,067
Any hand or foot tremors lately?

270
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,400
No, not at all.

271
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,167
Here, the color shows

272
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,833
significant degeneration.

273
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,933
Don't tell the agency for now.

274
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:02,100
I can't do that.

275
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,567
Then today will be the
last time I see you.

276
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,767
What's your next mission?

277
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,233
You have to take it easy.

278
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:21,533
Have I ever taken it easy?

279
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,733
That damn old coot.

280
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,867
Where did he hide it?

281
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,342
For goodness' sake!

282
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:37,734
Can't you stuff your face
without being so damn loud?

283
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:38,992
This smell.

284
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,458
I'm sick of it!

285
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:43,154
Why bother living?

286
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,833
Why is this disconnected?

287
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,300
Who are you?

288
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,500
What do you want?

289
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,300
I'll do whatever you ask.

290
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,967
I'm sure those old folks did
whatever you asked, too.

291
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,667
So, why did you kill them?

292
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,267
You mean Granny Park?

293
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,433
Come on, sir.

294
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:11,400
They let me go without any charges.

295
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,633
You'll wish that they hadn't.

296
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,167
Start the car.

297
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,167
<i>Silver Life Care Center</i>

298
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,333
Dad!

299
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:59,233
- Dad!
- Eun-ho.

300
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,500
It wasn't me.

301
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,967
Eun-ho, it wasn't me!

302
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,267
What's with you?

303
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,067
Come on, stay still.

304
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:03,033
Don't look at me like that. You
forget things when you're old.

305
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:08,500
<i>A woman in her forties
died in this accident.</i>

306
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,967
<i>According to witnesses,</i>

307
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:16,000
<i>a prospective suspect was seen near
the vehicle just before the accident.</i>

308
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,667
<i>The suspect parked the
car at this intersection</i>

309
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:23,300
<i>and left the victim in the car,
aware of the approaching train.</i>

310
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,633
<i>- The suspect chased after the witness</i>
- Crazy world, right?

311
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,133
<i>up to a nearby police
station and then ran away.</i>

312
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:31,533
<i>The police are suspecting this
to be a cover-up suicide case</i>

313
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,167
<i>and are looking for the suspect,</i>

314
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:37,767
<i>- who is a male in his mid-fifties.</i>
- Have a nice day.

315
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,100
You're ten minutes early.

316
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,100
I work on a timely schedule.

317
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,233
Did your boss not train you?

318
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:57,333
How rude. So...

319
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,767
What the...

320
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:23,798
<i>Staged Train Accident,
Police Hunting Down Killer</i>

321
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:27,833
How shameful, for someone
who's been so dedicated...

322
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,567
It's not easy for me either.

323
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:32,800
But a single stone can
flip over a whole car.

324
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,233
<i>Rules are rules.</i>

325
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:37,633
<i>- I'll send someone.</i>
- No, I'll do it.

326
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,433
You, Godmother?

327
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:46,500
Well, I'd be grateful, but...

328
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,133
<i>Where will you find him?</i>

329
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,433
It's obvious where he'll go.

330
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,800
Old people need a lot of care.

331
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,467
Will it be okay?

332
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,000
You know,

333
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,633
"the weight of time."

334
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,133
You're back.

335
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:14,000
How was it? Did it go well?

336
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,800
Well, I got rid of your headache.

337
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,833
But I guess you weren't waiting for me.

338
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,633
Oh, what the...

339
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,967
What's this?

340
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:28,133
We asked for the ring, not his fingers.

341
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,133
Check if I got all 28 pieces.

342
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,900
Mr. Sohn.

343
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,833
Could I have a word with you?

344
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:53,167
You here for me, Godmother?

345
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
What an honor.

346
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,700
What happened?

347
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,967
I saw Eun-ho.

348
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:05,133
She died. Ten years ago.

349
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:12,733
If only she hadn't met
that damned preacher...

350
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,300
I wouldn't have had so much rage.

351
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,367
Then perhaps my life
could have been different.

352
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,133
You walked the path given to you.

353
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,700
There's nothing more to life and death.

354
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,800
Just leave, please!

355
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:01,767
Kill me before you go.

356
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,867
You think I can't?

357
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,800
You think I can't kill you?

358
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,067
I told you to stay calm.

359
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,467
- Or you can't see clearly.
- Don't you get it?

360
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,667
Not everyone can live
as heartlessly as you.

361
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,467
You ruined the mission
because of your feelings.

362
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:47,933
By the rules, you must die.

363
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,900
This was going to be my last mission.

364
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,200
I was going to grow some flowers
and open a fried chicken place.

365
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,033
So...

366
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,767
You two bore me to death.

367
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,400
Who are you?

368
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,233
Who the heck are you?

369
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,733
We've met before.

370
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,067
Move.

371
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,233
This is my job.

372
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,967
But it's mine, too.

373
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,800
Did Sohn send you?

374
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,567
If you had handled your job properly,
I wouldn't have had to come.

375
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:37,167
So much for being a legend.

376
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,267
Hair turning white, and wrinkles, too.

377
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,733
Getting so old already?

378
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,167
Shut up.

379
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,933
I don't need any backup.

380
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:52,167
Then finish this.

381
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,133
Since it's your job.

382
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,500
They say that when it's time...

383
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,967
those you miss come out to greet you.

384
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:05,300
I think my daughter was there...

385
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,467
to tell me it's time.

386
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,800
That I've done enough.

387
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
She was there to greet me.

388
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:01,965

389
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,599
<i>The person you are calling

390
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:20,763
Sir, she's still not picking up.

391
00:35:21,017 --> 00:35:22,821
- Let's go back.
- No, we'll finish the job.

392
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,767
What if something's wrong?

393
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,300
Nobody's answered at home all day.

394

<i>Emergency Medical Center</i>

395
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:32,500
I told you, no excuses are
allowed at the edge of your knife.

396
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,033
- No matter who you face.
- No matter who you face.

397
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,633

open up to other people's stories?

398
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,067
Remember.

399
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,667
Don't shoot a butterfly with a gun.

400
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,133
What the hell?

401
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,433
Let's go now.

402
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:28,100
Don't move. I barely patched it...

403
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,933
What are you up to?

404
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:34,767
I heard a screech

405
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:37,600
and noticed a car on
the side of the road.

406
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,667
I peeked in and found you there.

407
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:45,067
You refused to go to the
hospital, then passed out.

408
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,667
It's an 8-cm lacerated wound,
including a cut to your right lat.

409
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:54,533
It barely missed your organs,
which is why you survived.

410
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,667
Forgive me for cutting your clothes
off. They were drenched in blood.

411
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,700
Where's my stuff?

412
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,690
I kept them safe.

413
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,667
You shouldn't do this.
You already bled too much.

414
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,701
Oh my. Bear with me.

415
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,700
What happened today...

416
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,333
Everyone has their own story.

417
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,000
Put this on before the nurses arrive.

418
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,967
I'll pack you some meds.

419
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,533
You're late.

420
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,267
You sent a backup.

421
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,433
Why?

422
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,433
You don't trust me?

423
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:01,267
The tide is high,

424
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,500
and I can't have you swept away.

425
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,900
You're a great asset to this agency.

426
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,133
Why is this knife so dull?

427
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:23,267
It may look dull...

428
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:33,067
But it's still plenty useful.

429
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,267
Right.

430
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:38,900
By the looks of it,

431
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,967
you picked up random strays
and gave them all kinds of jobs.

432
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:47,367
But our job is sacred,
eradicating malignant vermin.

433
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:50,300
For instance,
pest-controlling those druggies

434
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,867
who scammed a naive kid
and drove her to her death.

435
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:58,100
The jobs you've been rejecting are
what we're supposed to be doing.

436
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:02,533
Jeez, you're so frustrating.

437
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,367
Those druggies are pretty
much like the mafia.

438
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:07,600
One bite and we're dead, like
eating toxins in a blow fish.

439
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,633
What do you want me to do?

440
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,700
How convenient, cherry-picking jobs.

441
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,033
It's my authority.

442
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,033
And authority comes
with responsibility.

443
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,967
Then try it yourself!

444
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,933
Sure, why not?

445
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,700
And about Bullfight,

446
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,067
he has a clean background
with great skills.

447
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:34,700
Accept him as one of us and
cook him a meal sometime.

448
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,133
Your father looks so
young in that picture.

449
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:41,300
Were you in diapers then?

450
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,667
Right!

451
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:46,233
You were in your prime, too!

452
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,333
What's the rush?
Hang around a bit more.

453
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:06,167
Why don't you grow out your nails?

454
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:09,433
What?

455
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:13,000
They used to be fancy.
Try painting them.

456
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,467
Why?

457
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:19,700
You want me to rip off your face?

458
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,967
You have something
to do before that, no?

459
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:32,500
<i>You got your wounds treated like a dog.</i>

460
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,333

461
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,200
<i>you left a witness.</i>

462
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:41,867
If the agency knew, wouldn't
you end up like Gadget?

463
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:48,733

464
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:53,433
You do? Me?

465
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:55,000
I do.

466
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,133
A brat with a death wish.

467
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,500
Right.

468
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,500
You may be past your prime, but I
heard whoever crosses you is dead.

469
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,100
I know many specialists look up to you.

470
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:15,767
Then stay out of my sight, okay?

471
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:17,867

What happened?

522

Her surgery went wrong,

523
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,000
so she spent five years on
a sickbed and then left us.

protesting alone for years,

527

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,267
- I missed you.
- Hold on, Hae-ni.

541
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,700
Ma'am!

542
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:08,467
Ma'am!

543
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,067
Why did you come?

544
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:29,967
My family has nothing
to do with anything.

545
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,500
Why?

546
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,400
What?

547
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,100
You saw what I carry around.

548
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,167
But you're a good person.

549
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:43,400
You saved a stray dog.

550
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,600
I'm not a good person.

551
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,467
Only good people can say that.

552
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,000
How's Braveheart?

553
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:58,000
Braveheart?

554
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:03,100
She seemed brave, so I...

555
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,700
You're bad at giving names.

556
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:11,433
Why don't you want to see a doctor?

557
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,000
My company might lay me off.

558
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,067
It must be a scary place if you're
worried about such a thing.

559
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Then stop by my clinic
if your wound worsens.

560
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,967
And take Braveheart out
for a walk from time to time.

561
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,667
I don't know what to call you.

562
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,700
Could you tell me your name?

563
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,600
Do you think I'm a good person, too?

564
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:23,100
Braveheart.

565
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,933
Okay, you're Braveheart from now on.

566
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:37,900
This building has stood for
40 years on this costly land.

567
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,933
It'd be great to demolish it
and build something new.

568
00:54:40,933 --> 00:54:43,400
Not as easy as it sounds?

569
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,867
This gimp was born as prey,

570
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:51,133
and an old lioness is blocking its way.

571
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:54,067
I think her claws have fallen out.

572
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:57,000
She's never made any mistakes?

573
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,667
She was perfect. Unbelievably so.

574
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:03,500
A living legend, who
fascinated and terrified us.

575
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,433
They were all captivated by that story.

576
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:10,967
Jeez, what happened?

577
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:15,467
There was this guy named
Ryu who built this place.

578
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:16,933
You prick...

579
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:19,800
<i>I was late because
of the prayer ritual.</i>

580
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,433
To make sure that my family

581
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:24,500
<i>goes to heaven.</i>

582
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,433
When he died,

583
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:42,333
<i>Godmother wiped out 28 men
all by herself for revenge.</i>

584
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,433
<i>She sure did.</i>

585
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:58,133
<i>Then she changed her name
from "Nails" to "Hornclaw."</i>

586
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,967
But that was ages ago.

587
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:12,433
Expired waste should be
disposed of, don't you think?

588
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:27,600
Hello, ma'am.

589
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,867
Hello, Granny.

590
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:31,300
Oh, hi.

591
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,133
- On a walk with Braveheart?
- Yes.

592
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:35,800
Can I play with her?

593
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,000
- Yes.
- Hae-ni.

594
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,767
Sure.

595
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:40,300
Here you go.

596
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,500
Let's go, Braveheart.

597
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,833
Hae-ni, don't go too far.

598
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,533
Okay.

599
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:50,400
Your girl seems smart.

600
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,100
She's a lot like her mom.

601
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:59,067
My mother-in-law told you, right?

602
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:03,733
She was fine, and then suddenly...

603
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,900
The head of that hospital said,

604
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,000
"Everyone who's after money

605
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,467
always starts by asking
for a heartfelt apology."

606
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,100
Back then...

607
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,633
I wanted to end it all.

608
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:23,400
Or actually, I wanted to...

609
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,133
Kill her?

610
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:41,033
Would you eat with us?
We're on our way to lunch.

611
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:44,600
No, I'll just...

612
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,100
You're back.

613
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,633
Come with us. We all
need to eat, you know.

614
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,800
Sorry, but I should just go.

615
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:57,167
Pretty please.

616
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,333
Come with us.

617
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,100
I have a recital next week.

618
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,200
You should come, too.

619
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,400
Sorry, but I can't go
to places like this.

620
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,767
But I practiced my dance really hard.

621
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:12,900
Hae-ni, what's with you today?

622
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,667
Please don't mind her.

623
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:16,200
Eat up.

624
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,433
Hornclaw.

625
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,167
What?

626
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,733
My name.

627
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,067
One claw, two claws, three claws,

628
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:32,533
- four claws...
- Hae-ni.

629
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:37,833
It means the claws of a beast.

630
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,100
Is that so?

631
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,767
- I didn't know.
- Look over here!

632
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,800
Don't do that without
permission, Hae-ni.

633
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,467
See? Looks good, right?

634
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:48,167
Give me your number.
I'll send it to you.

635
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:49,933
Hae-ni.

636
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,567
Sorry about that.

637
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:59,167
Oh my gosh. Daddy, look.

638
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,333
Someone broke that and ran away.

639
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,667
Isn't that expensive?

640
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:15,300
Hello.

641
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,000
How can I help you?

642
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,840
<i>Dr. Kang Bong-hwe, Veterinarian</i>

643
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:24,733
There's this old hound...

644
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,133
An old woman I know.

645
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,067
She's been acting strange these days.

646
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,900
Why is that?

647
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,233
Sorry?

648
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,833
She's shaken by trivial things.

649
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,333
Gets scared often.

650
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:57,767
Or craves food she never liked.

651
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:01,433
You'll have to visit somewhere
else for psychogenic illnesses.

652
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,367
This is a hospital, though.

653
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,100
We only treat animals.

654
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,067
Aren't humans...

655
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,733
animals, too?

656
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:15,833
They are, but I can't treat them.

657
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:17,767
That's weird.

658
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:20,233
Pretty sure I saw you treat people.

659
01:00:29,267 --> 01:00:30,467
Hello.

660
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:32,200
Oh, hello.

661
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:34,167
- She won't eat anything.
- Oh no.

662
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,500
It must've been tough. Come inside.

663
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,501
Okay.

664
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:39,400
I'm sorry, sir.

665
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,833
I want some strawberries.

666
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:53,767
Strawberries are out of season.

667
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,000
What about Jeju oranges?

668
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,500
These California oranges are sweeter.

669
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,933
Come on, that can't be.

670
01:01:00,933 --> 01:01:02,067
Sir, look.

671
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:04,567
Come to my recital next week.

672
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,667
Sorry, I'm too busy.

673
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:11,167
Come on, I practiced my dance so hard.

674
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,167
Really? Can you show me?

675
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:21,300
- So good, sweetie.
- Wow, you're so good.

676
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,600
That fruit shop owner
sure is good at her game.

677
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,400
What are you up to?

678
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,767
This is old, wrinkled, and bruised,
but she said it tastes the same.

679
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,733
She said people only buy
the pretty and fresh ones

680
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:39,267
because they don't know.

681
01:01:40,267 --> 01:01:45,433
If you ever lay hands
on Dr. Kang's family...

682
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:49,733
You're serious, huh?

683
01:01:53,133 --> 01:01:55,833
That nerd must be a real charmer,

684
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,267
melting even your ice-cold heart.

685
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:03,500
I'll leave, so stop it.

686
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,833
What?

687
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:08,900
If I leave, there will be no
threat to Sinseong Agency,

688
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,600
and that innocent man will be safe.

689
01:02:14,733 --> 01:02:16,633
I don't like that.

690
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:22,167
You'll lay down your knife
and retire all because of him?

691
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:24,633
Now that you're old,

692
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:28,133
did feelings invade your body like
germs through your chapped skin?

693
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:33,533
Are you drowning in pity, guilt,
protectiveness, or some shit?

694
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:37,967
What is your goal here?

695
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,200
My goal?

696
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,633
People are funny.

697
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:52,500
Even when they're lost, they
ask where others are going.

698
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:57,200
Do you even know where you're headed?

699
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,633
Well...

700
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:06,267
Age doesn't matter.

701
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,933
You can look all you like.

702
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:14,133
But you don't deserve him.

703
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,800
See this?

704
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,267
Who would pay the same money for this?

705
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,667
Get some rest.

706
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,633
I'm fine.

707
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,333
I'll get you a new ID and a ticket.

708
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,400
No need.

709
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,000
I'll stay where I want to.

710
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,933
Do as you wish.

711
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:46,333
But from now on,

712
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,133
you and I both...

713
01:04:49,133 --> 01:04:52,067
will make sure to never
have anything to protect.

714
01:05:21,427 --> 01:05:23,301
It's been ten years already.

715
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,145
Great work.

716
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,633
<i>Protect Sinseong Agency with that.</i>

717
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,733
<i>I want the truth and an apology
for the sudden death of my wife</i>

718
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:04,240
<i>in the hospital during her surgery</i>

719
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,233
Hey, watch it!

720
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:11,600
I have the worst luck today.

721
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:17,400
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

722
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,467
What's wrong, ma'am?

723
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,333
<i>Pest Control Target</i>

724
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,300
<i>Request: Crush Skull in Front of Child</i>

725
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:58,333
Guess this is a serious grudge.
In front of his child?

726
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,967
Can't say.

727
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:04,167
The client wants full confidentiality,
so I can't tell you much.

728
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,633
Why not give it to
your loyal Bullfight?

729
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:14,500
Client requested a female specialist
of similar age to the victim,

730
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,433
which is why I'm asking you in person.

731
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,267
Rather than have someone
else make a mess of it,

732
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:23,233
I'd rather you handle this cleanly.

733
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,567
What the...

734
01:07:47,433 --> 01:07:49,267
Who's the client?

735
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,400
Oh, Godmother...

736
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,133
Why are you doing this to me?

737
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:02,567
Why is Dr. Kang being targeted?

738
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:06,233
"Ask questions, and you'll
be killed on the spot."

739
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:08,800
You made that rule.

740
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:17,067
I didn't make that rule
just to catch some fish.

741
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:19,267
It was to take the ocean.

742
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:26,433
You don't even know which
way the ship is sailing!

743
01:08:28,633 --> 01:08:32,400
<i>The son of the hospital head said
that Dr. Kang killed his mom.</i>

744
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,267
<i>So, he's out for revenge.</i>

745
01:08:34,267 --> 01:08:36,367
<i>And he dropped a fortune on it.</i>

746
01:08:36,367 --> 01:08:39,667
Dr. Kang is not that kind of person.

747
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:41,233
It did seem strange.

748
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:44,233
The so-called son of a hospital
head was wearing a fake watch.

749
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,600
<i>Sohn said to take it
anyway. Money's money.</i>

750
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
But just in case...

751
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,833
I did some digging.

752
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,000
Ten million? Raising it to
a hundred million, fucker.

753
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,767
Let's see how big your guts are.

754
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,133
Fuck, you in or out?
I'm all in, you bastard.

755
01:09:06,133 --> 01:09:10,900
That fucking son of a bitch...

756
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,267
Who the hell are you? Hey!

757
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:20,833
Why did you put a hit on Kang Bong-hwe?

758
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,167
Who?

759
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,500
I don't know anything, really!

760
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,267
I was paid. I just followed orders.

761
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:30,367
By whom?

762
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:32,367
On the phone...

763
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:34,333
We talked on the phone.

764
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,267
My phone's in my back pocket.

765
01:09:36,267 --> 01:09:38,933
- Call him.
- Yes, ma'am.

766
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:43,800
<i>What's up?</i>

767
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,500
There's a lady here...

768
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,933
<i>Granny.</i>

769
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,933
I don't think you have time
to fool around with that loser.

770
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:53,767
What do you want?

771
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:55,600
<i>Equal ruin?</i>

772
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:59,100
Dr. Kang's shift ends soon.

773
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,600
<i>Want me to help you again?</i>

774
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,933
Wait, hold up!

775
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:37,567
Thank you.

776
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,967
Are you okay?

777
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:19,667
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

778
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,067
Sir!

779
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:38,633
No... Sir!

780
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,533
Please don't leave me here by myself!

781
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,400
I'm sorry...

782
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,933
What are you doing here?

783
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,100
- I'm so relieved.
- Pardon?

784
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,433
<i>Please enjoy, from Braveheart's mom</i>

785
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:50,933
You don't need to worry about us.

786
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,100
No, it's...

787
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:02,500
Wait.

788
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,500
Is there anything

789
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,633
you want to say to me?

790
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:15,800
You've lost weight.

791
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,967
Be sure not to skip meals.

792
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:33,267
So, is your heart racing?

793
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:38,900
Why make this so complicated?

794
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,667
There's no point

795
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:43,400
if you can't figure out
the reason on your own.

796
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,910
You should go rub him out.

797
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:47,160
Why waste time with me?

798
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,567
I wonder why.

799
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:53,567
Maybe I wanted to see the legend.

800
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:57,833
You must be disappointed.

801
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,133
I am.

802
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:01,667
In myself.

803
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:06,133
For spending my whole
life searching for such crap.

804
01:14:06,133 --> 01:14:08,000
Stop this.

805
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,700
If you mean me, you already found me.

806
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:14,333
No.

807
01:14:16,633 --> 01:14:18,467
I haven't found it yet.

808
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,467
This isn't the real fight.

809
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:22,333
Don't even think of retiring.

810
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:25,933
And also, you'll never beat me.

811
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:29,800
You've got something to protect,

812
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,067
while I've got nothing to lose.

813
01:14:33,733 --> 01:14:34,900
Welcome.

814
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,133
This place is so nice.

815
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:37,833
Shall we sit here?

816
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,633
I can't wait any longer.

817
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,600
A daughter... No.

818
01:15:09,933 --> 01:15:12,433
Two sons... No.

819
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,767
1998, 1999.

820
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:21,433
No...

821
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,380
<i>Bae Jong-sun
Family: One Son</i>

822
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,267
I'm your new housekeeper...

823
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,833
Hi there.

824
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,167
<i>Allergic to pollen...</i>

825
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,750
<i>Son can't swallow
pills, grind into powder</i>

826
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,567
Give me some water.

827
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,933
Will you eat?

828
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,433
No.

829
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:18,267
<i>When does your dad get home?</i>

830
01:16:18,267 --> 01:16:19,800
After midnight.

831
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,033
Or sometimes not at all.

832
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:38,723
How long have you been working here?

833
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,043
Ten days?

834
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:44,231
Work's not too hard?

835
01:16:46,304 --> 01:16:48,904
Goddammit.

836
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,167
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

837
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,667
Jeez, seriously?

838
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,367
Who the heck untied these shoelaces?

839
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,497
<i>Blow to occipital and
parietal bone, crushed skull</i>

840
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,292
So, he's aiming for
the back of my head.

841
01:17:40,059 --> 01:17:41,043
Listen carefully.

842
01:17:41,068 --> 01:17:44,215
If I don't come back,
you leave through there.

843
01:17:44,978 --> 01:17:48,478
Don't starve like a
fool waiting for me.

844
01:17:48,503 --> 01:17:50,809
Find a new owner or
rummage through the bins.

845
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:54,139
Do whatever it takes to survive.

846
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:05,486
Just don't let the dog catcher get you.

847
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,833
<i>You're going to hit Han Seong-do's den?</i>

848
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:19,033
I'm going to do a job
worthy of Sinseong Agency.

849
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:21,433
Killing pests and
saving people in pain.

850
01:18:21,433 --> 01:18:26,633
<i>Madam Hong's case is not as
simple as getting rid of one druggie.</i>

851
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:30,133
Just rub out that vet
and be done with it.

852
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:34,167
Why poke at such a big wasp nest?

853
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:37,900
It'll be war if you screw up there.

854
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,800
You may be the Godmother,
but you can't do that job alone.

855
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
<i>This will be my last job.</i>

856
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,033
<i>I'll disappear whether
I survive or not.</i>

857
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,200
So, you can run this place from now on.

858
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:52,867
If you're that worried, send a backup.

859
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:55,533
That guy, Bullfight.

860
01:18:57,467 --> 01:19:01,567
This is so sudden. What
am I supposed to say?

861
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:21,633
Come on, get a hold of yourself.

862
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:25,534
- Bon appétit!
- Thank you for the food!

863
01:19:28,633 --> 01:19:30,067
What the hell?

864
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,900
Are you happy living off
of others' blood and tears?

865
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,367
An old hag?

866
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:38,267
What bastard hired a hag like you?

867
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,800
Who was it?

868
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,800
Oh Gwang-ryul? Jeon In-deuk?

869
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,667
Surely not Madam Hong?

870
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:58,733
It doesn't matter who kills you.

871
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,700
What matters is why you're dying.

872
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,133
Boss!

873
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:16,800
Hey! Prepare this old hag's funeral!

874
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:21,467
<i>Godmother!</i>

875
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:24,900
You can't do this.

876
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,200
I know you're the Godmother,
but it's too dangerous.

877
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,900
You'll die there!

878
01:20:33,733 --> 01:20:36,033
Do as you fucking wish.

879
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:47,067
Hey! Get her!

880
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,967
Get her!

881
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:01,133
Hurry, find her!

882
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:03,667
- What the...
- What the heck?

883
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,367
Hurry up!

884
01:21:23,267 --> 01:21:24,500
Where's Bullfight?

885
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,800
What about him?

886
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,300
Where is he right now?

887
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:32,133
Why the hell would I send our
next ace into that death trap?

888
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:35,667
<i>And Godmother, everyone has
their own quota of goodwill.</i>

889
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:39,667
<i>You're letting Dr. Kang live because
of something personal, right?</i>

890
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:42,400
<i>And that's why you want to quit.</i>

891
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:46,833
You've lived too long, dear Godmother.

892
01:21:58,067 --> 01:21:59,600
You!

893
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,500
I got her.

894
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,300
In front of Room Four.

895
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,100
If you're so old, just
die! Why bother living?

896
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:55,200
Look here, Mr. Sohn.

897
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,433
This is so out of line. How much
have you earned from me?

898
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,500
<i>How dare you fucking trash
my business like this?</i>

899
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,467
You've deserved to
die several times over.

900
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:07,933
Why complain in the face of such luck?

901
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:09,633
Let's meet to negotiate...

902
01:23:09,633 --> 01:23:11,700
What the fuck?

903
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:24,167
So, are you going to apologize?

904
01:23:28,267 --> 01:23:31,000
I'm tired. Let's just end this.

905
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,467
You disgusting vermin.

906
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,667
Snack on these on your way to hell.

907
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:40,933
Little worms, it's time to eat!

908
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:06,767
Pour it in every corner.

909
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,067
- Have fun!
- Goodbye, Granny.

910
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,167
- Hurry up, guys!
- Yes, sir!

911
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,967
Hey! Stop him!

912
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:44,167
I said stop, you prick!

913
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:45,867
Hey!

914
01:24:53,767 --> 01:24:55,633
You're not done yet, right?

915
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:58,400
What? Are you her son?

916
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,200
Well, from the same family.

917
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,133
You son of a...

918
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:37,767
Where the heck is she?

919
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:39,300
Where are you?

920
01:25:56,233 --> 01:25:58,267
Are you okay?

921
01:25:58,267 --> 01:26:00,100
Die!

922
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:13,100
<i>Are you worried?</i>

923
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,674
Yes.

924
01:26:15,521 --> 01:26:18,621
Then assign Bullfight as
backup. Do it yourself.

925
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,967
Sohn won't do it.

926
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,900
If I assign him, will he go?

927
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,100
Just do as I tell you.

928
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,100
I'll make you dinner.

929
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,833
In the condition you're in?

930
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:59,800
I can still cook a meal
for my colleague.

931
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,267
Ordinary people...

932
01:27:16,267 --> 01:27:17,967
What?

933
01:27:17,967 --> 01:27:19,933
I guess ordinary people...

934
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:23,933
must eat like this often.

935
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,667
What made you start this work?

936
01:27:28,433 --> 01:27:30,267
To be useful.

937
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,733
One time when I was
young, I was so hungry

938
01:27:35,733 --> 01:27:38,467
that I ate the neighbor's
bell flower roots.

939
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,833
But they turned out to be wild ginseng.

940
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:46,400
My family went broke paying it
back, and they kicked me out.

941
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,100
I worked as a maid

942
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:54,467
<i>and kept getting beaten,
abandoned, and running away.</i>

943
01:27:54,467 --> 01:27:57,000
Everyone told me to go die.

944
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,600
Calling me the most
useless bitch in the world.

945
01:28:03,233 --> 01:28:06,533
<i>And when I was 16,</i>

946
01:28:06,533 --> 01:28:09,533
I met someone who took
me in as their family.

947
01:28:09,533 --> 01:28:11,333
What is your name?

948
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,067
Min Seol-hwa.

949
01:28:13,067 --> 01:28:14,667
What a pretty name!

950
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:16,367
<i>He fed me,</i>

951
01:28:16,367 --> 01:28:19,467
<i>housed me, and gave me work.</i>

952
01:28:19,467 --> 01:28:25,267
<i>And he was the first
person to call me useful.</i>

953
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:31,367
Don't dodge it like that.

954
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:32,833
Flash your reflexes like that,

955
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:35,567
and you're basically
screaming, "I'm a killer."

956
01:28:35,567 --> 01:28:38,233
Hide it even if it means getting
your head bashed in. Got it?

957
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:39,368
Yes.

958
01:28:39,368 --> 01:28:41,633
That's it for today.

959
01:28:43,433 --> 01:28:46,867
I believe this work is sacred.

960
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:51,267
Each of us is saving the world.

961
01:28:51,267 --> 01:28:53,133
Even if no one else knows.

962
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,433
I'm jealous.

963
01:28:59,433 --> 01:29:03,833
I had that kind of
person in my life once.

964
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:06,000
Very briefly.

965
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,500
Tell me.

966
01:29:08,433 --> 01:29:10,900
Do you remember when we first met?

967
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,400
Was it 25 years ago?

968
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:18,133
Hi there.

969
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,700
I'm sorry, Do-young.

970
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:53,600
Wow, this is so touching.

971
01:29:54,433 --> 01:29:55,833
Then...

972
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,367
you must know why I came for you.

973
01:30:02,933 --> 01:30:05,867
You won't feel better even
if you kill me yourself.

974
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:09,800
So, why be lame and leave
your ancient revenge to others?

975
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,167
You should torment me to the end.

976
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,567
If you just drink up
whatever's given to you,

977
01:30:26,567 --> 01:30:28,567
you'll end up dead.

978
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:31,300
Especially from a colleague you trust.

979
01:30:37,233 --> 01:30:39,000
You failed...

980
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,533
You failed on purpose?

981
01:30:42,533 --> 01:30:44,500
Knowing I'd come?

982
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,467
Fifty-fifty.

983
01:30:46,467 --> 01:30:49,267
But I knew you would find me.

984
01:30:49,267 --> 01:30:52,533
That's why you made...

985
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,200
such a mess.

986
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:18,133
Think of it as being clawed by a beast.

987
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:20,000
See you in hell.

988
01:31:53,414 --> 01:31:57,014
Your precious ace is history.

989
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:04,244
I shouldn't have accepted you here.

990
01:32:07,228 --> 01:32:09,337
When did you ever accept me?

991
01:32:10,333 --> 01:32:12,600
It was for us...

992
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:17,433
For Sinseong Agency!

993
01:32:17,433 --> 01:32:20,800
I did all of that for us!

994
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,233
Sure, you did your best.

995
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:27,733
What do you think

996
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,500
your father would have done?

997
01:32:40,267 --> 01:32:42,333
You'll do it, right?

998
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:44,367
All the work you couldn't finish?

999
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,667
Burn this place down.

1000
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,633
And you leave here, too.

1001
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,267
Hae-ni!

1002
01:33:00,267 --> 01:33:02,067
Daddy's here!

1003
01:33:03,967 --> 01:33:06,433
Look how cute your daughter is!

1004
01:33:14,433 --> 01:33:16,233
Did you see me?

1005
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,933
Where is she?

1006
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:22,200
- Hello.
- Hello, sir, ma'am.

1007
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,300
Where's Hae-ni?

1008
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,400
Hae-ni? She was the first one out.

1009
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,467
- Then I'll check the restroom.
- Okay.

1010
01:33:30,467 --> 01:33:32,400
I'll look inside a bit more.

1011
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,233
Hae-ni?

1012
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,233
Hae-ni?

1013
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,333
- Hello.
- Hello.

1014
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,767
Got you!

1015
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:04,801
I'm sorry.

1016
01:34:04,801 --> 01:34:06,833
You grabbed me so suddenly...

1017
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,333
Haven't you gone too far?

1018
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:10,900
She's just a little girl.

1019
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,533
What...

1020
01:34:15,633 --> 01:34:17,900
Will you still keep pretending
after reading this?

1021
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,000
<i>I thought things over
at the gates of hell,</i>

1022
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,400
<i>but I felt really bad for Hae-ni.</i>

1023
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:29,000
<i>She'll most likely end up
alone just like we were.</i>

1024
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,833
<i>I know because I've been there.</i>

1025
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,233
<i>I'd be breaking my rule,</i>

1026
01:34:34,233 --> 01:34:37,100
<i>but I'm so upset, I can't help it.</i>

1027
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,933
<i>That's the problem with humans.</i>

1028
01:34:38,933 --> 01:34:42,800
<i>When you're feeling down,
everything goes out the window.</i>

1029
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,200
<i>You understand, right?</i>

1030
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,233
<i>I'll throw the biggest party ever.</i>

1031
01:34:46,233 --> 01:34:48,067
<i>You come here alone.</i>

1032
01:34:48,067 --> 01:34:49,367
<i>To Happyland.</i>

1033
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:52,967
Who the heck are you? What do you want?

1034
01:34:52,967 --> 01:34:55,433
You can't call the police.

1035
01:34:55,433 --> 01:34:56,600
I'll bring her back.

1036
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,567
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm reporting it right now.

1037
01:35:03,633 --> 01:35:05,567
Trust me.

1038
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:07,533
Hae-ni will be safe.

1039
01:35:08,433 --> 01:35:10,600
It's me that he wants.

1040
01:35:21,567 --> 01:35:25,567
Please bring Hae-ni back, okay?

1041
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,067
This is because I saved
you that day, isn't it?

1042
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,167
You weren't supposed to be saved,

1043
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,400
but I saved you, didn't I?

1044
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:50,967
Even so, I don't regret treating you.

1045
01:35:52,567 --> 01:35:54,967
It was something I had to do.

1046
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,067
Why isn't it moving?

1047
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,367
Hi!

1048
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:23,633
Braveheart, remember what I told you?

1049
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,000
Braveheart...

1050
01:38:53,633 --> 01:38:55,233
Approaching target.

1051
01:38:55,233 --> 01:38:57,333
Copy. No blind spots.

1052
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:58,967
All clear.

1053
01:39:11,733 --> 01:39:13,167
Third floor!

1054
01:39:22,967 --> 01:39:24,034
Spread out!

1055
01:39:24,034 --> 01:39:25,833
Target exposed! Fire!

1056
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,167
<i>Team B, entering the third floor.</i>

1057
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:35,667
<i>Provide cover.</i>

1058
01:39:45,967 --> 01:39:48,967
- Just shoot!
- Stairs on the third floor!

1059
01:39:55,267 --> 01:39:57,467
<i>Help me...</i>

1060
01:39:58,567 --> 01:40:00,667
<i>Help me...</i>

1061
01:40:24,267 --> 01:40:26,033
Squeeze in from both sides!

1062
01:40:29,767 --> 01:40:31,333
Going in!

1063
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:32,667
Come out!

1064
01:42:09,233 --> 01:42:12,633
No hurting children.
That's your rule, isn't it?

1065
01:42:12,633 --> 01:42:14,267
Don't kick her!

1066
01:42:16,133 --> 01:42:17,767
All right, then.

1067
01:42:26,767 --> 01:42:28,400
Drop your gun.

1068
01:42:37,067 --> 01:42:38,967
What took you so long?

1069
01:42:38,967 --> 01:42:41,333
I thought I'd die waiting.

1070
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:45,067
So, this is the farce
that you prepared?

1071
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:51,100
You worried my ancient revenge
would be lame, didn't you?

1072
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:53,167
Sure.

1073
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,167
These losers I'm working
with could do a lot better.

1074
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:58,167
You've got some nerve!

1075
01:42:58,167 --> 01:43:00,167
- How dare you...
- Captain Lee.

1076
01:43:00,167 --> 01:43:02,167
I paid you in full in advance.
Is there a problem?

1077
01:43:02,167 --> 01:43:05,100
My guys are all dead
because of your stupid plan.

1078
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,933
Didn't you know you were
just human shields?

1079
01:43:07,933 --> 01:43:09,733
Say that again, you...

1080
01:43:15,467 --> 01:43:19,100
You crazy bitch, you think
you're still the Godmother?

1081
01:43:22,767 --> 01:43:24,467
Get the hell up!

1082
01:43:24,467 --> 01:43:26,300
Hey, get up!

1083
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,567
Get up!

1084
01:43:28,567 --> 01:43:29,900
Let go!

1085
01:43:35,333 --> 01:43:37,233
Shit!

1086
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,333
I told you. You shouldn't
underestimate her.

1087
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:46,067
I'll go up and pay you a generous fee.

1088
01:43:46,067 --> 01:43:47,167
Drive safe.

1089
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:50,000
You fuckers!

1090
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,267
Don't be so pathetic.

1091
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:14,033
I'll cut off her ear.

1092
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,833
The rest, too!

1093
01:44:35,467 --> 01:44:37,567
What should I do for
you to give her back?

1094
01:44:37,567 --> 01:44:39,167
Give her back?

1095
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:41,033
Take her yourself.

1096
01:44:41,033 --> 01:44:44,800
Why do you keep bringing
Dr. Kang in between us?

1097
01:44:45,833 --> 01:44:49,067
That vet is someone to be protected,

1098
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,133
and I'm trash to be cleaned up?

1099
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,433
It seems so.

1100
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:08,333
Why are you doing this to me?

1101
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:10,933
Then what about you?

1102
01:45:10,933 --> 01:45:13,733
Aren't you waste to dispose of?

1103
01:45:13,733 --> 01:45:16,300
Since you're old and useless.

1104
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:23,767
Someone said, even if
you're old and useless,

1105
01:45:23,767 --> 01:45:26,067
you shouldn't be thrown away.

1106
01:45:30,233 --> 01:45:33,267
You can never protect him.

1107
01:45:33,267 --> 01:45:36,867
I'll kill him. And his entire family.

1108
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,067
You'll protect them like that?

1109
01:45:52,233 --> 01:45:53,767
Granny...

1110
01:45:56,633 --> 01:45:58,500
Keep this up,

1111
01:45:59,233 --> 01:46:01,233
and I'll throw her off.

1112
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,533
- No...
- You're all dead, bastards!

1113
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,733
What now?

1114
01:46:15,733 --> 01:46:18,300
The winner will have to take your car.

1115
01:46:20,133 --> 01:46:22,167
You didn't learn right.

1116
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,467
If you treat others like vermin,

1117
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:28,900
you become useless vermin yourself.

1118
01:46:31,933 --> 01:46:35,467
Sorry, I was self-taught.

1119
01:46:37,767 --> 01:46:39,633
Can I kill you?

1120
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,100
Sure. Weren't you going to?

1121
01:47:04,267 --> 01:47:06,100
Where are you looking?

1122
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,500
What the... Is that it?

1123
01:47:24,467 --> 01:47:25,933
You don't want it?

1124
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,733
When does your dad get home?

1125
01:47:33,733 --> 01:47:36,733
After midnight.

1126
01:47:36,733 --> 01:47:38,833
Or sometimes not at all.

1127
01:47:41,133 --> 01:47:44,467
You should get to bed now.

1128
01:47:44,467 --> 01:47:48,033
By the way, what music
are you listening to?

1129
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:50,100
This?

1130
01:47:51,067 --> 01:47:53,067
Listen when things are hard.

1131
01:47:58,967 --> 01:48:03,000
No, this isn't it.

1132
01:48:07,933 --> 01:48:09,833
Are you giving this to me?

1133
01:48:22,067 --> 01:48:24,433
It doesn't seem fair to keep two.

1134
01:48:24,433 --> 01:48:26,033
Should I drop one?

1135
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:27,267
Do what you want.

1136
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:29,233
But you'll regret it.

1137
01:48:44,133 --> 01:48:46,467
I gave it back to you.

1138
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,733
Thanks for that.

1139
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:02,233
Bae Do-young.

1140
01:49:02,233 --> 01:49:04,867
Didn't I tell you to come
out and greet me

1141
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:09,400
as soon as I return
from work, you prick?

1142
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,800
Who do you take after to be so weak?

1143
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,933
You damn idiot!

1144
01:49:14,933 --> 01:49:16,533
Sir.

1145
01:49:18,167 --> 01:49:20,067
What the heck?

1146
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:45,800
You're a legend. Is
this all you've got?

1147
01:49:55,567 --> 01:49:56,667
<i>This is the police.</i>

1148
01:49:56,667 --> 01:50:00,100
I've been kidnapped.
Please call my dad.

1149
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,333
I'm Kang Hae-ni.

1150
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:04,433
Please check my location
and come find me...

1151
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:30,200
Remember. This is a
seed that you planted.

1152
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:34,433
Unlike some people, I keep my promises.

1153
01:50:34,433 --> 01:50:36,133
"Promises"?

1154
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:39,400
<i>Have a good day!</i>

1155
01:50:54,967 --> 01:50:56,433
Don't you get it yet?

1156
01:50:56,433 --> 01:50:58,100
So stupid!

1157
01:51:06,467 --> 01:51:08,433
Are you stalling for time?

1158
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,733
For her?

1159
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,167
For goodness' sake,

1160
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:24,067
look at me.

1161
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,833
Look at me!

1162
01:52:21,409 --> 01:52:23,742
Don't be too upset.

1163
01:52:23,767 --> 01:52:25,832
I'll be following you soon.

1164
01:52:26,192 --> 01:52:27,758
Finally...

1165
01:52:29,164 --> 01:52:30,764
you're here.

1166
01:52:42,667 --> 01:52:45,267
This time, I won.

1167
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,967
Because...

1168
01:52:47,967 --> 01:52:49,767
I'm the one...

1169
01:52:50,933 --> 01:52:53,333
leaving you behind.

1170
01:53:08,367 --> 01:53:10,000
Have a good day.

1171
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,867
Take your medicine at lunch.

1172
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,300
Why were you good to me?

1173
01:53:21,467 --> 01:53:23,733
You didn't even...

1174
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,933
recognize me.

1175
01:53:32,467 --> 01:53:33,733
Do-young, where are you going?

1176
01:53:33,733 --> 01:53:35,533
I forgot my indoor shoes!

1177
01:53:46,733 --> 01:53:50,533
You didn't see anything.
Forget all this.

1178
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,500
Can I come with you?

1179
01:53:54,267 --> 01:53:57,433
Later, when you grow up.

1180
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:08,368
I'll...

1181
01:54:08,368 --> 01:54:10,333
come find you.

1182
01:54:14,667 --> 01:54:16,167
For sure!

1183
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,067
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1184
01:54:36,933 --> 01:54:39,033
I was scared.

1185
01:54:40,233 --> 01:54:42,100
What if...

1186
01:54:44,567 --> 01:54:46,333
you forgot about me?

1187
01:55:04,933 --> 01:55:07,167
Now you remember?

1188
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,467
Yes.

1189
01:55:14,267 --> 01:55:15,833
How?

1190
01:55:15,833 --> 01:55:18,200
When it's your time to die,

1191
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:22,100
your whole life flashes
before your eyes.

1192
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,033
I promise.

1193
01:55:25,033 --> 01:55:28,100
One day, you'll be much
stronger than your dad.

1194
01:55:29,133 --> 01:55:32,233
Until then, hold tight to your grudge.

1195
01:55:33,233 --> 01:55:35,067
For today, sleep well.

1196
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:38,367
Tomorrow will be better.

1197
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,967
Can we...

1198
01:55:41,967 --> 01:55:43,433
What?

1199
01:55:43,433 --> 01:55:45,333
go to Happyland together?

1200
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:46,967
Happyland?

1201
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:49,967
The amusement park.

1202
01:55:49,967 --> 01:55:53,300
My friends all bragged about going.

1203
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:54,967
Can we go?

1204
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,233
Shall we?

1205
01:56:09,233 --> 01:56:11,167
Liar.

1206
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:14,267
You never answered.

1207
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:20,900
I guess it's not...

1208
01:56:22,133 --> 01:56:24,333
your time to go...

1209
01:56:25,667 --> 01:56:27,567
yet...

1210
01:56:33,567 --> 01:56:35,067
Can you

1211
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,500
swallow your pills now?

1212
01:57:10,567 --> 01:57:12,667
He's a new member of our family.

1213
01:57:17,933 --> 01:57:22,267
<i>I know I did something bad, but I
was mad that you'd leave me again.</i>

1214
01:57:22,267 --> 01:57:24,233
<i>Still, I'm sure you'll
be the one to survive</i>

1215
01:57:24,233 --> 01:57:26,170
<i>because you have people to protect.</i>

1216
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:38,000
<i>Ryu.</i>

1217
01:57:38,667 --> 01:57:42,700
<i>This didn't happen to you because
you had something to protect.</i>

1218
01:57:46,967 --> 01:57:48,733
<i>In the end,</i>

1219
01:57:48,733 --> 01:57:52,167
<i>we all break and fade away.</i>

1220
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:55,600
You're back so early!

1221
01:57:57,767 --> 01:58:02,933
<i>But maybe living on with
that loss isn't so bad after all.</i>

1222
01:58:06,467 --> 01:58:08,333
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

1223
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:10,067
<i>We sincerely welcome
the return of President Jee</i>

1224
01:58:10,067 --> 01:58:11,333
- Amen.
- Amen.

1225
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:13,933
Even when I was locked in prison,

1226
01:58:13,933 --> 01:58:16,167
those who sued me...

1227
01:58:16,167 --> 01:58:18,567
those hypocrites!

1228
01:58:18,567 --> 01:58:23,333
Whoever they were,
I never held a grudge.

1229
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:24,967
- Amen!
- Amen!

1230
01:58:24,967 --> 01:58:26,300
My dear child.

1231
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:30,467
Let me warm you up nice and toasty.

1232
01:58:30,467 --> 01:58:32,433
<i>And Ryu...</i>

1233
01:58:32,433 --> 01:58:35,900
<i>It seems it's still not time
for me to join you yet.</i>

1234
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,201
<i>Cult Leader and Founder Sexual assault
