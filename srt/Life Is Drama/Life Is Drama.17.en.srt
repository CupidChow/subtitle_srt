[Episode 17]

2
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,900
You know the old man's trying

3
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,780
to marry you off.

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,980
He gave you a few candidates.

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,300
All you have to do is pick this guy.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,140
What?

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,020
But he's so ugly.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,380
All right.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,460
What's our next move?

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,220
Why do you care?

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,900
We are ready to make a move.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,340
The Shangguan family's stocks
have been plummeting lately.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,340
We've waited all this time.

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,460
We killed my brother for this day.

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,620
Darling,

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,580
let's get one thing straight.

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,860
Don't forget about me
once you get your hands

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,700
on the Shangguan family's assets.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,620
Be careful not to let anyone see you.

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,740
Throw another,

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,100
and I'll throw you off from this floor.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,220
Who are you?

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,700
Shangguan Chuxia.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
This is a remote control recorder.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,940
Hide this in leather

26
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,180
and put it in her bag.

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,140
Send me the recording.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,340
Do that,

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,740
and you will get 100,000.

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,140
What are you afraid of?

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,740
He's just a pawn.

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,340
Do you think the trap we set up

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,580
was all worth it?

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,300
I still have nightmares every night.

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,340
I dream about Shangguan Xiao.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,460
One must finish the path

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,060
they chose, even if they have to grovel.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,300
But I didn't expect...

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,060
She's his daughter, all right.

40
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,820
She won't get away.

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,460
She is already part of this.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,420
What do you mean?

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,133
Wait and watch.

44
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,300
Now we can be sure

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,620
that those two were involved

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,260
in my father's death.

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,433
We must act with caution.

48
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,540
I know.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
The mastermind
is the one controlling the game.

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,340
But I don't get it.

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,220
Aside from Shangguan Chunyan
and Liu Zhiqiang,

52
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:48,566
who else can benefit

53
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,300
from all of this?

54
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,380
Could it be

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,020
the Wang family?

56
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,860
But according to the information
Wang Tianye gave me,

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,420
my dad was brought to the hotel room
after he got drunk,

58
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,740
and that's when
the woman accompanying him appeared.

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,180
So, they must have made a move

60
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,220
at the party where he got drunk.

61
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,220
The celebration banquet for the listing.

62
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,780
My grandfather,

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,420
Shangguan Chunyan,
and Liu Zhiqiang were there.

64
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,660
Shangguan Chuxue was too young.

65
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,940
Wang Tianye was there too.

66
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,300
But Wang Tianye
gave me this information.

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,300
Who else could have been there?

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,860
Yun Su,

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,260
where were you that night?

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,580
I...

71
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,300
Mr. Yun.

72
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,980
Your father is back.

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,900
He's calling you.

74
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,580
Yun Su!

75
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,660
Come here!

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm drunk...

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,980
I'll check on him.

78
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,020
He must've had too much to drink again.

79
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,740
Dad,

80
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,740
what's got you in such a happy mood?

81
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,666
Yun Su, you're here.

82
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,100
I'm so happy.

83
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,860
Drink with me.

84
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,340
What's the good news?

85
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,180
Your ego's boosted.

86
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,540
The chairman just returned
from the company.

87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,133
Heard that many clients

88
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,060
from the Shangguan family
are switching to invest in us.

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,220
They arranged a dinner,

90
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,500
and then it turned out like this.

91
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,340
As to be expected.

92
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,900
How did you do it,

93
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,380
Feng Dongdong?

94
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,740
Tell me.

95
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,180
How did they end up choosing Yun Group?

96
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,700
Mr. Yun,

97
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,820
how many of the clients came
from the Shangguan family this time?

98
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,620
80 percent.

99
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,020
Looks like

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,740
the Shangguan family
is sure to lose this time.

101
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,780
Come, tell me

102
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,900
how you did it.

103
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,820
Mr. Yun,

104
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,620
I'm sorry. I lied to you.

105
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,980
My true identity

106
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,580
is Shangguan Chuxia,

107
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,300
daughter of Shangguan Xiao.
