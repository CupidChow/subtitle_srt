[Shangguan family]
Feng Dongdong.

3
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,980
[Shangguan family]
Yes.

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,860
[Shangguan family]
Follow me.

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Mr. Liu, good morning.

6
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,300
Set up the table

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,500
in the garden.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,620
Clean the windows.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,780
Wait a moment.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,340
Okay.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,940
Dabao.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,580
Hello, Mr. Liu.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,780
Take her to change her clothes.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,620
From today onwards,

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,180
I will gather evidence to find the truth

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,700
and bring them to justice.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,740
Hello everyone,

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,780
I am Feng Dongdong.

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,420
[Liu Zhiqiang]
Please take care of me in the future.

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,200
Miss,

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,940
since we are here at the Shangguan's
to work as servants,

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,060
[Aunt Dabao]
we are all family.

23
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,500
On the left upstairs is Chun's room;

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,580
she is the daughter of Mr. Shangguan.

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,340
On the right

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,900
is Miss Chuxue's room;

27
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,740
she is the granddaughter
of Mr. Shangguan.

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,340
Both of them need to
be well taken care of.

29
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,980
Don't bother about the third floor.

30
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,620
The master doesn't like
others going there.

31
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,600
Just focus on your work.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,940
That's father's room.

33
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,300
It seems I need to find a way to get in

34
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,100
and look for clues.

35
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,533
No one in the Shangguan family

36
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:18,580
is easy to serve.

37
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,600
Understood.

38
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,420
You saw me

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,180
but you didn't even greet me.

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,620
Yes.

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,566
Miss Chuxue.

42
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,100
[Shangguan Chuxue]
You're so pretty.

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,660
Why are you working as a maid here?

44
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,820
So, what's your motive?

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,340
Say something!

46
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,900
Believe it or not, I'll fire you.

47
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,633
If you want to stay here...

48
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,340
Miss Chuxue.

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,500
You're going to be late.

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,800
When you came downstairs earlier,
you kept checking your watch.

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,220
That means you must have woken up late.

52
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,220
I just checked
the next high-speed rail schedule;

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,540
it's three hours from now.

54
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,780
There's no rush,

55
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,060
so, it shouldn't be the high-speed rail.

56
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,300
However, there are three flights,

57
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,380
each heading to a different city.

58
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,700
This suitcase is heavy,

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,419
and it has a skiing symbol on it.

60
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,939
You must be going north.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,420
That means you're taking the one
which departs in an hour.

62
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,180
Well done.

63
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,580
Mr. Liu.

64
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
Do you have any orders, Miss Chuxue?

65
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,660
In the future,

66
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,620
have her take care of my daily life.

67
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
People from this family
are not easy to deal with.

68
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,540
Looks like I'll have to
search for clues upstairs tonight.

69
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,115
[Shangguan Xiao's room]

70
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,500
This is my parents' room.

71
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,900
Chuxia, you're such a good girl.

72
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,180
Wan'er, look.

73
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,940
Chuxia, you drew this so well.

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,900
Well done, Chuxia.

75
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,220
Mr... Mr. Chi.

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,140
What's going on?

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,220
[Chi Xi]
Why are you awake at this late hour

78
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,900
and coming to this room?

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,020
I just finished cleaning
the first floor.

80
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,540
You can't simply enter

81
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,740
a dead person's room.

82
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,420
I was thinking

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,620
Mr. Xiao's room
might also need some cleaning.

84
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,933
Oh?

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,180
You know this is Mr. Xiao's room.

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,966
You seem to know a lot.

87
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,420
Are you interested in
the Shangguan family's money too?

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,620
Stay with me,

89
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,060
and you'll have everything.

90
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,540
I need to go rest.

91
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,580
Tonight

92
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,540
is your chance.

93
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,420
What are you doing?

94
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:43,820
You can't escape!

95
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,140
Let go of me!

96
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,780
Ouch.

97
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,300
This is his phone.
