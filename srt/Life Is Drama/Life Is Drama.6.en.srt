2
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,133
You're here to see her, aren't you?

3
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,266
Otherwise,

4
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,400
why have your eyes been
on her the whole time?

5
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,233
I just got back

6
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:38,466
and noticed this girl.

7
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,700
She gives me a familiar feeling.

8
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,333
I'm talking to you.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,400
Sorry.

10
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,266
If you want to stay longer,

11
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,766
just stay for a while.

12
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,166
Don't slack off.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,900
Your pay will be deducted.

14
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,366
I heard

15
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,466
what you said just now.

16
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,400
Saying that will get you caught.

17
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,533
Didn't we agree to keep our distance?

18
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,133
Keep our distance?

19
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,000
That was your idea.

20
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,200
I never said that.

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,740
Fine.

22
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:30,666
Anyway,

23
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:32,866
thank you.

24
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,166
Thanking me verbally is not sincere.

25
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,466
Won't you give me

26
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,733
some services in the Shangguan family?

27
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:51,100
Big service.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Later, find a chance

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
and head to Hedi West Road.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,333
I'll pick you up.

31
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:08,233
Jerk.

32
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,066
Won't you see me off?

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,620
This way, please.

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,260
Jerk.

35
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,733
This girl has no background.

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,933
10 PM tonight,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
on the third floor,

38
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,733
do whatever you want.

39
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,460
Okay.

40
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,600
How's the investigation going?

41
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,466
We must thoroughly investigate

42
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,133
anyone working for the Shangguan family.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,866
Feng Dongdong

44
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:58,933
was adopted

45
00:02:58,933 --> 00:02:59,966
at Hedi West Road

46
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,400
many years ago.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,460
What?

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Hedi West Road?

49
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,260
Miss Chunyan, what's going on?

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,180
You jerk.

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,060
Today, I'll teach you a lesson!

52
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,133
What are you trying to do?

53
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,466
What are you doing?

54
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,866
Are you ignoring the rules?

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,700
Get lost!

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,460
Feng Dongdong,

57
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:30,533
come here.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
Didn't scare you, did I?

59
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:49,366
After all these years,

60
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,180
you're finally back.

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,566
I had someone investigate.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,733
This voice recorder is yours, right?

63
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:57,566
It was

64
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,133
found in your luggage.

65
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,500
You are my granddaughter,

66
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,100
Shangguan Chuxia.

67
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,900
I don't understand what you're saying.

68
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,060
In a few days,

69
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,100
there's a party at the Shangguan Group.

70
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,500
I'll restore your identity

71
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,766
in front of everyone

72
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,140
so that everyone knows

73
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,060
you're my granddaughter.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,300
I still prefer to be Feng Dongdong.

75
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,866
Please give me this chance.

76
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:26,800
Why?

77
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,600
I also want to ask why.

78
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,933
Why did all the records
of what happened to my parents

79
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,066
disappear?

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,966
What are you trying to do?

81
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,733
Do you want to destroy
the Shangguan family?

82
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,400
Stop investigating this matter.

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,500
Since this family
didn't clear his name back then,

84
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:40,500
as his daughter...

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Our family
is already complicated enough.

86
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,900
Don't investigate further.

87
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,660
I just want to have peace

88
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,220
in my final days.

89
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,580
Promise me

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,220
to be a good granddaughter.

91
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,180
Shangguan Chuxia,

92
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,100
okay?

93
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,000
I can't do it.

94
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,166
Are you blaming me
for ruining your father?

95
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,166
Each snowflake

96
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,000
in an avalanche pleads not guilty.

97
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,966
Grandpa,

98
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,166
this is the first time
I'm calling you this way,

99
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,866
but it might also be the last.

100
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll leave now.
