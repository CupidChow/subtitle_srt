[Episode 18]

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,540
Mr. Liu,

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,540
you're finally here.

4
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,400
What's wrong?

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,620
Many of the groups

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,820
we used to collaborate with

7
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,060
have terminated
their partnerships with us.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,140
What happened?

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,100
I heard

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,180
they all...

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,780
They all what?

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,540
They've chosen the Yun family instead.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,780
Yun Su?

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
More or less.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,980
Who gave him the audacity?

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,540
And

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,340
why did those groups turn against us?

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,580
Yun Su doesn't have the guts.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,860
I heard it was a woman.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,780
Apparently,

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,420
she's his fiancée.

22
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:01,939
What's the matter?

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,580
All right. Got it.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,980
It's just a few clients.

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,980
Let Auntie handle it.

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,700
She'll sort it out.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,500
The old man

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,780
plans to hold a banquet

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,980
to marry off Young Lady.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,980
Notify all the suppliers

31
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,980
that worked with Mr. Xiao

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,866
to attend.

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,020
Yes.

34
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,380
I haven't decided on my marriage.

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,180
Every member of the family

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,066
must serve the family.

37
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,300
It's not up to you.

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,260
Am I clear?

39
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,060
Yes.

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,260
Zhiqiang,

41
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,180
Chunyan,

42
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,180
I leave this matter to you.

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,020
Yes, Master.

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,820
Everything went according to plan.

45
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,260
As expected of the boss.

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,380
Let the real Shangguan Chuxia
deal with the Shangguan family.

47
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,460
That's right.

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,580
She's the only one who can get hold
of the Shangguan family's secrets.

49
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,140
The Yun family has launched
an all-out offensive against

50
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,380
the Shangguan family's clients.

51
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,900
Some through personal connections,

52
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,660
others through land concessions.

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,820
Got it.

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,100
Are all the people here?

55
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,980
Are you referring
to the marriage alliance?

56
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,660
What else?

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,580
What's going on with you now?

58
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,060
Do I have to repeat myself?

59
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,140
They… they all declined.

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,740
What?

61
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,940
Has the Shangguan family fallen so far?

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,540
It appears

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
they all went to the Yun family.

64
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,940
When did Yun Su become so calculating?

65
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,300
It's not Yun Su.

66
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,860
It's Shangguan Chuxia.

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
You're not Shangguan Chuxia.

68
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,580
Your real granddaughter

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,900
is the maid from before.

70
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,300
Why are you telling me this?

71
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,340
Shangguan Chunyan has gone too far.

72
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,980
She wanted me to feed you this.

73
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,460
I know this will kill you.

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,980
Besides, Shangguan Chuxia and I
are on the same side now.

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,500
She's collecting evidence

76
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,220
of Shangguan Chunyan's crimes.

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,740
I have to go now.

78
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,420
Take care of yourself.

79
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,900
What is the meaning of this?

80
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,980
It seems you already know.

81
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,033
Old man,

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,700
you are not the head
of this house anymore.

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,060
You are incompetent.

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,500
Leave while you still have dignity.

85
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,180
Stocks have hit the limit down.

86
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,500
All the projects
have gone to the Yun family.

87
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,620
The Shangguan family
can't hold on any longer.

88
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,860
If you want,
you could try begging Madam Chun,

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,540
she might

90
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,260
help you.

91
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,340
So, this has been your goal all along?

92
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,180
Have you been colluding
with the Yun family all along?

93
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,700
Old man,

94
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,820
your biggest flaw is

95
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,980
your lack of foresight.

96
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,020
You've seriously underestimated me.

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,780
My goal is both
the Yun and Shangguan family.

98
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,580
Even Shangguan Chuxia
going to the Yun family

99
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,660
was part of my plan.

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,500
Impressive.

101
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,820
This wasn't your idea, was it?

102
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,420
This is something beyond your control.

103
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,420
This is the share transfer agreement.

104
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,900
If you sign this,

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,660
we will let you out

106
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,260
so you can be with your granddaughter.

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,620
If you refuse,

108
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,860
then forget about going anywhere.
