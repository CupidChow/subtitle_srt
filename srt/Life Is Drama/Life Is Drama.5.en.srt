[Episode 5]

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,260
I was quite unhappy just now,

3
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,366
but seeing you

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,500
made me feel much better.

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,500
Don't catch a cold.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,466
Keep watching.

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,060
No, thanks.

[Yun Su]

9
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,700
It's a nuisance call.

10
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,233
I need to leave too.

11
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:55,866
Before I go,

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,500
may I know your name?

13
00:00:59,066 --> 00:00:59,933
Feng Dongdong.

14
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:01,733
Okay.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,820
I've remembered it.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,900
Your coat!

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,180
Why are you here?

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,366
If I hadn't come,

19
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,566
you wouldn't tell me

20
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,900
that you were bullied by Chi Xi,
would you?

21
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,233
How did you know?

22
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,733
I heard it from Shangguan Chunyan.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,066
She and her niece never get along.

24
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:28,766
Let me see your injury.

25
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:30,733
It's nothing serious.

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,900
Look at your injuries.

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,766
How is it not serious?

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,466
Oh?

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,533
Mr. Yun.

30
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,466
Mr. Yun, it's been a while
since we last met.

31
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,466
I haven't come here for some time.

32
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,966
I heard Chi Xi injured his leg,

33
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,033
so I came to visit him.

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,966
Mr. Yun, you don't have to.

35
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,133
It's just a small injury.

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,766
Hey, little girl.

37
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,066
You have a lot on your mind.

38
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,833
Now you're getting close to Mr. Yun.

39
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,666
Miss Chuxue,

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,433
I'm just here to serve the tea.

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,766
I'll leave now.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Stop right there.

43
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,666
I'm telling you,

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,433
I haven't settled
last night's matter with you yet.

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Today, I'll teach you

46
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,300
what to do...

47
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,866
My husband and I are very affectionate.

48
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:19,866
There's no road ahead.

49
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:20,733
And what not to do.

50
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,766
No one can come near my husband.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Hey!

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,566
Ah!

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,966
Dear!

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,233
Dear, are you all right?

55
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:29,566
Dear!

56
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,633
Dear, come down and save me!

57
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,033
Come down and save me!

58
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,033
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:34,933
My hands slipped.

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,966
Are you okay?

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Yun Su.

62
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,466
This is designed for me
by the most famous designer

63
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,033
in the country.

64
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:12,800
How is it?

65
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:13,833
Disgusting

66
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,233
and ostentatious.

67
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,333
It's not bad.

68
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,966
You should go back and rest.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,366
The perfume scent is too strong.

70
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,066
I like

71
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,233
your indifference.

72
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,420
Mr. Shangguan is here.

73
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,340
You two talk first.

74
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,180
Remember to come find me
when you're free.

75
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,300
You caused such a big scene
as soon as you came.

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,300
Why did you do this?

77
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:48,366
Chi Xi and Chuxue

78
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:49,833
have taken so many projects from me.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,466
Shouldn't I vent?

80
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,766
What you did

81
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,033
was too much.

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,533
Mr. Shangguan, you're older than me.

83
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,780
If you want to discipline me,

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,933
you're welcome anytime.

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,666
Young man,

86
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,400
about what we discussed last time,

87
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,580
have you thought about it?

88
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,580
Ever since Xiao passed away,

89
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,233
the cooperation
between the Shangguan and Yun families

90
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,766
hasn't been as close as before.

91
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,533
This time,

92
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:14,565
I proposed the project

93
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,699
with full sincerity.

94
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,566
When you talk about Shangguan Xiao now,

95
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,733
it seems you're quite calm.

96
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,233
I know you still remember that incident.

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,940
However, so many years have passed,

98
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,100
and I'm still looking for
my dear granddaughter.

99
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,933
If it weren't for you back then,
would Shangguan Xiao have...

100
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,266
Besides, are you sincerely

101
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:43,900
looking for Shangguan Chuxia?

102
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,133
Are you here today

103
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,466
just to mock an old man like me?

104
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,580
Well, no.

105
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,980
Then why are you here?

106
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,460
I missed you.

107
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,666
I came to see you.

108
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,300
Hmph.

109
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,433
You're here to see her, right?
