2
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,366
I know

3
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,300
you're the real Shangguan Chuxia.

4
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,033
Let's meet tomorrow.

5
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,100
I'll help you.

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,860
Feng Dongdong

7
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,366
or Shangguan Chuxia,

8
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,066
it matters not to me.

9
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,166
You really don't care?

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,540
That identity is yours.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,660
I don't care.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,740
I do.

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,466
Wang Mufeng,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,266
I don't believe it's appropriate of you

15
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,600
to call my fiance at this hour.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,620
Brother Yun Su.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,066
I'm not your brother.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I'm your elder.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,766
You should call me uncle.

20
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,533
Never contact her again.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,700
Block him.

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,933
What do you have against Mufeng?

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,900
Mufeng?

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,133
The Wang father and son
are not as simple as they appear to be.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,566
What did he say?

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,300
He said he wanted to see me tomorrow.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,766
He wants to see you?

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,740
Fine.

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,233
I'd like to see him too.

30
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:34,066
Tell him

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
to bring his father along.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,980
The four of us will meet.

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,860
It's late.

34
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
Come to bed.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Get upstairs.

36
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,620
I've invited you here today

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,260
to hear your thoughts.

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,700
Will you continue to support
the Shangguan family

39
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,166
or will you

40
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:16,980
help me?

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,533
What brought this up?

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,166
Has the Shangguan family declared war

43
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,660
with the Yun family?

44
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:30,900
There is an impostor
in the Shangguan family.

45
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:32,766
But I think

46
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,233
you know very well

47
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,433
who the real deal is.

48
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,566
It's a huge undertaking.

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,233
Shangguan Chunyan

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,380
can't pull it off alone.

51
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,266
Who is the mastermind?

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,340
I hope

53
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,900
the Wang family isn't part of it.

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,033
The Wang family

55
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,700
may be part of the Shangguan family,

56
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,633
but we really don't know anything

57
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,220
about this.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,500
Of course, we believe you.

59
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,660
We wouldn't be sitting here

60
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,780
otherwise.

61
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,820
So,

62
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,540
what's the plan?

63
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,460
We start from the imposter, of course.

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,966
These are just your words.

65
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,333
Then continue to consider.

66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,833
We won't force you.

67
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,266
We won't insist.

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
We don't have to cooperate

69
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,366
with the Wang family.

70
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,066
What's going on?

71
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,700
Why were you in such a hurry to see me?

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,033
Shangguan Chuxia didn't reveal anything,

73
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,060
did she?

74
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,940
No.

75
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,200
Aren't you afraid the old man
will find out

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,766
you came to see me so late?

77
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,940
He's at the company.

78
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:58,766
Oh, right.

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,366
Shangguan Chuxia came to me.

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,300
It's all right.

81
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,100
Even with the Yun family on her side,

82
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,866
she can't stir up any trouble.

83
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,133
The Yun family is assisting her

84
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,860
with their shares.

85
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,233
Yun Su.

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,540
No big deal.

87
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,366
What is love?

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,820
Money matters more.

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,660
Keep your eyes peeled.

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,140
The old man may be well for now.

91
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,366
According to Mr. Liu the butler,

92
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,500
he has a terminal illness.

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,066
His days are numbered.

94
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,766
When the time comes,

95
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,833
we can get a fake Chuxia to fool him.

96
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,620
Once the old man is gone,

97
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,466
the money will be ours.

98
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,033
True.

99
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,033
It doesn't matter
if she's the real deal or not.

100
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,266
We'll do the same to Shangguan Chuxia
as we did Shangguan Xiao.

101
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,020
We'll squash them.
