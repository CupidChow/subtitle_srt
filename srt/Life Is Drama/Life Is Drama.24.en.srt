[Life is Drama]
[Episode 24]

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,980
Who is the person behind

3
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,020
Shangguan Chunyan?

4
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,660
I don't know.

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,140
And I don't want to get involved.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,500
If there's nothing else,

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,780
please leave, Mr. Yun.

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,180
Must I spill everything before

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,340
you admit what you did
to Shangguan Xiao?

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,820
You were forced to marry Shangguan Xiao

11
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,660
to pay off your debts.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,620
I know you've always had a grudge.

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,180
But

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,460
have you considered Chuxia's feelings?

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,620
Stop talking.

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,700
Leave.

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,379
Mom.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,500
Chuxia.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,980
Did you do all of this?

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,660
Why?

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,060
Why?

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,300
Your grandfather forced me
to marry your dad.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,580
After I gave birth to you,
he wanted to kick me out

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,220
and make him remarry.

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,260
Did you know that, Chuxia?

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,700
But what does all this
have to do with Dad?

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,466
He knows nothing.

28
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,020
He's also a victim.

29
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,420
Why did you do this to him?

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,020
Mom,

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,780
stop it.

32
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,100
You can't keep making mistakes.

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,780
Stop?

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,200
I've pretended to be a lunatic
for all many years

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,180
just for this moment,

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,500
and you want me to stop?

37
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,220
Mom...

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,060
You should listen to the message

39
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,420
Dad left for you in the recorder.

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,340
What?

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,900
Listen for yourself.

42
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,420
I love you

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,740
and our child.

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,500
By the time you hear this recording,

45
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:09,866
I might not be around anymore.

46
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,500
I want to apologize.

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,633
I didn't know

48
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,700
Father forced you

49
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,420
to marry me back then.

50
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,700
I know you harbor resentment
towards the Shangguan family,

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,580
and I know
there's someone else in your heart.

52
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,260
But I've never blamed you.

53
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,220
I only regret

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,740
that I couldn't bring happiness
to you and our child.

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,740
Wan'er,

56
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,933
I've liquidated all my assets

57
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,233
to compensate the shareholders

58
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,140
who suffered losses because of me.

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,660
The rest is for you.

60
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,060
If you can reunite with our daughter,

61
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,060
live a good life.

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,780
Don't return to the Shangguan family.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,320
[One week later]

64
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,860
Sister-in-law,

65
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:54,733
according to Shangguan Hong,

66
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,620
this is the fortune he left Mr. Xiao.

67
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,660
This is his letter of apology.

68
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,233
He wants to release it
after the press conference.

69
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,180
He wants to clear

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,700
your father's name.

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,380
Donate the fortune

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,420
to the children's fund.

73
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,900
That was my father's wish.

74
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,933
I also hope it can help all the parents

75
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,066
who have lost their children

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
and the left-behind children.

77
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,900
Yes, of course.

78
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,780
Well.

79
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,420
It's over now.

80
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,060
It's finally over.

81
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,500
All the best to our partnership.

82
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,540
All the best to our partnership.

83
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,780
Is this...

84
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,620
going back to its owner?

85
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,660
I'll get you a new one.

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,940
Hey, kid,

87
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,380
marry me.

88
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,500
I made no promises

89
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,580
about keeping my distance.

90
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,220
Okay.

91
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:49,581
[End]
