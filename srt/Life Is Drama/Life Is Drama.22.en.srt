2
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,981
Mr. Yun.

3
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:30,660
Wang Mufeng!

4
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,060
Where's Chuxia?

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,281
Hold your horses.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,348
Don't be so agitated.

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,060
Forgot to tell you.

8
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,648
My wedding with Chuxia

9
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,780
is about to begin.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,014
Wang Mufeng,

11
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:47,100
are you tired of living?

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,914
Every move you make now could affect

13
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,414
my relationship with Chuxia.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,700
Mr. Yun,

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,648
those who do great things

16
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,740
must remain composed.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,940
Whatever the case is,

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,940
I only want her to be safe.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,714
If you want her to be safe,

20
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:19,714
you need to behave for the time being.

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,500
Wang Mufeng,

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,748
if my guess is right,

23
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:27,914
you have someone assisting you.

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,914
We'll see how capable you are.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,214
That guy really isn't as simple

26
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:40,780
as he appears.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,380
Alcohol.

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,381
It's been a long day as a waiter.

29
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm exhausted.

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,381
Yun Tun,

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,914
look into the connections

32
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:56,420
between Lin Wan'er and the Wang family.

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,300
Do you suspect...

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,700
And while you're at it, gather all
the evidence against Shangguan Chunyan.

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,940
Now all that's left is the catch.

36
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,660
That is our shop.

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,981
Behind that is our commercial park.

38
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,148
This street is
the main commercial street.

39
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:39,281
The part at the back is

40
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,140
our secondary building.

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,948
If you're interested,

42
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,140
you can give it a try.

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,580
So, it is you.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,314
The Wang family finally
has some blood ties

45
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:55,681
with the Shangguan family.

46
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,100
Chuxia seems to be
a good match for our Mufeng.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,614
The little fox

48
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:02,114
is one of the better ones
of the Shangguan family.

49
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:04,700
But she has too many ideas
for her own good.

50
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,714
After she marries Mufeng,

51
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,980
you should have him educate her.

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,848
Smile more.

53
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,940
Even if you're acting,
you have to make it look real.

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,900
Otherwise,

55
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,820
I won't let you off easily.

56
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,948
I never realized

57
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:29,940
you were such a good actor.

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,940
And to think I considered you a friend.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,420
Friend?

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,580
I thought you said you were using me.

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,900
I have no friends.

62
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,414
I just want my adoptive parents

63
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:46,820
to approve of me.

64
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,140
Approve of you?

65
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,081
Is it worth doing all this

66
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,414
for their approval?

67
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:52,148
Of course.

68
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,420
They give me dignity.

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,948
All of you will have

70
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,220
to look up to me.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,081
Fine.

72
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,660
Just remember your promise

73
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,340
to treat my mother well.

74
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,348
As long as you behave,

75
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,900
I guarantee you and your mother

76
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,860
will live a peaceful life.

77
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,981
Come on, look at the camera.

78
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,259
Yes, smile.

79
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,913
Everything is ready.

80
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:20,214
The Shangguan family
has already signed the agreement

81
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:22,740
to transfer all the shares
to the Wang family.

82
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,681
The Yun family's clients
are also preparing

83
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,300
to work with the Wang family.

84
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,380
The Shangguan Group

85
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,940
will see a change in ownership.

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,660
I've wronged my daughter.

87
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:39,440
[15 years ago].

88
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,114
Yun Su's taken cared of?

89
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,980
Yes.

90
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,020
I've deleted the footage.

91
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,181
Ms. Lin. Mr. Wang.

92
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,914
Photos taken?

93
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,540
It's done.

94
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,581
Wan'er.

95
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:06,948
Wan'er,
I know you don't want to hear this,

96
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:08,681
but it's enough for me

97
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,614
to bear all of this by myself.

98
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:10,620
You have a good life now.
to bear all of this by myself.

99
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,248
You have a good life now.

100
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,214
Shangguan Xiao loves you too...

101
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,340
That's enough, Tianye.

102
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,460
The Shangguan family is nothing
but a group of robbers.

103
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,448
They've taken everything from me.

104
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,981
What about Chuxia?

105
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,014
You won't change my mind.

106
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,100
I'll infiltrate his family step by step

107
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:34,540
over the next ten years and turn them

108
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,420
against each other.

109
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,780
Do you think all I did was worth it?

110
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,580
Tianye and I were meant for each other.

111
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,740
I was his beloved fiancée.

112
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,660
Then, I fell ill.

113
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,580
We couldn't do anything.

114
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,414
In a way,

115
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,260
the Shangguan family saved my life.

116
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,140
They paid for my recovery.

117
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,300
They wanted me
to give Shangguan Xiao a son.

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,780
When I gave birth to Chuxia,

119
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,981
they were unhappy

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,220
I gave them a daughter.

121
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,220
They even wanted Shangguan Xiao
to divorce me and remarry.

122
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,740
Fortunately,

123
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,820
karma caught up

124
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,980
with them.
