2
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,660
Let's go inside.

3
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,540
I'll take good care of you.

4
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,140
Leave!

5
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,833
You still think you're the young lady
you once were?

6
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,900
I don't care to be a young lady

7
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
and I don't care to have anything
to do with you.

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,459
If it weren't for my mother,

9
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:02,620
I...

10
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:04,866
Wang Mufeng.

11
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,540
Why are you doing this?

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,980
I'm an orphan.

13
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,220
From the day my father adopted me,

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,860
my life

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,900
belongs to the Wang family.

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,833
All right.

17
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,340
Go inside.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,940
You are mine tonight.

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,300
What? Are you hoping for a miracle?

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,460
Yun Su

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,700
is not coming to save you.

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,540
Chuxia.

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,260
Come with me.

24
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,980
My mother is still in his hands.

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,780
I can't leave.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,780
Yun Su,

27
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,340
your woman

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,700
is mine now.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,620
Your act is over.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
He's deceiving you.

31
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:10,780
Come with me.

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,500
Tomorrow, I'll take you to your mother.

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,780
How does Yun Su have this photo?

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,766
What do we do now?

35
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,340
The old man already knows?

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,820
So what?

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Isn't the Shangguan family
already in our control?

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,340
Is that so?

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,180
Dad!

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,380
Why are you here?

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,820
Didn't you tell Wang Mufeng
to keep an eye on them?

42
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,860
Say something!

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,860
Yun Su has found out about everything.

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,066
Wang Tianye!

45
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,220
You betrayed us!

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,660
Enough.

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,860
Stop it.

48
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,580
Yun Su has told me everything

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,220
and has all the evidence against you.

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,580
The police are on their way.

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,866
Master...

52
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:08,533
Dad!

53
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,266
I'm your daughter!

54
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,966
How can you do this to me?

55
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,860
Xiao was your family, too, wasn't he?

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,300
Master...

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,100
I...

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,260
They tricked me.

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,340
It was all Chunyan

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,300
and Wang Tianye!

61
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,833
Wang Tianye set me up!

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Stop talking.

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,780
Xiao,

64
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,940
I was wrong.

65
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,740
Things have finally come to an end.

66
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,860
Dad!

67
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,780
Yun Su?

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,980
What brings you here?

69
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,220
What's your relationship
with Wang Tianye?

70
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,940
Wang Tianye?

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,900
I don't know him.

72
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,620
You're lying.

73
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,900
I've had them look into it.

74
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,800
This street used to be where

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,220
you and Wang Tianye lived together.

76
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,400
Then,

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,100
the Shangguan family
found an opportunity

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,580
and maliciously took over.

79
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,260
Wang Tianye should have been

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,180
at odds with the Shangguan family.

81
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,566
Yet, somehow,

82
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,660
Wang Tianye joined the Shangguan family

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,980
and became one of
Shangguan Hong's most trusted aides.

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,140
And you

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,180
married Shangguan Xiao.

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,340
Both of you are seeking revenge
against the Shangguan family.

87
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,660
That's impossible.

88
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,540
If I hadn't pretended to go crazy,

89
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,420
the Shangguan family
would never have spared me.

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,060
So,

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,620
it seems we have a common enemy.

92
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,140
Tell me then,

93
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,060
who is the person behind

94
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,100
Shangguan Chunyan?

95
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,700
I don't know.

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,300
And I don't want to get involved.

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,580
If there's nothing else,

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,020
please leave, Mr. Yun.

99
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,380
Must I spill everything before

100
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,220
you admit what you did
to Shangguan Xiao?
