2
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,180
Take her to the countryside

3
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,460
and never come back again.

4
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:37,220
Grandpa,

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,340
I don't want to go to the countryside.

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,766
It's all Auntie's orders.

7
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:40,866
How dare you mention her?

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,140
This video was given to me by Chi Xi.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,300
What?

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,020
Chi Xi?

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,933
Even your husband can't stand you.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,400
You've gone mad,

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,380
girl!

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,740
No, Grandpa.

15
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,566
It must be that jerk, Shangguan Chunyan.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,740
She wants to kick me out
of the Shangguan family

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,266
and take all the property herself.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,380
Grandpa, you have to believe me.

19
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,500
Take her down.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,333
Grandpa, I don't want to.

21
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,100
Old habits die hard.

22
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:02,866
You're not a part
of the Shangguan family anymore!

23
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:03,666
Miss Chuxue.

24
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,033
Please leave.

25
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:04,866
I'm not leaving.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,260
Don't touch me!

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,800
It's really Shangguan Chunyan
who instructed me!

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,380
Grandpa!

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,466
Mr. Shangguan,

30
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,700
she has been sent to the car.

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,700
Where's Chunyan?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,333
She seems to have gone to find someone.

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
When she comes back,

34
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,533
tell her to see me.

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,380
Yes, Mr. Shangguan.

36
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,833
Who are you?

37
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,666
Who are you?

38
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,420
Who are you?

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,200
Miss Chunyan, this is
Feng Dongdong's house.

40
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,820
What's your relationship
with Feng Dongdong?

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,500
She's my daughter.

42
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,660
Your daughter?

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,533
Miss Chunyan, could it be...

44
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,249
I adopted her.

45
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,540
Adopted?

46
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,566
When?

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,366
I can't remember.

48
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,066
I advise you to think carefully.

49
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,900
Think carefully.

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,133
I'll think carefully.

51
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,766
Give a good answer.

52
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,300
The money is all yours.

53
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:04,166
I'll think carefully.

54
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:07,299
Right!

55
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,633
That night...

56
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,100
Money!

57
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,966
My money!

58
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,433
Today, Shangguan Group announced

59
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,433
Miss Shangguan Chunyan
and Mr. Yun Su from the Yun Group

60
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,420
are about to get engaged
and will hold a banquet dinner.

61
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,600
Dad.

62
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,033
You look particularly good today.

63
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,133
I feel like

64
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,233
I'm looking at your young self.

65
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm happy today.

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,466
You and Yun Su

67
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,033
are a perfect match.

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Dad.

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,966
Did Yun Su agree?

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,133
I haven't seen anyone

71
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,033
from the Yun family until now.

72
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,300
Don't worry.

73
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,860
I've already talked to the old man
from the Yun family.

74
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,400
Miss Chun,

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,833
someone claiming to be

76
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,166
Feng Dongdong's adoptive mother came.

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,300
Don't let her in.

78
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,060
Okay.

79
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,580
Miss Chun, Mr. Yun is here.

80
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,940
Dad.

81
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,400
I want to break them up.

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't stop me!

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,433
Calm down.

84
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,800
Considering our brotherhood in the past,

85
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,700
I'm begging you.

86
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,200
They want to harm my daughter.

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,033
All I ask from you is to protect her.

88
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:31,933
Shangguan Chuxia,

89
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,700
I can only protect you
using this fake engagement.

90
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,666
This is also fulfilling
my promise to your father.

91
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,100
I want everyone to know

92
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,660
that you are mine.

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,866
Get ready.

94
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,366
We're shooting the cover.

95
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,866
How do I pose?

96
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,433
I'm so mad!

97
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,380
What's your name again?

98
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:39,966
Me?

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,860
Feng Dongdong.

100
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,166
Yun Tun.

101
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,340
What's going on?
