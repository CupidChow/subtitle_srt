2
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,460
I know something about Shangguan Xiao.

3
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,900
Since I'm friends with Chuxia,

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,966
so I'm telling you.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,333
Tell me.

6
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:39,600
I won't spill the beans.

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,660
Lin Wan'er, Shangguan Xiao's wife,

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,000
many people said

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,340
she had depression

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,233
and passed away,

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,033
but my father

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,733
told me she's still alive.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,100
I'll bring you to see her later.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,966
Good girl, Chuxia.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,900
Lin Wan'er?

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,020
Is she really my mother?

17
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,633
She disappeared

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,166
after your father's incident.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,433
Later, I heard she died of depression.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,566
Who knows...

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,900
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,500
Who sent you here?

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,166
Was it Mr. Shangguan who sent you here?

24
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:37,800
Get lost!

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't want to see anyone!

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,966
Are you sure she'll want to see you?

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,566
This patient's mental condition

28
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:45,000
is terrible.

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,133
Mom.

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
Mom.

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,033
You're...

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,433
Mom, I'm Chuxia.

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,400
Mom?

34
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,765
I'm your mother.

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,500
Baby, were you calling me?

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,966
It was me,

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,733
Mom.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,180
Why did you become like this?

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,933
Who caused this?

40
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,833
I can't say.

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,600
If I do,

42
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,500
my child will be in danger.

43
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,400
I can't say!

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,066
No, I can't.

45
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:29,833
Mom.

46
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,020
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,633
I'm with my daughter.

48
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,900
Go out!

49
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,933
Get lost!

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,780
Let them be alone for a while.

51
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,900
But...

52
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,533
Just for a while.

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,933
Fine.

54
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,660
You're my daughter.

55
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,833
Take care of her for me.

56
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,500
This is my younger daughter.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,566
I'm so happy.

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,166
I have

59
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,600
two daughters now.

60
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,766
Can you tell me a story?

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,733
They're all liars.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,580
The Shangguan family are all liars.

63
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,800
Chuxia.

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,333
What are you going to do now?

65
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,233
It must be them
who caused my family to fall apart.

66
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,833
I need to find evidence.

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,380
I'll help you.

68
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,500
No, thanks.

69
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,800
You've helped me enough.

70
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,366
Why did you say so much nonsense?

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,580
I said I'd help you.

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,200
Why?

73
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,933
It's because...

74
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,933
Forget it.

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,600
After this is over,

76
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,260
you have to hand over
the Shangguan family's projects to me.

77
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,633
What do you mean?

78
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,633
You only have two choices.

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,500
First,

80
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,866
go back to being a maid,

81
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:29,600
Feng Dongdong.

82
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,433
You can only hide

83
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,420
and fight alone.

84
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,200
I know it's hard,

85
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,966
but I won't give up.

86
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,020
You have another choice.

87
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,460
You can openly return
to the Shangguan family.

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,380
What is it?

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,780
Let me be your fiancee.

90
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,500
You and I will work together.

91
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,333
Fiancee?

92
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,733
I need the Shangguan family's projects,

93
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,020
and you need my help.

94
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,866
We'll cooperate,

95
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,260
each getting what we need.

96
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,000
At the engagement party in a few days,

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
you must make everyone believe

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,220
that you are my fiancee.

99
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,333
It's just a show.

100
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,460
Just cooperate with me.
