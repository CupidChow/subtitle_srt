2
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,620
Young Lady,
these are freshly picked fruits.

3
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,540
Please try them.

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,833
They are so sour.

5
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,966
How can you serve this to me,
the young lady of the house?

6
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:36,260
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,866
Get lost!

8
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:37,980
I'll tell Grandpa

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,100
and have you all fired.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,540
Chuxia.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,180
Grandpa.

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,733
What's going on here?

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,400
Grandpa,

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,580
didn't you say
you'd take me to the company?

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,540
Let me be the general manager.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,380
Being the general manager is no game.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,900
The Shangguan Group is responsible

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,380
for tens of thousands.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,940
I was only kidding.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,660
The general manager must be Auntie.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,020
I'll just assist her.

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,580
Are you so sure
that it will be your Auntie's?

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,200
Auntie was always
the nicest to me when I was little.

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,020
Now that my dad is gone,

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,233
it's only natural
that it would go to my auntie.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,580
You have a way with words.

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,980
Treat

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,500
the staff better.

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,366
They've been with our Shangguan family

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,020
for many years.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,400
I understand, Grandpa.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,066
Come on. Let's go.

33
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:24,860
Let's go to the company.

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,100
Zhiqiang.

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,580
Come on. Take her to company.

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,780
Yes, Master.

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,020
Well?

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,420
She didn't pick up.

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
Did she tell you

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,400
where she was going today?

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,060
She said she went to the dock

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,700
to meet a client today.

43
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,980
Mr. Li?

44
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,980
He's a known scum.

45
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,540
If he informs the Shangguan family...

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,460
Yun Tun,

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,540
keep calling her.

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,866
I'll go look for her.

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,420
To think his daughter

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,300
was as outstanding as he was.

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,860
This time,

52
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,300
I will definitely support your father.

53
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,220
Plus,

54
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,333
your proposal

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,140
is indeed

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,780
better than the one Shangguan Chunyan

57
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,700
showed me.

58
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,060
Regardless of personal sentiment

59
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,940
or the company's stance,

60
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,180
I will be supporting you.

61
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,580
Thank you.

62
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,740
Sister-in-law,

63
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,333
where are you now?

64
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,220
What's wrong?

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,140
The Shangguan family
might be looking for you.

66
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,220
The Shangguan family?

67
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,940
By the way,

68
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:50,780
Mr. Yun is here too.

69
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,940
Yun Su?

70
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,900
I'll be right back.

71
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,940
Tell him to go home.

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,900
All right.

73
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,420
Take care of yourself.

74
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,620
I will.

75
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,820
Come... Come in.

76
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,900
I...

77
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,820
What's with this?

78
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,300
Don't come closer.

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,420
I'm going to sleep.

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,700
Why won't you let me see you?

81
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,700
You're hiding something from me.

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,333
You're hurt!

83
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm fine.

84
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,860
It's just a small injury.

85
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,260
I'm all right.

86
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,260
It's not a big deal.

87
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,500
Don't cry.

88
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,580
I'll get you something for it.

89
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,580
What are you doing?
