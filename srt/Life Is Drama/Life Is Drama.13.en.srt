[Episode 13]

2
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,933
It's nice to meet you.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,100
My name is Feng Dongdong.

4
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,533
A Feng? I've never heard about you.

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,333
Trust me,

6
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,433
you should give up.

7
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,580
You're not worthy of marrying him.

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,600
I am an ordinary person.

9
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,820
Please have a look.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,933
The Yun's family's wealth
has nothing to do with me.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,540
Really?

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,866
What are you after, then?

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,466
Yun Su helped me.

14
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,600
I'll be sure to repay your kindness.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,100
I've done my research.

16
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:00,333
Compared to the Shangguan family,

17
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,366
the Yun family has far fewer clients.

18
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,600
I can get

19
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,833
over 70% of

20
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,266
the Shangguan family's client base

21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,460
within a month.

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,200
Utter nonsense.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,260
I don't buy it.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,733
This is the information I brought.

25
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,566
I believe none of you
have seen this before.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,500
Li Chunlai was Shangguan Xiao's
best friend.

27
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,466
After Shangguan Xiao passed away,

28
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,400
he remained a business partner
of the family.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
But, he changed his name to Zhang Wei.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,566
There must be a reason.

31
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,166
Our first mission

32
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:32,700
is to win his trust.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,140
Let's go.

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,933
You need to register.

35
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,233
All right.

36
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:44,740
Zhang Wei.

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,700
Zhang Wei.

38
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:49,966
Zhang Wei.

39
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,700
Why are there so many Zhang Weis?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We did some research.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
There are thousands of people
with the same name.

42
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,732
A big shot lawyer

43
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:08,420
has the same name too.

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,333
I know.

45
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,660
What's the plan now?

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,566
Let's wait.

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,433
No.

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,500
My time is precious.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,066
How about you go back first?

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,666
I can handle it myself.

51
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,633
No,

52
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,766
we agreed

53
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:34,500
to do it together.

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
This is a fine work of art.

55
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,233
You have a keen eye.

56
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,933
The artwork is called "Assassin."

57
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,366
Look at the concise lines,

58
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,400
portraying a sharp and fierce style.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Can't you feel

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,020
the overwhelming killing intent?

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes, I can feel it.

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,500
How much

63
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,100
is this piece?

64
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,740
40 million.

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,020
It does have a strong intent indeed.

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,766
If it swindles all your money,

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,566
then the assassin has succeeded.

68
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:18,200
You're a funny guy.

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,266
This way, Mr. Zhang.

70
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,020
What?

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,133
What do you mean by
swindling all my money?

72
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:24,980
Explain.

73
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,733
Artworks don't have price tags

74
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,333
because they are meant for auctions,

75
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,300
and that's because they know

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,300
they're not worth it.

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,066
They make up stories

78
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:35,700
and origins

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,133
to sell them for millions,

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,060
to fools like you.

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,166
What are you saying?

82
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,460
Art is priceless.

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Art is indeed priceless.

84
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,733
But from what I know,

85
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,733
you're just a hustler in the art world.

86
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,833
Painting a piece in two hours

87
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,866
and selling it for millions,

88
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,333
that takes some audacity.

89
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,660
You're even more pretentious than I am.

90
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,600
Your wise words

91
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,766
have given me a wake-up call.

92
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,020
How should I address you?

93
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,140
Yun Su.

94
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
My name is Feng...

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,860
Shangguan Chuxia.

96
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,766
Who?

97
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,600
I have something to attend to.
I must go.

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,366
Let's talk next time.

99
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,266
Why did you introduce me
as Shangguan Chuxia?

100
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,500
He is Li Chunlai.

101
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,933
You're from the Shangguan family...

102
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,780
Li Chunlai.

103
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,066
Did the Yuns come looking for you?

104
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:54,966
Yes.

105
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,420
You want to help them?

106
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,466
No.

107
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,060
I know you guys
wouldn't let that happen.

108
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,700
It's good that you know that.

109
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,380
The Shangguan family
is not what you can mess with.

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,566
I won't help them

111
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,060
even if they find out who I am.

112
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,260
Really?

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,700
Weren't you Shangguan Xiao's friend?

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,700
So am I.

115
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,100
Yun Su.

116
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,300
Bastard, it's you again.

117
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,540
I've been itching to beat you up.

118
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,100
Don't do it.

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,140
Don't dirty your hands
for someone like him.

120
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,620
You and your father

121
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,100
are both cowards.

122
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,660
Don't talk about my dad like that!

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,066
I will.

124
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,533
Shangguan Xiao

125
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,580
is a coward.
