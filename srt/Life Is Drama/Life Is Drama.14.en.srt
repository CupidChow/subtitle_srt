00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,666
Shangguan Xiao

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,900
is a coward!

4
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,300
You are but a lapdog in the family.

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,340
How dare you hurt her?

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,633
Yun Su, you...

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,733
Mr. Li!

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,566
Mr. Li,

9
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,700
rest assured.

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,366
With me around,

11
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,340
they won't dare to touch you.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,533
You're a Shangguan.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,220
Why would you help the Yuns?

14
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:03,766
For my father.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,580
Uncle Li,

16
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,600
you know who is
behind my father's death,

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,460
don't you?

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,940
The Li family and the Shangguan family
have been close for generations.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,566
Dad,

20
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,100
Chi Xi called.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,433
The Yuns have found Li Chunlai

22
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,033
and are discussing
a possible partnership.

23
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,300
What should we do?

24
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:30,766
Uncle Li,

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,066
I really hope we can reach an agreement

26
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:33,860
on this partnership.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Chuxia,

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,300
setting aside
the Shangguan family's threats,

29
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,300
do you even know
what a partnership means?

30
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,180
What can you bring to the table?

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,166
Uncle Li,

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
the most appealing aspect
of your supermarkets

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,433
has always been the desserts.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,900
They have impressive sales,

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,666
but

36
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,166
there is

37
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,000
a significant issue

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
you might not

39
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,780
be aware of.

40
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,700
What issue?

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,966
You sell desserts
in various districts of the city

42
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,433
at high prices,

43
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,433
but you've never clearly
labeled the prices

44
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,780
on the packaging.

45
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,433
What does that have to do with anything?

46
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,860
Willing buyer, willing seller.

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,300
Mr. Li,

48
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,460
for the average consumer,

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,666
all they want is

50
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,420
an ordinary product.

51
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,033
But when they check out,
it's priced ten times higher.

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,866
Yet, they have to buy it
to save their pride.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,140
In the long run,

54
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,566
there will be a public outcry.

55
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,366
Just like

56
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,833
this piece of art.

57
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,700
Water can carry a boat,
but it can also overturn it.

58
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:33,066
If you don't take
the consumer's interests into account,

59
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,220
how can a supermarket thrive?

60
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,633
That's right.

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,366
Uncle Li,

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,633
I truly hope
we can make this partnership

63
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:45,700
possible.

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,433
Not only for my dad,

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,666
but also for your business

66
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,060
to reach new heights.

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,900
I don't want to get involved

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,566
in this mess.

69
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,933
I understand.

70
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,200
But I still hope

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,940
you'll consider my suggestion.

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,260
I look forward to your final response.

73
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,233
Mr. Li,

74
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,866
we'll take our leave now.

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,866
She's the old man's favourite.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,033
Then, I'll find a fake to replace her.

77
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,940
The real one can forget
about coming back.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Auntie,

79
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,500
are these all for me?

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,266
I'm warning you.

81
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,340
Don't look so pathetic and petty.

82
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,933
I brought you here to play a young lady.

83
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,340
Got it.

84
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:52,800
And...

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,740
It's late.

86
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,566
Auntie,

87
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,966
let's talk about it tomorrow.

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,140
I'm going to bed.

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,566
Is it done?

90
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,140
Yes.

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,033
Let's wait for the show.

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,366
Wait until Chuxia uses the Yun family
to bring down the Shangguan Group.

93
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,066
Keep things calm at home.

94
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,140
Do you understand?

95
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,740
I am Shangguan Chunyan.

96
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,619
Do not talk to me with that attitude.

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,666
If I expose what you did

98
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,660
to Xiao ten years ago...

[Paternity Test Report]

100
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,500
How could this be?

101
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,233
How can I suddenly have
two granddaughters?

102
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,780
Master,

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,433
there are many in this world

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,500
that wish to get close
to the Shangguan family.

105
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,766
That Shangguan Chuxia

106
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,333
must have realized how much
you miss your granddaughter

107
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,833
during her stay.

108
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,900
That's why she did it.

109
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,300
Now that you've found
your real granddaughter,

110
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,933
there's nothing for you to worry.

111
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,266
No one else knows about this, right?

112
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,700
Worry not, Master.

113
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,666

What does that have to do with me?
