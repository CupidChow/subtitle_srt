2
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,700
Chuxia.

3
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,020
Mufeng?

4
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,220
Why are you here?

5
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,820
I heard about what happened
between you and Yun Sun.

6
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,966
I came

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,300
because I was worried about your safety.

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,940
I'm fine.

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,500
You can't stay at Yun Su's place.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,580
Come with me.

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,620
Stop it.

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,740
After the way Yun Su treated you,

13
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,740
do you still want to give him a chance?

14
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,380
That's personal.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,180
Where are you going?

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,133
I want to get my mother out of here.

17
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,100
I don't want
anything to do with anyone here!

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,033
Including me?

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,420
Unhand me!

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,166
You're not going anywhere.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,820
What does that mean?

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,540
Come with me,

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,300
or

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,980
you'll never see Lin Wan'er again.

25
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,233
Wang Mufeng,

26
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,060
what did you do to my mother?

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,933
Lin Wan'er is safe for now,

28
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:37,933
but she might not be

29
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:38,820
if you leave.

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,780
Take her away.

31
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,800
Did they break up?

32
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,100
I think so.

33
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,980
Otherwise, why would he look
as if his dad died?

34
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,733
Uncle,

35
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,966
you shouldn't curse yourself.

36
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,660
Bah.

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,300
Can you two stop being so noisy?

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,980
A special assistant

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,533
and a chairman.

40
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,166
Don't you two
have anything better to do?

41
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm not a monkey in a zoo.

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,100
You're one to talk.

43
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,940
What did you do to my daughter-in-law?

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,860
That's right.

45
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,433
What did you do to my sister-in-law?

46
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,860
Come clean.

47
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,340
Dad,

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,300
we've been working
with the Shangguan family for years.

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,566
What do you know about the Wang family?

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,060
The Wang family?

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,780
They just work
for the Shangguan family, right?

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
The Wang family is known

53
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,700
to be good people.

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,940
What's the problem?

55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,500
Don't change the subject.

56
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,100
Get my daughter-in-law back.

57
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,700
I'm trying.

58
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,300
There goes my sister-in-law.

59
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,820
There goes my daughter-in-law.

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
That's right.

61
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,700
I remember now.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,433
Wang Tianye was crying

63
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,300
when he talked to the old man that time.

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
He was even on his knees, begging.

65
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,020
Get up. I'll help you back to your room.

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,460
Yun Su.

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,300
I need to talk to you about something.

68
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,100
Sure.

69
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,133
The old man wants me removed.

70
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,420
Can you help me?

71
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
Sure.

72
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,020
Give me the details.

73
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,380
What's so strange about that?

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,340
Something's not right.

75
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,060
I still think something's up
with Wang Tianye.

76
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,866
They've worked for the Shangguan family
for so many years.

77
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,033
They're always known as the good ones.

78
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,399
Their hands are too clean.

79
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,533
But if there is nothing wrong with them,

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,366
why would Shangguan Xiao

81
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,266
leave a photo of Wang Tianye with others

82
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,260
in this recorder?

83
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,666
Even though the photos were damaged,

84
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,500
and I only see Wang Tianye clearly,

85
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,200
but that other person

86
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,220
must be connected
to Shangguan Xiao's death.

87
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,000
That's easy.

88
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:36,940
Let me try.

89
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,860
You?

90
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,340
I've waited for so long.

91
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,740
The day has finally come.

92
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,620
Chunyan,

93
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,740
thank you.

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,700
How long till they get here?

95
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,800
Here comes

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,233
the star of the show.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,000
Where's Grandpa?

98
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,140
Sit.

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,380
That old geezer's at home.

100
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,820
Wang Mufeng,

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,100
what do you mean by that?

102
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,820
I'll be frank with you.

103
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,100
Ms. Yan will inherit

104
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,580
the Shangguan family's wealth.

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,740
As for you,

106
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,620
you have two choices.

107
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,100
You can be my wife

108
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,580
in the Wang family

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,780
and help Ms. Yan,

110
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,300
or end up

111
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,980
like your dad.

112
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,833
You want me to marry you?

113
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,300
Why should I?

114
