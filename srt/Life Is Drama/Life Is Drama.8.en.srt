2
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,852
If you're willing to
sincerely follow me,

3
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,300
to be on my side,

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,318
I promise to give
the Wang family more face

5
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,718
in the Shangguan family.

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,918
Since Mr. Shangguan wants me
to be by your side,

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,018
then I'll follow you.

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,540
You're really obedient.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm used to it.

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,420
Ah!

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,780
Why are you so childish?

12
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,818
Actually,

13
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:20,980
there's something I've been
wanting to ask you.

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,018
Aren't you

15
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,852
my father's biggest competitor?

16
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:24,860
Why did you help him so much?
my father's biggest competitor?

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,518
Why did you help him so much?

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,652
I've said it before,

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,500
it's just your misunderstanding.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,485
Stop being so insincere.

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,420
I knew

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,085
you and my father
were childhood friends.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,452
When you were young,
you used to call him brother.

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,385
However,

25
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,940
my father was very good,

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,540
you could never beat him.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,940
Who told you that?

28
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,380
Aunt Dabao.

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,218
I asked her many things,

30
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:46,260
including matters about you.

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,260
Stop denying it.

32
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,100
You're just being childish,

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,518
always wanting to win against him.

34
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:52,860
Deep down,

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
you still see him
as the best elder brother.

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,585
Who sees him as an elder brother?

37
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,252
Just swing on your swing.

38
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,460
Why are you so nosy?

39
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
What are you doing?

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,885
Since you're here, just have fun.

41
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:09,185
Why so serious?

42
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:09,860
This is not a meeting.

43
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,980
When I was little, my father used to
bring me here to swing.

44
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,352
Every time,

45
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:15,820
I could swing until sunset.

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,152
It's almost sunset!

47
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:17,618
I'm not playing.

48
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:19,100
Just play for a bit.

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,820
Go!

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,418
How was it?

51
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:29,252
Fun, right?

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,085
Grandpa,

53
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:52,060
what did you call us here for this time?

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,580
Chunyan.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,718
Next week,

56
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,340
during Shangguan Group's event,

57
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,300
bring Feng Dongdong to Wang Tianye

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,152
and have him assign her a position.

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,818
This girl is quite smart.

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,540
It's a pity she's just a servant.

61
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,752
Grandpa,

62
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,300
isn't that inappropriate?

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,918
All right, I'll make the arrangements.

64
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,018
This time, we must unite, right?

65
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:20,052
I never thought

66
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,552
that after fighting
with each other for so long,

67
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,860
we'd actually join forces
to deal with a servant.

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,580
No.

69
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,385
I think that woman isn't so simple.

70
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,500
Don't you think she looks familiar?

71
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,500
What do you mean?

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,185
I have a feeling

73
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:35,300
that he has known her for a long time.

74
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,020
Known her for a long time?

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,540
Could it be...

76
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,780
Who is she?

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,060
Don't you think
she looks like Shangguan Xiao?

78
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,380
Shangguan Xiao?

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,140
I've sent the photo to your phone.

80
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,452
That's the current situation
with the Shangguan family.

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,818
Feng Dongdong.

82
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,618
Okay, I got it.

83
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,385
We can't do anything
to her for the time being.

84
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:04,252
Why?

85
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,860
Don't ask too much.

86
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,218
Okay, I got it.

87
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,418
Even if I'm not allowed to,

88
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,585
I'll do it anyway.

89
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,860
What did the boss say?

90
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,980
He said to give her some threat.

91
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,985
However, Grandpa
sides with her very much now.

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
I dare not.

93
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,620
Don't you find it strange?

94
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,318
Yun Su,

95
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:23,185
my boss,

96
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,252
and my father

97
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,900
all value her so much.

98
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,318
I don't know if you remember

99
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:31,518
what my father said.

100
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,852
He said he'd leave most of his property

101
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:35,860
to Shangguan Xiao's daughter.

102
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,620
If Shangguan Chunxiao is real,

103
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,540
then all our efforts will be in vain.
