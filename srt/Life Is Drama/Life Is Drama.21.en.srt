00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,700
You want me to marry you?

3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,100
Why should I?

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,660
See for yourself.

faces its biggest crisis]

[How many secrets
is the Shangguan family hiding?]

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,112
That old bastard

8
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,878
didn't give me a single share.

9
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:53,180
All I have to do is let Lin Wan'er
see the light of day again.

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,820
You have me to thank for that.

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,478
Daughter-in-law,

12
00:00:57,778 --> 00:00:59,140
you saw for yourself.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,278
Old Mr. Shangguan's influence

14
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:02,900
is a thing of the past.

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,678
Follow us and be our puppet,

16
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,745
and you can live without worry

17
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,245
and get to see your mother
whenever you want.

18
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:10,545
Well?

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,012
I want to see my mother.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,220
Sure.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,980
You'll see her tomorrow.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,245
But from now on,

23
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,345
you're coming with us

24
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:21,140
wherever we go.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,112
Mufeng.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,220
Okay, good talk.

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,580
Follow me to your room.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,820
Finally cracked it.

29
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,460
How did you do it, Dad?

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,380
Back in the day, your dad
was a top computer science student.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,940
That's how I won over your mother.

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,500
It's him.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,612
One…

34
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:09,745
Two…

35
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,140
Three…

36
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:14,612
Mom,

37
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:15,545
are you all right?

38
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,140
Did these people hurt you?

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,445
One…

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,945
Well?

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,345
Two…

42
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,020
Have you made up your mind?

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,140
Three…

44
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,612
Okay.

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,580
I'll work with you.

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,500
But you have to let me and my mother go.

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,180
There are no more triads
in this day and age.

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,420
Who can restrict your freedom?

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,580
I mean, don't follow us anymore.

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,878
I don't want anything to do
with you people.

51
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,140
That won't do.

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,460
Once you marry Wang Mufeng,

53
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,580
you'll be my daughter-in-law.

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,700
You'll have to call me mom.

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,980
Weren't you with Liu Zhiqiang?

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,578
Liu Zhiqiang? As if he's worthy.

57
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,140
He's just a pawn.

58
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,112
All right.

59
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,620
I've said enough.

60
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,020
Your only choice
is to marry Wang Mufeng.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
Drink it.

62
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,812
Suit yourself.

63
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:14,078
If it weren't for Mr. Wang,
you wouldn't even have anything.

64
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,100
Die, then.

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,340
Mr. Wang.

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,112
How can you be so rude
to the once prestigious

67
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,380
old Mr. Shangguan?

68
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,378
Tomorrow is the day
I'm engaged to your granddaughter.

69
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:26,378
You don't seem

70
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:27,940
all that happy about it.

71
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,460
Mufeng,

72
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,220
whatever you want,

73
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,445
I'll give you everything I can

74
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,180
in my power.

75
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,820
Am I not good enough for you?

76
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,700
Do you think my family

77
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,812
will forever be

78
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:44,812
your lapdog?

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,112
Back then,
my father begged you on his knees.

80
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:51,012
But you still forced his fiancée

81
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,812
to marry that ungrateful Shangguan Xiao!

82
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,500
Do you know how pitiful my godfather is?

83
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,378
After the Shangguan Group went public,

84
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,045
you thought he was too old.

85
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,212
You wanted to replace him

86
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:02,412
with someone younger.

87
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:04,912
Do you know how much he has done

88
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,940
for the Shangguan family
all these years?

89
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,300
If it weren't for
what happened to Shangguan Xiao,

90
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,740
you would have kicked him out
a long time ago.

91
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,860
All right.

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,412
I've said my piece.

93
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:19,660
Mufeng,

94
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,878
please,

95
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,500
spare my family.

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,020
Spare you?

97
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,660
Did you show us any mercy?

98
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,412
Did we deserve that
after everything we've done

99
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,060
for the Shangguan family?

100
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,412
It's karma.

101
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,845
It's time for the Wang family

102
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,780
to be the boss.
