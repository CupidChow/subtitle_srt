00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,700
What are you doing?

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,940
Hurry up!

4
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,580
My wife will be back soon.

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,060
How do I explain this injury to her?

6
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,660
Chi Xi!

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,500
Miss Chuxue is back.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:40,940
I'll leave first.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,733
Hey!

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,700
Chi Xi!

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,566
I was only gone for a few days,

12
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,700
and you're messing around at home.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,333
Do you have no shame?

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,700
Ouch.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,860
I didn't do anything.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,780
It's clearly Feng Dongdong's fault.

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,460
She got me drunk.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,620
Beast!

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,700
Miss Chuxue!

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,500
Your husband is a beast!

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,940
He wanted to take advantage of Dongdong.

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,980
If Dongdong hadn't been smart,

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,060
she would've...

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,180
She would've been abused!

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,700
Do you know?

26
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,540
You don't

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,620
need to discipline my man.

28
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,580
So annoying.

29
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,420
You're fired.

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,980
Miss Chuxue, I'm begging you.

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,100
Please don't fire me.

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,340
I have elderly parents
and children to support.

33
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,260
Get lost!

34
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,340
Miss Chuxue.

35
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,940
I won't pursue this matter further

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,380
and won't spread it outside.

37
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,620
Please spare Aunt Dabao.

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,060
Spare her?

39
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,900
I haven't even said I'll spare you yet.

40
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,933
I want you to take care of me,

41
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:33,980
not my husband.

42
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,400
Cheap woman.

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,100
Being beautiful is a curse.

44
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,380
Oh, oh.

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,700
Dear niece,

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,340
who bullied you again?

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,140
Auntie,

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm just dealing with a few servants.

49
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,700
You don't need to worry.

50
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,420
Did my niece hit you?

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,740
Do you want to call the police
or ask for compensation?

52
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,380
I'll help you.

53
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,260
Shangguan Chunyan,

54
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,420
what's wrong with you?

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,780
You don't even call me auntie.

56
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,140
So rude!

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,500
I'll tell Dad about this.

58
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,460
How can you manage others
with such arrogance?

59
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,140
If you can't manage people,
how can you manage our family's assets?

60
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,340
All right.

61
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,780
You're dismissed.

62
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,500
I'll let you off today.

63
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,500
Miss Chuxue,

64
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,660
I have evidence
of your husband's infidelity.

65
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,420
You don't love him.

66
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,260
What do you mean?

67
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,940
The wedding ring.

68
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
You were wearing it
when you left that day.

69
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,340
You went to see the other man.

70
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,060
So what?

71
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,740
Why do you have such a good memory?

72
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,540
I have your husband's backup phone.

73
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,740
Its contents

74
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,420
may be useful for your divorce case.

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Together with my testimony,

76
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,860
it's enough to leave him penniless.

77
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,020
I didn't expect to find
what I've been looking for for so long,

78
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,820
and it's found by you.

79
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,700
What do you want?

80
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,540
I want to be a person
with influence in this family

81
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,380
and earn more money.

82
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,860
You're so direct.

83
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,980
I like it.

84
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,340
I'll consider it.

85
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,620
Then I'll take my leave for now.

86
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,940
She's so clever.

87
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,660
Looks like she can't stay here.

88
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,060
Mr. Yun,

89
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,780
are you going
to the Shangguan's tomorrow

90
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,260
to see Shangguan Chunyan

91
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,340
or to see the lady from last time?

92
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,940
I think

93
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,220
you've been too free lately.

94
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm just worried that Shangguan Chunyan

95
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,780
would use this incident
to stir up gossip.

96
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
Who doesn't know?

97
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,940
She just wants to
improve her family status

98
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,500
by marrying you.

99
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,620
Only you know, huh?

100
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,300
It's because I care about you.

101
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,100
You're already so old

102
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,660
and haven't been in any relationships.

103
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,580
There are so many women around you,

104
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,940
but you're not interested in any.

105
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,140
Are you interested

106
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,980
in...

107
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,540
You're holding the book upside down.

108
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,940
Aren't you also holding it upside down?

109
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,940
All right,

110
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,140
I'll stop.

111
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,140
I wonder what that girl is doing now.

112
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,820
Who is this girl?

113
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,260
She's a newcomer to the Shangguan's.

114
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,500
[Wang Mufeng]
Mufeng, are you still waiting?

115
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,860
It's been hours, right?

116
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,580
I'm used to it.

117
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,340
Mr. Shangguan has always been
like this with us.

118
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,740
You've worked hard, Mufeng.

119
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,020
It's okay, Dad.

120
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,220
I'm just delivering a document for you.

121
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,900
It's no big deal.

122
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,100
Wang Mufeng,

123
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,700
don't wait anymore.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,060
Mr. Shangguan has gone to bed.

125
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,220
What?

126
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,380
Please leave.

127
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,100
I've...

128
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,980
What are you complaining about?

129
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,060
The Shangguan's are keeping you

130
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,933
because they expect full obedience.

131
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,180
Don't be like that new girl over there

132
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,020
who lacks discipline.

133
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,460
What are you

134
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,140
looking at?

135
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm looking at the moon.

136
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,860
The moon?

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,900
It's not a full moon.

138
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,060
What's there to look at?

139
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,980
It used to be

140
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,340
so perfect.

141
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
By the way,

142
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,180
who are you?

143
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,220
Just an errand boy for the Shangguan's.

144
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,820
I see.

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,780
I was quite unhappy just now,

146
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,380
but seeing you

147
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
made me feel much better.
