2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,998
I don't know if you remember

3
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:29,198
what my father said.

4
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,531
He said he'd leave most of his property

5
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,580
to Shangguan Xiao's daughter.

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,340
If Shangguan Chunxiao is real,

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,260
then all our efforts will be in vain.

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,064
What if she isn't

9
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:42,460
Shangguan Chuxia?

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,860
Furthermore,

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,098
we should

12
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:46,764
refrain from going too far,
shouldn't we?

13
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:48,231
Stop worrying.

14
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,331
She's already on her way here.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,398
Later,

16
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,260
you can scare her a bit.

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,860
I've already removed
the surveillance cameras.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,940
What's in it for me then?

19
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:01,980
Don't worry.

20
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,420
The boss said as long as
you drive her away,

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:04,431
there will be some money for you.

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,698
What is it?

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,380
I'm going to discipline you properly.

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,698
Get some good shots.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,198
There will be benefits for you.

27
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:20,298
You're so arrogant

28
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,700
and favored.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,620
Ouch!

30
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,580
What's with the injury on your face?

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,998
Has your dad got
a lot of big projects lately?

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,598
Thanks to you, you said
nice things about my father

33
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:52,260
to Mr. Shangguan.

34
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,060
You're silly.

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,980
Quick, sit down.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,364
You're a guest, and I'm a servant.

37
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,020
Considering how much I've helped you,

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,564
shouldn't you sincerely thank me?

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,864
How much?

40
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:05,420
Name your price.

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,780
I'll discuss it with my father.

42
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,260
Duh.

43
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:10,780
Just have a meal with me.

44
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,364
Okay, I'll book a restaurant right away.

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,660
Would you like
French or Italian cuisine?

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,860
A roadside stall.

47
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,331
Good friends' relationships

48
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,660
always start at a roadside stall.

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,180
Okay.

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,898
Let me report
to Mr. Shangguan about my work.

51
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:24,731
No problem.

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,980
By the way,

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,564
I've never had many friends
since I was young.

54
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:31,998
You're the first one.

55
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,364
It's nice meeting you.

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,900
What if I'm just using you?

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,500
What do you mean?

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,164
Nothing. Go ahead.

59
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,940
It's okay if I'm used.

60
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,931
Why did you ask me to help investigate

61
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,540
Shangguan Xiao's matter?

62
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,531
When I was a poor college student,
Shangguan Xiao sponsored me.

63
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:01,660
I wanted to repay him,

64
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,531
but when I came back,

65
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,860
I received news
that he had committed suicide.

66
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,598
Hence, I was thinking

67
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,564
if I could find some information
about the Shangguan family,

68
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,431
or approach his closest relatives,

69
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:13,940
I could also repay them.

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
All right.

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,620
I promise you.

72
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,300
I'll inform you
if there's any news in the future.

73
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:19,664
Okay.

74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,740
Why do you keep smiling at me?

75
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,380
I just feel like

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,140
every time I see you,

77
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,131
I feel particularly close to you.

78
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,940
Particularly close?

79
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,060
Feng Dongdong,

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,498
how dare you sneak a date
without my knowing?

81
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,980
Who allows you to touch her?

82
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,220
Yun Su?

83
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,020
How come you're being so close to him?

84
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,260
We're friends. What about you, Yun Su?

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,900
When did you become
so close to Dongdong?

86
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,700
I am...

87
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm her guardian.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,900
Don't listen to his nonsense.

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,020
Please eat.

90
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,180
Why did you come over here?

91
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,164
Why do you care so much?

92
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,331
I even suspect

93
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,531
you've installed a tracker on me.

94
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,631
Tell me,

95
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,940
how did you know that I'm here?

96
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Do you hate me that much?

97
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,220
Forget it.

98
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,020
Don't disturb me.

99
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,464
Tell you what,

100
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,031
I was just about to get some information

101
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,598
from Wang Mufeng about Shangguan Xiao.

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,580
He knows nothing.

103
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,060
Actually,

104
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,498
I know something about Shangguan Xiao.
