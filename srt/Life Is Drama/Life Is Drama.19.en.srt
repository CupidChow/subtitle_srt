2
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,566
I assume
you've already made up your mind?

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,820
Chuxia,

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,780
I'm on your side this time.

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,600
I've worked for the Shangguan family

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,400
for so many years.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,980
Now, I want to live with dignity.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,340
Mr. Wang,

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,020
since we've agreed to work together,

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,180
I'll be frank.

11
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:48,933
I've found out

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
that Liu Zhiqiang and Shangguan Chunyan

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,233
framed my father,

14
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,433
but there's someone else

15
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:56,500
hiding behind the scenes,

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,000
and I haven't been able
to uncover their identity.

17
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:03,740
You should know more

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,420
about this matter, right?

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,533
I've kept it to myself

20
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,500
for a long time.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,100
Before I tell you,

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,733
you have to be prepared.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,600
The day after tomorrow
is the company's listing.

24
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:21,766
Let's have

25
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,780
a good celebration tonight.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,866
Cheers.

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,700
Congratulations,

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,460
my good friend.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,600
The Yun family and Shangguan family
are one.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,300
Thank you, Yun Su.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,980
You two are awfully close.

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,740
What about me?

33
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,166
Look at you, Mr. Xiao.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,820
Here. I'll drink with you.

35
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,800
No need.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,020
I want to thank my wife.

37
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,740
What's wrong?

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,820
Do you want to go back and rest first?

39
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:06,432
With so many people,

40
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,420
I can't leave.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,633
Shangguan Xiao,

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,780
I didn't know
you were such a lightweight.

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,380
Already swaying after a few drinks?

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,340
Come on. Get up.

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,460
Let me.

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,133
My husband needs
to pick up something in his room.

47
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:22,140
He'll be right back.

49
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,900
All right.

50
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,340
Let's go.

51
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,180
I'll take you back to your room.

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,200
Mr. Wang,

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,400
who took my father?

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,780
Well…

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,340
Please tell me.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Yun Su.

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
You're back.

58
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,966
Mhm.

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,860
Do you want to ask me what's wrong?

60
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,500
You'll tell me

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,380
if you want to.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,566
But I know even if you don't.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,433
It's because of me.

64
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,860
You know?

65
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,940
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,500
You took my father?

67
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,380
You deleted the security footage.

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,966
Only you have access

69
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,300
because you're the shareholder.

70
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes.

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,733
Why?

72
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,260
Why did you set my dad up?

73
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,633
Were you the one who put that woman

74
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:51,140
in the room with him?

75
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,466
Did you install a camera

76
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,860
and send the footage to the media?

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,400
Will you believe me

78
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:58,500
if I say no?

79
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,433
Fine.

80
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:00,860
I'll give you
a chance to explain yourself.

81
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,020
Say it now!

82
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,200
I've told you everything.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,733
I moved your father inside.

84
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:08,980
I didn't hire that woman.

85
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,133
I deleted the footage,

86
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,200
but I deleted the hallway footage

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,065
for your father's safety!

88
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:13,965
Nonsense!

89
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,566
You've been using me all along.

90
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,340
You were after my father's data.

91
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,666
You wanted to use it to gain
the Shangguan family's resources

92
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,140
for the sake of the Yun family!

93
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,500
Shangguan Chuxia.

94
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,633
Is this what

95
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,500
you think of me?

96
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,266
Chuxia!

97
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,033
Chuxia, can you please calm down?

98
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,100
How can I calm down?

99
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,100
You were the person I trusted the most.

100
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,900
Why did you lie to me?

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,833
How can I believe you now?

102
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,900
I just want the truth.

103
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,866
Chuxia…

104
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,500
Let go of me!

105
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:02,866
Chuxia…

106
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,300
Can you just let me explain?

107
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,980
I can resolve all of this soon.

108
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,220
Don't follow me anymore.

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,580
And don't contact me.

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,333
Chuxia!

111
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,380
Hello?

112
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,540
Look into Wang Mufeng for me.
