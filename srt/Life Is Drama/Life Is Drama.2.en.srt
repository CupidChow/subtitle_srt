Last time,

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,860
did you go missing at Hedi West Road?

I seem to remember.

Someone was chasing after me,

so I kept running and running.

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,460
Then I fell down and lost consciousness.

"Chuxia."

You say I'm Shangguan Chuxia,

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,020
then who are you?

56
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm a friend of your father's.

57
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:10,900
According to seniority,
you should call me uncle.

58

Your father

59
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,620
told me to take care of you.

64

I just wanted to ask you,

65
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,780
since you said my father isn't someone

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,745
who would have an affair,

67
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,540
what happened back then?

68
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,220
Was he framed?

69
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,420
These years,

70
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,900

I want to go back to that house

72

No, you can't go.

I suspect

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,260
this matter is related to
the Shangguan family.
