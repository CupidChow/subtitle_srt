00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,180
What's your name again?

3
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,540
Me?

4
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,660
Feng Dongdong.

5
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,133
Yun Tun.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,140
What's going on?

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,420
It's good news, Uncle.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,766
What's so good?

9
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,980
My plan is ruined!

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,900
Uncle.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,740
Didn't you ask me
to find true love for my cousin?

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,660
Isn't she here?

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,166
I've contributed a lot, you know.

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,900
I did say those words,

15
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,220
but how do I explain
to the Shangguan family?

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,500
What's there to explain?

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,666
Are you talking back to me?

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,566
Dad.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,266
I'm serious.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,266
Now,

21
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,180
it's just the old man, Shangguan Hong
holding up the family.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,940
It's not impossible for us,
the Yun family, to beat them.

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,133
We are not up to that level yet.

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,666
Brat, why is
your thinking not mature yet?

25
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:23,733
Dad.

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,900
When did you become so hesitant?

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
The Yun family has always
acted with integrity.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,740
Why do we have to
act in collusion with them?

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,333
If we choose the righteous path
and compare openly with them,

30
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,866
our family won't lose.

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,500
Don't worry.

32
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:37,666
I'm here.

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,033
All right.

34
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:42,933
Dad.

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,400
Where are you going?

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
To apologize.

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,066
Xiao.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,780
You have a good daughter.

39
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,580
The Shangguan family
won't be peaceful from now on.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,666
What should we do?

41
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,820
I'm completely clueless.

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
What are you doing?

43
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,666
I finally know

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,420
what your father left for you.

45
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,666
You're so great!

46
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,900
Yun Su.

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,400
Come and eat breakfast.

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Let's go.

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,580
I shall not go.

50
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,566
It's too awkward.

51
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,300
Girl, join us too.

52
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,460
I made an extra portion today.

53
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,966
It hurts! Let me go!

54
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,660
It's clearly made for her

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,400
but you kept saying
it's an extra portion.

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,820
You don't say what you mean.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,033
Anyway, even without
the Shangguan family's help,

58
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,666
we won't lose anything.

59
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,300
On the contrary,

60
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:07,700
we'll earn even more.

61
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,666
Brat!

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,233
You took all my food.

63
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,700
What can I eat?

64
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,700
How about

65
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:17,799
you eat mine?

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,500
Mine.

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,220
Just eat your own.

68
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,266
I won't have breakfast.

69
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,900
Dongdong, let me ask you one thing.

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,566
Are you sure

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,000
you want to marry into the Yun family?

72
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,300
I...

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,533
I am sure.

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,366
Okay, I got it.

75
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,100
Yun Su.

76
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,333
You should go to the company.

77
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,066
Your aunts and uncles

78
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,220
are there.

79
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,400
You should

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,260
deal with your own matters.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh no.

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,940
They're much harder to deal with
than the Shangguan family.

83
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,166
What are you thinking?

84
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,300
What are you up to?

85
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,933
Can't you be more obedient?

86
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,666
You're already grown up.

87
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,866
Why does the Yun family

88
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,066
have a disobedient child like you?

89
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,600
Our Yun family can't be ruined by you.

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,700
Uncle.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Auntie.

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
I'm at least a director of the company.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,633
Can you give me some face?

94
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,766
Stop pushing me.

95
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:12,800
Otherwise, I'll...

96
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:13,900
What will you do?

97
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,100
I'll call my wife

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,700
to come bully you!

99
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,500
That's great.

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,366
It's a chance for me
to help you check on her.

101
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:25,900
Hello,

102
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm Feng Dongdong.
