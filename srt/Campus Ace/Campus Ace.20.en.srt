(In the name of a designer)

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,770
I...

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,890
I'll head inside then.

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:43,970
Wait.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,090
Why don't we

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,490
take a walk?

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,330
But we've circled around the dormitory

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,730
for ten times.

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,810
We've only dated for three hours.

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,890
Are we going to split up so soon?

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,690
We can meet again tomorrow.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,770
All right.

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,530
I don't want to disturb you at first.

22
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,690
But you've walked ten laps.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,650
Aren't you tired?

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,850
What brings you here?

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,130
I'm now in a relationship with Momo.

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,530
Why?

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,930
Do you want to step in?

28
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,650
Momo somehow treats me as a brother.

29
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,530
Somehow, I'm your brother-in-law.

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,650
You don't talk like this
to your brother-in-law.

31
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,650
It's rude.

32
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,850
Take care of him.

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,850
My goodness!

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,330
Enough.

35
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,090
Stop joking.

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,610
The contest for Crabapple Award
is about to start.

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,010
You may join as a Ren's designer.

38
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,090
Then you can skip a preliminary round

39
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,890
and join the final straight.

40
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,010
I'm not a Ren's designer after all.

41
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,610
And you know

42
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,650
how important is the award to me.

43
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,530
This time,

44
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,890
I want to compete

45
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,010
on my own.

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,250
I respect your decision.

47
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,050
All the best.

48
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,610
Sure.

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,610
I need to go now.

50
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,410
Bye.

51
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,570
Bye, Ren Jie.

52
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,490
Where are you looking at?

53
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,530
Your boyfriend is here.

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,250
Enough.

55
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,610
I'll get inside.

56
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,250
Go.

57
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,730
Bye.

58
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,050
What are you doing?

59
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,850
Hold it.

60
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,890
Let me try yours.

61
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,810
One bite.

62
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,290
Don't run.

63
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,810
Look over there.

64
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,010
What's the matter?

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,010
This is our first date.

66
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,330
The contest is coming,

67
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,210
but I still have no inspiration at all.

68
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,290
All right.

69
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,450
Tang Momo!

70
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,890
You're the best!

71
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,330
Tang Momo!

72
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,810
You're the best!

73
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,450
Have a try.

74
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,930
Tang Momo!

75
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,690
You're the best!

76
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,570
You're the best!

77
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,290
You're the best!

78
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,290
You're the best!

79
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,010
You paint it wrongly.

80
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,810
The lake is clearly blue.

81
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,290
Why do you want to paint it pink?

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,610
I like pink.

83
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,290
Wouldn't it look good
if I paint my favourite colour?

84
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,090
It's nice.

85
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,890
That's all that matters then.

86
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,170
The most important thing
is that I like my paintings.

87
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,930
(I like it. That is what matters.)

88
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,570
Stop playing pity on me here.

89
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,570
Give me a clear explanation.

90
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,050
What's in the phone?

91
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,810
I copy your work

92
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,530
and have someone to paint for me?

93
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,850
How interesting.

94
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,530
It's the truth.

95
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,010
I don't want to be bullied
by you anymore.

96
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,210
Did I bully you?

97
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,050
I bought all your clothes,

98
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,610
bags and cosmetic.

99
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,610
You were just trying to
show your superiority.

100
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,130
You!

101
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,730
Don't hit me.

102
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,450
It's not true.

103
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,370
Feifei.

104
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,010
I didn't expect you to be like this.

105
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,450
Let's leave.

106
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,720
How could they have a falling out.

107
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,040
Who knows what was going on.

108
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,290
No way.

109
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,130
Look at this, Momo.

110
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,250
It's a good show.

111
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,090
Qiao Nuanfei plagiarised someone's
work for her graduation piece.

112
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,410
Also,

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,730
her former designs

114
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,050
were all done by someone else.

115
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,090
She plagiarised?

116
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,010
She doesn't have to go so far.

117
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,530
Why do you speak for your rival?

118
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,730
The design has been unveiled.

119
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,930
Royal Chiwick.

120
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,130
What?

121
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,290
Royal Chiwick.

122
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,850
From what I know,

123
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,330
Dormeuil produces
only 1,000m of fabric every year.

124
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,650
It's very hard to find.

125
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,410
Hard to find?

126
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,850
Huang Jingjing's family

127
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,170
is not doing well, right?

128
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,210
Do you need my help?

129
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,250
Actually,

130
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,090
I admire you quite much.

131
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,210
I think you should know

132
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,490
that Qiao Nuanfei is not

133
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,410
really friendly with us.

134
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,290
We're going to graduate after all.

135
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,410
I won't want to endure anymore.

136
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,610
Royal Chiwick.

137
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,930
Did you find this fabric?

138
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,690
Can you introduce me to it then?

139
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,850
The supply

140
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,810
may be out of stock.

141
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,050
I need to ask.

142
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,850
Sure.

143
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,930
Help me ask.

144
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,970
I guess

145
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,330
you want to tell me

146
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,650
that it is out of stock.

147
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,530
Yes.

148
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,970
The fabric is a hot item.

149
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,410
I surely know it is hot.

150
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,690
Dormeuil produces
only 1,000m every year.

151
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,650
Let alone its high price.

152
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,410
Unless you order it
years in advance,

153
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,410
you couldn't have obtained it.

154
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,850
Unless,

155
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,850
you own Dormeuil.

156
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,490
I...

157
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,490
These designs

158
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,170
and sketches.

159
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,450
They all belonged
to Qiao Nuanfei, right?

160
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,210
Only Qiao Nuanfei
won't mind the price

161
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,370
when she is designing.

162
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,170
As for you,

163
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,010
you can't afford it at all.

164
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,010
Yes.

165
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,610
I can't afford it.

166
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,610
Why is Qiao Nuanfei the only one

167
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,010
who gets all the best resources?

168
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,490
Why is everyone rallying around her?

169
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,210
I can't accept it.

170
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,970
I just want to grab it all.

171
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,770
If so,

172
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,730
I hope you can prove it
with your own strength,

173
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,170
but not like this.

174
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,930
I've recorded our conversation.

175
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,690
After all that she's done to you,

176
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,690
why do you still want to help her?

177
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,490
I heard that

178
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,250
you've gone to uphold another justice.

179
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,770
Not really.

180
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,090
I just don't like others
being misunderstood.

181
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,970
After all that she has done to you,

182
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,170
why did you want to help her?

183
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,370
Did I tell you

184
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,970
why I want to be

185
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,570
a fashion designer?

186
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,730
My father

187
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,850
was an excellent fashion designer.

188
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,650
He even won the gold medal
of Crabapple Award.

189
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,570
It's just that not long after that,

190
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,810
the trophy was taken back
by the organising committee.

191
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,570
They said my father

192
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,410
was suspected of plagiarism.

193
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,210
I was thinking that

194
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,010
he was such an outstanding

195
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,490
and arrogant person.

196
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,530
He...

197
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,970
He wouldn't copy someone else's work.

198
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,490
I trusted him,

199
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,130
but I had no proof.

200
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,530
After that,

201
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,490
my father never picked up a pencil

202
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,370
and designed a work.

203
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,850
You know what?

204
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,010
For a fashion designer,

205
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,530
plagiarism

206
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,730
is an accusation that will ruin

207
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,690
a career and even life.

208
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,210
I don't want anyone to be misunderstood

209
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,970
and ended up like my father.

210
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,010
It's fine.

211
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,810
I'm with you.

212
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,480
Pass the ball.

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,720
Pass it to me.

214
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,200
-How is the negotiation?
-We need to change like this, right?

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,840
Yes.
