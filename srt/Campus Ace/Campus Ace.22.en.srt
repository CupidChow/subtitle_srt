But you're good-looking enough.

I have a question for you.

Is Rmall designed and developed by you?

Yes.

Of course.

don't admit your wrongdoing.

Ling Yao acts so arrogant

104
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:52,415
because he has a rich father to rely on.

105
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,095
I just gave him a little punishment.
