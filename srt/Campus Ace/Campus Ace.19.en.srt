(101 methods to confess)

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,830
I like you.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,790
No way.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,070
Be my girlfriend.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,590
Impossible.

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,110
I can't do it.

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,030
I really can't.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,590
Confession is an essential step

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,790
to begin a new relationship.

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,670
No.

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,430
You need to do it.

20
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,310
Hey!

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,910
What are you drawing?

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,270
We aren't in that kind of relationship.

23
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,350
I have plenty of proof

24
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,710
that you're dating.

25
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,430
But even if I like him,

26
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,910
he may not feel the same way about me.

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,710
Must I tell her that I like her?

28
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,430
Action is what matters.

29
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,070
What if I misunderstood

30
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,430
his feelings for me?

31
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,190
I've been good to her all this while.

32
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,550
She should've felt it already.

33
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,470
For girls,

34
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,950
clarifying your feelings

35
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,870
is a sign of responsibility.

36
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,470
It even gives her
a sense of security.

37
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,030
It is also to show

38
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,750
that your relationship

39
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,990
is meaningful.

40
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,670
You're awesome as always.

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,190
You know a lot.

42
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,150
I surely do.

43
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,750
Action is the most direct.

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,510
Confession

45
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,030
doesn't really suit me.

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,830
Life still needs a sense of occasion.

47
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,030
But how should I confess?

48
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,270
I have no choice but
to use my ultimate skill.

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,510
Read this.

50

101 methods to confess.

51
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,550
Will it really work?

52
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,070
They'll come in to
play basketball from that way.

53
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,030
Then

54
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,390
it's your best time to confess.

55
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,430
No.

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,710
I think I'm not ready.

57
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,710
You're the bravest
female warrior.

58
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,470
Go for it.

59
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,830
Xiao'ai.

60
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,590
Let's forget it.

61
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,830
Sit down.

62
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,030
I think this method doesn't suit me.

63
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,790
You're only one step away.

64
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,710
Don't be a coward.

65
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,910
Look at me.

66
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,470
Don't be scared.

67
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
It's very simple.

68
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,270
I'll teach you.

69
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,790
Just do this.

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
(I have something very
important to tell you.)

71
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,166
(This matters to me,)

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
(but you matter the most to me!)

73
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,365
(It was a pleasure to meet you)

74
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,170
(and we have so much fun together.)

75
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
(I like you. Will you be my boyfriend?)

76
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,470
Well,

77
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,750
what do you think of
this kind of confession?

78
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,430
I will!

79
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,310
Listen to me.

80
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,470
You may have misunderstood it.

81
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,470
We're just...

82
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:10,950
It's not what you think.

83
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,950
I don't care.

84
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,510
Xiao'ai.

85
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,910
I accept your confession to me.

86
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,430
You're responsible for me.

87
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,590
No.

88
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:25,790
Be responsible.

89
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,310
Later,

90
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,510
just do as I've told you.

91
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,230
Then,

92
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,270
it will work out.

93
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,750
Are you sure?

94
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,150
That's a sure thing.

95
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,350
She is coming.

96
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
You're all by yourself.

97
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:42,950
Good luck.

98
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,390
I like you.

99
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,230
Mother.

100
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,350
Feifei said you haven't
contacted her for a month.

101
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,550
You're fiddling around here.

102
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,590
I'm venturing.

103
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,030
In both romance and career.

104
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,510
I'm not fiddling around.

105
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,750
Who are you?

106
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,070
You must be Yao's older sister.

107
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm his partner.

108
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,390
Well,

109
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,070
this is our newly ventured application.

110
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,830
Look.

111
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,350
Anyway,

112
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,910
this method of confession

113
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,790
is too old-fashioned.
