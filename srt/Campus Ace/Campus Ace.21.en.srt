I don't need this to prove my worth.

I never thought

you'd be the only one
willing to help me.

Can you please stop messing around?

00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,220
I just want to help.

55
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,220
You're not helping.

56
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,420
It's all gone!

57
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,780
Yao, you are finally here.

58
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,180
How are things going?

59
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,260
It should be the work
of a professional hacker.

60
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,900
We can't trace it at all.

61
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,700
This hacker has nothing better to do

62
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,380
than to hack a small workshop like ours.

63
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,580
We can rewrite the program,

64
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,580
but the problem is,

65
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,100
Unique's scheduled
launching time will be delayed.

66
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,660
And what if all the clothing
partnerships we've negotiated

67
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,020
hold us to account?

68
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,020
This is bad.

69
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,340
I'd better tell them
to postpone the launching.

70
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,180
By the way,

71
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,620
I have to tell the publicity, too.

72
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,460
I remember

73
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,340
there's a backup data
on the dormitory computer.

74
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,260
Dachuan, you go back and get it.

75
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,940
Fatty.

76
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,420
You and Qixuan fix the computer bugs

77
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,540
to stop the hacker.

78
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,540
Hua.

79
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,300
Check if the previous demo

80
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,100
can still be logged in.

81
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,180
Okay.

82
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,420
Get moving.

83
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,620
Come on, guys.

84
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,860
We should be able to

85
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,180
launch it on time
if we work overtime.

86
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,940
How is it?

87
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,460
What's the matter?

88
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,460
We had been working
overtime a few days ago,

89
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,540
today we need to stay up late again.

90
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,980
If this goes on,

91
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,500
we will die of exhaustion.

92
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,020
It's impossible to make it on time, Yao.

93
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,660
Why don't we just give up?

94
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,540
No way.

95
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,260
Everyone is exhausted.

96
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,980
Why don't we find a way

97
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,180
to cheer them up?

98
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,740
How about a hotpot?

99
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,260
Look at them.

100
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,820
Do you think they have an appetite?

101
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
I have an idea.

102
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,860
What is it?

103
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,060
Come with me.

104
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,660
Are we

105
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,580
going to wear this?

106
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,700
Actually, I've been wanting to
wear this for a long time.

107
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,540
I just haven't found
the right opportunity.

108
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,420
Then you should wear it.

109
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll skip.

110
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,460
Don't you want to help our buddies?

111
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Look at them.

112
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
They are under a lot of pressure.

113
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,180
They are depressed

114
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,780
and in a gloomy mood.

115
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,740
Don't you want to help Ling Yao?

116
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,940
Fine.

117

118
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,380

119
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,900
Calm down.

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,940
out of meat.

172
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,380
Let's order another plate.

173
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,100
Eat as much as you want.

174
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,580
Boss!

175
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,820
Add another two servings of beef!

176
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,860
Thank you, Yao.

177
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,380
You shouldn't call him like that.

178
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Call him "Mr. Ling".

179
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,740
After Unique is launched

180
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,820
and makes a big hit,

181
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,980
we can earn a lot of money.

182
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,700
Then let's expand the company.

183
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,980
Fatty.

184
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,180
You will be the President of
Software Development Department.

185
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,020
Qixuan will be the President of
Technology Department.

186
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,340
Dachuan will be the President
of Planning Department.

187
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,020
And I will be

188
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,260
the Chief Representative
of Greater China Service,

189
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,220
President Hua.

190
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,380
Dream on!

191
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,460
Don't get ambitious.

192
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,580
Eat more vegetables.

193
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,300
What is this "Rmall"

194
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,100
posted by Ren Jie?

195
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,660
What did he post?

196
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,380
This Rmall

197
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,220
looks similar to Unique.

198
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,460
The interface design

199
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,540
and the function settings
are exactly the same as Unique's.

200
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,420
Really?

201
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
Let me see.

202
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,500
This is plagiarism.

203
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,380
How can they make the exact same thing?

204
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,220
I think

205
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,660
this has to do with the hacker attack.

206
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,100
This is ridiculous!

207
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,060
Let's file a lawsuit.

208
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,660
Sue him.

209
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,420
Yes.

210
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,940
The hacker IP address was from overseas.

211
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,900
We have no evidence
to point it at Ren Group.

212
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,340
Still, we can't just let this slide.

213
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,340
Ling Yao.

214
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,879
-I've checked your planning case. It's nice.
-Thank you.

215
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,020
Ren Jie!

216
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,700
You tried to steal Momo away from me,

217
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,020
and now you're trying to
steal my application, too.

218
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,500
Did you make a habit of it?

219
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,900
What are you doing?

220
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,740
What's got into you?

221
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,820
Don't play innocent.

222
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,300
Are you in charge of Rmall?

223
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,020
Yes.

224
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,700
So what?

225
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,020
Are you serious?

226
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,540
You just changed the name of my Unique

227
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,340
and launched it online.

228
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,060
You are very brazen.

229
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,380
Rmall was developed by my team

230
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,180
after a month of effort.

231
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,420
I've never even

232
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,500
heard of Unique.

233
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,900
Don't blame me

234
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,100
for your failures.

235
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,660
Take a good look at this.

236
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,600

237
