《It's her lover》

6
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,490
(Yuri) Theo-kun

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,659
Do you know about my power?

8
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,000
<(Makoto) As expected>

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,997

<Who is Yoon Tae-oh?>

12
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,978
but…

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,147
What do you mean?

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,650
<The person who told your father about it>

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,986

<Professor Iiyama notices Yuri's power>

<Professor Iiyama notices Yuri's power>

19
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,997

20
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,667
《But Theo-kun started speaking before I spoke》

00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,003
《I already knew》

《(Iiyama) As it is》

23
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,309
``Something bad may happen to the two of us.''

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,483

 <b>《Could you please separate Theo-kun and Yuri-san?</b>  <b>》</b>

26
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,161
Is it true?

27
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:40,333
I can't believe Theo-kun knows about my power.

28
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,670
can't believe it

(Mahiro) I'll sort it out once.

33
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,000
Part 1: Theo-kun really knows about Yuri's power.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,483
Part 1: Theo-kun really knows about Yuri's power.

35
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,986
Do you know?

36
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,158
Part 2: How long have you known?

37
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:44,497
Part 3: Who exactly is Professor Iiyama?

38
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,000
What concerns me the most is

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,003
As you know my power

40
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,640
I wonder why Theo-kun is keeping it a secret.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,176
That's right

42
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,000
Why is Theo-kun keeping it a secret from Yuri-san?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,313
Why is Theo-kun keeping it a secret from Yuri-san?

44
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,816
Let's find out how?

45
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,319
Well, I have to ask directly...

46
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,489
It's impossible. Do you really know?

47
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,491
Even though I don't know

48
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,327
Well, now I have no choice but to translate it.

49
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,996

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,311
Interview with the president?

55
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,982
What are your plans for today, Kame-san?

56
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,655
(Kamei) Me, this interview with the president.

57
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,992
I look forward to it every year (Aihara). Is that so?

58
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,328
 <b>Aren't you nervous?</b><b>No</b>

59
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,998
Every year, the president listens kindly to my daughter's stories.

60
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,001
Yeah, let's skip Mr. Kame's interview to next week.

61
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,170
 <b>eh?</b><b>Okay</b>

62
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,641
I'll do it Yuri-san...

64
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,010
Just pretend like you don't know anything

65
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,647
Will I be able to continue dating Theo?

66
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,819
That's true

67
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,989
If you want to open the door to Theo-kun's heart,

68
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,991
Let's start with Yuri-san.

69
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,994
I have to knock

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,999
Yeah

71
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,149

72
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,151

74
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,999
Would you like some coffee?

75
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,001
Yeah

77
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:09,309
This interview will begin with a stress check.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,645
 <b>(Theo) Is this a stress check?</b><b>Yes, it's a stress check.</b>

79
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,647
This is also part of the interview.

80
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,983
is that so

81
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
OK, let's get started

82
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,989
yes

83
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,000
in a certain place

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,998
in a certain place

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:37,670
There was a good friend, an otter and a dog.

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,806
Is it a sea otter?

87
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:45,011
The sea otter had some delicious oranges.

88
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,981
I kept that a secret from my dog.

89
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,318
Is the sea otter a mandarin orange?

90
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,154
But actually the dog

91
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,990
I knew the secret

92
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,000
The sea otter is eating oranges...

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,993
The sea otter is eating oranges...

94
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,329
Now…

95
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,667
if you are a dog

96
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,002
what should I do?

97
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,639
(Korean heart voice)

98
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,146
(notification sound)

99
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,650
(Mahiro) Songe and Teaput...

100
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,000
Songe and Teaputo

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,156
Songe and Teaputo

102
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,328
What can I send?

103
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,998
Sea otters don't eat oranges

104
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,001
Ah... that's true though

105
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,506
Sea otters like sea urchins and clams.

106
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,309
Ah... that's not what I meant

107
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,979
And with sea otters and dogs

108
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,981
Habitat is different

109
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,316
So it's not like that

110
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,000
(Korean heart voice)

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,653
(Korean heart voice)

112
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,829
Padarayucchi

113
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,500
(Mahiro) I added green onions.

114
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,502
That's no good.

115
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,340
eh?

116
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,314
What if... what's wrong?

117
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,000
home…

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,316
home…

119
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,653

00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,000
Ah…

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,657
Ah…

187
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,993
today…

188
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,999
Why don't you go on a date with me?

189
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,001
Is it a date at home?

190
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,503
Yes, that's a date at home

191
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,006
Yeah, that's good

192
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,008
let's go

193
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,011
It's our first date at home.

194
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,979
Yeah…

195
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,989
This is a green sea slug. I see.

196
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,826
The research object, the New Tall Sea Slug, is

197
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,328
In some areas they are on the verge of extinction

198
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,664
Therefore, their ecology is somewhat similar.

199
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's study this seaweed... I see.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,803
Let's hang out with each other

201
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,639
 <b>yes?</b><b>to get to know each other</b>

202
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,476
First of all, I said, let's hang out.

203
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,312
I don't know unless I know

204
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,981
But the love between me and you

205
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,000
I won't know until you and I try it.

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,985
I won't know until you and I try it.

207
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:38,491
Your thoughts are too far from mine.

208
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,494
But it's because I don't understand

209
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,330
You're interested, aren't you?

210
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,334
Really…

211
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,639
That's why I'm so worried about you

212
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,009
Are you curious?

213
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,311
about me

214
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm really interested.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,481
I'm really interested.

216
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,986
Then let's hang out

217
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,988
we

218
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,992
You have a point.

219
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,495
The only species that can always accept change and adapt is

220
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,497
can survive

221
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,499
eh?

222
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,804
Is the world in an era of great extinction?

223
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,807
Let's survive this era together

224
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,980
I have no choice.

225
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,651
Let's survive forever from now on

226
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,986
in your life

227
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,992
what?

228
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,662
 <b>Huh?</b> <b>eh?</b>

229
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,664
Yeah?

230
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,641
I will make it today

231
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,311
I'm happy

232
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,648
Ah, shall we take a photo?

233
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,650

It's been a while since I cooked

241
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,505
Sorry it took so long

242
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,475
It's okay, I'll help you.

243
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,978
Well then... Thank you

Should I put this in oyster sauce?

255
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,990
Yeah, put it in

256
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,160

Yes, this is the secret ingredient in God's Sundubu.

264
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,165

00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,143
I've been thinking that for a while, but what does that mean?

267
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:23,482
Oh, it means please eat deliciously.

268
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,986

00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:13,498
So, what if Theo-kun could use supernatural powers?

360
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,168
What power do you want?

361
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,004

362
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,006
What happened?

363
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,308
for example

364
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,477
Do you want to stop time?

365
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,481
That's no good, I can't talk to Yuri.

366
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,000
All that's left is instantaneous movement

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,483
All that's left is instantaneous movement

368
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,819

369
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:38,156
If anything happens to Yuri-san, I can go right away.

370
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,161
Well then...

371
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,499
Can you hear the voice in your heart?

372
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,501
Hmm

373
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:54,339
If I could hear my heart too...

374
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,000
