For some reason, Theo-kun had it.

And coincidentally, the story is →

38
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:47,660

00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,498
That's big issue

180
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,137
Whoa, my hands are cold

181
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,974
(Blows into hands)

182
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,000
It's an exaggeration, it's no good

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,146
It's an exaggeration, it's no good

184
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,815
It's still cold

185
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,985
(Blows into hands)

186
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,324
Theo-kun... you know.

187
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,326
Yuri-san?

188
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,829
Try closing your eyes

189
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
Yeah?

190
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,985
Wow hahaha...

191
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,488
Does this make you feel warmer?

192
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,490
Thank you Nikuman?

193
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,327
No, it's not a meat bun, is it?

194
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,166
So here's a quiz.

195
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,302
yes

196
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,138
What's inside this?

197
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,000
Hmm...

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,141
Hmm...

199
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,477
If it's not a meat bun, how about a steamed bun?

200
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,646
Ten which one?

201
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,983
That's different!

202
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,985
Curry bun

203
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,154
Pizza cunt

204
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,656
What else happened?

205
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,659
A special tip

206
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,329
Please try this

207
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,633
I'll enjoy having this

208
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,982
 <b>Hmm!</b>  <b>…Yeah?</b>

209
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,818
Is this... a crab?

210
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,488
Ding dong den fufufu…

211
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,992
That's correct. It's my favorite Kananiman.

212
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,994
Hmmm

213
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,632
Theo-kun likes crab comics.

214
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,000
I did not know

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,634
I did not know

216
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,138
Yeah

217
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,985
That's what I thought when I saw Mahiro and the others earlier.

218
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,989
I still have a lot

219
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,325
What Theo doesn't know

220
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,000
What is Yuri's favorite meal?

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,999
What is Yuri's favorite meal?

222
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,303
The best... hmm?

223
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,805
Maybe omelet rice

224
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,308
 <b>Is it omelet rice?</b><b>Yeah</b>

225
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,644
My father was a chef

226
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,647
When I was little, I often had them made at the store.

227
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,818
Ah... later

228
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,654
coffee and chocolate

229
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,490
I always had it served with food.

230
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,000
 <b>Yeah?</b><b>Hmm</b>

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,161
 <b>Yeah?</b><b>Hmm</b>

232
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,798
So our company is chocolate.

233
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,802
It's coffee, right?

234
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,805
But well...

235
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,307
Coffee from my company for dad

236
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,643
I've never had anyone drink it though.

237
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,000
I have one too

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,823
I have one too

239
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:37,162
There are many things that Yuri doesn't know.

240
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,799
So I'm more

241
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,469
I want to know a lot

242
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,005
but…

243
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,640
Even if you don't know

244
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,642
It doesn't change

245
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,651
well…

246
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:12,798
Both the kind Yuri-san and the angry Yuri-san.

247
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,801
Any Yuri-san

248
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,804
This is my favorite Yuri

249
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,642
that's why…

250
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:28,147
I'm very happy now

251
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah

252
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,817
Yeah

253
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,157
(Korean heart voice)

254
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,327
(Korean heart voice)

255
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,302
Me too... Thank you hehehe

256
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,474
 <b>Are you going back soon?</b><b>Yeah</b>

257
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,144
Ah…

258
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,661
Well, I'm here.

259
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,163
Do you want to send it?

260
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,004
Mahiro-san!

261
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,973
I will contact you again

262
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,000
 <b>eh?</b><b>I still have questions left</b>

263
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,810
 <b>eh?</b><b>I still have questions left</b>

264
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,981
(Onoda) I will send you a list later.

265
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,983
Well then

266
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,328
Onoda-san is a little different though.

267
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,499
You're seriously thinking about Mahiro.

268
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,467
is that so?

269
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,637
I'm more than a love interest

270
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,000
I feel like it's a research subject.

271
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,141
I feel like it's a research subject.

272
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,310
Fufufu…

273
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,813
 <b>Ha!</b><b>That's right, Yuri-san.</b>

274
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,315
I read that picture book!

275
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,484
 <b>eh!</b>  <b>? I really read it!</b>  <b>?</b>

276
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,987
Mr. Onoda helped me understand my appropriate alcohol intake.

277
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,823
I only read 2 pages while I was concentrating on calculations.

278
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,492
I made progress and took some photos!

279
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,496
Thank you. What did you write?

280
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,001
that is…

281
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,807
If that power

282
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,976
If I could erase it...

283
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,980
(Mahiro) Do you want to erase it?

284
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,990
``The girl asked God.''

285
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,994
"Tell me how to get rid of this power."

286
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,000
"Then God told me."

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
"Then God told me."

288
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,304
"it is……"

289
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,814
<I never thought about it>

290
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:21,820
<If I could eliminate this power...>

291
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,824
《I am very happy now》

292
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,000
<Forever with the person I love>

293
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,630
<Forever with the person I love>

294
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,167
<Maybe we can just stare at each other>

295
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,141
<But...>

296
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,311
<If this power disappears...>

297
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,163
<I already know my father...>

298
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,167
<I can't speak to you again...>

299
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,807
The most important thing...

300
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,167
(knock) Yes

301
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,971
Yuri-san, sorry to bother you.

302
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,481
Are you worried about whether to erase that power?

303
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,000
 <b>Won't you erase it?</b> <b>Yeah…</b>

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,152
 <b>Won't you erase it?</b> <b>Yeah…</b>

305
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,155
It's not so easy to decide

306
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,659
Yes, but if we don't hurry, it might get into trouble...

307
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,329
No, it's a picture book after all.

308
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,631
Is it true? Please...

309
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,633
(Hard knocking) (Kamei) President!

310
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,635
 <b>yes!</b> <b>Ta ta ta... It's hard!</b>

 <b>Aitatata... Are you okay?</b>  <b>?</b>

312
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,806
Venture capital partners →

313
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,308
That VCP went bankrupt!

314
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,310
 <b>Yeah!</b>  <b>? Oh my!</b>

315
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,814
Ah…

316
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,151
(Hanaoka) That's a lie...

317
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,154
Venture capital partners...

318
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,824
A company that was planning to invest in our company

319
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,826
Isn't this pretty bad?

320
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,828
I don't think it's that bad.

321
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,163
The planned investment amount of VCP is

322
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,466
 <b>70 million bye!</b> <b>Itta... 70 million!</b>  <b>?</b>

323
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,634
If this continues, our cash flow will be short-circuited.

324
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,304
Is it possible to negotiate an increase with another company?

325
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,641
Let's give it a try.And also to the individual investors I know.

326
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,478
Please try it from all sides.

327
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,985
Again...

328
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:15,827
(Vibrator incoming call)

<Will the power disappear if we make eye contact for 33 seconds...>

362
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:36,167
I don't know if it's true but...

363
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,504
If it were true...

364
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,341
Maybe it's my fault that my father is like this...

365
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,013
<What are you talking about? It's not Yuri's fault.>

366
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:53,151
<It was more painful to worry alone>

367
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,663

392
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,482
but…

393
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,484
<It's okay>

394
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,489
<Dad is always happy>

395
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,667
<Let's go, Yuri>

Yuri open your eyes

401
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,667
Yuri, listen first.

402
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:28,506
Thank you for being born as my father's daughter.

403
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,000
thank you

404
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,675
thank you

405
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:34,012
Just stop...

406
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,849
She was really small when she was born →

407
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,985
My father is →

408
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:44,155
When I touched that small hand →

409
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,825
I swore in my heart→

410
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,993
No matter what happens from now →

411
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:53,498
He will definitely protect Yuri.

412
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,669
So that day...

413
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,176
I was able to protect Yuri with my own hands.

414
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,179
Dad was proud

415
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,850
but…

416
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,154
Because of that, my father...

417
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,826
Yuri, are you misunderstanding something?

418
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,665
Dad is very happy now

419
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,507
And this too

420
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,848
Yeah...smells nice

421
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,326
Sigh... delicious

422
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,000
Yuri's coffee is the best in the world

423
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,834
Yuri's coffee is the best in the world

424
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,647
<Thank you Yuri>

425
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:20,151
(Sound of the second hand advancing)

426
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,490
I refuse…

427
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,660

429
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,510
After all, it's like this!

430

431

444
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,990
Ah, that was good!

445
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,993

 <b><Huh?</b> <b>That means ></b>

That's right, it's a picture book.

450
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,509
Why did I believe it was 33 seconds?

451
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,678
<What is it already>

452
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,846

Sorry for making you worry...

464
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:12,156
Umm... Did you eat rice?

465
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,659
Yeah?

466
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,661

It's the best energy charge

475
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:46,324
That's why I'm happy and sad days

476
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,826
I will definitely eat rice

477
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,496
If I do that, someday

478
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,665

00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,486
Actually...

489
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:53,825
My father was in an accident a long time ago...

490
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,828
I've been bedridden ever since.

491
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,997
Yeah…

492
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,668
but…

493
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:08,172
Always the same and kind

Be positive...

495
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:17,849
That's why I have a father like that.

496
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,485
I've loved you forever

497
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:30,000
It's wonderful that Yuri takes care of her family.

Were you able to charge your energy?

500

Yes, ah...

509
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,648
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

510
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,320
There's something I want to talk to Theo-kun.

511
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,233
That was 12 years ago at the field work.

512
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:47,238
This is when I visited Cape Kiritappu in Hokkaido.

513
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,741
I witnessed a fishing boat accident.

514
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,581
 <b>"Ah!</b>  <b>》</b>

515
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:00,000
So he jumped into the sea to save the sea otter.

516
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,084
So he jumped into the sea to save the sea otter.

517
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,086
It was Yuri Motomiya.

518
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,557
 <b>Yuri-san?</b><b>yes</b>

519
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,566
But at that time

520
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,402
Trying to save Motomiya-san who was about to drown

521
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,738
her father...

522
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:28,913
I'm really worried about you two...

523
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,000
《Nice to meet you at Sochi University》

524
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,250
《Nice to meet you at Sochi University》

525
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,553
《Researching endangered animals》

526
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,555
《My name is Iiyama》

527
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,059
《Mr. Motomiya tried to help us》

528
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,229
《The sea otter was safely rescued》

529
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:49,400
"I'm really thankful to you"

530
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,903
(Iiyama) But... your father is →

531
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:57,408
His body became incapable of conversation.

532
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,549
I was worried about my condition, and since then I sometimes

533
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,919
I went to visit my father.

534
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,392
That's why I also talk about Yuri Motomiya.

535
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,394
I know unilaterally

536
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:22,400
your lover is so brave

537
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,904
I think he is a wonderful person with a kind heart.

538
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,000
But for her...

539
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,908
But for her...

540
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,412
There's still a secret you don't know

541
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,385
Theo-kun

542
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,921
this is…

543
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,558
I thought it was my request as a father.

544
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,560
please listen
