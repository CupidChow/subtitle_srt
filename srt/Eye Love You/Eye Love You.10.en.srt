Ah, it's okay

11

00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,332
I'm sorry Theo-kun because of me.

13
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,334
Sorry no

14
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,007

I like that too

29
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,008

130
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,000

164
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,653
I tried it with my dad and it didn't go away.

00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,655
Huh? Is that so?

166
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:20,326

Hmm (Hanaoka) But even that power

168
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:27,333

Is it true?

188
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,990
☎(Hana) That's...

189
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:00,000
(Hana) I have hope.

190
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,994
(Hana) I have hope.

191
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,664
hope?

192
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,667
at that time

193
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,670
Shortly after he died

194
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,807
I had a chance to go to Hokkaido

195
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,476
There, the old Ainu

196
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,979
☎I read the legend.

197
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,981
☎There is

198
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,318
Is there a way to erase abilities similar to this power?

199
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,320
☎It was written

200
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
☎I wasn't able to try it

201
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,991
☎I wasn't able to try it

202
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,996
☎That's why I entrusted it to that picture book.

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
hope

204
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,484
(take a breath)

205
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,988
Excuse me!

206
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,990
 <b>Sh... Chocolatier!</b>  <b>?</b>

207
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,998
(Onoda) Wow~ What, Mahiro-san?

208
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,000
 <b>Why are you here?</b><b>To both of you</b>

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,003
I have something to ask you.

210
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,008
I see, Ainu legend

211
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,010
Do you know after all?

212
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,646
Yeah, I'm not an expert, but

213
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,648
Ainu prose tales

214
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,000
I often go to Hokkaido to research Ezon pikas.

215
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,985
I often go to Hokkaido to research Ezon pikas.

216
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,320
A long time ago, I was interested and did some research.

217
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,322
That's amazing!

218
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,326
Ah, I'm sure there are documents.

219
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,328
eh?

220
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,999
I feel like it was around here...

221
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,001
I do.

222
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,004
not here

223
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,640
Ah, this is it!

224
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,642
there was

225
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,978
Yes, that's right, Ohainu.

226
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:00,000
A person whose life was saved by God →

227
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,980
A person whose life was saved by God →

228
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,982
Now listen to God's voice

229
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,984
helping people and animals

230
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,320
This is an Ainu legend.

231
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,322
This is it

232
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,325
I certainly didn't notice

233
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,328
It looks like that picture book

234
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,999
Ah, this is it, 33 seconds.

235
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,003
But with this method, it won't go away.

236
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,806
 <b>Other than that?</b><b>There's something, right?</b>

237
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,000
No, sorry, I'm not an expert either.

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,809
No, sorry, I'm not an expert either.

239
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,979
There must be something, right? Please come up with something.

240
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,981
(Iiyama) No, Mr. Chocolatie, please calm down.

241
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,984
(Mahiro) Is it okay to give up here? I'm doing research or something.

242
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,488
You're smart, right? Use your brain to think of a way to do it!

243
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,324
No, no, that's mine...I have this.

244
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,326
what is that

245
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,330
(Onoda) Ainu language materials →

246
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,999
At that time, my professor asked me to decipher it.

247
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,336
It was a pain so I hid it.

248
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,000
“Nepkaia Equal Core…”

249
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,341
“Nepkaia Equal Core…”

 <b>incantation?</b> <b>What does it say?</b>

251
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,981
Well, I'm not an expert either.

252
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,316
It doesn't have to be a specialty or not.

253
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,318
 <b>Decode it now!</b><b>a little bit</b>

254
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,988
It's an important document, so I'll keep it for now.

255
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,323
I'll take care of it for now...I'll do it!

256
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,497
(Vibrator incoming call)

257
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,001
Hello, Mahiro, what happened?

258
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,000
☎(Mahiro) Yuri-san, is it under the starry sky?

259
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,338
☎(Mahiro) Yuri-san, is it under the starry sky?

260
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,008
So it's under the stars!

261
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,010
I haven't been able to decipher everything yet...

262
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,978
There are various theories about it

263
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,315
33 seconds under the stars with my loved one

264
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,317
We make eye contact

265
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,320
☎You can eliminate that power!

266
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,239
Well, as expected of my doctor, I reviewed it.

267
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,908
Did I miss it?

268
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,545
Because you won't tell me at all.

269
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,547
what?

270
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,551
nothing!

271
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,235
There are tens of millions of different living things on this earth today.

272
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,904
It is said that there is

273
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,906
Huh~

274
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,910
We are one of those tens of millions of species.

275
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,879
It's the same species

276
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,881
Well, that's right

277
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,884
But the genes are different.

278
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,000
you

279
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,555
you

280
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,891
within the human species

281
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,894
I have the most attracted gene.

282
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,235
What does that mean?

283
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,904
That is, the important thing is

284
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,908
In other words, I'm attracted to

285
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,879
only you on this earth

286
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,883
(Onoda) That means...

287
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,899
what?

288
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,403
That's the point, really.

289
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,239
Oh, maybe it's a kiss?

290
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,209
I feel bad about the choice of words.

291
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,212
Haa~ Well, it's not really a big deal though.

292
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,214
I know that's the kind of person you are.

293
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm the one who fell in love with you

294
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,217
I'm the one who fell in love with you

295
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,904
Me too

296
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,908
me too…

297
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,878
what?

298
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,219
Mahiro-san

299
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,223
I like it

300
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,570
You finally said it

301
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:44,890
(The hygrometer makes a sound)

302
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,892
(It stops once, but then the sound plays again)

303
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,896
(Sound plays intermittently)

304
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,899
<(Makoto) I see>

305
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,902
<You made a good decision>

306
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,000
<Hey Yuri>

307
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,907
<Hey Yuri>

308
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,212
<There are bitter days in life>

309
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,214
<Some days are sweet>

310
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,717
<That's just how I feel>

311
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:17,222
<It's because I'm trying my best to live my life>

312
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:21,560
<Just follow the path you want to take>

313
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:27,232
<You don't have to hide your true feelings only from yourself>

314
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,000
<Your father>

315
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,902
<Your father>

316
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,907
<I'm glad he's Yuri's father after all>

317
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,211
father

318
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,881
<Yuri>

319
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,885
<Try holding your father's hand>

320
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:19,217
thank you dad

321
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,904
Hmm Theo

322
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,906
Yeah

323
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,908
Sorry, call me

324
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,910
Oh no no

325
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,247
Um... what did you do to get to Seoul?

326
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,250
I have a contract with Min.

327
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,253
Aaaand...

328
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,924
this

329
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,000
I can't accept it because there's no signature.

330
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,927
I can't accept it because there's no signature.

331
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,229
Ah, sorry

332
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,406
That's a nice place

333
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,249
Why did you return to Seoul silently?

334
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,920
Near Yuri

335
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,000
Because I can't stay

336
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,923
Because I can't stay

337
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,897
(sigh)

338
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,901
I know?

339
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,237
what people think in their heads

340
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,573
If it's 100%

341
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:53,244
What can be conveyed to others through words

342
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,581
In fact, it seems that only about 5%

343
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,000
5％？

344
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,251
5％？

345
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,894
Then that 5%

346
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,233
Isn't it a waste if you don't use it carefully?

347
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,905
Yeah…

348
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,418
what?

349
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,898
Theo is still barely an employee of ours.

350
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:53,905
This is a business order.

351
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,915
It's okay to abuse your power once in a while.

352
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,227
ah…

353
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,897
Mr. Yuri?

354
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,908
Theo-kun

355
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,905
I wanted to meet you

356
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,910
I wanted to hear your voice

357
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,249
I wanted to see your face

358
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,584
I wanted to meet you

359
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,898
Me too

360
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,911
Theo, will you listen to me?

361
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,915
Yeah

362
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,586
It's me

363
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,558
I…

364
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,904
<Kenchana>

365
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,582
I…

366
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,920
Theo's

367
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,557
I can hear the voice in my heart

368
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,561
I could hear it all the time

369
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,234
But I couldn't say it

370
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,904
I've been scared for a long time

371
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,911
Yuri-san...

372
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,916
It's scary

373
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,561

Me too

378
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,582
I like Yuri

379
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,000
but…

380
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,919
but…

381
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,924
I don't want Yuri to be in pain either.

382
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,228
Both are true feelings.

383
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,183

384
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,521

395
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,849

I understand how Yuri feels.

418
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,851
I may not know everything though

424
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,842
If we are

426
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,856
