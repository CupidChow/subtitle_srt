1
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:41,560
February 1989.
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong

2
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:44,843
Honey! Your husband, Dong Il, is here!

3
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:50,560
Shut up and go to sleep.
The kids are all asleep.

4
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,650
OK, OK.

5
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,371
My child...

6
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,840
My son, No Eul, is so good looking!

7
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,010
Stop it, Dad! You smell like alcohol!
Stop it! I'm sleeping!

8
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:19,480
Who gave birth to such a cutie?

9
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:23,383
Who else?
Dong Il did!

10
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,359
Who would believe that you're in
high school, with all of this baby fat?

11
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,073
Let me see your willy!

12
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:37,310
-My little child!
-Dad! It's really cold!

13
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,382
Hey, Sung Deok Sun.

14
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,664
It's Sung Soo Yeon.

15
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,733
You said you wanted to
listen to this, right? Here.

16
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,135
You don't want to?
Never mind, then.

17
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,683
No!...
Give it to me.

18
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,706
Darn it... did he fall asleep?

19
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:21,053
Oppa... I have to pee.

20
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,151
OK.

21
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:27,417
Jin Joo, let's go pee.

22
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,475
Hey! What took you so long?

23
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,724
Sorry, Noona.

24
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,392
My mom went to sleep late.

25
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,251
Is Soo Yeon sleeping?

26
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,866
Yeah. She wouldn't notice if someone
were trying to kidnap her.

27
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,743
Is your mom sleeping?

28
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,406
-Yes.
-Jin Joo, too?

29
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:58,066
Yes. She's sleeping next to me.

30
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,736
You sleep with Jin Joo?

31
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:05,743
No. She woke up before because
she had to pee.

32
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,489
But then she said she wanted to
sleep with me, so I brought her over.

33
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,412
You're such a good kid.

34
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,064
What are you doing tomorrow?

35
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,385
Should we go check out a movie tomorrow?

36
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,159
Check out a movie?

37
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,438
Why are you speaking so informally
with me lately?

38
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:22,629
Can't I be just a little
when we're dating?

39
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,031
Can't I be?

40
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:28,075
OK, noona. I'm sorry.

41
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:33,388
But... the block is so quiet tonight.
I think everyone's asleep.

42
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,607
Of course they are.
Don't you know what time it is?

43
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,868
What is it, hyung?

44
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,201
-Jung Hwan.
-Yeah?

45
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:40,588
It's snowing outside.

46
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:46,063
So what?

47
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,618
Let's sleep together.

48
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,218
-No...
-I feel so lonely.

49
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,047
What's wrong with you?

50
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:58,579
Hey, where do you think you're
going with those hands?

51
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:00,979
Let's sleep together.
It's been a while.

52
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:03,325
Come on, hyung.

53
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,041
Noona. It's snowing.

54
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:11,954
So what?

55
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,979
Meet me outside.

56
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,142
I'll wait for you outside
of your front gate.

57
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,757
Hey. Hey! Hey!
Sun Woo! Hey!

58
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:25,645
Darn it...

59
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,787
Noona, where are you going?
Where are you going, Noona?

60
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:59,273
The bathroom.
Go back to sleep. Sleep...

61
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,269
Are you out of your mind?

62
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,771
Nobody's watching.

63
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,642
Noona?

64
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,439
Noona.
Noona!

65
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,915
Where did she go, at this hour?

66
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,575
Does No Eul sleepwalk, or something?

67
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,441
Why did he come out here,
all of a sudden?

68
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,691
I'll take care of him tomorrow.

69
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:00,245
Sun Woo, hurry up and go home.

70
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,367
At this rate, we'll run into
everyone in the neighborhood. Bye.

71
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:03,522
Hey!

72
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:07,188
Wait. Who would
come here at this hour?

73
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,339
Everyone's sleeping now.

74
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,482
You take care of him.

75
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:21,156
Episode 12: What It
Means to Love Someone

76
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,576
My precious friend, Taek...

77
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,058
It's a secret, OK?

78
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,981
I said, it's a secret!

79
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,421
OK.

80
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:03,622
-Sun Woo.
-Yeah?

81
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,231
Aren't you afraid of Bo Ra noona?

82
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,731
No, not at all.
She's cute.

83
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:19,354
Crazy jerk...

84
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:22,499
You... you know phrases like that?

85
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:28,463
Where did you learn that from?
Who taught you to curse?

86
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:31,383
It's a secret.

87
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,307
Crazy jerk.

88
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:44,060
Put more oomph in it.
"Crazy jerk."

89
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,105
Crazy jerk.

90
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,819
All right. Next.
"This son of a b-tch."

91
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,431
Darn it, this son of a b-tch!

92
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,619
Good. You've gotten much better.

93
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:04,212
What are you two doing?

94
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:06,683
Way to really teach him the best stuff.

95
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:10,731
No, it's not that. He lent some research
student sunbae ten million won again.

96
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,139
-What?
-What?

97
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,810
That sunbae is a crazy jerk!
Son of a b-tch! Motherf-cker!

98
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,972
You should teach him how to chew
on a shaver's blade!

99
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:20,093
How will you survive in this cruel world?

100
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,199
Are you a pushover?

101
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,135
Thats... so frustrating.

102
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:25,630
OK, repeat after me.

103
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,875
"I don't want to."

104
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:31,956
I don't want to.

105
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,479
"Why should I?"

106
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,902
Why should I?

107
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:37,690
"What the hell?
Freaking pissing me off..."

108
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,451
What the hell?
Freaking pissing me off...

109
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,252
What are you doing?

110
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,663
Cursing.

111
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,246
You're done for!

112
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,621
What are you doing?

113
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,497
-I'm leaving.
-Where are you going?

114
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,538
I promised Jung Bong hyung
I would see a movie with him.

115
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:02,146
Just wait. I have a gift
for all of you, you punks.

116
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Ta-da!

117
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:05,143
Ddochi Western Food
Five Pork Cutlets for Free

118
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:06,989
Ddochi Western Food?
What's that?

119
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:09,683
A pork cutlet place, what else?
My third oldest brother gave it to me.

120
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:10,926
Geum Ryong hyung?

121
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,479
Yeah. His friend opened
a Western restaurant.

122
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,008
I can't believe my older brothers are
doing nice for me, for once.

123
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,067
Then, when can we go?
Should we go this weekend?

124
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,767
You're all free, right?

125
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,436
But this coupon isn't valid on weekends.

126
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:23,459
It only works on weekdays.

127
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,374
We're back in school
next Tuesday, you punk.

128
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,050
We can go for dinner!

129
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:31,319
It's near Ssangmun Station, on the
first floor of the shopping plaza.

130
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,600
It's right between our school
and Soo Yeon's school.

131
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,202
So we can just eat and go!

132
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,956
-You're coming, right?
- Sure.

133
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:39,509
I have matches on Monday and Tuesday.

134
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:41,667
-What time?
-At 9.

135
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,440
If it ends early,
I'll come right over.

136
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:45,512
Hey, don't overwork yourself.

137
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:49,438
What about you?

138
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:52,583
Yeah... I...

139
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:00,815
Hey. They say that their part time
waitress looks just like Lee Mi Yeon.

140
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,629
You'll come, right?

141
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,969
Of course I have to go, then.

142
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,379
Sun Woo, I'm taking Jin Joo
and going to the market!

143
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,254
Let's go together, Mom.

144
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,566
It's OK.
Just stay home and study.

145
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,448
-I can go by myself.
-No, it'll be too heavy for you.

146
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,862
I'll come. Just wait.

147
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:25,896
It's really fine, though.

148
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:38,990
Here you go.

149
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:41,969
How much is one bag of the bean sprouts?

150
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,207
300 won.

151
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,464
Give me a 100 won discount. 200 won.

152
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:50,105
Here we go again. It's 300 won.
How could I take 100 won off of that?

153
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:51,789
OK, fine.
Hurry and pack it for me.

154
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,525
Why are you giving up so easily today?
You haven't even worked me down 50 won...

155
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,170
Hurry!

156
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:01,939
Mom!

157
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:03,881
Yeah?

158
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,693
How much was it again?
300 won?

159
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:07,925
Yes.

160
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,489
You're making bean sprout soup?

161
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,954
Yeah, it's cold. So I thought
it would be good to have some.

162
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:16,821
Hey, Sun Woo. Can you take
Jin Joo and go home?

163
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,909
I have to pick up some sesame seeds.

164
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,884
-Let's go together!
-No, it's OK. Jin Joo is cold.

165
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:26,296
And I want to chat with the
ladies here a bit before I go.

166
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,254
OK. I just have to
change the charcoal, right?

167
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:30,422
That's right.

168
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:33,827
Don't buy anything else!
Your wrist isn't doing so good.

169
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,413
OK!

170
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,385
And if you do buy
something heavy, leave it here.

171
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,571
I'll get it for you later.

172
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:41,597
OK. Hurry up and go!
Jin Joo is going to catch a cold!

173
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,598
OK.
Let's go, Jin Joo.

174
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,727
-Bye!
-OK, bye!

175
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:51,440
How nice your son is so
good natured!

176
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:56,637
You must be so happy.
You have such a great son.

177
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:58,718
Just 100 won.

178
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:00,437
What?

179
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,103
Just give me a 100 won discount!

180
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,567
No! We already agreed on 300 won!

181
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,782
That was because I was in
a hurry because of my son!

182
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:09,992
Come on, just 100 won.

183
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:11,858
No... no.

184
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:18,286
What about just 50 won, then?
Just give me 50 won off, then!

185
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:23,325
The orthographic rules of the
Korean language are being changed.

186
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,275
Yo, An...

187
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,254
Yo... An...

188
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,100
A...

189
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,050
Overall...

190
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:39,819
yo...

191
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:44,482
Jin Joo. Wait.

192
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,928
From now on, you have to write...

193
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,175
...the verb with an
"s", not an "o".

194
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,514
OK?

195
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,087
My Jin Joo probably doesn't
know the Korean alphabet yet.

196
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,390
She's just copying what you wrote.

197
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:11,621
-Mom, do you have a cold?
-No, I'm fine! It comes and goes.

198
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,971
Sun Woo. Try this.

199
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:23,218
How does it taste?
It's good, right?

200
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,617
Yeah.

201
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,365
What? It's too salty?
Is it not good?

202
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:31,122
It's a little salty, but I think
it would be fine if you ate it with rice.

203
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,927
Really? I put extra salt in it
for that exact reason.

204
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,628
-Clear the table. Let's eat.
-OK.

205
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:39,034
-Jin Joo, let's eat.
-Should I add more salt?

206
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,070
No, don't, Mom!
It's great the way it is now.

207
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,111
-Really?
-Yeah.

208
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:53,638
Isn't Dad working late today again?
Why are you making so much rice?

209
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,797
I have to make some, regardless.
It's better than not having enough.

210
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,983
Yeah... I have to give that to them...
they have to eat that with their meal.

211
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,900
-Soo Yeon!
-What?

212
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,629
Can you run an errand for me?

213
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:13,238
Go bring these to Jung Hwan's.
I bet they're eating dinner already.

214
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,828
OK.

215
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,613
Don't do anything else.
Come right back after, OK?

216
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:17,923
And bring some to
Sun Woo's house.

217
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:20,549
Why do you make me do everything?
Am I your only child?

218
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,708
I'll go.

219
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,987
Give me that, Mom.
I'll bring it to Sun Woo's.

220
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:36,256
What... is this it?

221
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,987
I think we need to bring her
to the hospital or something.

222
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,511
I think she's gone crazy.

223
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,023
I must be out of my mind...

224
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:02,019
I must be crazy. Darn it!...

225
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,944
Missus, it's me, Soo Yeon!

226
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:20,334
Hey, Deok Sun!

227
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,985
She's Soo Yeon.

228
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,736
Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon...

229
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,363
My mom wanted you to have this.

230
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:32,278
He made so many!
Did your father get his paycheck?

231
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:33,446
No.

232
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:37,351
What are you doing?

233
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:38,986
What else?
Eating, obviously.

234
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,125
Soo Yeon. Can't you be
Deok Sun again now?

235
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Soo Yeon.

236
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:48,804
I prefer calling you Deok Sun.

237
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:52,032
Deok Sun suits you more.

238
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,807
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon!

239
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,017
If you keep calling me that...

240
00:19:57,274 --> 00:20:00,661
...I wouldn't succeed! 
(*Homonyms in Korean)

241
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:08,001
Our Soo Yeon....
things have to go well for you!

242
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:11,973
Soo Yeon.

243
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,475
Would you like to have dinner here?
I made steamed sea squirt.

244
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,191
I'd love to!

245
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:22,447
Our Soo Yeon...
I'll be your slave forever!

246
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:25,990
Word play from a
popular 80s comedy.

247
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,375
Thanks.

248
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:37,486
-I got it.
-I got it.

249
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,069
My mom wanted you to have this.

250
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:01,009
Noona.

251
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,866
OK. Tell her that I said thank you!

252
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:08,454
-Yes.
-Wait!

253
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:13,395
I have something I need to ask you.
Just a moment.

254
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,194
Yeah, Bo Ra!
Help Sun Woo with his studies!

255
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:18,924
I can't pay you for tutoring,
but I'll give you some pocket money.

256
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:32,878
You don't have socks on.

257
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:35,999
-Aren't you cold?
-Are you crazy? What if we get caught?

258
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,436
We won't.

259
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:44,509
Sit down.

260
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,072
No. I'm leaving.

261
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:48,830
Hey! Do you have a death wish?

262
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:54,382
Fine. Noona, my break ends tomorrow.

263
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,453
I know.

264
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:58,140
I'll drop by on my way
to school tomorrow.

265
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,239
You can't. I'm going to the library
early tomorrow morning.

266
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,865
Early in the morning? Why?

267
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:06,737
I have my reasons.
You don't need to know.

268
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:07,991
You're still on break though.

269
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:09,999
Are you, by chance...

270
00:22:12,438 --> 00:22:13,832
...going to do some
"political exercises"?

271
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,589
No. I'm really going to study.

272
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:18,084
I'm off.

273
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:23,047
Then let's meet after my night classes,
in front of your place.

274
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:24,129
I'll be home around 11 p.m.

275
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,475
-I can't.
-Noona!

276
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,621
-Be quiet.
-What is it, this time?

277
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,142
I think No Eul is catching onto us.

278
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,022
Meeting in front of my house is risky...

279
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,598
How about the food truck on the big road?

280
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,757
At 11 p.m.

281
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:45,152
Study hard, student!

282
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,757
OK. I will.

283
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,743
Here, eat this!

284
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:56,843
Missus, I think Sun Woo has anemia.

285
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:59,652
I think he needs some medicine. Goodbye.

286
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,435
-Are you ill?
-What?

287
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:03,810
-Are you dizzy?
-No.

288
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:05,814
-Should I get you some medicine?
-No, it's fine.

289
00:23:06,054 --> 00:23:08,052
-Are you sure?
-No, I'm fine, really.

290
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,287
Mister, I'm leaving!

291
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,400
OK!

292
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:20,831
When are you going to school
tomorrow morning?

293
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,785
I don't know. Early.

294
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:29,463
OK. See you tomorrow!

295
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:32,739
I'm really leaving now.

296
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,379
Hey, Soo Yeon.
Be careful on your way home.

297
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:38,659
Your house is quite far
from here.

298
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,690
-Oppa.
-What?

299
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:43,524
Did you write a reply yet?

300
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,099
Yeah.

301
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:48,989
I went to the post office myself and
picked the fastest shipping method!

302
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,433
I think I could get a reply by tomorrow.

303
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:57,239
What are you guys talking about?

304
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,529
You don't need to know.

305
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,383
I'll tell you next time.
Something great has happened to me.

306
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,263
My heart is pounding already.

307
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,321
Your heart is on the other side.

308
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:27,101
Son, wake up! It's your first day
back at school! You have school.

309
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,037
What time is it, Dad?

310
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,412
It's already 6:30 a.m.
Go and wash up.

311
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,120
Hey... and wake up your sister.

312
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:39,435
Hey, she's a high school senior now.
She should get up on her own!

313
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:40,808
When will she wake up herselves?

314
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:44,083
Seriously, that girl doesn't have
a care in the world.

315
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:46,267
Sis, wake...

316
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,615
What, you're all ready to go already?

317
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,768
Yeah. I'm a third year now, after all.

318
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:59,837
Darn it!

319
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:02,930
Glue

320
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:18,278
Soo Yeon is off to school now!

321
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:37,210
Hey, Deok... no, I mean, Soo Yeon.
You're going to school early.

322
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,999
Ma'am, where is Jung Hwan?

323
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,503
-Jung Hwan?
-Yes.

324
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,003
-He already left.
-What?

325
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,716
I think Jung Hwan is aiming for Harvard.
He left at the break of dawn.

326
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:52,488
Darn it...

327
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:14,106
Ssangmun Girls' High

328
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,429
-You're here?
-Yeah.

329
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,450
Hey. I had something totally
crazy happen to me yesterday.

330
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,754
What? Did you get rejected again?

331
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:37,442
No. Hey. Also, what would be
so crazy about that?

332
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:39,879
-That happens all the time.
-Right?

333
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:41,842
So? What is it?

334
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:45,028
I went to a Western restaurant
with my family yesterday.

335
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:49,516
There's a new place near the train
station. It's called Ddochi or Douner...

336
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:51,836
I'm going there next week!
I have a coupon.

337
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:57,064
Hey, be careful there!
I saw a Trench Coat Man there!

338
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,631
-A Trench Coat Man?
-Yeah! It was so freaky...

339
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:04,092
I still have never seen one.

340
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,835
What the heck!
You've really never seen one yet?

341
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:09,487
Yeah. I'm the only one in our class
who has never seen one.

342
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,295
You sound really disappointed.

343
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:15,044
I bet if you actually saw one,
you would pass out on the spot.

344
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,673
Are you OK?

345
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,611
Yeah, well...
I see them pretty often, so yeah.

346
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,347
All of a sudden, the world
felt like such a cold place.

347
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:26,564
So I told him, "Mister! It's cold!
Go home!" and sent him off.

348
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:30,721
-Hey... Wang Jo Hyun! You're incredible!
-That's not much, really.

349
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:35,687
But the first time I saw one, I was so
surprised. My heart started pounding...

350
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,377
I cried on the spot.

351
00:27:37,543 --> 00:27:40,134
Seriously? I would get
myself an autograph.

352
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,471
Yeah, you would do such a thing.

353
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:47,627
Hey, how about skipping study hall
and going to Brazil Ddukbokki?

354
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:51,108
I can't. Starting today,
I'm studying hard.

355
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:52,297
I'm going to college, too.

356
00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:54,857
Isn't it too late for that?

357
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,460
Hey. The moment you think
that it's too late is...

358
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,558
It's really too late.

359
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,989
-How nice.
-So nice and sweet!

360
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:11,524
It's so much quieter around here
now that the kids are back in school.

361
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:13,456
It's like our vacation has just begun.

362
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:18,518
All the kids are gone.
Now only Jin Joo is left!

363
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:24,152
Hello.

364
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,159
Where are you going?

365
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:28,116
Outside for a bit...

366
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,144
Jung Bong.

367
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:38,893
Come over here.

368
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,166
Go to the arcade or something.

369
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:48,983
Thank you.

370
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,711
Have a great time, then.

371
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:02,977
I have to see him go to college
before I die, at least...

372
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:05,735
Hey, you're being so greedy.

373
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,824
You used to always say that
all you want is for him to be healthy!

374
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:11,945
Yeah. Jung Bong is such a nice boy.

375
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:15,209
What other guys do you know his age,
who don't cause any trouble?

376
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:17,133
That's all you need.

377
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:21,816
Did you catch a cold?

378
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,621
It isn't a cold yet.

379
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:27,089
Hey, buy yourself
some medicine, you silly girl!

380
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:31,411
It's fine. All I need is
a cup of citron tea.

381
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:33,477
You're going to work
again today? What time?

382
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:37,856
Same time. I have to be there
by 8:30 p.m., when it closes.

383
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,800
At this rate, you'll get caught.
What if Sun Woo finds out?

384
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:43,820
And how would Sun Woo find out?

385
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:46,673
When they come home
from night class, it's 11 p.m.

386
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,183
I get off work by 10:30 p.m.

387
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:51,630
I'll never get caught.

388
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,158
But... where's Jin Joo,
our little princess?

389
00:29:56,475 --> 00:30:00,020
Our Jin Joo...
she made a new friend recently.

390
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:04,104
Even when I go to work,
I leave her with her friend.

391
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:07,367
-Her friend? Who?
-There's a kid who is at her exact level.

392
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:18,642
Jin Joo, wait just a bit.
I'm almost done.

393
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:31,879
All done!
Here you go, Jin Joo!

394
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:37,399
-What's wrong, Jin Joo?
-You cut off the shoulders!

395
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:38,454
The shoulders?

396
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,174
What? Wait a minute.

397
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,093
No! I'll put them back on!
Just wait a bit! Don't cry, OK?

398
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:50,986
I'll take care of these for you.
No, the shoulders!

399
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:54,450
Yes, the shoulders. I'll have to
cut them out before I stick them back on.

400
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,499
Just wait a bit. OK?

401
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,908
Mister!

402
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:16,902
Is there a letter for Kim Jung Bong?

403
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:21,581
Kim Jung Bong, who lives
at the house with the blue gate.

404
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:26,695
No.

405
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,190
I don't have anything for you.

406
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,743
You don't?

407
00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:37,446
You really don't?

408
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,415
My Soo Yeon is in her last year
of high school now.

409
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:55,485
She really needs to come to her
senses and start studying.

410
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:58,590
Let's try to put some faith
in that fortune teller.

411
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:00,917
Even though she was totally
wrong about my Jung Bong.

412
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,047
It's not like she got mine right, either.

413
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:08,521
You never know.
She has to be right, eventually.

414
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:13,938
Soo Yeon. Please study!
Sheesh...

415
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:16,957
It's your mother's only wish...

416
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:33,490
Chapter 1: Arithmetic of Sets
Unions and Venn Diagrams

417
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,308
Why me? Why?

418
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:21,205
Why me? Why?

419
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:39,680
Principles of Accounting

420
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:24,170
Ssangmun High

421
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:32,454
-Let's hurry to Taek's.
-What is that?

422
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:34,158
I have something to do.
I'm running ahead!

423
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,208
Hey... Sun... geez.
Why is he always leaving us?

424
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:40,316
What do you think it is?
It's an X-rated film.

425
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,427
I had to pay Michael
10,000 won to borrow it.

426
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:46,698
Taek has a match tomorrow,
so we have to support him and what not.

427
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,301
Studying isn't everything.

428
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:51,551
You have to experience
things with your body...

429
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:53,956
...and feel, with your own body,
you punks...

430
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,927
I promised my older brother watch
Die Hard with him today.

431
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,151
Please, go home already.
OK?

432
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:04,444
It's because I really don't want to
see the dean at home today...

433
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:08,481
Let's go home!

434
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm proud of my dad!

435
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,910
Were you waiting for a long time?

436
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,421
Maybe ten minutes?

437
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:45,456
From now on, let's meet
ten minutes later.

438
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:47,855
I came as fast as I could today,
but I still got here late.

439
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:51,419
So... from now on,
let's meet at 11:10 p.m., OK?

440
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:55,068
OK. Then we can just agree on
sometime around eleven.

441
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:58,756
I don't want you to be waiting
while it's cold out.

442
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:01,187
-Do you want udon?
-Yeah.

443
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,896
Can we have two udons?

444
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:05,235
OK!

445
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:23,559
Let's hurry up and eat and go home.
Your mom will be waiting.

446
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:26,261
Even so, I have to see your face.

447
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:29,963
Have this. I don't like chrysanthemums.

448
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,934
You're pickier that Jin Joo, seriously.

449
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:38,034
You have to eat everything so you
get taller and grow up to be healthy.

450
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,512
Stop messing around.

451
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:45,717
But... Noona. Why are you spending
so much time at the library lately?

452
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,523
Are you preparing for your exam already?

453
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,000
How late are you studying? Math?
Or something else, besides math?

454
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,662
You sure are curious
about a lot of things.

455
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:57,236
Do you really have that many things
that you want to know about me?

456
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:59,390
Of course. That's how people are.

457
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:01,396
You're the weird one...

458
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:07,788
I don't like secrets.

459
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,655
You keep speaking to me so informally.

460
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:11,043
Ma'am.

461
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,898
But seriously, what are
you up to lately?

462
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,450
-Hey... really!
-Really.

463
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:26,641
I'm going to see Taek for a little bit!

464
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:47,991
I'm studying accounting lately.

465
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:49,790
Why?

466
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,855
You're going to take the CPA exam? And
not the teacher certification exam?

467
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:56,717
I was blacklisted by the
Seoul Police Department.

468
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:58,211
It'll be hard for me to get certified.

469
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,865
An upperclassman suggested
a part time job to me...

470
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:04,532
...and it is in the accounting field,
so I'm studying on my own.

471
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,590
They'll pay me more than
I make from tutoring.

472
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:10,849
If I end up liking the job,
I can apply for a full time position.

473
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,816
So I'm a bit busy nowadays.

474
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:18,835
I don't have much time to see
you for the time being.

475
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:22,823
Why don't you just study
for the CPA, then?

476
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,755
Hey, do you think that just
anyone can become a CPA?

477
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:27,120
You have to study like crazy
for several years.

478
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:30,727
Also, if I start studying for that,
it's definitely over between us.

479
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:34,137
I can't do both things at once.

480
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,112
Consider yourself lucky.

481
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:40,363
Even so, we can see each
other here every night, right?

482
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:42,159
Only on weekends.

483
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:44,933
Let's just see each other
on weekends from now on.

484
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:50,154
Hey, you're a third year now!

485
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,179
I don't want your grades to
drop because of me.

486
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:55,309
I'll take care of my studies.

487
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,160
No! We're only seeing
each other on weekends!

488
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:16,492
Where's your dad?

489
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:17,653
He's asleep.

490
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,005
OK, nice.

491
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,777
Why don't we watch it together,
with everyone else?

492
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,622
I have to give it back tomorrow.

493
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,612
Hey, where can you find a true friend like
me who takes care of friends' sex lives?

494
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:34,747
Like me!
Thank me.

495
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:42,268
Let's put this in...
Taek, Taek...

496
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,718
Taek, my mom wanted you to eat...

497
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:49,118
-Hey!
-What is that?

498
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:50,730
It's porn, right?

499
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:52,376
-No, Deok Sun! No!
-Mister!

500
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:54,861
Hey... good job!

501
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:04,245
No, you can't! You can't, Deok Sun!

502
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:10,680
No... you can't...

503
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:37,121
Michael, that son of a b-tch...

504
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:56,425
Are you mad?

505
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,030
Nope.

506
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:01,465
Nope? Speaking informally, again?
You're getting really brazen lately.

507

-I can't speak informally?
-What the hell did you say?

508

Yo?

509

No, you can't.

510

Aren't we dating?

511
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:16,171
Right?

512
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,263
Am I just a little kid to you?
You always treat me like a kid.

513
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:25,965
This is just...
a one way romance. Yeah.

514
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:29,478
Whatever. Stop spouting nonsense
and let's go. It's late.

515
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,347
-What do we owe you?
-1,400 won.

516
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,948
-Let's go.
-Goodbye.

517
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,700
Come on now, hurry up.

518
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:02,663
What... she's toying with me.

519
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:06,048
Noona!

520
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:14,087
Noona, you wore that
skirt for me, didn't you?

521
00:42:14,341 --> 00:42:15,365
Shut up...

522
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,367
Aren't you cold?
You will be cold in a skirt.

523
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:18,570
I am.

524
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,574
-Goodness!
-People will see us.

525
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,580
A Trench Coat Man?

526
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,661
Are you talking about those people
who wear big coats and flash people?

527
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,203
Yeah. Apparently they pop up near
the Ddochi Restaurant quite often.

528
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:45,152
-Then let's go somewhere else.
-We can't! I need to use the coupon!

529
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:47,504
It's OK. What's so scary
about a Trench Coat Man?

530
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:49,204
My wish is to see one.

531
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:51,714
-Aren't you scared?
-Nope.

532
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:54,314
Hey, you really think
she would be scared of that?

533
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:57,074
For her, nothing is
scarier than Bo Ra noona.

534
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,126
Don't be silly...

535
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:03,734
Hey, what's that sound?

536
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,143
Don't you guys hear that?

537
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:14,363
Mice. My dad put out a few of
those sticky mouse traps...

538
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:17,433
...but my dad and I are both
too scared to check them.

539
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:20,029
We have to throw them away...

540
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,456
Hey. Your dad looks like he could
kill them with his bare hands.

541
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,893
So he does have some human traits, right?

542
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:27,456
Mice are the only thing he fears.

543
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:30,175
A mouse bit him once,
when he was young.

544
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:33,664
-Where are you going?
-To catch mice.

545
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:36,406
Let's go. I'll throw
the traps out for you.

546
00:43:42,221 --> 00:43:44,079
Yeah.Three of them.

547
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:48,504
Three what?

548
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:56,815
-Stop it! Are you really a girl?
-Stop it, Deok Sun. Stop it.

00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,401
I'm Soo Yeon!

550
00:43:58,412 --> 00:44:00,494
Get away from me!
I'll kill you, seriously!

551
00:44:00,694 --> 00:44:02,980
Try killing me!

552
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:06,582
Go away! Stop it! Go away!

553

Don't come near me! Go away!

554
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:23,923
You should really reconsider.

555
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:25,887
What?

556
00:44:26,526 --> 00:44:28,116
You really like that girl,
as a woman?

557
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:31,018
She's cute.

558
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,831
Come to your senses, idiot!

559
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,626
Darn it... I bit my tongue.

560
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:32,535
I'm going to kill you all today!

561
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:36,328

I'll say goodbye.

to me when I'm sleeping?

-Hey, Bo Ra. You're leaving early.
-Yes.

-Hello, Mister.
-Deok Sun. Where are you going?

I'm Soo Yeon.

Yes... did you see
Jung Hwan leave, by any chance?

577
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:47,409
Nope. I haven't seen him.

00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:53,505
-OK. Thank you. Goodbye!
-OK...

Wait. I'm going to get a cup of coffee.

581

OK.

What are you doing?
Why are you leaving so early?

583

What about you, then?
Why are you leaving so early?

584

I'm going to sleep.
Wake me up when we arrive.

You did catch a cold, Mom!

593
00:50:32,523 --> 00:50:33,523
Did you take medicine?

594
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:37,951
It's OK! I'll buy it later.
You'll be home late again today, right?

595
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:41,399
I'll be home around the same time.
Buy some medicine! OK?

All right! Just take care of yourself.

And now, Baduk news.

598

Going forward from today,
matches will be played...

599
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:53,349
...at the Korean Baduk Club's
competition room.

00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,586
The first match will be between
Choi Taek, 6-dan and Yoo Jin Ho, 9-dan.

601
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:01,774
This match has no time limit...

602
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,841
...so players' self-maintenance
will be quite important.

603
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:08,025
To date, the record stands
at three victories and two losses...

It's something I do every day, anyway.

Oppa. Where's Taek?
Did he go the Baduk Club already?

609
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,251
He has a match today.
He left early this morning.

610
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,500
But, did you catch a cold?

611
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,978
No, I'm fine.
Have this.

612
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:35,498

spoonfuls of this...

when you feel a cold coming on.

Why, did he lose?

630
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:40,608
No. The match still isn't over.

631
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:42,657
Didn't the match start this morning?

632
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,722
It started at 9 a.m.,
and it's still not over.

633
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:45,853
It's been ten hours.

634
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,003
I heard that the guy
he's playing is really good.

635
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:50,116
What if he loses,
after all of this time?

636
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:52,441
Then it'll suck.

637
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,751
It looked like he stayed up
all night last night.

638
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:46,470
I bet he's in terrible shape.

639
00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:51,285
Are you still having indigestion issues?
You've been like this since lunch.

640
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:54,599
I don't think I can eat dinner.

641
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:56,489
Go to the bathroom.

642
00:54:07,463 --> 00:54:08,563
Did you throw up?

643
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:10,710
Yeah... a little.

644
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:13,241
Just go home today. Leave early.

645
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:45,663
Did he say you can go home?

646
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,253
Want me to take you home?

647
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:49,402
No, it's fine. I'm leaving.

648
00:54:52,975 --> 00:54:56,664
Got nothing to lose.
Let's give it a shot.

649
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:15,763
Father. My stomach is...

650
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:19,092
I ate the same thing
as Sun Woo for lunch...

651
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:23,732
So I don't know if it's because of that,
but I feel a bit... indigested.

652
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:58,681
Father... Fathe...

653
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:00,606
I think my farts are coming out.

654
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:05,268
I think I'm all digested now.
My farts... my farts...

655
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:49,823
Can I get some medication
for indigestion?

656
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:53,080
Also, can I also have some
cold medicine for runny nose?

657
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:57,233
Is it for you? It's not good
to take those together.

658
00:56:57,702 --> 00:56:59,167
The cold medicine is for my mother.

659
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:03,956
Can I have one that is easy
on the body? Not too strong.

660
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:05,561
OK.

661
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:23,328
You're already here?

662
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:25,447
There's still some time, though.

663
00:57:25,497 --> 00:57:28,396
Jin Joo said she wanted to play here,
so I brought her a bit early.

664
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:31,305
OK. Then have a seat
for a bit before you go.

665
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,426
Yeah... hold on.

666
00:57:48,864 --> 00:57:50,078
This is for you.

667
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:51,467
What is it?

668
00:57:51,919 --> 00:57:53,676
-Medicine.
-What?

669
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:57,070
I bought some for you while
I was buying Taek's medicine.

670
00:57:57,951 --> 00:57:59,241
Thank you very much.

671
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:10,996
Give it to me.
I'll open it for you.

672
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:22,168
No. So clumsy...

673
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:34,363
Oppa. Dye your hair a little bit.
You're growing a lot of white hairs.

674
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:37,365
No way. Who cares about that, at my age?

675
00:58:38,446 --> 00:58:42,021
You're not old. You're just
in your mid forties.

676
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,909
So cold.

677
00:59:04,144 --> 00:59:06,324
OK, let's go.

678
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,625
Jin Joo, say goodbye. Say thank you.

679
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:57,253
Thank you!

680
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,249
Oppa, I'm off then.

681
01:00:44,668 --> 01:00:46,237
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

682
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:48,709
Be careful on your way home, Sir.

683
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:51,141
You know you have a match
at 9 a.m. tomorrow, right?

684
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:05,693
At this rate, he's going to pass out.

685
01:01:28,508 --> 01:01:30,058
Mom, I'm home!

686
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:33,941
Sun Woo!
My son's home?

687
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,354
-You're hungry, right?
-No, I ate with my friends.

688
01:01:37,063 --> 01:01:38,229
Did you eat ddukbokki again?

689
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:40,995
Yeah... that, and some other things.

690
01:01:41,238 --> 01:01:43,354
Is that right? Want me to
make you some kimchi stew?

691
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:47,789
-No. What about you? Did you eat?
-Of course! Look at the belly I have.

692
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,142
The first match of the competition
took place today...

693
01:01:53,212 --> 01:01:55,184
...at the special competition room
at the Korean Baduk Club.

694
01:01:55,572 --> 01:01:59,227
Choi Taek, 6-dan, lost to Yoo Jin Ho,
9 dan by only a few points...

695
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,640
...in a match that lasted
10 hours and 30 minutes.

696
01:02:03,026 --> 01:02:07,070
Choi Taek, 6 dan, could not maintain his
momentum until the end of the match...

697
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:10,205
...and was defeated.

698
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:16,941
Poor Taek hyung. I bet that
he feels terrible, losing like that.

699
01:02:21,603 --> 01:02:23,446
Where's Soo Yeon?
She's not home yet?

700
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:28,513
She should be home soon.

701
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:46,237
Hey, Master Choi! Chin up!

702
01:02:47,778 --> 01:02:49,829
Hey, walk with your chest
held high, at least.

703
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:51,521
And lift your head!

704
01:03:02,244 --> 01:03:07,952
Sorry... I bet you had a really
tough time today.

705
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:12,582
Well, yeah... losses happen...

706
01:03:33,636 --> 01:03:35,575
You... you worked hard.

707
01:04:13,134 --> 01:04:14,712
Mom! I'm going to school!

708
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,328
-Hi!
-Hey.

709
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:30,871
-Hi.
-Hey.

710
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:36,240
What kind of a coincidence is this?

711
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:39,683
All of us leaving at the same time
really doesn't happen very often.

712
01:04:40,425 --> 01:04:42,187
Now, if only Master Choi comes out...

713
01:04:46,346 --> 01:04:47,930
Are you all going to school?

714
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:50,923
When you live in the same
neighborhood for about 20 years...

715
01:04:51,131 --> 01:04:52,541
...you develop a sort of telepathy...

716
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:55,350
Hi, Deok Sun.

717
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:57,606
It's Soo Yeon.

718
01:04:58,451 --> 01:04:59,451
OK.

719
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,556
You guys know about this evening, right?
Ddochi Western Restaurant!

720
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,821
Even if just one of you doesn't
show up, you're all dead!

721
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,031
Can you come?
Don't you have a match today, too?

722
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:10,088
I'll come if it ends early.

723
01:05:10,342 --> 01:05:12,352
Don't get lost on the way, OK?

724
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:13,879
OK.

725
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:15,019
Hey, we're late.

726
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:17,356
-Crap!
-Let's go!

727
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:38,596
Oppa, you should dye your hair.
You're growing a lot of white hairs.

728
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:41,869
No way. Who cares about that,
at my age?

729
01:05:42,543 --> 01:05:44,554
You're not old. You're just
in your mid forties.

730
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:01,772
Hey, where are you going?

731
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:03,179
To wash my face.

732
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,124
If you're sleepy, you should sleep...

733
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:09,009
Why go so far as to
wash your face to study!

734
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:11,651
What... jerk...

735
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:18,350
What, you intense jerks.

736
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:23,759
Where are you going?

737
01:06:24,075 --> 01:06:25,095
To wash my face.

738
01:06:27,575 --> 01:06:31,070
What, you could say I don't know how to
study because I don't wash my face.

739
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:56,947
You scared me!

740
01:06:58,238 --> 01:07:00,448
Jung Bong.
I'm going to the market.

741
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:02,791
Have a safe trip.

742
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:06,501
Let's go together. It'll be hard to
carry everything on the way home.

743
01:07:07,635 --> 01:07:09,022
It's so cold!

744
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,208
Missus, are you going to the market?

745
01:07:17,483 --> 01:07:18,483
Yeah.

746
01:07:18,664 --> 01:07:20,304
What are you making for dinner tonight?

747
01:07:20,773 --> 01:07:23,333
I'm just going to buy a few
cutlassfish and braise them.

748
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:26,455
Are you taking those glass bottles
to Dooly Supermarket?

749
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:29,361
Yes. If I bring all this, I could
probably buy a block of tofu, right?

750
01:07:29,903 --> 01:07:31,333
And you're OK to do your work, right?

751
01:07:31,771 --> 01:07:33,711
Of course! It's nothing!

752
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:36,131
And Sun Woo still doesn't know?

753
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:39,190
Of course not.
I'd be in such big trouble if he did.

754
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:43,084
He's such a gentle kid, but he's
really scary when he gets angry.

755
01:07:43,712 --> 01:07:47,064
I can't believe I'm sort of living
in fear of my own child as I get older.

756
01:07:47,393 --> 01:07:49,748
It's just because he hates
seeing his mom suffer.

757
01:07:50,102 --> 01:07:51,192
He's a real filial son.

758
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:54,206
-That, he is. For sure.
-You're lucky.

759
01:07:55,073 --> 01:07:56,441
You sure drank a lot, didn't you?

760
01:07:57,555 --> 01:07:59,736
[Ssangmun High]
Stand, bow.

761
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:01,182
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

762
01:08:01,193 --> 01:08:02,198
Have yourselves a good dinner.

763
01:08:02,209 --> 01:08:03,741
-Yes!
-Yes!

764
01:08:04,742 --> 01:08:06,520
Hey, let's hurry up and go.
We don't have much time.

765
01:08:06,823 --> 01:08:07,998
Do I have to go?

766
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:11,541
Are you saying that you don't need
pork cutlets, because you're a rich boy?

767
01:08:12,011 --> 01:08:14,141
I have to use all five of these by today!

768
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,138
Dong Ryong. I'm sorry.
I have to go somewhere.

769
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:23,308
If the teacher asks, tell him
that I still don't feel well.

770
01:08:24,003 --> 01:08:25,295
I'll be going ahead, then.

771
01:08:25,354 --> 01:08:27,320
Hey. Hey, you...

772
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:31,525
What the hell?
He's cutting night classes?

773
01:08:32,051 --> 01:08:36,124
Well, fine. If one of us doesn't come,
I can just eat two cutlets, so it's fine.

774
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:38,148
But if Taek doesn't come,
it'll be an issue.

775
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,957
No. Soo Yeon can eat two,
and I can eat two...

776
01:08:41,174 --> 01:08:43,847
No. if I eat three,
and she eats one, I'll be full.

777
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,896
-Then, if Soo Yeon eats four...
-You punk!

778
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:49,320
Are you possessed by a ghost who
died from being denied pork cutlets?

779
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:50,501
We're late. Let's go.

780
01:08:50,947 --> 01:08:52,259
A ghost? Where?

781
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,564
Wait up.

782
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,318
Hey, over here!

783
01:09:19,645 --> 01:09:22,006
I like the atmosphere in here.

784
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:23,579
Five pork cutlets, please!

785
01:09:25,924 --> 01:09:27,153
OK.

786
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:28,383
What the hell? What about Sun Woo?

787
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,428
He said he had to take care of something.

788
01:09:30,548 --> 01:09:32,492
-Why, is he sick?
-No.

789
01:09:33,356 --> 01:09:36,123
I cannot believe there came a day
that Sun Woo cut night classes.

790
01:09:36,391 --> 01:09:37,504
Taek's not here yet, right?

791
01:09:38,364 --> 01:09:39,570
I don't think he can make it.

792
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,338
His match yesterday was
more than ten hours too.

793
01:09:43,784 --> 01:09:46,769
-Hey?
-Yeah... Master Choi! You're here?

794
01:09:50,414 --> 01:09:51,648
You won, didn't you?

795
01:09:51,924 --> 01:09:53,775
Yeah. It ended early today.

796
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:57,491
Did you already order?

797
01:09:57,567 --> 01:09:58,861
Yes, of course.

798
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:00,483
But... where's Sun Woo?

799
01:10:00,817 --> 01:10:02,809
He's cutting night classes.
He said he had something to do.

800
01:10:04,518 --> 01:10:05,530
Sun Woo did?

801
01:10:40,664 --> 01:10:41,814
Enjoy.

802
01:10:46,351 --> 01:10:48,142
I thought you said the waiter
looked like Lee Mi Yeon.

803
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,287
Sorry.

804
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,758
Hey. I can eat two, right?

805
01:10:53,927 --> 01:10:55,014
Split it in half with me.

806
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:57,890
Have mine.

807
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:00,869
No, thanks. Eat up!
Get some meat on those bones.

808
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:14,002
Wait... hey, give it here.

809
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:21,531
Here!

810
01:11:22,462 --> 01:11:24,410
All right... shall I dig in?

811
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:27,516
First, I have to make
plenty of room in there.

812
01:11:27,685 --> 01:11:28,764
I'm going to the bathroom!

813
01:11:29,019 --> 01:11:31,083
Thats... you're so disgusting!

814
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,944
Did I ever say that
I was doing Number Two?

815
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:36,383
I have to use the bathroom, too.

816
01:11:42,891 --> 01:11:44,314
Do I have to use the bathroom now, too?

817
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,051
Thats, it's so darn small!

818
01:12:24,397 --> 01:12:26,221
There isn't even anything to look at!

819
01:12:26,631 --> 01:12:29,169
Go home, Mister!
That's nothing worth looking at!

820
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:44,614
Deok Sun!
You're really incredible.

821
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:46,306
You have some guts...

822
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,761
Sit down.
Let's eat together.

823
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:20,882
Eat up, my Jin Joo!

824
01:13:21,003 --> 01:13:22,670
-OK!
-OK.

825
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:26,015
Oppa, did you try
the citron tea I gave you?

826
01:13:26,046 --> 01:13:27,090
Did it taste OK?

827
01:13:27,156 --> 01:13:28,971
Yeah. You did a good job making it.

828
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:30,305
It tasted great.

829
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:33,278
If you run out, let me know.
I'll make you some more.

830
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:35,510
OK.
How's your cold?

831
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,728
I took the medicine you gave
me and got a whole lot better!

832
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,571
That's good, then.
Jin Joo!

833
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:43,811
-Eat up, OK?
-OK!

834
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:03,111
Why aren't they coming back?

835
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:14,346
Taek's got game. Scary dude!

836
01:14:30,908 --> 01:14:32,149
Are you done crying?

837
01:14:34,104 --> 01:14:35,780
Don't tell the others about this.

838
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:39,369
It's OK to cry a little.

839
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:43,112
Even so... it's humiliating.

840
01:14:48,987 --> 01:14:50,877
Oppa, I'll leave her to you then.

841
01:14:51,589 --> 01:14:53,886
OK. Don't worry, go ahead.

842
01:14:54,015 --> 01:14:55,370
You're heading there earlier today, too.

843
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:58,160
Yeah, I forgot to clean
the bathrooms yesterday.

844
01:14:58,284 --> 01:15:00,162
-I have a lot to do today.
-I see.

845
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:03,905
When you clean, you have to
wear gloves, no matter what.

846
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:07,067
Cleaning supplies are
really bad for your skin.

847
01:15:07,329 --> 01:15:11,641
OK! But... I can't really do
that when I'm working.

848
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,530
Sun Woo doesn't know yet, right?

849
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:16,442
I'm so nervous that
Sun Woo will find out.

850
01:15:17,053 --> 01:15:18,659
Just stay home.

851
01:15:19,024 --> 01:15:21,844
My Sun Woo is so busy
with studying these days.

852
01:15:22,512 --> 01:15:26,804
I have to earn a lot of money
so I can buy my Sun Woo sneakers...

853
01:15:27,026 --> 01:15:31,053
...and some new clothes
for when he goes to college.

854
01:15:31,715 --> 01:15:33,316
Do you think Sun Woo would want that?

855
01:15:33,621 --> 01:15:36,721
Well... but that's not
how a mother feels.

856
01:15:37,675 --> 01:15:40,385
I'm off, ok?
Take good care of her, OK?

857
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,755
OK? Thank you!

858
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:46,291
-Make sure you put on rubber gloves!
-OK!

859
01:15:59,626 --> 01:16:05,985
Uksoo Bathhouse: We're Closed

860
01:16:32,927 --> 01:16:36,082
Hey, nobody is going to
steal your food. Slow down.

861
01:16:36,566 --> 01:16:37,622
Look at these kids.

862
01:16:37,651 --> 01:16:40,771
They're from comfortable families,
so they show class when they eat.

863
01:16:40,782 --> 01:16:44,031
It's only you and me who are like this.
Sheesh... so humiliating.

864
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:46,701
You're comfortable too.
I'm the only one who's poor.

865
01:16:46,805 --> 01:16:49,395
I got these habits from eating at home.
I'm afraid someone will steal my food.

866
01:16:50,783 --> 01:16:52,553
Dong Ryong. Are we
having something after this?

867
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:56,885
"Something after this?"
It's called "dessert."

868
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,869
Do you know what parfait is?
"Do you know parfait?"

869
01:16:58,983 --> 01:17:00,835
-You do, right?
-Yeah. I've had it before.

870
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:03,068
-Me too.
-I haven't.

871
01:17:03,613 --> 01:17:07,040
As to be expected. Without you here,
I'd be so much more pathetic.

872
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,018
Deok... I mean, Soo Yeon.

873
01:17:09,182 --> 01:17:12,594
They'll bring us two parfaits soon,
so have them both, OK?

874
01:17:12,809 --> 01:17:13,897
Yeah!

875
01:17:16,594 --> 01:17:19,680
The parfait is here.

876
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:23,025
What the hell?
This is freaking amazing!

877
01:17:25,242 --> 01:17:27,037
Hey, hey, hey, Soo Yeon!

878
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:29,865
Don't put that in your hair. Put it down.
Hurry.

879
01:17:36,771 --> 01:17:38,141
I'm going to call my house.

880
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:40,066
Why, is something going on at home?

881
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:42,870
I have to tell my brother
to record the boxing match.

882
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:44,848
OK.
Be back soon!

883
01:17:50,126 --> 01:17:51,256
But... what should I do?

884
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:53,637
Why, you don't think you
will be able to eat it all?

885
01:17:53,963 --> 01:17:56,457
No... I have to go to the bathroom again.

886
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:59,627
You already went before, though!

887
01:18:00,612 --> 01:18:02,686
You ate so freaking much...
Hurry up and go!

888
01:18:03,683 --> 01:18:04,831
It's fine.

889
01:18:13,675 --> 01:18:14,976
Is there an earthquake or something?

890
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:17,663
Stop shaking your legs
and go, already.

891
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:22,361
OK. I'll be back really soon!

892
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:24,575
OK.

893
01:19:23,411 --> 01:19:24,496
I came out for a smoke.

894
01:19:29,185 --> 01:19:31,580
Go ahead.
I'll be here.

895
01:19:42,409 --> 01:19:43,509
OK.

896
01:20:06,443 --> 01:20:08,023
I came here to see my mom.

897
01:20:09,891 --> 01:20:11,195
I can go in, right?

898
01:20:13,227 --> 01:20:15,144
You must be Ms. Kim's son!

899
01:20:18,807 --> 01:20:21,277
Well... your mom's inside. Go on in.

900
01:20:21,703 --> 01:20:23,263
Yes. Thank you.

901
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:47,042
Please don't tell my mom
that I was here.

902
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:05,260
Hey... Sun Woo.

903
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:06,899
Yes.

904
01:23:08,147 --> 01:23:13,317
Your mom went out for a bit.
She'll be back soon.

905
01:23:17,403 --> 01:23:19,569
It's cold. Let's go inside.

906
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,364
Mister.

907
01:23:22,859 --> 01:23:23,879
I know about it all.

908
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:25,980
About the fact that my mom
is working at the bathhouse.

909
01:23:26,911 --> 01:23:28,001
I know about it too.

910
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:33,956
Where's Jin Joo?

911
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:38,462
Yeah, she's sleeping inside.
Sun Woo...

912
01:23:38,777 --> 01:23:41,546
-It's not that she has a huge issue...
-It's OK.

913
01:23:43,594 --> 01:23:45,004
I'll pretend like I don't know.

914
01:23:47,378 --> 01:23:49,997
OK... Thank you.

915
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:56,306
I'll be out with my friends
and come home at my usual time.

916
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:57,871
-Thank you.
-OK.

917
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:21,468
Noona. Why do I hate this so much?

918
01:24:23,993 --> 01:24:25,852
I hate this so much!

919
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:32,724
I'm fine, really. I don't need
nice shoes or clothes.

920
01:24:34,058 --> 01:24:35,522
I don't need to go to a cram school!

921
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:39,157
I don't need what any
of the other kids have...

922
01:24:41,238 --> 01:24:43,164
I just want her to not work.

923
01:24:44,278 --> 01:24:46,392
I really hate seeing my mom suffer.

924
01:24:47,471 --> 01:24:50,578
Also, why does Mr. Choi know something
that I don't even know about?

925
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:55,957
Why does Taek's dad know something that
even her own son doesn't know about?

926
01:24:59,838 --> 01:25:02,551
I told her it's fine,
so why is she doing this?

927
01:25:05,595 --> 01:25:08,946
I really don't need anything else.
We can just live like we have been!

928
01:25:12,123 --> 01:25:14,008
Her son hates it so much, so why...

929
01:25:15,762 --> 01:25:17,375
Darn it...

930
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:25,849
Hey... Forget that.

931
01:25:27,349 --> 01:25:29,271
Just go massage her shoulders.

932
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:38,376
Go massage her shoulders.

933
01:26:21,438 --> 01:26:23,479
You hate seeing your
mother suffer, right?

934
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:25,646
And not seeing her suffer
makes you feel more at ease.

935
01:26:27,002 --> 01:26:32,591
Hey. Well, for your mom, not being able
to buy you Nikes is what she hates.

936
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:35,541
Why are you only thinking of yourself?

937
01:26:35,627 --> 01:26:37,230
Have some consideration for
how your mom feels.

938
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:41,689
Is your peace of mind the only
important thing, you immature punk?

939
01:26:47,771 --> 01:26:52,398
Loving someone isn't
just the room to give.

940
01:26:53,065 --> 01:26:55,696
It's the desperate need to give
because you have to.

941
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,909
Mom, I'm home! I'm hungry!

942
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:13,320
Yeah! You're home, my Sun Woo?
Hurry and wash up.

943
01:27:13,331 --> 01:27:16,256
I got some goldfish bread
to fix up for you.

944
01:27:16,407 --> 01:27:18,119
-OK. I'll go wash up.
-OK.

945
01:27:21,813 --> 01:27:24,141
-Is it good?
-Yeah. It's really good.

946
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:30,687
I bought it at the three way
intersection, down the road.

947
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,377
They make really delicious goldfish bread.

948
01:27:35,278 --> 01:27:38,105
Sun Woo.
You love your mom, right?

949
01:27:39,249 --> 01:27:44,530
Hey. It's really difficult
to love someone.

950
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:06,730
My cute child, No Eul...

951
01:28:16,841 --> 01:28:19,072
Thats, so warm!

952
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:32,637
To love someone, does not only mean
that you love to feel them near you...

953
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:37,340
...but it means that you love to
acclimate yourself to them.

954
01:28:43,711 --> 01:28:45,924
My No Eul...

955
01:28:52,345 --> 01:28:55,324
Why did Jung Hwan run ahead, though?

956
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:57,595
He said he had to watch a
video or something...

957
01:28:58,027 --> 01:29:00,693
He's so similar to Jung
Bong hyung sometimes.

958
01:29:02,131 --> 01:29:03,951
-Bye, friend.
-OK.

959
01:29:26,095 --> 01:29:28,334
And also, to love someone, means that...

960
01:29:29,463 --> 01:29:32,171
...even if that person
endlessly causes you pain...

961
01:29:32,983 --> 01:29:36,240
...and so you find yourself endlessly
wanting to hate them...

962
01:29:37,287 --> 01:29:41,029
...yet... you can never hate them.

963
01:29:43,246 --> 01:29:45,797
Jung Hwan!
Bring this over to Taek.

964
01:30:17,908 --> 01:30:23,008
To love someone, doesn't mean
that you don't hate them.

965
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:27,308
It means that you can
never be able to hate them.

966
01:31:53,902 --> 01:31:56,592
To: Mr. Kim Jung Bong

967
01:32:20,156 --> 01:32:22,398
Oppa.
Did you get a letter?

968
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:25,611
A love letter?

969
01:32:25,803 --> 01:32:28,821
You're so popular lately!

970
01:32:29,047 --> 01:32:32,331
Hey, why did your friend take
so long to send me a response?

971
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,760
I thought I would die waiting!

972
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,391
What are you talking about?

973
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:38,033
Man Ok sent you a response?

974
01:32:38,631 --> 01:32:39,662
Yeah. Here.

975
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:41,672
Are you crazy?

976
01:32:41,811 --> 01:32:44,441
She can't even eat properly
because she was in a car accident.

977
01:32:44,829 --> 01:32:46,067
How could she send you a reply?

978
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:48,141
She can't even move a finger right now.

979
01:33:02,586 --> 01:33:03,951
What's this, then?

980
01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:06,271
Yeah, I wonder.
What is that?

981
01:33:06,607 --> 01:33:07,907
Who's it from?

982
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:28,509
This letter had its beginnings in England
and it makes its rounds every year...

983
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,884
...giving good luck to
those who receive it....

984
01:33:33,616 --> 01:33:35,291
It's a lucky letter!
You don't have much time.

985
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:38,033
You have to forward this
to seven people in four days.

986
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:41,051
Good luck!

987
01:33:45,654 --> 01:33:49,372
President Kennedy of the United States
received this letter but ignored it...

988
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,610
...and was assassinated.

989
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:07,253
Space Adventure Invitation

990
01:34:07,366 --> 01:34:10,512
With this one card, you can go
anywhere you want to go.

991
01:34:12,462 --> 01:34:13,648
No way.

992
01:34:13,659 --> 01:34:15,349
Hey, how did you get
so much prettier?

993
01:34:15,851 --> 01:34:18,541
Hey, that's not true!
What are you saying?

994
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:19,832
-Bye!
-I'll call you.

995
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:20,988
OK.

996
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:23,222
We can't enter Taek's room
until this Saturday.

997
01:34:23,341 --> 01:34:26,941
Our Taek... do you think you
have to eat breakfast, or not?

998
01:34:29,314 --> 01:34:30,352
I should eat.

999
01:34:30,574 --> 01:34:32,909
You're so frustrating.
You idiot.

1000
01:34:33,258 --> 01:34:35,673
You have to put your strength here.
Are you an idiot?

1001
01:34:35,684 --> 01:34:37,230
-Like this?
-Yeah!

1002
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:38,371
OK.

1003
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:42,809
We really don't have
that kind of relationship.

1004
01:34:42,988 --> 01:34:44,174
Do you not like him?

1005
01:34:44,911 --> 01:34:46,141
Even so, I don't like it.

1006
01:34:46,419 --> 01:34:47,551
Sun Woo.

1007
01:34:48,451 --> 01:34:50,515
Oppa.
Aren't you scared?

1008
01:34:51,206 --> 01:34:52,336
I am scared.

1009
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:03,982
My god!
What do we do?

1010
01:35:03,993 --> 01:35:06,841
Mister... did you get
a call from Taek?
