1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,383
Duk Seon!
You'll be late for school! Hurry up!

2
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,818
OK!

3
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,558
I'm off!

4
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:23,934
I'm off!

5
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:29,539
I'm off!

6
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:30,970
Do you want me to drive you?

7
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:33,710
It's OK.
I have a car too.

8
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:35,670
A car?

9
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,818
Hi, Air Jordans.

10
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,158
I'm off...

11
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,393
Nobody's home, right?

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,895
I know. Yes.

13
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,372
Oh yeah, my backpack.

14
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,811
Mister!
Hurry up and go!

15
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,847
Hurry up and go!

16
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,321
Darn it!

17
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:21,170
Here! Take it!

18
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,670
What the hell?

19
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,170
-Come through!
-Sorry!

20
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,665
-Come on!
-I'm sorry.

21
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,370
Geez!

22
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,409
Mister, go!

23
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,429
Should I just go back home?

24
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,810
I want to go to college.

25
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:20,670
Crazy girl. You must be out of
your darn mind. As if.

26
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm going to study, starting today.
Get me a tutor.

27
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,356
What... what tutor?

28
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,670
Your older sister goes to
Seoul University!

29
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,463
You can just learn from her
instead of wasting my money!

30
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,598
Learn from your sister.

31
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,343
THREE YEARS AGO.

32
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,752
Transfer it.

33
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,959
Move everything except for "x"
over to the other side!

34
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:05,595
Oh.

35
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,133
2x equals...

36
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,571
Six minus eight.

37
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,874
Geez.

38
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,446
Are you certain?

39
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,053
Hey, you idiot!

40
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,923
I told you to negate the number when
you move it to the other side, didn't I?

41
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,158
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

43
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,828
Are you hollow?
Do you have nothing in there?

44
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:41,931
This is for first-year middle schooler's!
First-semester first-years, no less!

45
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,035
Even if you're that much of an idiot,
how can you not even solve this?

46
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,005
There's something
fundamentally wrong with you.

47
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,670
Everything is a joke to you.

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,309
You have nothing you're serious about.

49
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,978
You always have
a dull look in your eyes too.

50
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,181
Jesus Christ.

51
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,984
What I'm saying is,
focus more on an everyday level.

52
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,170
If you're dumb,
you should at least try hard!

53
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,170
Do you think living life
is that easy?

54
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,358
You know, the thing stuck
to your neck. Your head.

55
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,670
Why do you carry that around?
Don't just use it for styling your hair.

56
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,128
Use it to study for a change!

57
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,463
Use your darn head!

58
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,465
Even if you're an idiot, you can
at least memorize things!

59
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't try to understand it...
just memorize it!

60
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,670
Got it?

61
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,636
Geez, you idiot!

62
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,170
Darn it.

63
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,807
My chest hurts.

64
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,670
If learning from her means life
or death, I'll take death.

65
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,946
I'm going to go to the
study room from now on.

66
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,882
Mom. Her issue is
her lack of concentration.

67
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,452
She can't last ten minutes at a desk.

68
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,455
I've never even seen her sit at a desk.

69
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:45,328
But you know, I've heard...

70
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,132
that there is something that
works wonders for concentration.

71
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,670
What?

72
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:55,670
Just consider yourself lucky
that you have me as a father.

73
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:01,344
Also, know what a huge blessing it is
to be living on this block.

74
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,427
You must be busy.
Sorry.

75
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,764
Do you even know how to play Baduk?

76
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,570
Go first.

77
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,398
Do you want to eat ramyun?

78
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,901
Do you want me to make it?

79
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,977
Wow! Why did you go through
all the trouble of making this?

80
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,813
I bought them because they were on sale.

81
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,481
I just bought an entire box.

82
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,470
Hurry up and eat,
Bo Ra's father.

83
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,221
Yes.

84
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:22,525
My husband never eats this at home.

85
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,960
How should I eat this?

86
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,964
You just take this in
your hand and eat it.

87
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,433
We just started having croaker recently.

88
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:35,472
Wow... Jung Bong's mother
really is a saint.

89
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:39,909
How could you be so generous, to share
something so precious and expensive?

90
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,946
I'd feel like there was barely
enough to feed my own family...

91
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,685
Oh my... oh my...

92
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:51,670
Oh my. It's so chubby.
Just look at how much meat is on here.

93
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,056
Wow.

94
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,031
I could just die right here!

95
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,170
It's delicious!

96
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,375
I heard Duk Seon is
learning Baduk as of late?

97
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:16,170
I did hear that Baduk is good for
increasing one's concentration.

98
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,170
Baduk must be difficult for her.

99
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,416
She probably won't last too long.

100
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:23,860
Hey, how can you say that?

101
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,488
What do you mean,
she won't last long?

102
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,170
I bet she already gave up on it
without lasting a full day!

103
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,660
I know I shouldn't talk about
my own daughter like this...

104
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:37,660
but she really has no talent
for studying.

105
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,070
But, you know, I heard
something else too.

106
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,441
I heard that Baduk really is that good
for increasing one's concentration.

107
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,244
What are you doing?
Why aren't you eating?

108
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:53,850
Get some more rice for yourself. Geez.

109
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:56,920
Why aren't you eating?

110
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:30,753
Want to switch?

111
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,121
I'll open it for you.

112
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:33,623
You do this.

113
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:55,660
Wow!

114
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:03,353
Here!

115
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,514
Here.

116
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,916
Work on that.
I'm going to the bathroom.

117
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:02,345
Dear!

118
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,981
Is Jung Bong studying well nowadays?

119
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,884
There's less than 50 days
before exams, right?

120
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:20,263
Three... two... one.
Start!

121
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,283
Got to get some
fermented soybean paste...

122
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,760
Oh! Where were you off to,
so early in the morning?

123
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,896
Today is my wife's birthday!

124
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,865
I'm making her seaweed soup.

125
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:30,967
I'll be heading inside then.

126
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:11,240
You jerk!

127
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,277
I'll kill you...

128
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,379
Sorry...

129
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,650
I'm off!

130
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,552
You know that we're
eating out tonight, right?

131
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,886
Come home early.

132
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,588
I'm going to be studying
until late though.

133
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,490
But today's Saturday...

134
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,793
You want to die?

135
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,263
I have to be home by 5 PM, right?

136
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:50,813
What's with your shoes?

137
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,950
What? Why?
What?

138
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:57,053
Can't you tell?
They're Air Jordans. Why?

139
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:59,455
You'll get caught by
the Leadership Team with those.

140
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,157
Don't you know that, idiot?

141
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,626
Sun Woo's been on the Leadership Team
since last week, idiot.

142
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,461
Must be nice, idiot.

143
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,197
Must be nice for you too. You won't
even need to bring lunch today.

144
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:12,001
You can just have what's stuck
on your chin for lunch. Idiot.

145
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,672
Geez...
Bye.

146
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,052
Where are we?
Are we here? Do we get off?

147
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:06,389
We still have a long way...
Do you think I'd leave you behind?

148
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,294
Duk Seon. Where are you?
Can you hear me? Answer me, Duk Seon!

149
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,029
Don't call my name...

150
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,787
Mister! Geez...

151
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,723
What happened?

152
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,393
Are we here?
Do we get off, or what?

153
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,220
Do we get off, or what?
What happened?

154
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,571
Honey!
It's almost time!

155
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,275
You look pretty enough!
Let's go, already!

156
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,710
What time is it now?

157
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,746
4:33 PM. It's almost time!

158
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,049
Jung Hwan!
Jung Bong!

159
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,584
You two hurry up too!

160
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,488
Geez, you all are getting all dolled up
because we're going out to eat.

161
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:18,327
What's this?
Is that really my son?

162
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,897
Are you an actor?
I like those colors.

163
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,032
Is it new?

164
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,267
I wore this yesterday too.

165
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,302
Oh!

166
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,971
What about your older brother?
Tell him to come out quickly too.

167
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:39,982
Older Bro. Let's go.

168
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,918
Today is Mom's birthday.
We're eating out.

169
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:48,591
I won't take a single step out
until I finish this.

170
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,928
It's my own battle to fight.

171
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,398
We're going to eat pork cutlets.

172
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,471
I might get carsick
if I do this in the car.

173
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:22,324
Geez... what's taking her so long?
Honey!

174
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,392
Mi Ran!

175
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:24,460
Ra Mi...

176
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:39,742
Honey, why did you stuff
your shoulders so much?

177
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,949
Can I just... stay home?

178
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:51,887
No. Family has to stick together.
Hurry up and get in.

179
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:54,090
I have some stuff in the front,
so everyone ride in the back.

180
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:03,999
Let's go, Kit.

181
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,421
Honey.

182
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,558
Did... we eat all of
the stuffed blood clams?

183
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:04,827
Yeah.

184
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:08,998
Then you should've bought some
before we ran out!

185
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:13,335
You know how much I love those!

186
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,405
Shut the hell up
and eat already!

187
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:18,741
Do you know how annoying
it is to make those?

188
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,143
They take so long to bring home and boil

189
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,546
and then I have to put sauce
in every single one!

190
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,315
You think they grow
on trees or something?

191
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:31,987
Geez, it's not like I asked you to make
me galbi stew or shuck me oysters!

192
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:36,559
I love stuffed blood clams the most!
You can't even make that one thing!

193
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,894
Also, why are you getting
so mad over it?

194
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,966
Geez. Socrates was really on
the money when he said this.

195
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,168
"A terrible wife is still a wife."

196
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,440
It's my fault that I've dealt with you
for all this time! You know that?

197
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:53,342
What nonsense...

198
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,545
Be grateful that I put up
with someone like you!

199
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,983
No manners, no charm.
Geez, geez, geez...

200
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,186
Well, I must have had something going
for me for us to have had three kids!

201
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:09,725
Turn that trash off!

202
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,828
I ought to throw that away!

203
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,196
Lower the volume, you jerk!

204
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,220
Now's the time for you to watch TV?

205
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,605
You'll be a high school sophomore soon.
You should be studying, darn it...

206
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,907
He's like this because
he takes after you.

207
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:29,111
What? Why is that my fault?
How is that my fault?

208
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:33,048
If he took after me, he'd be first in
the entire school! He takes after you!

209
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,119
What did you just say?
Say it again.

210
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,155
What's wrong with my brains?
What's wrong with my brains, tell me!

211
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:44,260
To be frank, you didn't even
graduate high school.

212
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,035
What the hell!
That's low!

213
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:57,320
You started it!

214
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:15,824
-Get out! I said, get out!
-Why are you treating him like that?

215
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:29,238
Can I take your order? The best thing
on our menu is the pork cutlet.

216
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,139
Oh...

217
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,542
Four pork cutlets, please.

218
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,345
-Father, I'd like the beef cutlet.
-I'd like the Hamburg steak.

219
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,190
The pork cutlet here is the best.

220
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,381
-Beef.
-Hamburg.

221
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,618
Two pork cutlets, one beef cutlet,
and one Hamburg skake.

222
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,687
One Hambak skate...

223
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,389
One Hamburg steak, please.

224
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:50,993
-Would you like rice or bread?
-Rice.

225
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,095
-Me too.
-Yes.

226
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,863
It's so nice to eat out
with the family.

227
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,901
I'm sure that there is no family
more harmonious than ours.

228
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:34,470
Isn't that right, Jung Bong?

229
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,705
Yes, Father.
Enjoy yourself as well.

230
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:44,346
When I see my kids and my Mi Ran eating
so happily, I feel satisfied enough.

231
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,916
Jung Hwan. Do you want more steak?
Do you want me to order you another?

232
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,251
I already did.

233
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,954
Why are you talking so much?

234
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:53,756
Your spit is going to
get on the food. Stop it.

235
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,058
OK.

236
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,631
What happened?
What?

237
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,048
One, two, three!

238
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,620
Here you go.

239
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,340
-I'll take a photo for you.
-Ah, yes. Thank you!

240
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,028
No, it's OK!

241
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:37,366
Let's take one! Let's take one together!
Please take one.

242
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:40,536
-I don't want to either.
-Jung Hwan, let's take one.

243
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,639
Jung Bong, just take one and keep
eating. Take it, and then eat.

244
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:46,175
Come on. Jung Hwan, you can eat
after we take it.

245
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,676
Hurry. Put your fork down.

246
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:51,513
Honey. You look so pretty. Look there.
He's waiting, come on!

247
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,315
It's a happy occasion!
We should take one.

248
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,817
He's waiting. Look, smile!

249
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,252
Smile!
Smile, OK?

250
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,888
OK, smile!
Pork cutlet!

251
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:02,291
One, two, three!

252
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,694
Study, you jerk.

253
00:25:56,104 --> 00:26:01,143
Jung Hwan.
Your dad bought some Italiano!

254
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,614
High-quality ice cream!
Italiano!

255
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,249
Hurry and come out.
Let's eat it together.

256
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,885
Kim Jung Hwan!

257
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,656
I'll put this on the table then.

258
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,924
Come out and eat it!

259
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,979
My older son!
Let's have some ice cream!

260
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:40,015
Hey, my eldest son.

261
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:42,084
You don't want ice cream?

262
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,521
I'll leave it in the kitchen then.

263
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:47,623
Come out and have some.

264
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:58,967
At the Baduk Championships today,
6-Dan Choi Taek

265
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,870
was defeated by newcomer
Park Joon Young.

266
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:09,111
Park beat 6-Dan Choi Taek in 123 moves.

267
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:17,252
Choi Taek was disadvantaged from the
beginning and seemed to give up halfway.

268
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,189
He has been overcome by a jinx
in the past, and this time

269
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,692
he showed his weakness
to a newcomer.

270
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:29,097
There are many who wonder
if he has fallen into a slump.

271
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,999
Hey, Dong Ryong.
Today, Taek...

272
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:52,020
Where are you going, Mom?

273
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,690
I'm going to Taek's to give them
some kimchi pancakes.

274
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:56,124
I heard he lost today!

275
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,820
Don't say anything about it.

276
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,361
He'll probably feel even worse.

277
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:03,365
What?
Are you going somewhere?

278
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,934
No... just up there.

279
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,202
Aren't you hungry?

280
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:08,336
No, I'm fine.

281
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,377
What time is it now?

282
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:19,848
You didn't feed the dog,
Haeng Gook, today, right?

283
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:21,817
Hurry up and feed him.

284
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,753
You want me to do that?

285
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:27,556
Then you want me to do it,
at my age?

286
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:31,793
Ah, ha. I'm a bit embarrassed.

287
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,433
Oh, President Kim!

288
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,604
Where are you going?

289
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:44,720
The bathroom.

290
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,541
Feed Haeng Gook too,
while you're at it.

291
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:47,442
OK.

292
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:07,796
Haeng Gook...

293
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,599
Oh my God, you scared me!

294
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,068
Make a little noise when you
walk around, will you?

295
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,469
Speak for yourself.

296
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,038
Where were you?

297
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:21,009
The study room.
To study.

298
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,613
Look at you, lying through your teeth.

299
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:28,784
You sure you didn't just dig up a grave?
Are you a zombie or something?

300
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:33,588
Geez.
Exactly how old are you?

301
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,457
In the middle of the night, too.

302
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,459
Oh my God!
You scared me!

303
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,427
Why are you so on edge?

304
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:43,064
Duk Seon.
Do you have any pencil lead?

305
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,333
Yeah.

306
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,669
Follow me.
I'll give you some.

307
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,996
Are you asleep?

308
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:51,720
I made some kimchi pancakes.

309
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,668
Is Taek sleeping?

310
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,905
Let's just act as if nothing happened.

311
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,220
He's taking this a lot harder
than he usually does.

312
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:05,720
Don't worry too much about him.

313
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,983
You'll make him feel worse.

314
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,885
Just pretend like nothing happened.

315
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,586
I'll be going now.

316
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,288
Have some of this.

317
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,803
Mom.

318
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,238
It starts today, right?

319
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:44,472
Yeah!

320
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,443
Jung Bong's mother
especially included you!

321
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:54,720
No! I told you, I won't
get tutored by her!

322
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,318
Honey. There's no
stuffed blood clams today?

323
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:58,586
Shut it.
Don't eat.

324
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,220
Just do it, already!

325
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,124
Do it for your sister's sake,
at least!

326
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,720
I said no!

327
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,563
They're letting you join even though
Jung Hwan is the one getting tutored.

328
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:09,497
For free.

329
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:10,632
Shut it.

330
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,934
You really didn't catch onto that?

331
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,870
It's as if Jung Bong's mother
is giving you allowance!

332
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,720
You think that Jung Hwan
really needs tutoring?

333
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,774
You're the only one on the block
that needs any tutoring!

334
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,220
There's Dong Ryong, too.

335
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:24,512
Dong Ryong's father is a teacher!
So why would he need tutoring?

336
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:28,720
Either way, we decided to do it starting
today, so don't say a word. Just study.

337
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,386
Don't think of her as your older sister.
Think of her as your teacher!

338
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:33,488
I'm not doing it.
I'm really not doing it.

339
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,491
And why the hell not?

340
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:38,720
They said that Jung Hwan and Sun Woo

341
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,329
ranked Number one and two respectively,
are coming.

342
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,899
Why are you being so stubborn?

343
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,720
Huh? Stop being stupidly stubborn!
Just do it!

344
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:49,720
Just do as your mother tells you...

345
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Sun Woo is coming!

346
00:35:57,472 --> 00:35:58,406
Older Bro.

347
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,100
Ugh, so cold!

348
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,547
Would you like some juice?

349
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:41,382
Enjoy it yourself.

350
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,924
Hurry up and get dressed too.

351
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:51,926
The kids will come to get tutored soon.

352
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,562
I don't want to make them
feel awkward, so let's leave.

353
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,068
I said, let's leave!

354
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,004
Go out by yourself.

355
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,906
I'm just going to stay here.

356
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:20,455
Jung Bong's father loves to stick
by your side... so where is he today?

357
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:23,057
I don't know!
What's he grumpy about this time?

358
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,720
Geez... it's like raising another kid.

359
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:27,629
Oh, come here!
Have a beer.

360
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:30,220
Oh geez... what's this,
drinking in broad daylight?

361
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,599
I'm afraid of what others will think.

362
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,968
We're all friends here on this block,
so whatever.

363
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:35,803
But... what about Bo Ra's father?

364
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,673
Why didn't you two come out together?
He could've had a drink with us.

365
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,943
I don't know. He left in the morning
saying he was meeting friends.

366
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:47,720
I wish he'd take No Eul to the public
baths or help around the house today.

367
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,050
He's so selfish.

368
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:52,220
He doesn't even bother you... how nice.

369
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,688
Geez, lady.

370
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,220
You're so lucky to be able to
say something like that.

371
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,525
If Bo Ra's father was even half
the man that Jung Bong's father was

372
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,720
I'd carry him on my back every day.

373
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,528
I'd treat him like a king.

374
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:03,031
It's only nice for a day or two...
trust me.

375
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:06,720
I wish he'd see his friends
or go off somewhere on the weekends.

376
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:10,571
All he does is
roll around the house... geez!

377
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,875
Wow... you two have no etiquette.

378
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,244
Are you poking fun at me
for being a widow?

379
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:19,720
Are you bragging about
your husbands in front of me?

380
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,515
Geez.

381
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,183
Your life is the best, honestly.

382
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,352
Geez... it must be nice to be you.

383
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,054
Really.

384
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:30,091
Then... get together with Taek's dad.

385
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:31,720
It's pretty much fate that
you live on the same block.

386
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,150
What did you say?
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,720
Why? What's wrong with it?

388
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:38,333
Oh, my.

389
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,902
It's like fate... it's Taek's father.

390
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,720
Well... then again, living with him
would be like living with a rock.

391
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
But he has a lot of money...

392
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,950
Looks like our Sun Young's life
will blossom in her older years!

393
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,220
What good would that be?

394
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:00,221
I barely hear him say
two words in a single day.

395
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,024
I have to practice abstinence
forever, at this age?

396
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,694
I'm fine with someone with no money, but
I'm not fine with someone who's no fun.

397
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,563
What about my husband, then?

398
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,432
No thanks.
You can keep him.

399
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,036
Oh! I was going to come back for that!

400
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,038
Well, you live right here, so...

401
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,720
How's Taek?

402
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,942
Well.. you know.

403
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:23,720
Just act as if nothing happened.
That's the best thing to do.

404
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,545
Yes.

405
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:28,220
It's not like he can win all the time.
He has to lose sometimes.

406
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,017
We won't say a word to him.

407
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,720
But... I know it's Sunday,
but the block is especially quiet.

408
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,720
What about the kids?

409
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,492
Oh... the kids are getting
tutored by Bo Ra today.

410
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,259
What?

411
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,220
They're going to be juniors soon.

412
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,564
That's why they're
getting tutored by Bo Ra.

413
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,501
Our friend over here
treated all our kids!

414
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,920
Isn't tutoring... illegal?

415
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,805
It's among us,
so what does that matter?

416
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,306
Who would report us?

417
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,042
Are you going to report us?

418
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,813
Of course not.

419
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,220
-Here, have one!
-Look, he's going off to report us.

420
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:12,960
You're here too?

421
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:14,929
Yes.

422
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,965
Your father is a teacher, though.

423
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,801
Yes.

424
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,537
What if he reports us
to the Board of Education?

425
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:23,938
Did you tell your dad about us?

426
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,240
My dad's busy.

427
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:27,742
My mom registered me for this.

428
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:30,720
Why is your dad busy?
It's Sunday.

429
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,147
My dad...

430
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,917
tutors.

431
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:51,220
You all think that
I'm a science teacher, right?

432
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,934
That's a load of bull!

433
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:58,630
I'm... not a science teacher,
but what?

434
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,475
-A music teacher!
-A music teacher!

435
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:02,220
OK, bingo!

436
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,379
All right... shall I
have a listen, then?

437
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:08,220
We're starting the periodic table.
Ready?

438
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,720
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!

439
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,992
The dean... no, your father... he's a
chemistry teacher. He teaches math too?

440
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:21,762
His major in college
was mathematics.

441
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,664
What a plot twist,
am I right?

442
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:25,633
Wow.

443
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:27,935
All right.
Quadratic formula.

444
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:31,739
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!

445
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:40,920
X equals negative b
plus or minus the square root

446
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,254
of b squared minus 4ac
all over 2a. All done!

447
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,756
You punks.

448
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,259
Did you bring your math textbooks?

449
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:11,846
What is this?

450
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:14,282
She only looked at the section on sets.

451
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,450
I do sets better than
anyone in my class!

452
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,852
Geez... good for you.

453
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:26,928
What's with your book?

454
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:27,995
It's so wrinkly!

455
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,364
Don't touch that.
That's his drool.

456
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:48,316
Let's just give up on math.

457
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:52,720
Physics.
Let's test you two on physics.

458
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,855
A really easy question, too.

459
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:56,557
A middle school problem.

460
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,927
You know the formula,
F equals ma, right?

461
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,467
Jung Hwan, who is 70 kilograms

462
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:09,770
hits Sun Woo with a force
of 20 Newtons.

463
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:12,039
What's the acceleration?

464
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,310
How did you endure that?

465
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,779
It must have hurt.

466
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,284
You endured it well.

467
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,853
If you didn't get hurt,
that's good enough.

468
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,134
Juice.

469
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:43,304
Enjoy.

470
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,309
Thanks, Jung Bong.

471
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,647
You're welcome.
My pleasure.

472
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,454
Older Bro.
Where are you going?

473
00:44:01,322 --> 00:44:05,459
Oh, I want to ask Taek
how to solve this.

474
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,720
Taek's not home.
He went to the club.

475
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,497
Even we barely get
to see him these days.

476
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:12,066
What?

477
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,720
KOREAN BADUK CLUB

478
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:36,323
What brings you here on a Sunday, Sir?

479
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:40,428
Same goes to Taek, 6-Dan.
It's Sunday, so you should relax.

480
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,630
For him, this level of play
is relaxing.

481
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,568
How can you win every time?

482
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,737
Losses happen.

483
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:53,307
They say that losses are all
a part of gaining experience.

484
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:58,579
Just consider this as a good experience
and forget about it already.

485
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,219
Even so, Choi Taek, 6-dan's still the
likely winner of this competition.

486
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,590
It's fine!
It's fine!

487
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:11,392
Don't worry about it.

488
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,496
Other people lose 20 or 30 times a year.

489
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,833
The fact that you have a
70-percent winning rate...

490
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,436
even that's impressive enough!

491
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,305
Hey!

492
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:27,308
What brings you here?
You never come out on Sundays.

493
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,777
I came to console our Taek.

494
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:33,914
You're OK, right?

495
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:36,720
Of course.

496
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,386
Even if you're the Almighty Choi Taek,
you can't win all the time.

497
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:41,489
And you still have the finals.

498
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,424
It's fine.
It's fine.

499
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,401
I'm worried about Taek.

500
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:55,736
Yeah.

501
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,105
I'm more worried about your lives!

502
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:00,908
I thought you at least
knew some English.

503
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:01,942
Geez!

504
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:04,745
You guys.

505
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:06,947
English is just memorization.
Just memorize it!

506
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:10,050
Just forget everything else
and memorize it! OK?

507
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,720
Do you even know any words?

508
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,123
Do you know anything that will
supplement your memorization?

509
00:46:16,657 --> 00:46:18,292
Of course I do!
What do you take me for?

510
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,126
What, then?

511
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,829
I, my, me, my.

512
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,832
You, your, you, yours.

513
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:27,301
-That's first-year middle school stuff.
-He, his, him, his.

514
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,769
Jesus.

515
00:46:28,903 --> 00:46:30,304
She... her, her, hers!

516
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,439
We, our, us, ours.

517
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,876
I know how to speak German, too.

518
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,978
Der, des, Dem, Dem,
die, der, der, die

519
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:39,780
das, des, Dem, das,
die, der, Dem, die.

520
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,019
You didn't forget that you're coming to
Duk Seon's school with me tomorrow, yes?

521
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,489
Hey, I don't know when
I'm getting out of work.

522
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:50,224
You go by yourself.

523
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,926
They asked both of us to come!

524
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:54,595
It's the first meeting about her future.
How can I go alone?

525
00:46:55,196 --> 00:46:57,298
All right, already!
Give it a rest!

526
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,365
I'll come.

527
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,100
Thank you!

528
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,020
Don't go talking to strangers
on your way home.

529
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,740
Call home as soon as you leave the bank.

530
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:08,520
Why do you never call?

531
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Look at Jung Bong's dad. He calls
every hour after he leaves his shop.

532
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:12,279
Other husbands...

533
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,020
All right, already!
Give it a rest!

534
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,020
I'm not your child.

535
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,621
Every time I try to say something,
you're just dying to nag at me!

536
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:22,790
Really, I...
oh my.

537
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,494
Oh, T...

538
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,864
He probably feels terrible.

539
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,933
Don't say anything to aggravate him.
Be really careful.

540
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,369
Why, I ought to...

541
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:38,439
Master Choi!
Hi, there.

542
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,020
Oh, yes.

543
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:47,114
Here. Have one of these.

544
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,586
Also, why don't you and your father
come eat dinner at our place tonight?

545
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:56,020
I'm going to make seaweed soup today.

546
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,224
You like seaweed soup, right?

547
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,226
It's OK.

548
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:02,062
Then...

549
00:48:02,897 --> 00:48:03,530
OK.

550
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,800
OK. Bye.

551
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:07,735
Bye, now!

552
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,403
Bye!

553
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:11,520
How sad...

554
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:12,673
Why, I ought to...

555
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:16,310
Did you feed your common sense
to Haeng Gook?

556
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,713
How could you offer seaweed soup
to someone who lost a match?

557
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:22,683
Oh my God! It's an allegory for failure.
You're right.

558
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,752
Oh my God, what do I do?
I totally forgot.

559
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:26,687
Geez... what do I do?

560
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,756
Go and tell him that
you're sorry, already!

561
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:32,092
Geez...

562
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:42,603
You're just getting home?

563
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:46,807
What about dinner?

564
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,076
I ate.

565
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:51,011
Taek.

566
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:54,915
Have strength. OK?

567
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,084
Yes.

568
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,498
What about your dad?

569
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,600
He says he doesn't want any.

570
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,807
Wait.

571
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:28,182
Dinner, honey.

572
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:32,353
Your food is going to get cold.

573
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,763
I wonder what he's
grumpy about this time.

574
00:49:42,763 --> 00:49:43,831
Geez.

575
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:48,469
Where are you going?
You're not eating dinner?

576
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:50,671
I'm going to Taek's.
I'll eat with the guys.

577
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,207
Don't bother Taek
and come home early!

578
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:54,020
OK!

579
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,246
Eat up already.

580
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,621
Hey. Eat.

581
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:09,020
OK.

582
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:13,961
Hey, that's Kim Hye Soo,
right?

583
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:18,732
Wow... she's so pretty.

584
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,068
What is she, 22, 23?

585
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,102
She's 19!

586
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:24,538
She's 19! She's younger than Bo Ra!

587
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:26,407
Oh my... she's 19?

588
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:30,944
What kind of 19-year-old
is so good at acting?

589
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:34,820
Look at her face.
She's a pretty one.

590
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:41,488
Geez... who doesn't
look that good at 19?

591
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,458
I was pretty like that when I was 19.

592
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,294
What utter nonsense.

593
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:51,465
When I met you, you were 18.

594
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,668
There wasn't a single part of you
that was pretty.

595
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:57,104
Then did I date Il Hwa or Yi Hwa?

596
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,907
Please!
Do you know how you were back then?

597
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:02,443
You had such terrible dry skin...

598
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,320
you're lucky that you met me.

599
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:11,351
Geez, you... how could you talk
to your almighty husband like that?

600
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,089
It's so obvious that you're uneducated.

601
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:17,091
Almighty, my ass.

602
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,792
Don't joke with me.

603
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:22,629
Don't joke with me?

604
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:25,866
Look at the way you talk!

605
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,067
I...

606
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:31,839
And just where the hell
are you going?

607
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:33,207
To Taek's.

608
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,308
-Don't go!
-Don't go!

609
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:37,644
Taek is still sad about his loss.

610
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,980
Don't hang around there.
Stay the hell at home!

611
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,116
It's too late to be visiting people.
Leave Taek alone.

612
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:47,621
Mom, I'm off!

613
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:49,189
It's dinnertime!
Where are you going?

614
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:51,258
To Taek's!
I'll eat with the others!

615
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,820
Sun Woo!

616
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,820
Don't say anything to Taek!

617
00:51:57,064 --> 00:52:00,500
You'll make him feel worse...
Geez.

618
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,535
Taek.

619
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:03,704
Taek...

620
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:05,539
I'm washing up.

621
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:06,773
OK.

622
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:38,705
Mister, is Taek home?

623
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,208
Yeah, he is.
But his condition isn't...

624
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,477
Taek!
The Almighty Me is here!

625
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:48,320
-Mister!
-Hello!

626
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:49,750
Is Taek home?

627
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,320
Yeah. But he's...

628
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:54,320
-No need to explain...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

629
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,157
If you try it yourself...
ah, ah, ah!

630
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:59,820
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know! Do you know?

631
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,163
-I don't know.
-I don't know, either.

632
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,133
Hello. Is Taek...

633
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:08,435
Yeah, he's here. Yeah.
He's been here for a while now.

634
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:09,670
Yes.

635
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:11,805
Taek!

636
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,820
Geez...

637
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:40,434
I heard you got beat badly.

638
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:42,102
Way to go, jerk.

639
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:43,737
You've humiliated our town.

640
00:53:45,372 --> 00:53:46,820
Hi, Taek!

641
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:48,408
I heard you lost.

642
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:49,343
Geez.

643
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:53,447
I heard they stepped all over you.

644
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,320
Yeah. It's about time you lost once.

645
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,820
It's been a long time coming.

646
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:02,389
It was a mistake.

647
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:03,957
Mistake, my ass.

648
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:06,627
Genius Baduk players
can't afford to make mistakes.

649
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,428
Am I supposed to win every day?

650
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:10,130
You have to win every day.

651
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:14,134
You can't lose, be jinxed,
fall into a slump, or even take a...

652
00:54:14,635 --> 00:54:17,104
No, you can take a dump.
But it's not allowed to smell.

653
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:23,644
Hey. Should you be laughing right now?

654
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:26,320
Just curse instead.

655
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,080
Look.
Go ahead.

656
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,416
Darn it.

657
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,820
Geez!

658
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,286
Sun Woo.

659
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,289
Darn it!

660
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,320
Hey...

661
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:38,358
Try it!

662
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,660
Try it, already!

663
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,820
Darn it!

664
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,734
Hey, you have to do it right.

665
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:50,320
Darn it!

666
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,240
Darn it!
Darn it!

667
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:58,078
Darn it!

668
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,180
Darn it!

669
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:02,382
Darn it!

670
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,617
Darn!

671
00:55:03,617 --> 00:55:04,751
Do it!

672
00:55:05,419 --> 00:55:07,621
Darn it!

673
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,820
Duk Seon has a very bright personality.

674
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,967
She tries very hard,
and gets along with her friends well.

675
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,272
She has great social relationships
and her personality is great...

676
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,575
But...

677
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:05,078
her grades this time around are...

678
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,132
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

679
00:56:30,504 --> 00:56:32,072
Geez!

680
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,011
Oh no.

681
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:39,446
What are you doing?
Hurry up and come.

682
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:41,081
I can't believe him...

683
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:42,983
he could've at least held the door.

684
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:45,952
What's with all this rain?

685
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,121
Can we get two orders
of kalguksu here?

686
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:49,756
I want sujebi!

687
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:52,820
Why not ask me first
before ordering?

688
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,497
Geez... OK, fine.
Have sujebi. All right?

689
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,320
Can we get one sujebi
and one kalguksu?

690
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:05,820
I told you beforehand, we have
to worry about Duk Seon's studies.

691
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:07,820
I said, even if we can't get a tutor

692
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,342
we should at least
send her to a cram school!

693
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,679
Geez... we can just ween
her into her studies now.

694
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,315
She still has two years left.

695
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,783
Also...

696
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:22,456
do you know how hard
white-collar life is?

697
00:57:23,256 --> 00:57:26,526
The other mothers all take care of
their kids' educations.

698
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:30,664
If you had done that, Duk Seon
wouldn't have ended up like this.

699
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:32,466
Oh my God.

700
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,134
So it's my fault?

701
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,870
It's my fault that Duk Seon
is 999th place in the entire school?

702
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:41,820
Geez... you think it's easy
to raise a kid?

703
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,743
If only we had money...

704
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,712
I wouldn't have let things
get that bad.

705
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,481
Geez.

706
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:50,784
What a wretched life.

707
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:55,255
What's so wrong with your life?

708
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:58,658
Did I lose our house
through gambling or something?

709
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:00,320
Did I cheat on you?

710
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,096
Am I a drunk who beats you?

711
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,432
Geez... stop it already.

712
00:58:05,532 --> 00:58:06,666
You're so annoying.

713
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:09,836
Let's just eat kalguksu.

714
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,640
Cheers.

715
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,181
People are even getting married to
Chinese people nowadays.

716
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:22,916
Wow.

717
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,820
What's with all this rain? Geez.

718
00:59:35,522 --> 00:59:40,594
Geez... even if I can't swap my husband,
shall I try swapping my umbrella?

719
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:47,467
Oh my.

720
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:49,736
Where did my umbrella go?

721
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:54,820
Geez... why would someone take
someone else's umbrella?

722
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:06,653
Is anyone the owner of this umbrella?

723
01:00:06,753 --> 01:00:08,154
Whose is this?

724
01:00:13,927 --> 01:00:18,365
Oh dear... I guess the owner of
this umbrella took mine instead.

725
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,466
I guess it can't be helped.

726
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:26,640
Ah, so cold!

727
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:41,521
Yeah...

728
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,591
Figures, with my luck.

729
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,860
What's taking you so long?

730
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,751
No matter how much better
others' things may seem

731
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:14,220
they all have their faults.

732
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:21,094
What are you doing?
Hold onto my arm.

733
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:25,198
Let's go.

734
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,983
Jung Bong! Jung Hwan!
Have some kimchi pancakes!

735
01:01:45,251 --> 01:01:45,819
OK!

736
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:01,968
Father?

737
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,636
Have some kimchi...

738
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:21,888
Hey... Dong Ryong.

739
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:25,020
My dad hasn't spoken
to us in a few days.

740
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:26,860
Why do you think that is?

741
01:02:27,761 --> 01:02:30,520
It's because of you, your brother,
or your mom. One of the three.

742
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:37,103
What should I do about it then?

743
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:44,520
It's the easiest thing in the world
to make your dad stop being angry.

744
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,020
Just accept it.

745
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,248
Accept what?

746
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:23,416
Is it Duk Seon?

747
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,100
Duk Seon, I'm in the kitchen!

748
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,824
Oh, President Sung!

749
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,835
Oh, President Kim!

750
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:59,052
-It's really great to see you!
-Really great to see you!

751
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:20,840
I came to get some juice.

752
01:04:22,508 --> 01:04:24,410
-I'm having dinner with the others.
-OK.

753
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,600
Geez... lower the volume.
You like the TV that much.

754
01:05:22,368 --> 01:05:23,603
I love these.

755
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:29,470
-Delicious.
-Really?

756
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,644
There's nothing one is more sick of
and considers more tacky than

757
01:05:31,644 --> 01:05:34,013
something that has belonged
to them for a long time.

758
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,994
It's raining and all...
want some soju?

759
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:34,173
There's nothing one is more sick of
and considers more tacky than

760
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:36,175
something that has belonged
to them for a long time.

761
01:06:38,478 --> 01:06:40,913
However, another way
to say "tacky" and "sick of"

762
01:06:41,314 --> 01:06:43,449
is "accustomed to"
and "comfortable."

763
01:06:45,018 --> 01:06:47,787
The feeling of being accustomed
only comes with

764
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:49,756
having spent a long time with something.

765
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:51,924
And only the people I'm comfortable with

766
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:55,100
can truly know me, embrace me,
and console me.

767
01:06:57,463 --> 01:07:00,600
Sometimes, you're so sick of something and it
seems so tacky that you don't even want to look at it

768
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,337
but the only people in the world
who can protect me are "my people."

769
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:07,440
People who I'm used to,
and am comfortable with...

770
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,143
people who have been my people
for a long time...

771
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,613
are people who you
cannot help but love.

772
01:07:14,414 --> 01:07:16,215
"We cannot help loving them."

773
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,184
You can't help but to love them.

774
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:20,600
Jerk.

775
01:07:25,892 --> 01:07:26,726
Sun Woo.

776
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:28,061
It's raining outside.

777
01:07:28,728 --> 01:07:30,600
"I am raining."

778
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:34,667
It's, "it's raining."

779
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,235
Oh.

780
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:44,444
Hey, Taek.

781
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:47,100
My older brother has
been on that for a week.

782
01:07:47,346 --> 01:07:48,948
Figure it out, and then
tell me how to do it.

783
01:07:48,948 --> 01:07:50,349
I'll tell him the exact method.

784
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:52,919
Open the door!

785
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,100
Put something down!

786
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:02,428
-Hey!
-Hey!

787
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,200
Hey!

788
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:10,269
Not that...

789
01:08:21,414 --> 01:08:22,615
Are your studies going well?

790
01:08:23,282 --> 01:08:24,600
You really think
they'd be going well?

791
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,119
She's studying for the
first time in 18 years.

792
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,100
Shut it.

793
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:31,724
Duk Seon and I decided
to give up on math altogether.

794
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:35,995
Just use your spoon!
Geez!

795
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,632
But English seems doable enough.

796
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:41,901
Me too.
I'm confident with idioms.

797
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,870
"Can not help-ing."

798
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,438
It means, "I can't help but to..."

799
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,600
I can not help laughing!

800
01:08:49,742 --> 01:08:51,600
You don't know things like this, right?

801
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:54,981
Here.

802
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:55,815
Wow.

803
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,184
Even if he just started studying today

804
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:59,485
I bet Taek would do
much better than you two.

805
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:01,687
Hey, Taek.
Tell me how to do it again.

806
01:09:01,921 --> 01:09:04,090
Kids!
Come out for a second!

807
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,025
Can you help me move my things?

808
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:06,759
Yes, Sir!

809
01:09:06,926 --> 01:09:08,600
Hey, Jung Hwan.
You clean up, OK?

810
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,128
OK.

811
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:16,903
Hey... hey!

812
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,939
Hey, hey, hey... cramp!
Cramp, cramp, cramp!

813
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:21,100
Are you OK?

814
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,100
Are you OK?
What do we do?

815
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,379
I got a cramp in my leg!

816
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:27,613
OK, already!

817
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:30,716
Ow... ow!
Don't touch. Ow.

818
01:09:32,185 --> 01:09:33,953
Do something about it!

819
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:45,100
What the hell are you doing?

820
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:47,300
No?

821
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,005
Hey... stop that.

822
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:53,873
Fine.

823
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:55,708
Don't touch it!

824
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:57,310
What do you want me to do, then?

825
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,644
OK, then... meow!

826
01:09:58,644 --> 01:10:00,100
I said stop!
Ow!

827
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,981
-Meow!
-Stop it!

828
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,683
-Ow...
-Here, let me see!

829
01:10:03,983 --> 01:10:06,100
Let go! Ow!

830
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,887
It really hurts!

831
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:09,600
-Meow, meow, meow!
-Stop it!

832
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:13,859
Let me see, already!

833
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:17,396
Roar!

834
01:10:17,396 --> 01:10:19,365
You think roaring is going to work?

835
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,870
I'm off!

836
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:30,100
Oh yeah, my lunch.

837
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:35,600
Darn it!

838
01:10:57,403 --> 01:10:58,904
-What are you going?
-Huh?

839
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:00,906
Are you waiting for me?

840
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,042
No!
I'm waiting for Sun Woo!

841
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:05,711
Sun Woo?

842
01:11:30,903 --> 01:11:32,371
Miss, what about Sun Woo?

843
01:11:33,072 --> 01:11:34,106
Sun Woo?

844
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,175
He already left!

845
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,644
Darn it!

846
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,100
Hey, Mister!

847
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,100
Geez!

848
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,100
Geez!

849
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:42,935
I'm going to be gone for two days or so.

850
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,771
If you want to live,
listen carefully to what I have to say.

851
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,308
Don't you worry.

852
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:50,443
All right?

853
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,114
Yay!

854
01:13:55,314 --> 01:13:56,382
We did it up yesterday, right?

855
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,218
I'll borrow this and give it right back!

856
01:13:59,618 --> 01:14:01,100
This, too!

857
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:03,390
They said that they've
arrived at the terminal.

858
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,190
Terminal?

859
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,624
This is an emergency!

860
01:14:06,225 --> 01:14:09,161
Change your clothes and
clean everything!

861
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,600
You're dead today!

862
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,002
-Let go!
-Get over here!

863
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,305
Are you trying to ruin your life?

864
01:14:19,438 --> 01:14:21,907
Do I have to foam at the mouth and
pass out for you to come to your senses?

865
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,709
What if Big Sis gets a criminal record?

866
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:27,213
Bo Ra is the issue!
She's so scary!

867
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:28,600
Hey!

868
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:30,616
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

869
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,418
Aren't you worried about your child?

870
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,254
Sun Woo.
Have you seen my Bo Ra?

871
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:38,100
Stop coming here, already!

872
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,124
Bo Ra!
