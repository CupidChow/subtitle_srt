1
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:32,890
[January 2016]

2
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:34,710
Who asked to date first?

3
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,882
-Well, it was...
-Just natural.

4
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,107
It happened slowly without either
of us realizing it.

5
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,736
Do we really have to tell you that?

6
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:52,444
Yes, that's how it is.
Even if you kiss and hold hands...

7
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,773
...it's just considered a fling
until you state that you're a couple.

8
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:59,910
-Even with kissing?
-Yes, apparently.

9
00:01:00,753 --> 00:01:02,969
-I heard it from the kids?
-What the heck.

10
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:06,545
-And you say things like that?
-I heard some kids say it.

11
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,200
Our first kiss?

12
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:26,486
Should we say it at the
same time on three?

13
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,570
-Stop watching so much TV.
-That's how people reveal things.

14
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,818
Should we answer now?

15
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:35,417
I'll count one, two, three,
so at the same time, OK?

16
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,577
I'm doing it. One, two, three.

17
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:38,841
-1994.
-1989!

18
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:42,725
Hey, 1994... it was 1994.
Right?

19
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,110
It was 1994 in Beijing, right?

20
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,970
I need to use the restroom for a second.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,976
Just a minute.

22
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:12,051
Buy some tofu.

23
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,761
Tofu!

24
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:44,203
I thought you'd have less work now,
but it's just the same.

25
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,975
Get someone you trust to do it.

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,457
Hey, I'm the oldest director
at our bank.

27
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:56,137
Above me, there's the Vice Chief,
Deputy Chief, and Director.

28
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,613
There are so many.

29
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,140
If a high school educated guy like me
doesn't work hard...

30
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:07,660
who would keep an old manager around?

31
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:14,496
So, I'm going to take care
of my own work. Don't worry.

32
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:18,117
And about bringing up the voluntary
retirement...

33
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,978
I only brought it up because I had
so much work.

34
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,867
Don't concern yourself with that,
all right?

35
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,278
It tastes just right.

36
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,004
My wife makes the best fermented
soybean stew in the world.

37
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:33,546
You're the champion...

38
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:53,710
You should go back to bed.
It's still early in the morning.

39
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,775
Your flight is in the evening?

40
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:01,259
So, you're going to Japan today
and going to China a day after?

41
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:04,691
I had no idea that there were so many
baduk matches.

42
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:07,519
-There are a lot at the end of the year.
-Yes.

43
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,513
Why don't you leave later
and rest here for a bit?

44
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,703
What, we're scheduled
for Beijing next week.

45
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,802
I guess I'll get to meet
our senior's boyfriend.

46
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,280
Isn't that baduk
competition in Beijing?

47
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,585
-Yes.
-Oh...

48
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:30,914
I hear you are friends with
the famous Choi Taek 9 dan.

49
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,571
What?

50
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,572
Our senior told me
you two are super close.

51
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,320
So, why don't you date him?

52
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:40,299
We're just friends,
since we were little kids.

53
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,174
I've known him for almost 20 years.

54
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,819
Wow, then you really must be close.

55
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:48,386
So, why aren't you dating him?

56
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,356
What?

57
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,977
There's no such thing as friendship
between a man and a woman.

58
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,863
Friends? What a joke.

59
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:14,194
Yeah, they're right.
My husband is very tired.

60
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:17,505
"Salad" man is very tired.

61
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,096
-Salaryman.
-It's the same thing.

62
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:26,816
These days I think that Dong Geun
is so sexy.

63
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:30,870
He's 10 years younger than you.
How is he your senior?

64
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:33,835
He would jump up in his sleep if he
heard that.

65
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,113
Hey really.

66
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,899
Aren't all good looking guys seniors?

67
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:41,777
So, you call your husband that?

68
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:44,104
Well, he is good looking.

69
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:50,039
Sun Young, there's still one thing that
I don't understand.

70
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:51,374
What is it?

71
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:56,246
How could a brutal face that's like his
produce a son like Taek?

72
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,243
-What?
-Really, it doesn't make sense.

73
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:02,657
How could he have a son like Taek?

74
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:06,208
What? You don't know what
you're saying.

75
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,496
You've never seen Taek's dad when
he was young, have you?

76
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,432
He looked just like Taek.

77
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:17,494
If you compare Taek's face now with
Taek's dad's face when he was young...

78
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:22,638
...you can't tell who is who.
They look exactly alike.

79
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:25,253
-Sun Young?
-Yes.

80
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:28,590
Your insanity is boundless.

81
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,986
Has the effect of the rose
tinted glasses not worn off yet?

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,803
Do you think we don't know what he
looked like when he was young?

83
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:41,444
He was young when he moved here.
He looked the same.

84
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:43,930
Is that right?

85
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,943
You two are great together.

86
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,812
I wondered why you didn't
get together a long time ago.

87
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:56,865
Hey, Dong Ryong's mom has some jokes!

88
00:06:57,556 --> 00:07:00,664
Mrs. Cho, you felt stuffy now that
you just sit at home, right?

89
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,034
I'm sure it was suffocating.

90
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:08,475
You worked all your life. How stifling
to watch your grandchildren at home.

91
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,366
No... I'm all right.

92
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:20,097
Hey dear, the kids must be awake.
I should get going.

93
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,591
-Thank you for the sweet potatoes.
-OK.

94
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,252
-Bye.
-Bye now.

95
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,880
Hey, she's quite something.

96
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:38,075
She was so good at working
and she's a good housewife too.

97
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:39,322
That's true.

98
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,015
By the way...

99
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:51,805
Third Training Air Force Squadron

100
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:55,093
Korean Air Force Academy

101
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:08,617
Hey, Choi Taek!

102
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,231
What is this? You're crazy.

103
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,870
What brings you all the way here,
you crazy punk?

104
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,476
I came to see you.
Well, you look so cool.

105
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:41,770
Have you made your decision?

106
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,351
You can tell me. It's OK.

107
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,164
I have some conditions... three of them.

108
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:59,608
What kind of conditions?

109
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,857
If you're OK with these conditions,
we can start dating again.

110
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,891
Gosh...

111
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,055
You don't have to if you don't want to.

112
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,318
OK, tell me.

113
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,862
First...

114
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,648
I'm dropping honorifics.

115
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:30,710
If we start dating again,
I'm dropping honorifics.

116
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,778
I won't call you "Ma'am"
and I won't use honorifics.

117
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,501
OK, next.

118
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:49,161
Second...

119
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:56,110
What is number one in your life?

120
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,776
-Me.
-Now, me.

121
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,066
I'm not being a child and asking
you to only look at me.

122
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:19,039
I want to be an important
part of your life.

123
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,901
Not something that get tossed aside
when things are hard.

124
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,687
I would like to be one of the most
important things in your life.

125
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:36,405
I was just so hurt.

126
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,967
All right and the last one?
What's the last condition?

127
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:52,821
As for the last condition...

128
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,069
Bo Ra, I'm just a regular guy.

129
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:07,535
When I date now,
I'm going to think about our next step.

130
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,219
I'm thinking ahead to that.

131
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:22,218
If you're scared of that,
then don't even start this.

132
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,261
Give me time to think about it.

133
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:55,959
Sir!

134
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,525
Hey, the kimchi here is amazing.

135
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:12,524
What brings you all the
way here to my base?

136
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:13,795
You're busy with matches.

137
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:17,513
Jung Hwan.

138
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,808
I have something to tell you.

139
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,597
You know long time ago?

140
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,728
You asked me if I opened your wallet?

141
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,306
Honestly, I...

142
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:06,508
Gosh, you dummy.
You're still talking about that?

143
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,020
Stop creating such a pain for everyone
and just go after Duk Seon.

144
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:14,899
You idiot. You're so frustrating.

145
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,391
I didn't come to talk about that.
Who says I came because of that?

146
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:26,243
Really?

147
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:29,128
Whatever then.

148
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,216
Let's just eat.

149
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,387
Just eat your rice.

150
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:45,890
The food here is really good.
It really is.

151
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:51,643
It's good.

152
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:56,346
I think I have menopause. I have no news
of anything for several months.

153
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,956
We are at that age now, aren't we?

154
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:08,495
Hey dear, you know it's no joke.

155
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,538
-It can be very difficult.
-What do you mean?

156
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,153
It was so annoying having
that for over 30 years.

157
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,996
Now, I don't have to think of it.
It's good.

158
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,267
I'm going to face it, head on.

159
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:26,656
Is there a good one here?
I think I like this one.

160
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,325
So, you need to be careful from now on.

161
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:40,250
I'll get a fever all of a sudden.

162
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:44,643
I could just leave the house.

163
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:49,275
My whole body will be aching and in pain.

164
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:51,769
Many people get depressed too.

165
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:58,731
I'll make the meals,
but I won't do the dishes.

166
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,529
I'll do the cleaning,
but not the laundry.

167
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,468
- Don't worry. I'll do it all.
-I'll do it all, Mom.

168
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:19,284
-Yeah, so you should call her often.
-OK.

169
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,287
I guess our mom is already that age.

170
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:26,808
OK, Jung Bong. I'll call often.

171
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,770
But isn't there something
we could do for her?

172
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:34,791
This is when a daughter would be good.
It's not like I can say anything.

173
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:36,984
Can I just overlook it?

174
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:41,148
Who is our Mom?
She is the great Ra Mi Ran.

175
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:42,858
She is getting through it.

176
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,291
Have you eaten, by the way?
You're not lonely?

177
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:50,634
Taek visited me today and
we ate together.

178
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:53,916
What? All the way to Sacheon?
Is something going on?

179
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,998
No, what could be going on?
He just came to visit a friend.

180
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:59,087
Jung Bong, I'm going to go exercise.

181
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:05,881
This late at night?
Your nights must feel very long.

182
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,417
Ah, what are you saying?

183
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,577
You know it's Mom's birthday next month.
You can come, can't you?

184
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,087
Yes, of course.

185
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,505
I checked the calendar and it's on
the weekend, so I have time.

186
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:22,136
OK, sleep well my little brother.
Good night.

187
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:38,995
Press one to page,
two for voice mail, and...

188
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:45,652
Yes, hello. You
weren't sleeping?

189
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,267
I finally spoke to the girls.
It's been six years.

190
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,080
Congratulations.

191
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:54,807
I'm meeting them tomorrow
at the spicy rice cake shop.

192
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,624
Duk Seon has time too.

193
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:59,675
We're meeting at Brazil Spicy Rice Cakes.

194
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,195
They probably got so pretty.
What if I can't recognize them?

195
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:10,257
Duk Seon and Ja Hyun haven't changed.
I saw them recently.

196
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,507
No, I heard Duk Seon got prettier since
becoming a flight attendant.

197
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:17,053
-Who said that?
-Ja Hyun.

198
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,913
Those two just console one another
by saying things like that.

199
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:26,301
I'm worried that those two might now
recognize you, Man Ok.

200
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:30,322
You should wear a name
tag on your chest.

201
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:38,600
When can I see you again? I can
see you next week, can't I?

202
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:43,509
I will buy you some tasty rib-eye.

203
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,187
Rather than rib-eye,
I like pork belly. Buy me that!

204
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:51,303
Deal! If Man Ok wants it,
forget about pork belly.

205
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:57,889
I'll slice off the belly meat on my body
and cook it on a hot fire.

206
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,807
Really, seriously?

207
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,976
I think I went too far with my joke.

208
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:10,774
You should go to bed now.
See you in my dream.

209
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:14,199
See you in your dream.

210
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,161
Brazil Spicy Rice Cakes

211
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,978
Hey, this place is completely different.

212
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:48,744
Is this the same Brazil Spicy Rice Cakes
that we used to eat at?

213
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:52,065
Hey, do you think this place changed
as much as you?

214
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:55,609
Man Ok, did you get plastic surgery
in the US?

215
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:59,215
Why are you so pretty now?

216
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:03,957
I took my braces off. You
got pretty too, you wench.

217
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,184
I guess it really is Man Ok.
She still talks so roughly.

218
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,777
Hey, how could you not have called
even once? You awful girl.

219
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:17,353
You horrible girl. I guess
we meant nothing to you.

220
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,410
Were we the only ones who considered
us close friends?

221
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:22,470
How could you not call for six years,
you awful girl?

222
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,548
I was afraid I'd miss you guys
if I called you.

223
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:40,806
I thought I'd want to come back to Korea
if I heard your voices.

224
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:52,859
Even looking at our photos made me
tear up. So, how could I call?

225
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:58,007
That's why I couldn't call, you wenches.

226
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,276
Here is the blood sausage,
spicy rice cakes.

227
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,304
I put lots of innards in it for you.

228
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,631
Hey... it'll get cold.

229
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:49,156
Man Ok, you're so pretty.
I'm going to get braces too.

230
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:19,753
-Missus, take these cabbages.
-OK.

231
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:22,186
What are these cabbages for?

232
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,943
Dong Ryong went to the market
this morning and got some cabbages.

233
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,884
Well, these are really great.

234
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,680
Mi Ran, these would be so good
if you prepared them.

235
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,255
I'll make it. I'm really good at it.

236
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:43,405
That's amazing.
This is a good method too.

237
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,716
I should have done this too.

238
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:48,250
Why is Dong Ryong so busy?

239
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:55,339
Dae Ryong opened a
second location nearby.

240
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,427
Thats, the sales must be good.

241
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:01,511
Dong Ryong is good with people
so his business is doing well.

242
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,269
Dong Ryong is running
the second location by himself.

243
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:08,924
But he spoke to the reception hall owner
and Dong Ryong got that contract too.

244
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:14,430
What good is it to send kids
to Seoul University?

245
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:18,568
Wait and see. Dong Ryong
will be better off than anyone.

246
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,277
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

247
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,183
Yes?

248
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:27,681
If it's not too much bother,
could you lend me some sesame oil?

249
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,141
Of course.

250
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,624
Jung Bong, get some sesame oil.

251
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,918
Yes, Mom.

252
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:36,324
You didn't go into work today?
It's not vacation time yet.

253
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:38,646
I decided to take two weeks off work.

254
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,022
Why is that? Is something going on?

255
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:44,127
No, that's not it. I just wanted to rest.

256
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:48,799
I see. That's a good thing.
You should take it easy in life.

257
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,029
Yes, yes.

258
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:54,312
-Here you go, Teacher. Use it liberally.
-OK.

259
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:58,555
We heard that Dong Ryong
is running a second location.

260
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,304
And that he's even catering
for wedding reception halls.

261
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,774
My gosh, word travels fast.

262
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:06,067
Dong Ryong managed to do something big.

263
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:09,424
You should come by
during the day for galbi.

264
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,285
I will give you free coupons.

265
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:14,805
I thought young couples
liked buffets these days.

266
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:18,091
I thought they wouldn't like galbi.
Would that be OK?

267
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,078
My Dong Ryong came up with
a brilliant idea.

268
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:24,638
He's always been watching those
American movies all the time.

269
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,398
And he came up with an idea.

270
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:30,247
In the U.S. they wear what's called
a morning dress or evening dress.

271
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:33,046
And go around greeting
their wedding guests.

272
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:35,069
-We don't really know.
-Right.

273
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,796
So he has a nice, shiny dress
at the restaurant.

274
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:40,973
Once the in law gifting is over,
he dresses the bride in that...

275
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,725
...take them over to where all the guests
are eating and let them greet them.

276
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:49,324
The wedding cake will be three tiers.
And you turn on music too.

277
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,835
Young couples like that so much.

278
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:56,229
That sure is a smart idea.
Dong Ryong is amazing.

279
00:23:56,346 --> 00:24:00,559
Now that things worked out this way,
I regret harassing him about his studies.

280
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:03,246
They all figure it out on their own.

281
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,643
Not everyone is like that.

282
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:09,448
It's because Dong Ryong is kind
and smart.

283
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:13,540
Why do you need sesame oil anyways?
Is no one home?

284
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,352
No, everyone is home now.

285
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:18,361
I'm not doing anything,
so I should do these chores.

286
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,955
I'll be going now then.
Thank you for this.

287
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,777
Bye now.

288
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:31,615
Our teacher is always so bright.

289
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:34,635
We've lived here in this neighborhood
with him for 20 years.

290
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:36,786
And I've never seen him with a frown.

291
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,526
I've never seen him with a scowl on
his face.

292
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,984
Look who's talking.

293
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,297
What? I'm having a hard time lately.

294
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,824
-Gosh, you're lying.
-No, really.

295
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:05,531
I'm home.

296
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,258
I'm home.

297
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,942
Why are you home, Bo Ra?

298
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,181
-It's the weekend.
-What?

299
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,059
Since when did you come home on
the weekends?

300
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,407
Be quiet!

301
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,026
I'm home.

302
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,540
-Hey, I'm getting washed up.
-OK.

303
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,621
Pretty girl is home.

304
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,275
-No one like that lives here.
-Hey!

305
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:42,015
You have one message.

306
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,424
It's me. Come outside.

307
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:48,234
You know where, right?

308
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,893
Where is Duk Seon?

309
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:03,425
I don't know.

310
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,103
-What about Bo Ra?
-Don't know.

311
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,024
Mom, there's something I've been
suspicious about for a while.

312
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:14,294
What's that?

313
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:16,774
-You know Bo Ra?
-What about Bo Ra?

314
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,863
I think she's seeing someone.

315
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:23,947
Really? Why? What makes you think that?

316
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:27,580
Gosh, that sneaky girl.

317
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,443
She wouldn't go on marriage setups
and had no interest in guys.

318
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:32,432
I was actually really worried about her.

319
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:37,120
-Who is it? Who do you think it is?
-He's in this neighborhood.

320
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,394
She comes home all the time.

321
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:44,516
And she's very suspicious.
I even smelled perfume on her.

322
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:46,884
You're getting a feeling, right?

323
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:48,926
Who could it be?

324
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:52,391
Since Jung Pal is in Sacheon,
I'm ruling him out.

325
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:57,371
Why? I like Jung Hwan.
I like younger guys too.

326
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,067
-Then, Jung Bong?
-What? Jung Bong?

327
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:05,825
-Taek?
-Taek!

328
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:08,741
Hey, I like Taek the best.

329
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:10,981
-Me too, me too.
-Right, right?

330
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:16,425
-But, Taek is scared of Bo Ra.
-Right?

331
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,848
Then Taek is out too.

332
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:23,453
Then Dong Ryong... no, it can't be him.

333
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:24,765
Doesn't he have a girlfriend?

334
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:26,569
-Right? A tall and young one.
-Yeah.

335
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:30,535
Then there's just one person left.

336
00:28:30,924 --> 00:28:33,124
I think this guy is the most likely.

337
00:28:39,642 --> 00:28:40,760
It can't be Sun Woo.

338
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,391
It can be anyone else,
but not Sun Woo.

339
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:46,939
You know why, don't you?

340
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:44,676
Why don't you hurry up?

341
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:25,490
Hey, what would you have done if I
said no to you kissing me right away?

342
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,930
Then you shouldn't have
worn that necklace.

343
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:31,782
When did you see the necklace?

344
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,707
You had two buttons undone
just so I could see.

345
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,474
How could I not see?

346
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:42,927
Sun Woo.

347
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:46,011
Sung Sun Woo.

348
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,047
Thank you.

349
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:51,993
I love you.

350
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:56,144
Really... I'm touched.

351
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,228
Hey, Taek!

352
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:36,865
I'm dating Bo Ra again.

353
00:31:38,948 --> 00:31:41,960
Hey, it's been six years.
I'm dating her again after six years!

354
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:43,444
Is this real or is it a dream?

355
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:46,678
You know how hard it's been for me
for the past six years, right?

356
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:48,593
Yeah you know, you punk!

357
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,992
I even stole your sleeping pills.
It got so bad.

358
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:54,854
But why is your reaction like this?
What's wrong?

359
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,312
You're not talking about...
my Sung Bo Ra, are you?

360
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,155
What is that crazy punk saying?

361
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:13,246
Hey, it wasn't a one sided crush?
You guys actually dated?

362
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,573
He said they dated. They are dating.

363
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:18,863
Song Sun Woo, you crazy jerk.
Get a hold of yourself!

364
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,055
Hey, one sided love...

365
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:23,987
You had a one sided crush on Bo Ra
this entire time?

366
00:32:27,817 --> 00:32:30,392
Hello, Jung Pal?

367
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,781
Where are you, Jung Pal?

368
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:36,532
Sun Woo and Bo Ra...
Sun Woo and Bo Ra are dating.

369
00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:37,851
What?

370
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:40,830
Sun Woo, get over here. Get over here.

371
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:43,563
So, you guys dated each other.
Wait, no...

372
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,470
You two dated each other.

373
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:47,567
No, you two are currently dating.

374
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:49,767
Hey, hey wait. Duk Seon, hold on.

375
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:52,820
I'll explain everything slowly now.
Just sit down. Sit down.

376
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,528
-I suddenly have a headache.
-What headache?

377
00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:00,207
How could you fool us
for six years like that?

378
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:02,132
I thought Sun Woo just
liked her on his own.

379
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,253
Bo Ra likes him back too?

380
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,898
That's not it. He liked her by himself.

381
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:10,164
-Is Bo Ra crazy?
-Hold up now.

382
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:15,447
Hey... how come I'm the only one
who doesn't know this?

383
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,733
How could you do this to me?

384
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,839
Forget it! Just hang up.

385
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,940
Song Sun Woo, I'm the only
one who didn't know.

386
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,817
Am I not even a friend?

387
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:31,115
What nonsense is he saying?

388
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:34,777
I need any of this. Forget it.
You're not my friend.

389
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,304
Dong Ryong, I didn't know either.

390
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:38,907
Don't lie to me.

391
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,984
Does it make sense that Sun Woo said
that in here if you didn't know?

392
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:45,811
I'm not that stupid.

393
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:49,887
Why do people lose baduk to you?

394
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,217
Don't laugh. I can see you laughing.

395
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:56,173
Me? When?

396
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,729
Now, now!

397
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,502
Hey, Sung Bo Ra.
So you're dating Sun Woo, are you?

398
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:02,297
Hey, wait.

399
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:04,928
Just talk to me about it.
Don't bother Bo Ra.

400
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,683
-Bo Ra?
-Bo Ra!

401
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:09,431
-What in the world?
-Come on.

402
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:12,696
-Hey!
-Bo Ra?

403
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:14,827
Taek, where are you going?

404
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:17,677
Hey, "Bo Ra" is a bit much.

405
00:34:17,743 --> 00:34:19,862
-Hey!
-That's just not right.

406
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,866
You must be insane!

407
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:23,862
Beijing, China

408
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:29,693
Chunlan Finals, Round 3, D-1

409
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:40,314
Since we have a day off tomorrow,
should we go watch?

410
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,069
A lot of reporters are here.

411
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,849
My boyfriend said we could come.

412
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:47,291
I want to go too.
I've never seen a baduk match.

413
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:50,285
I'm going to get Choi Taek
9 dan's autograph.

414
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:53,209
I doubt that you can.
He doesn't meet with anyone.

415
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:56,443
But the finals are over tomorrow.

416
00:34:57,604 --> 00:34:58,947
Can't I see him if he wins?

417
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:02,496
He goes right to sleep if he wins.
He's like a corpse.

418
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:03,830
Right, Duk Seon?

419
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,064
Choi Taek 9 Dan...

420
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:10,886
-Honey.
-Yoo Ram!

421
00:35:11,046 --> 00:35:13,133
-Duk Seon.
-Hello.

422
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:16,217
-Where's Taek?
-He's in his room.

423
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:20,858
The third round is very important,
so he's sensitive today and tomorrow.

424
00:35:21,564 --> 00:35:24,250
But he's in good condition these days,
so he's better than before.

425
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:25,926
Has he eaten something?

426
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,817
It's rice porridge.
I just thought I'd make it.

427
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:39,067
You brought this from Korea.

428
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:40,974
China is not that far.

429
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:43,968
Hry. You really are something.

430
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,249
People without friends would
be too sad to live.

431
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,183
But why don't you give it
to him yourself?

432
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:52,748
He'd like it much better than
getting it from me.

433
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,894
You said tomorrow is important.

434
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,778
What if he gets excited from seeing me
and messes up?

435
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:59,899
Why don't you just give it to him?

436
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:03,616
You're right. That could happen.

437
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,549
He really likes you.

438
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:13,334
He'll become restless if he sees you
and we can't have that.

439
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:16,288
I'll get this to him.

440
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:18,815
What? I was only joking.

441
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,921
Why? I was being serious.

442
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:46,210
There has been a steep increase
in voluntary retirements at banks.

443
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,294
In order to adjust to the drastic
changes in the financial market scene...

444
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:53,210
...caused by the open financial markets
and the introduction of ATMs

445
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:55,856
...the banks have undertaken
the strategy to trim their workforce.

446
00:36:56,316 --> 00:37:00,036
Those who retire voluntarily will receive
more than double their pension.

447
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:04,315
Until their retirement, they will
receive 70 to 100 percent...

448
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,664
...of a special retirement pension
on top of that, as well.

449
00:37:09,637 --> 00:37:12,603
What, two times the pension?

450
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:15,360
Then isn't it worth it?

451
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:18,838
If one wants to make a lot of money,
that's an opportunity too.

452
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,158
What kind of opportunity is that?

453
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,108
They just turned 50 years old.

454
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,984
Should they just sit around at home
at that young age?

455
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,840
I'd stick to my work even if they
offered me a lot of money.

456
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,311
Honey, Dong Il is hanging
in there, right?

457
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:37,995
Even though he always
talks about quitting.

458
00:37:38,797 --> 00:37:40,322
Who knows what's going on in his head.

459
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:44,692
Everything might be crumbled inside
and he might be dead inside.

460
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:00,502
Voluntary retirement can be by choice.

461
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:03,767
But many banks are requiring their
employees to take this retirement.

462
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:08,312
This includes Hanil Bank, Choheung,
Commercial, and Seoul Trust banks.

463
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:13,905
Those who have not moved up the ranks
or those too high up in the ranks...

464
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:16,369
...have been included in this retirement.

465
00:38:18,903 --> 00:38:21,430
Gosh, this man.

466
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:26,363
What if he just leaves his bank?

467
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,843
Chunlan, Final Round Three

468
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:52,510
-Sir.
-Yes, Duk Seon.

469
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,385
Did you come to see Taek?

470
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,669
Why is so quiet? Hasn't it started yet?

471
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:03,236
Of course it started.
They're all in the monitor room.

472
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,722
The monitor room?

473
00:39:04,952 --> 00:39:08,368
Now, you can watch directly
on the monitors.

474
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:10,172
You don't have to wait in the hallway.

475
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:07,408
I think I'll go wait in my room.
I'm too nervous to watch.

476
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:11,046
Please call me when the match is over.

477
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:14,733
I'm in room 503. Thank you.

478
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:18,991
OK, go to your room.
I'll call you as soon as it's done.

479
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:22,909
The game looks good for Taek right
from the beginning.

480
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,591
I think it'll end early.

481
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:28,676
Seeing as how he's attacking,
I think he's figured it out already.

482
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:32,403
Still, you don't know until the
very end with baduk.

483
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:35,048
Whats, Duk Seon!

484
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,162
You know all about baduk now.

485
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:49,094
-Duk Seon, I'm meeting my boyfriend.
-OK.

486
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:12,644
Hello, is it over? Did Taek come out?
Did he win?

487
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:15,320
It's me, Taek.

488
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:19,578
Taek...

489
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:24,022
You worked hard.
Are you all right?

490
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:25,768
Yeah, I am.

491
00:41:26,594 --> 00:41:28,327
I'm done and I'm in my room now.

492
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,672
-Does your head hurt?
-Yeah, a little bit.

493
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:33,494
I took some medicine.

494
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,453
You should have eaten first.

495
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:38,864
Go to bed.
Why did you bother calling first?

496
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:40,855
I'm hungry though.

497
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,806
I'm hungry.
Duk Seon, let's go eat together.

498
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:51,501
-I'll see you in the lobby.
-OK.

499
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:24,092
Let's go.

500
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:28,923
You came out.

501
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:30,479
Duk Seon.

502
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:34,944
We're going for dinner now too.
Come with us.

503
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:39,244
-Hurry, come on.
-Let's go.

504
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:09,976
Taek, have some crab meat.

505
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:19,786
Cheers to Master Choi's consecutive wins.

506
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:22,327
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

507
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:26,546
This place is famous in Beijing.
Enjoy your food here.

508
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:28,596
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

509
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:47,965
-Is it good?
-Yeah, is yours good?

510
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,664
You're very good at drinking.

511
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:03,675
I'm not that good at drinking.

512
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,155
Why did you two drink so much?

513
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,395
-Hey!
-Senior is passed out.

514
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:12,007
-Pull yourself together.
-Yes.

515
00:44:13,336 --> 00:44:15,170
-Take her up.
-Senior.

516
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,251
Come on.

517
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,849
Let's go. Get up now.

518
00:44:20,914 --> 00:44:22,184
Go sleep in the room.

519
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:25,330
-Duk Seon, give me your room key.
-OK.

520
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:29,884
Here.

521
00:44:31,694 --> 00:44:32,966
Get back carefully.

522
00:44:33,188 --> 00:44:34,658
Get it together, would you?

523
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,846
Get back to your room then.

524
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:03,609
Excuse me. Is anyone here?

525
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:49,071
You didn't go to your room?

526
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:56,843
The door is locked.
I think Senior is sleeping.

527
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:02,022
You should get going.
Go in and get some sleep.

528
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:04,126
I'll get a key when an employee
comes back.

529
00:46:08,046 --> 00:46:09,282
Sleep in my room.

530
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,670
You can sleep in my room.

531
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:21,979
Well!

532
00:46:34,813 --> 00:46:35,995
You can sleep in the room.

533
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:38,933
I can just sleep here.

534
00:46:42,812 --> 00:46:45,710
It's OK. I'll sleep on the sofa.
You should sleep in the room.

535
00:46:46,028 --> 00:46:47,506
You didn't even sleep properly.

536
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,066
How can I sleep properly when
you're on the sofa?

537
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,691
The room and sofa are the same to me
once I take my pills anyways.

538
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:04,968
You take so much these days?

539
00:47:08,114 --> 00:47:09,742
I've built up resistance.

540
00:47:11,182 --> 00:47:16,520
If you take too many,
you can end up sleepwalking at night.

541
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,428
What would you do if that happens?

542
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:22,232
Hey, it's not that bad yet.

543
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,157
You never know.

544
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:29,398
Make sure you lock your doors tonight.

545
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:33,046
I don't know what I'll do once
I take my pills.

546
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,041
Why? Are you going to kiss me again?

547
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:57,834
So...

548
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:01,226
That wasn't a dream?

549
00:48:14,209 --> 00:48:17,497
Why did you lie?

550
00:48:26,557 --> 00:48:27,898
I was scared.

551
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:33,642
We're friends.

552
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:37,455
What if it got awkward?

553
00:48:47,526 --> 00:48:48,998
If things got awkward with you...

554
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,537
I just couldn't imagine it.

555
00:49:25,164 --> 00:49:26,394
What about now?

556
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,765
It would be awkward now too.

557
00:49:42,534 --> 00:49:43,907
But...

558
00:50:38,878 --> 00:50:42,999
Hey... how could you say 1989?

559
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:44,509
But it was 1989.

560
00:50:44,704 --> 00:50:46,138
I was a senior then.

561
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:49,125
- I was in high school.
- Right, you were a senior.

562
00:50:49,802 --> 00:50:52,464
I can't keep track of those things
because I didn't go to school.

563
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:54,148
So what if you were a senior?

564
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:56,951
You're a public figure.

565
00:50:57,742 --> 00:51:01,529
I'm sure people would love it if they
knew you had a first kiss in high school.

566
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:06,438
People think you're Buddha.

567
00:51:06,795 --> 00:51:08,241
Should we ask them to delete this?

568
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,580
How can you do that?
That makes you look worse.

569
00:51:13,558 --> 00:51:16,290
Let's ask them to re-shoot
that part, OK?

570
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,575
I'll talk to them.

571
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:19,443
-OK, OK.
-Let's go.

572
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:27,563
Hey, stop it with the sleeping pills.

573
00:51:28,454 --> 00:51:30,846
OK. I'll take less from now on.

574
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:40,522
-Duk Seon, I'm going to sleep now.
-All right.

575
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:45,995
You should get going. Bye.

576
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:28,024
Hi.

577
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:32,822
Hello... hi.

578
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:36,915
Good morning.

579
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:46,234
What are you doing here?

580
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:49,586
When did you leave last night?

581
00:54:50,064 --> 00:54:53,710
I left right after you said
you needed to sleep. Why?

582
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:58,486
What is it? Did you have a dream?

583
00:55:00,824 --> 00:55:01,874
Yeah.

584
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:08,122
That's a relief.

585
00:55:13,931 --> 00:55:16,848
What is it? Was I in your dream?
What kind of dream was it?

586
00:55:17,262 --> 00:55:18,627
No, it was just nonsense.

587
00:55:19,255 --> 00:55:20,415
You don't need to be concerned.

588
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:26,515
-What about Dong Ryong?
-Him? I envy him the most.

589
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,758
He's probably at the hospital
playing and doing nothing.

590
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:32,958
Hey, wake up, would you?

591
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:35,073
You're so out of shape.

592
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,073
I'm going now.

593
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:04,612
-We could have beef.
-I like places like this.

594
00:57:05,032 --> 00:57:08,590
And pork belly is the best,
frozen pork belly, that is.

595
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:13,334
How could it be that you and I have
the same taste in food too?

596
00:57:13,686 --> 00:57:15,756
Then can I order the food?

597
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:18,632
Over here.

598
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,974
You want it as thin as possible?

599
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,500
Yes, that's what makes frozen
pork belly taste the best.

600
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:30,988
It will curl up though.

601
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:32,369
I can unroll it then.

602
00:57:32,879 --> 00:57:35,232
That's another good part of
frozen pork belly.

603
00:57:36,973 --> 00:57:38,043
OK.

604
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,458
This is really thin.

605
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,248
-It's like...
-It's like sliced pork belly, right?

606
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:53,520
It's my favorite style.

607
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:02,815
I think you have a very specific
philosophy when it comes to food.

608
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:07,623
Why don't you stop studying law
and start looking into this?

609
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:12,484
Look into this?

610
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,472
Do you think I'd have a chance?

611
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:21,264
-Still, law is cooler.
-How is that true?

612
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:23,432
It's not as good.

613
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:26,167
And what's wrong with food?

614
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:28,694
Food is the most important thing in life.

615
00:58:31,117 --> 00:58:32,793
And this something Duk Seon told me.

616
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,478
She says the ramen you make
is the best in the world.

617
00:58:42,017 --> 00:58:43,733
Do what you like to do.

618
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:46,068
Whatever it is that you
think about all night long.

619
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:54,195
I studied fashion even though
I didn't want to because of my dad.

620
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,842
I'd like it if you did something that
you want to.

621
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,953
One moment.

622
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,781
Blood sausage, spicy rice cakes,
and tempura.

623
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:34,055
They still sell bread fries?

624
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:39,013
All right, Dad. I'll buy it later.

625
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:49,888
How much is this?

626
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:54,394
Gosh now. Just make a decision and
I'll tell you the price.

627
00:59:54,405 --> 00:59:56,784
-I need to know the price.
-Make your decision first.

628
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:58,389
I think 10 will be enough, right?

629
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:02,194
-Yes. How much?
-My store has everything so...

630
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:13,198
Don't do that now.

631
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:16,303
My precious daughter can't be doing this.
Go over there.

632
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:17,395
What's with you?

633
01:00:18,403 --> 01:00:19,769
You brought the food?

634
01:00:20,462 --> 01:00:23,457
Yeah, that tent is still around.

635
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:28,381
Were you on a date?

636
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:32,950
-No.
-Come on now.

637
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:35,708
You're in a dress and all.

638
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:40,610
Dad, can I date now?

639
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:46,051
Of course, you're not in high school.
I need to get you married.

640
01:00:46,966 --> 01:00:51,629
I'm going to get you married off
and then I'll stop working too.

641
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:53,400
It's about time.

642
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,865
I'll spend my life going on cruises with
your mom.

643
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:00,199
What? My dad loves money.

644
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,447
Could you do that?

645
01:01:02,445 --> 01:01:04,928
You opened a third location last month.

646
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:06,385
Your mom said...

647
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:12,835
...that the location of
the store is amazing.

648
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,717
That one is going to do so well.

649
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,886
You said you're giving it all up
and going on cruises.

650
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:20,485
We have a customer.

651
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:23,352
-Hello there. You interested in that?
-Yes.

652
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:26,959
Don't leave. Hang out with your dad.

653
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:29,040
OK, don't worry.

654
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,020
What do you need to see?

655
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,428
-Is it this silk?
-Yes.

656
01:02:13,184 --> 01:02:16,909
Hey! You scared me.

657
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:26,555
Why are you sitting here like this?

658
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:33,563
Bo Ra's dad. Why are just sitting here?

659
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,591
Why? Is something wrong?

660
01:02:39,564 --> 01:02:40,585
Il Hwa.

661
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,907
Today...

662
01:02:45,914 --> 01:02:47,878
I was forced to voluntarily retire.

663
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:57,587
I am sorry.

664
01:03:30,398 --> 01:03:31,750
No.

665
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,588
Why should you be sorry?

666
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:51,939
No, honey.

667
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:56,690
There is nothing you should be sorry for.

668
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:31,941
Why aren't you sleeping
and what are you doing?

669
01:04:39,044 --> 01:04:40,291
Don't turn on the light.

670
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:44,041
I can't sleep.

671
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:49,491
Honey, are you all right?

672
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:53,655
I'm not OK.

673
01:04:57,254 --> 01:04:58,532
I'm not OK.

674
01:05:00,854 --> 01:05:01,972
Dear.

675
01:05:37,178 --> 01:05:42,142
Episode 19 - You Did Your Very Best

676
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:44,654
What?

677
01:05:45,554 --> 01:05:46,623
Really?

678
01:05:47,294 --> 01:05:48,371
Dad?

679
01:05:51,495 --> 01:05:56,547
Your dad no longer needs to go into work.
He's done with the bank.

680
01:05:57,334 --> 01:06:01,845
He will have the retirement next week
and it will really be over.

681
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:06,477
Voluntary retirement? Did
you apply for it? Why?

682
01:06:08,505 --> 01:06:13,468
If you apply for it now, you get
two and half times your pension.

683
01:06:13,558 --> 01:06:14,692
So, I did it.

684
01:06:14,832 --> 01:06:17,698
Do you know how
much we're getting?

685
01:06:18,802 --> 01:06:21,884
We're getting more
than 200 million won.

686
01:06:22,258 --> 01:06:24,092
-That much?
-Really?

687
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:27,024
When else would we get
that kind of money?

688
01:06:27,732 --> 01:06:31,545
He would be retiring in three or four
years anyways.

689
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,873
I heard that many people
were retiring at the banks.

690
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:37,081
I didn't think you would, Dad.

691
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:42,604
I just decided to jump on the chance.
I'm getting a free 100 million won.

692
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:45,790
Still, you worked there for a long time
so you must feel sad.

693
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:51,287
-I'll come home often.
-Why would I be sad?

694
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,186
Do you know what your dad's wish is?

695
01:06:53,197 --> 01:06:58,135
It's to sleep really late until
the sun comes up for once.

696
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:03,427
Dad, you should go on trips with Mom
and exercise too.

697
01:07:03,744 --> 01:07:05,253
Last year was hard for Mom too.

698
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:07,621
You should hold hands and eat lots
of yummy food, OK?

699
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:13,914
I will go around with him,
but I don't know about holding hands.

700
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:16,027
It's enough if you don't fight.

701
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,418
Bo Ra's mom!

702
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:22,145
What brings you by?
We're home right now.

703
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:27,572
Bo Ra's mom, I need just three minutes.

704
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:36,772
Honey, I'll be home in a moment!

705
01:07:40,229 --> 01:07:43,320
It's a strange sight to see you here
during the day.

706
01:07:44,576 --> 01:07:46,880
Yes, I'm still finding it strange too.

707
01:07:46,891 --> 01:07:51,135
It's been five years you've been married
and you can't get a decent meal yet?

708
01:07:51,218 --> 01:07:52,701
What's with the black bean noodles?

709
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:58,024
Jung Hwan's family was ordering,
so I got one too.

710
01:07:58,653 --> 01:08:01,290
-Let's eat together.
-Sure, it looks new.

711
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:14,129
Are you delivering black
bean noodles again?

712
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,250
My wife kicked me out.

713
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:18,593
She says she doesn't even
want to see my face.

714
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:20,675
She told me to get lost.

715
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:25,204
Put that here.
It's nice to eat together.

716
01:08:25,624 --> 01:08:26,841
Yeah, sit down.

717
01:08:30,631 --> 01:08:36,280
You know... when it's time for a
woman's menopause...

718
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:40,180
...they hate the entire world
and everyone's their enemy.

719
01:08:40,262 --> 01:08:44,613
And the person they hate the most
is their husband.

720
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:48,959
I really suffered last year because of
my wife.

721
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:52,661
I didn't know my wife had that side
to her, really.

722
01:08:52,672 --> 01:08:56,217
If it wasn't for true love,
she probably wanted to hit me.

723
01:08:56,228 --> 01:08:57,587
It was really bad.

724
01:09:10,637 --> 01:09:12,182
Why did that make me mad?

725
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,597
All he did was put
ice cream on the table.

726
01:09:16,814 --> 01:09:18,713
You could get mad.

727
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:23,289
I get annoyed a lot at Taek's dad too.

728
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:26,364
A fire rose up from inside of me.

729
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:32,775
And I had tears in my eyes.

730
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:35,485
Goodness.

731
01:09:37,769 --> 01:09:39,425
This is not normal.

732
01:09:41,449 --> 01:09:44,653
Jung Bong's dad was passing by
and got the brunt end of it.

733
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:49,078
Why are you getting upset again?

734
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:52,511
It's OK.

735
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:58,317
Missus, you're just 52 years old.

736
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:03,761
You don't even have a white hair.
You're still young.

737
01:10:04,194 --> 01:10:06,192
You're still young... still young.

738
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:09,465
I don't have white hair,
yet I'm like this.

739
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:11,954
Gosh...

740
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:19,348
You got through it well. You did.
You're amazing, Il Hwa.

741
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:23,735
I don't know about amazing.

742
01:10:24,832 --> 01:10:31,346
I still pour cold water on my head
before I go to sleep.

743
01:10:32,372 --> 01:10:38,193
I do wake up two times
and toss around in my sleep.

744
01:10:39,187 --> 01:10:40,618
Well, you know...

745
01:10:41,619 --> 01:10:45,322
Still, you have daughters so you get
through it.

746
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,904
Our poor Mi Ran doesn't have
any daughters.

747
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,600
You need daughters at times like these.

748
01:10:54,895 --> 01:10:56,516
I should have one now.

749
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:03,513
Yeah, I can't. Darn it.

750
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:06,456
Nothing is working out for me at all.

751
01:11:06,571 --> 01:11:11,356
I see that you're making jokes now.
You must be OK now.

752
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:14,327
I go back and forth.

753
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:18,665
I did envy you a bit last year.

754
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,064
Did you?

755
01:11:22,773 --> 01:11:29,271
I guess my daughters are good
at taking care of the little things.

756
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:32,577
I wouldn't say it's that.

757
01:11:32,974 --> 01:11:36,463
It's because they are your daughters,
so they know a mom's heart.

758
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:39,553
Sons will never know a mother's heart.

759
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:44,283
And Duk Seon is especially good.

760
01:11:44,284 --> 01:11:48,681
Lately, I just want to make her my
daughter in law.

761
01:11:49,884 --> 01:11:54,735
Last Year, 1993

762
01:12:00,243 --> 01:12:02,363
Mom, let's head out. Get up, OK?

763
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,824
Get dressed, get dressed.

764
01:12:04,464 --> 01:12:06,716
-Let's go.
-Where?

765
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:09,552
-Let's go.
-I'm tired.

766
01:12:09,678 --> 01:12:10,688
No, let's go.

767
01:12:12,032 --> 01:12:13,234
Hurry up.

768
01:12:14,278 --> 01:12:18,142
There's a place next to Ssangmun Station
that makes really good fried pancakes.

769
01:12:18,221 --> 01:12:20,024
-It's supposed to be really good.
-OK.

770
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:22,860
Mom, aren't you cold?

771
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:26,078
There. Let's go.

772
01:12:26,737 --> 01:12:27,856
Let's go.

773
01:12:45,877 --> 01:12:49,221
What the heck...
I ought to be re-born.

774
01:12:49,294 --> 01:12:51,318
I need to be born as a mother.
I'm so envious.

775
01:13:08,435 --> 01:13:09,583
It's pretty.

776
01:13:10,871 --> 01:13:12,094
Can you erase it?

777
01:13:12,657 --> 01:13:14,899
-How can I go out like this?
-Why not?

778
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:17,362
Let's put it on this side too.

779
01:13:27,894 --> 01:13:30,171
It's expensive medicine.
Make sure to take it.

780
01:13:30,464 --> 01:13:32,616
Pillar of the house,
your second daughter.

781
01:13:42,437 --> 01:13:48,450
Our nation's Choi Taek 9 dan was champion
in China at the Chunlan baduk match.

782
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,438
Taek won again?

783
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:54,791
He must be crazy. He's not human.

784
01:14:00,592 --> 01:14:02,569
Hello?  Taek!

785
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,984
Congratulations.

786
01:14:05,907 --> 01:14:08,218
You're in Korea? When did you come back?

787
01:14:08,607 --> 01:14:10,745
OK, hold on.

788
01:14:11,194 --> 01:14:12,205
Duk Seon.

789
01:14:13,594 --> 01:14:14,654
Yeah?

790
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:17,144
OK.

791
01:14:18,392 --> 01:14:19,832
I have to see Taek for a bit.

792
01:14:20,318 --> 01:14:22,804
-You should finish eating.
-Taek.

793
01:14:26,936 --> 01:14:28,168
Isn't something a little strange?

794
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,084
Is Duk Seon maybe...

795
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:32,775
Just eat your rice.

796
01:14:33,197 --> 01:14:34,977
Are you still that nosy?

797
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,158
-When did you get back?
-Now.

798
01:15:04,364 --> 01:15:07,273
-Aren't you tired?
-I'm OK.

799
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:11,602
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm all right.

800
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:19,086
Well, this is warm.

801
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,309
Tomorrow is Dad's retirement.

802
01:15:28,669 --> 01:15:30,282
I'm already about
to get tears in my eyes.

803
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:38,011
Can't I go too?

804
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:43,811
Forget it, don't come.
If you come, it will get noisy.

805
01:15:44,686 --> 01:15:46,839
And only family is supposed to come.

806
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:49,516
All right.

807
01:15:52,097 --> 01:15:55,839
But, can't I just stop by for a bit?

808
01:15:56,332 --> 01:15:59,478
No, if you come,
you'll be the main attraction.

809
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:02,028
Tomorrow, my dad has to be the star.

810
01:16:03,987 --> 01:16:05,079
OK.

811
01:16:06,113 --> 01:16:08,376
Then I'll just stay in the back and...

812
01:16:11,111 --> 01:16:14,136
-Hey!
-You better listen, OK?

813
01:16:15,694 --> 01:16:16,728
Yes.

814
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:49,158
This is the suit Bo Ra bought for you with her
first pay from judicial training center.

815
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,643
Gosh, what were you saving it for?

816
01:16:51,964 --> 01:16:54,187
You never wore it.
I didn't think it would be for this.

817
01:16:54,564 --> 01:16:58,699
That's why they say things turn to crap if
you save it. I think it is a correct saying.

818
01:17:02,983 --> 01:17:06,224
Why are you going to cry now?

819
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:10,039
I got lots of money and left my job.

820
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,477
It's fine, so stop crying.

821
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:21,422
What do you mean it's fine?
You always say that.

822
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:24,537
It's OK.

823
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:32,060
Gosh, you look so good.
Let me see.

824
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:51,009
My god.

825
01:17:57,081 --> 01:18:00,355
You guys sure know how to surprise
a person.

826
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:12,357
-Yeah, thank you so much Jin Joo.
-You worked so hard all this time.

827
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:15,042
You worked hard.

828
01:18:16,528 --> 01:18:18,801
You didn't have to get me this.

829
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:22,145
I almost missed you.

830
01:18:22,502 --> 01:18:25,196
I told Jung Bong to keep the front gate
closed.

831
01:18:25,728 --> 01:18:27,722
For crying out loud.

832
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:31,656
It's not like I'm the president of Korea.
Why make such a fuss?

833
01:18:32,402 --> 01:18:35,302
It's going to be done in an hour
and I'll be back.

834
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:40,976
Then be back quickly.

835
01:18:41,222 --> 01:18:43,575
I'll have several things warmed up
and ready for you here.

836
01:18:44,908 --> 01:18:48,126
Manager Sung, you worked very hard
all those years.

837
01:18:49,787 --> 01:18:51,255
Gosh, man.

838
01:18:52,064 --> 01:18:54,076
We're all going to switch banks now.

839
01:18:54,298 --> 01:18:57,643
Bo Ra's dad is no longer at Hanil Bank,
so why should we go there?

840
01:18:57,897 --> 01:18:58,930
Right?

841
01:18:58,993 --> 01:19:01,608
I was going to switch my account too.

842
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,871
That darn, crappy Hanil Bank.

843
01:19:04,093 --> 01:19:07,233
To hell with Hanil Bank.

844
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,355
Duk Seon will be waiting.
You should get going.

845
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:15,098
You've never been late ever,
so you can't be late for your retirement.

846
01:19:16,077 --> 01:19:18,872
So I'm going to be unemployed now.

847
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,860
Please take good care of this unemployed
man in this neighborhood.

848
01:19:24,108 --> 01:19:25,990
Dad, we're going to be late. Hurry!

849
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,151
OK, I'll be going.

850
01:19:29,677 --> 01:19:31,361
I'll be going. Thank you.

851
01:19:36,477 --> 01:19:38,566
-Bye now.
-Thank you.

852
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,793
Hello? Yeah, Bo Ra.

853
01:19:57,249 --> 01:19:58,875
Yeah, are you at the hospital?

854
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:00,790
Yeah, is something wrong?

855
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:04,245
Isn't your dad's retirement today?
Did it go well?

856
01:20:04,904 --> 01:20:06,795
It did end OK.

857
01:20:07,638 --> 01:20:08,750
I just don't feel good.

858
01:20:10,704 --> 01:20:12,230
You should comfort your dad.

859
01:20:13,022 --> 01:20:14,774
He's probably more depressed than
anyone.

860
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:18,132
It's not like I expected anything great.

861
01:20:18,966 --> 01:20:21,859
But it was just so simple and short.

862
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:25,314
About 30 people retired together.

863
01:20:25,998 --> 01:20:28,890
They didn't even give him a plaque.
They just gave him some flowers.

864
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:32,791
He worked there for 30 years
and they only gave him flowers?

865
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,668
I was about to protest like my old self.

866
01:20:38,111 --> 01:20:40,839
Are you home? Let's meet later.

867
01:20:41,396 --> 01:20:42,531
I'll go even if it's late.

868
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:46,353
Yeah, I'm home. I'm going
to stay home for a bit.

869
01:20:47,544 --> 01:20:52,207
Dad went for soju with my mom.
The two have become closer lately.

870
01:20:53,434 --> 01:20:54,449
That's good.

871
01:20:56,234 --> 01:20:57,261
What about Duk Seon?

872
01:20:57,456 --> 01:20:58,475
I don't know.

873
01:20:58,557 --> 01:21:00,504
She was going on about it for a while,
but I don't see her.

874
01:21:01,644 --> 01:21:02,648
Hey, you startled me!

875
01:21:03,819 --> 01:21:05,596
I just can't stand by like this.

876
01:21:05,985 --> 01:21:08,138
No Eul's coming too.
Just do as I say.

877
01:21:08,225 --> 01:21:09,790
Sun Woo, I'll call you back later.

878
01:21:12,277 --> 01:21:15,710
Bo Ra, are you really a Seoul University
graduate? This is the best you can do?

879
01:21:16,306 --> 01:21:18,228
Hey, do you think I'm a Korean
language major.

880
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:20,500
Give it to me. I'll do it.

881
01:21:26,407 --> 01:21:28,897
-Do it fast. I have to give it to them.
-All right.

882
01:21:31,568 --> 01:21:32,745
You're leaving now?

883
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:36,509
Yeah, but don't wait for me.
I'll probably arrive late at night.

884
01:21:36,965 --> 01:21:38,868
OK, you have to drive carefully.

885
01:21:39,014 --> 01:21:41,229
OK, how is Mom doing?

886
01:21:41,557 --> 01:21:43,754
-I'm not sure.
-What?

887
01:21:45,756 --> 01:21:49,722
She seems OK at times
and then not OK too.

888
01:21:51,144 --> 01:21:53,336
This is why a household needs daughter.

889
01:21:53,996 --> 01:21:56,293
Wait. The second "Daughter"
will be there soon.

890
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,572
Are you home, son?

891
01:22:49,127 --> 01:22:50,137
Yes.

892
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:53,948
Are you OK, Mom?

893
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:58,137
Yes, I'm OK.

894
01:23:00,919 --> 01:23:04,484
I'm OK. I'm going to sleep.

895
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:06,835
See you later, son.

896
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:51,438
Look who it is. It's Soldier Kim.
Sir.

897
01:24:54,487 --> 01:24:55,696
Look at the state you're in.

898
01:24:56,028 --> 01:24:58,652
If you came into the army under me,
you would be dead.

899
01:24:58,882 --> 01:25:01,155
Am I crazy? Why would I go under you?

900
01:25:01,553 --> 01:25:02,824
When did you get back anyways?

901
01:25:05,108 --> 01:25:06,334
Late last night.

902
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:09,481
Let's have a drink later.
Taek is finishing up early later.

903
01:25:09,674 --> 01:25:11,396
Today is my mom's birthday.
We're going out to eat.

904
01:25:11,685 --> 01:25:13,961
OK, that's why you're up here.

905
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,171
Have you made a reservation?

906
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:20,080
I was going to make one with my brother.
Do you know a good place?

907
01:25:21,092 --> 01:25:23,186
I don't know. I'll try to think of one.

908
01:25:26,557 --> 01:25:27,834
Is it going well with Bo Ra?

909
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:47,242
You say you're dating and you don't
even know a nice restaurant?

910
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,651
You're younger than me.
How come you don't know a restaurant?

911
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:52,168
I've been living in Sacheon.

912
01:25:52,222 --> 01:25:55,402
Lately, I've been... a housewife.

913
01:26:02,505 --> 01:26:03,515
Yes?

914
01:26:04,321 --> 01:26:06,414
Dong Ryong? What's up?

915
01:26:06,635 --> 01:26:08,209
Hey, where are you right now?

916
01:26:08,695 --> 01:26:09,790
What are you saying?

917
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,698
One of the wedding reception guests
canceled on me.

918
01:26:13,036 --> 01:26:15,217
We prepared galbi for 100 people.

919
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:17,664
The bride ran off this morning with
her first love.

920
01:26:18,188 --> 01:26:19,196
What?

921
01:26:19,266 --> 01:26:21,946
I already got the payment,
so the money is fine.

922
01:26:22,172 --> 01:26:23,671
The galbi would go to waste.

923
01:26:24,248 --> 01:26:26,180
Let's have a neighborhood party.

924
01:26:27,285 --> 01:26:29,390
Invite anyone you see from now on.

925
01:26:29,787 --> 01:26:31,924
Hey, do you have cake there too?

926
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:34,507
Are you kidding me?
I have a three tiered one.

927
01:26:34,872 --> 01:26:39,458
It's your mom's birthday, isn't it?
You got lucky today, punk.

928
01:26:39,693 --> 01:26:42,970
I'll surprise you and turn this wedding
cake into a birthday cake.

929
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,989
Wait, don't change it.
What time should I be there?

930
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:49,261
It's the last time slot,
so about 7:00 p.m.

931
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:53,100
You can just leave now if you want.
All the customers from before have left.

932
01:26:53,436 --> 01:26:56,586
Anyways, invite everyone from the
neighborhood. I'm treating today.

933
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,056
Thanks Dong Ryong.

934
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,838
Jung Bong, I have a good idea.

935
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:04,730
What?

936
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:13,318
Hey, how many people are coming?

937
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:16,766
I think it will be about 20 people.

938
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:20,525
Duk Seon will be here for sure and
Jung Pal will be coming too.

939
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:23,170
It will be a long time since I've seen
all the neighborhood people.

940
01:27:23,714 --> 01:27:26,204
Yeah, Dong Ryong. Mom is coming too.

941
01:27:27,572 --> 01:27:28,692
Really?

942
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:30,353
She's done now?

943
01:27:31,172 --> 01:27:32,307
She's coming straight here.

944
01:27:34,184 --> 01:27:35,747
This is all because of you, Dae Ryong.

945
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:37,209
What did I do, kid?

946
01:27:39,236 --> 01:27:40,958
Hello there!

947
01:27:41,285 --> 01:27:44,272
Is this Yoo Dong Ryong's
restaurant?

948
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,806
We came for the free galbi.

949
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:49,117
-Are you here?
-Hi, Dae Ryong.

950
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,922
Hi. You're the first family here.

951
01:27:51,256 --> 01:27:52,654
Is this Dong Ryong's store?

952
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,965
-We'll take one of these here.
-Yes.

953
01:27:54,976 --> 01:27:57,183
- Where is it?
- Over there.

954
01:27:57,299 --> 01:27:59,454
-We came for the galbi.
-Hello.

955
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:00,956
Dong Ryong!

956
01:28:01,154 --> 01:28:03,594
-Hi, Dong Ryong.
- Hello.

957
01:28:10,717 --> 01:28:12,532
Mister, two galbis please.

958
01:28:12,798 --> 01:28:14,836
Hey, Sung Duk Seon. You got pretty.

959
01:28:15,527 --> 01:28:17,958
Hey, your parents are here. Go on in.

960
01:28:18,106 --> 01:28:19,142
Hello.

961
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:22,606
-You came alone.
-I came with my senior.

962
01:28:22,937 --> 01:28:24,686
Is that the only person you're
friendly with?

963
01:28:24,978 --> 01:28:26,450
I told you to bring everyone.

964
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:29,400
-Hello!
-I did bring people.

965
01:28:29,489 --> 01:28:33,673
Man Ok, Ja Hyun, say hello.
This is my friend Dong Ryong.

966
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:35,111
Hello.

967
01:28:35,296 --> 01:28:38,456
Hey, it's you right?
Ssangmun High's Park Nam Jung?

968
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:42,778
-Ssang Girls' High Wang Jo Hyun?
-Long time.

969
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:45,034
What is this? Did I hook you guys up?

970
01:28:45,114 --> 01:28:47,131
Shut up. I likely have a girlfriend.

971
01:28:48,379 --> 01:28:51,017
I think the broth is ready now.
I have to go inside.

972
01:28:52,483 --> 01:28:54,195
I'm fine so worry about your own
love life.

973
01:28:55,457 --> 01:28:56,475
Let's go.

974
01:29:01,577 --> 01:29:02,737
Who's missing?

975
01:29:03,893 --> 01:29:06,787
That punk. He thinks he's a star
and now he's always late.

976
01:29:10,007 --> 01:29:12,102
-Hello.
-Hello!

977
01:29:12,392 --> 01:29:15,137
-Hello.
-We heard there was free galbi.

978
01:29:19,882 --> 01:29:21,724
Why are you just getting here?

979
01:29:22,074 --> 01:29:23,455
All the galbi's been taken.

980
01:29:23,664 --> 01:29:24,862
I drove here.

981
01:29:25,843 --> 01:29:28,429
Then I guess I understand.
Have some soup.

982
01:29:40,524 --> 01:29:41,553
Hey.

983
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:45,360
-Mom.
-Give us some food too.

984
01:29:47,138 --> 01:29:49,739
Mom, we've prepared some galbi for you.

985
01:29:52,175 --> 01:29:53,518
We'll go if you don't have it.

986
01:29:53,893 --> 01:29:56,841
You did a good thing,
so come in and eat.

987
01:30:00,202 --> 01:30:02,021
The school dean is here.

988
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,075
Who isn't here? Hands up.

989
01:30:08,824 --> 01:30:11,434
Jung Pal and his mom.

990
01:30:13,643 --> 01:30:15,463
His dad is not here either.

991
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:22,041
That's true. He's the one who told me
to prepare everything.

992
01:30:24,022 --> 01:30:25,624
Hello...

993
01:30:26,878 --> 01:30:32,092
Is this Dong Ryong's place where they
make the best galbi?

994
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,240
And you are that Mrs. Cheetah of
Sssangmundong that I've only heard about.

995
01:30:38,393 --> 01:30:39,466
Please come in.

996
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:43,240
Come on in.

997
01:30:46,796 --> 01:30:49,101
-What are you doing over there?
-Hey, my mom.

998
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:19,722
Hey.

999
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,836
I was feeling down because
it was my birthday.

1000
01:31:30,847 --> 01:31:33,808
I feel a bit better because we're all
having dinner together.

1001
01:31:34,132 --> 01:31:36,383
Why would you feel down on your birthday?

1002
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:38,186
You should be happy today.

1003
01:31:40,007 --> 01:31:42,993
Mom, I'd like to wish you happy birthday
on your 52nd birthday.

1004
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:48,125
We can go home later and have
another party with our family.

1005
01:31:48,696 --> 01:31:54,862
Son, I don't want to make a big deal
out of my 52nd birthday.

1006
01:31:55,356 --> 01:32:01,211
No! What should I do? I'm so sorry.
What can I do? What a mess. I'm so sorry.

1007
01:32:01,512 --> 01:32:04,794
It's OK. I'm fine.

1008
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:09,967
You better change your clothes.
It will start to smell.

1009
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:11,978
I don't have clothes here.

1010
01:32:12,535 --> 01:32:16,713
Well, we do have some clothes here.
Do you want to get changed into them?

1011
01:32:23,777 --> 01:32:25,204
Be careful now.

1012
01:32:25,784 --> 01:32:27,142
Over this way.

1013
01:32:32,645 --> 01:32:34,611
-Come over here.
-OK.

1014
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:45,701
It's all done. What about the music?

1015
01:32:47,242 --> 01:32:48,731
No need to worry.

1016
01:32:48,804 --> 01:32:50,674
-What about the cake?
-It's ready.

1017
01:32:50,846 --> 01:32:52,765
Jung Pal, someone is here.

1018
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:10,069
-Jung Bong, you be the flower boy.
-Me? But my girlfriend is here.

1019
01:33:11,313 --> 01:33:12,341
Then should I do it?

1020
01:33:14,263 --> 01:33:16,957
Actually, it's always been my dream
to be a the flower boy.

1021
01:33:18,016 --> 01:33:20,008
-You didn't know, did you?
-No.

1022
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,109
OK.

1023
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:26,499
Who will give her the bouquet?

1024
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:29,819
-There's one person doing nothing.
-Who?

1025
01:33:30,218 --> 01:33:32,719
You. You can give it to her directly.

1026
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:35,405
When I turn on the music,
you give it to your mom.

1027
01:33:35,771 --> 01:33:37,638
What? I'm not good at that stuff.

1028
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,814
You crazy punk. This was all your idea.

1029
01:33:47,959 --> 01:33:49,840
Ma'am, can you Jung Hwan's mom?

1030
01:33:50,152 --> 01:33:52,661
Why? Is something wrong with her clothes?
Is she not coming?

1031
01:34:09,044 --> 01:34:13,342
I'm eating galbi wearing this now?

1032
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:15,923
It fits you perfectly.

1033
01:34:17,003 --> 01:34:18,624
I do have a glamorous body.

1034
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,286
Will I be able to digest in this thing?

1035
01:34:21,672 --> 01:34:24,076
Should I just take it off and eat?
I am feeling warm.

1036
01:34:26,018 --> 01:34:27,985
Gosh, you look pretty.

1037
01:34:28,024 --> 01:34:31,627
When else will you get to wear something
like this?

1038
01:34:32,743 --> 01:34:34,024
-How can I go out?
-Ma'am.

1039
01:34:34,152 --> 01:34:35,621
The prime beef is ready.

1040
01:34:36,195 --> 01:34:37,695
OK, I got it.

1041
01:34:38,436 --> 01:34:40,793
-Hurry up and come out.
-OK.

1042
01:34:40,885 --> 01:34:42,079
So pretty.

1043
01:34:45,803 --> 01:34:49,786
Goodness, what is this? Seriously...

1044
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,948
-Mom.
-Whats!

1045
01:34:52,788 --> 01:34:54,967
What is this now?

1046
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:57,637
Why are you all making a fuss?

1047
01:35:00,507 --> 01:35:02,864
-So pretty.
-What's going on here?

1048
01:35:03,388 --> 01:35:06,130
I should be careful in this dress.

1049
01:35:07,534 --> 01:35:09,753
-You look good.
-I'm so embarrassed.

1050
01:35:52,026 --> 01:35:53,324
Hey.

1051
01:35:54,194 --> 01:35:55,522
Hey now.

1052
01:36:10,377 --> 01:36:11,628
Why are you crying?

1053
01:36:12,076 --> 01:36:15,100
Bride and groom, please enter.

1054
01:36:38,143 --> 01:36:46,189
Kiss, kiss...

1055
01:36:46,206 --> 01:36:49,197
Kiss, kiss, kiss...

1056
01:36:55,293 --> 01:37:02,007
Dong Ryong, Dong Ryong, Dong Ryong...

1057
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:08,782
Dong Ryong, Dong Ryong, Dong Ryong...

1058
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:13,615
Blow out the candle.

1059
01:37:14,346 --> 01:37:17,945
One, two, three!

1060
01:37:32,553 --> 01:37:33,582
Whose idea was it?

1061
01:37:35,522 --> 01:37:36,625
Your "Daughter."

1062
01:37:39,594 --> 01:37:41,295
-What?
-Jung Hwan?

1063
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:44,194
How did you know that picture was a fake?

1064
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:48,525
I thought we would never get caught.

1065
01:37:49,344 --> 01:37:53,086
It was obvious you had
combined two photos.

1066
01:37:58,114 --> 01:37:59,445
Thank you, Jung Hwan.

1067
01:38:00,849 --> 01:38:05,503
My menopause is gone. Thank you.

1068
01:38:12,404 --> 01:38:14,343
I didn't do it for this.

1069
01:38:14,354 --> 01:38:16,905
It's nothing to cry over.
Why are you doing this?

1070
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:19,400
Be quiet, you!

1071
01:38:29,846 --> 01:38:34,463
Why are you crying over that?
It's a good thing. How embarrassing.

1072
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,775
-Dad.
-Yeah?

1073
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:41,294
-We have something for you too.
-What?

1074
01:38:46,584 --> 01:38:47,620
A present.

1075
01:38:50,844 --> 01:38:54,775
What's with all of you?
Have you all suddenly grown up or what?

1076
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:56,562
What is this?

1077
01:38:56,687 --> 01:39:00,749
We decided to have our own retirement
with our family. Open it, Dad.

1078
01:39:08,548 --> 01:39:11,349
Hey... what's this?

1079
01:39:11,678 --> 01:39:15,169
Thats, isn't this a "Thank You" plaque?

1080
01:39:16,537 --> 01:39:19,293
Hey, I'll read it for everyone.

1081
01:39:19,304 --> 01:39:21,715
-Don't read it.
-You can't.

1082
01:39:22,078 --> 01:39:25,815
Why? It's a present from children to
their father.

1083
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:27,548
We should read it
while we're all together.

1084
01:39:27,602 --> 01:39:30,726
-No, please don't read it.
-Yes, don't read it!

1085
01:39:30,737 --> 01:39:34,554
If you read that now,
everyone will cry.

1086
01:39:34,643 --> 01:39:37,677
Mister, you should still just read it.

1087
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:40,369
-You can take insults later.
-Is that right?

1088
01:39:41,296 --> 01:39:43,946
I became a new groom
in my fifties.

1089
01:39:44,084 --> 01:39:46,432
I'll just take some insults today.
Why not?

1090
01:39:46,622 --> 01:39:48,012
Read it, read it.

1091
01:39:49,558 --> 01:39:51,215
"Thank you plaque."

1092
01:39:52,661 --> 01:39:56,778
"You worked at Hanil Bank for 26 years."

1093
01:39:57,848 --> 01:39:59,254
Manager Sung Dong Il...

1094
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,626
Gosh, I don't think I can read this.

1095
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:07,510
"Thank you plaque."

1096
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:12,349
"You worked at Hanil Bank for 26 years."

1097
01:40:12,628 --> 01:40:15,733
"Manager Sung Dong Il,
we would like to thank you."

1098
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:22,168
"We may no longer be able to call you
Manager Sung Dong Il."

1099
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:23,892
"What has not changed is that..."

1100
01:40:24,945 --> 01:40:27,602
"Sung Dong Il is Lee Il Hwa's husband."

1101
01:40:28,683 --> 01:40:32,402
"And Sung Bo Ra, Sung Duk Seon,
and Sung No Eul..."

1102
01:40:33,573 --> 01:40:35,811
"He is the proud father
of three siblings."

1103
01:40:39,221 --> 01:40:41,515
"These are the things our father likes
to say the most often."

1104
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,978
"Crap and hell."

1105
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:48,682
"The words my father
hates the most are..."

1106
01:40:49,673 --> 01:40:51,938
"Forever Assistant Manager
and loan guarantee."

1107
01:40:54,647 --> 01:40:59,455
"The thing my father did best...
was buying useless items."

1108
01:41:00,389 --> 01:41:02,307
"And giving us kisses."

1109
01:41:06,892 --> 01:41:11,721
"His favorite food is seasoned
cockle shells and soju."

1110
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:22,709
"And the thing my father loved
the most... It was our family."

1111
01:41:24,782 --> 01:41:28,858
"As our father's daughters and son..."

1112
01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:32,894
"...because we could not give him a
warm word..."

1113
01:41:35,731 --> 01:41:39,044
"...and we couldn't have a drink with him
that he liked so much..."

1114
01:41:41,913 --> 01:41:43,813
"...or hold him in our arms first..."

1115
01:41:47,364 --> 01:41:49,272
"Or tell him we love him first..."

1116
01:41:54,277 --> 01:41:59,615
"And we could not consider the
weight of the title 'Dad...'"

1117
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:05,599
"We are sorry and apologize."

1118
01:42:13,351 --> 01:42:17,094
"Even then, he was like a tree that
never stopped giving."

1119
01:42:21,711 --> 01:42:27,486
"A dad that Bo Ra respected. A dad
that was like a friend to Duk Seon."

1120
01:42:29,447 --> 01:42:34,390
"And a dad that provided
stability to No Eul."

1121
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:42,320
"With that thankful heart...
we give you this plaque."

1122
01:42:45,973 --> 01:42:50,907
"December 5, 1994.
From, your children."

1123
01:43:03,158 --> 01:43:07,210
Goodness sakes.
Why did you bother reading that?

1124
01:43:11,409 --> 01:43:12,736
Sit down.

1125
01:43:16,487 --> 01:43:18,383
Our Duk Seon is so pretty.

1126
01:43:19,227 --> 01:43:24,563
Hey... you guys liven up the mood,
wouldn't you? What the heck...

1127
01:43:27,069 --> 01:43:32,793
-You sure had good kids.
-Hey, turn it on.

1128
01:43:35,038 --> 01:43:36,201
Turn what on?

1129
01:43:52,045 --> 01:43:53,346
Ra Mi Ran...

1130
01:45:04,058 --> 01:45:05,078
Il Hwa.

1131
01:45:06,808 --> 01:45:09,112
Have you heard of Hwa Moo Ship Il Hong?

1132
01:45:12,234 --> 01:45:13,324
Yes, I have.

1133
01:45:14,955 --> 01:45:16,496
A chrysanthemum has its season...

1134
01:45:17,131 --> 01:45:19,236
...and there is no flower that
keeps their color for ten days.

1135
01:45:20,354 --> 01:45:23,560
I have pulled myself together
and I'm going to do something about it.

1136
01:45:25,898 --> 01:45:27,317
So I guess that statement is wrong too.

1137
01:45:32,808 --> 01:45:37,230
My life has almost passed now.

1138
01:45:37,907 --> 01:45:42,021
Time doesn't pass by just for us.

1139
01:45:44,093 --> 01:45:46,701
It passes by for everyone.

1140
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:54,137
Who can you complain to? You just
accept it and go along with it.

1141
01:45:57,138 --> 01:46:01,486
I realized something really big today.

1142
01:46:04,194 --> 01:46:05,229
What's that?

1143
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:09,701
I thought it was all over once the
petals bloomed.

1144
01:46:11,104 --> 01:46:17,043
But once those petals open,
there is another fruit that blooms.

1145
01:46:18,697 --> 01:46:20,752
I forgot about that.

1146
01:46:22,445 --> 01:46:26,894
I only got sad that my flower petals
weren't going to bloom again.

1147
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:30,882
I couldn't see that.

1148
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:39,590
I know I got to let go from work.
But the way I raised my children...

1149
01:46:41,692 --> 01:46:43,880
I did such a good job, right?

1150
01:46:48,332 --> 01:46:52,303
Yes, but who knows?

1151
01:46:52,744 --> 01:46:56,409
They might cause us grief later on.

1152
01:46:56,956 --> 01:47:00,731
Maybe, I spoke too soon, didn't I?

1153
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:03,916
But you never know.

1154
01:47:05,947 --> 01:47:10,312
This heart we have for our children,
someday they will...

1155
01:47:11,707 --> 01:47:12,862
...answer us.

1156
01:47:14,462 --> 01:47:15,629
"Thank you."

1157
01:47:18,013 --> 01:47:19,117
Let's go.

1158
01:47:34,283 --> 01:47:37,922
So, you're going to work the counter
at the supermarket?

1159
01:47:39,645 --> 01:47:41,775
So, you're going to be a cashier?

1160
01:47:44,118 --> 01:47:46,073
You're really something, you know?

1161
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,221
I got trained yesterday and today.
I'm starting tomorrow.

1162
01:47:53,408 --> 01:47:57,737
Since you've always worked,
you'll get sick if you stay home.

1163
01:47:57,909 --> 01:48:00,193
Dong Ryong's mom, did you go somewhere?

1164
01:48:00,665 --> 01:48:02,885
I didn't see you around for a while.

1165
01:48:05,538 --> 01:48:09,668
I left home.

1166
01:48:09,986 --> 01:48:11,472
-What?
-Why?

1167
01:48:11,537 --> 01:48:13,482
Why? Where?

1168
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,337
It was two or three weeks ago.

1169
01:48:18,705 --> 01:48:22,508
I left and came back
yesterday to eat galbi.

1170
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:26,179
But why did you leave home suddenly?

1171
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:28,181
As for me...

1172
01:48:29,656 --> 01:48:30,953
In my life...

1173
01:48:32,703 --> 01:48:34,207
Just being called
Dong Ryong's mom...

1174
01:48:34,588 --> 01:48:39,630
...or Dae Ryong's mom
made me unhappy.

1175
01:48:42,013 --> 01:48:45,024
My name is Cho Soo Hyang.

1176
01:48:53,772 --> 01:48:55,852
I was watching my grandchildren.

1177
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,484
My heart suddenly felt so suffocated.

1178
01:49:02,174 --> 01:49:05,673
I wondered what I was even doing there.

1179
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:12,331
I thought I'd go insane like that.

1180
01:49:14,424 --> 01:49:20,927
When my grandchildren were asleep,
I just went to my sister's in Daejeon.

1181
01:49:22,842 --> 01:49:27,267
That's why Teacher Yoo was home.
He was taking care of the house.

1182
01:49:28,874 --> 01:49:30,406
He's a deep person.

1183
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:36,261
He didn't even call because
he thought I'd worry.

1184
01:49:39,589 --> 01:49:42,775
Yes, everyone is OK.

1185
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:45,293
Don't wake her. No.

1186
01:49:45,574 --> 01:49:47,907
Brother in law, do you want
to pick up my sister now?

1187
01:49:48,347 --> 01:49:50,412
No, I'm going to let Soo Hyang rest.

1188
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:52,898
When your sister is better,
give me a call.

1189
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:54,996
Then I'll go pick her up.

1190
01:49:55,445 --> 01:49:59,055
How are the kids? What about
your food and school?

1191
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:02,083
I'll take care of it.
Just take care of your sister.

1192
01:50:02,923 --> 01:50:04,052
Bye now.

1193
01:50:11,977 --> 01:50:15,899
He is a real man.
He really is.

1194
01:50:16,834 --> 01:50:21,920
Yeah, but he didn't even
let us know at all.

1195
01:50:22,166 --> 01:50:25,368
We would have helped him out if we
had known, right?

1196
01:50:27,759 --> 01:50:29,174
Mom, I'm home.

1197
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:32,288
OK... my oldest is here.

1198
01:50:32,347 --> 01:50:34,886
Bo Ra, are you here?

1199
01:50:36,136 --> 01:50:38,605
Bo Ra, everyone's here.

1200
01:50:38,954 --> 01:50:40,393
-Hello.
-Hi.

1201
01:50:40,559 --> 01:50:44,341
Please have some persimmons.
My mom likes these.

1202
01:50:46,176 --> 01:50:48,193
-Have fun then.
-OK.

1203
01:50:53,181 --> 01:50:56,035
Bo Ra's face looks better and better.

1204
01:50:56,635 --> 01:51:00,096
Isn't it time for her to get married?
Isn't she dating?

1205
01:51:00,495 --> 01:51:04,298
I think she is dating.

1206
01:51:04,485 --> 01:51:06,371
-Mom!
-Yeah.

1207
01:51:07,097 --> 01:51:10,703
He was on his way home,
so I told him to buy some red bean bread.

1208
01:51:10,877 --> 01:51:14,587
You should just sell those things.
How much do you eat per year?

1209
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:17,901
-Are you here?
-Hello.

1210
01:51:18,095 --> 01:51:20,402
I bought a lot of them.

1211
01:51:21,819 --> 01:51:23,549
-Please enjoy.
-OK.

1212
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:26,350
-I'll be going now.
-OK.

1213
01:51:27,579 --> 01:51:28,762
-Bye.
-Bye.

1214
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:30,238
He should stay a bit.

1215
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:46,922
What is this now?
We see each other all the time.

1216
01:51:47,125 --> 01:51:49,259
I know I'm right.
The two of them have something going on.

1217
01:51:49,485 --> 01:51:51,459
Stop saying total nonsense.

1218
01:51:51,562 --> 01:51:53,524
Do you want to see your mom faint?

1219
01:51:53,842 --> 01:51:55,219
Shut your mouth now.

1220
01:51:56,267 --> 01:51:58,332
Sun Woo must have
so much to stress about.

1221
01:51:59,482 --> 01:52:01,017
He'll do fine.

1222
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:03,004
Are you confident about it?

1223
01:52:03,713 --> 01:52:06,412
Mom, can you let it go this once?

1224
01:52:08,437 --> 01:52:11,925
I'm confident I won't change.
Aren't you?

1225
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,876
That can't ever happen.

1226
01:52:19,657 --> 01:52:20,767
Hey.

1227
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,787
Are you doing this on purpose to make
me angry?

1228
01:52:27,537 --> 01:52:30,533
You just never know with people.

1229
01:52:30,621 --> 01:52:32,765
The bride will now enter.

1230
01:52:33,428 --> 01:52:35,069
Bride, enter.
