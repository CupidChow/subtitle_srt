1
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:38,082
October 8th, 1994
Ssangmundong, Dobong-gu, Seoul

2
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:50,344
Batman!

3
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:53,505
That's not right at all.

4
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:55,483
Really?

5
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:58,903
Keep trying.

6
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,117
Batman!

7
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,326
Who wants dinner now?

8
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:16,600
Teacher! Me, me! Teacher! Me, me!

9
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:19,086
Me! Me!

10
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,670
Turn that off.

11
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:30,589
I'll be at Taek's.

12
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,297
Come home early!

13
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:35,055
I think I'm going to forget
what my second son looks like.

14
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:37,724
I'm meeting up with the gang,
so I think I'll be late.

15
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:41,061
He hasn't seen them in so long.
Why would he come home early?

16
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,302
Open up!

17
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,110
Stay out late if you'd like.

18
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,039
We can see you to our
heart's content tomorrow.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,318
I'm sorry. I'll get going now.

20
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:54,654
OK, go ahead.
I'm sure they're waiting.

21
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,390
This is that age when you want to spend
all of your time with your friends, right?

22
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,999
I guess he's now a child in our bosom.

23
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,147
Right?

24
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,687
I liked it when he was in high school.
Those were good times.

25
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,361
I'm going out. I'm meeting the gang.
I'm coming home late.

26
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:20,063
All right, have fun then.

27
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,440
-Have fun.
-Bye.

28
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,551
What is it?
Why are you standing there like that?

29
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:33,982
You should go inside.

30
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,476
-OK. Get going.
-Yep.

31
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,555
What the heck is with that girl?

32
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:47,418
It's been so long since she came back.
She can't have one meal with her family?

33
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,785
It's been a while since
she's seen her friends.

34
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,503
Why? Do you feel hurt?

35
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,402
Should I tell her to come home early?

36
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:59,665
Why would I feel hurt?
I don't feel that way at all.

37
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,163
I'm hungry. Just give me some food.

38
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:04,571
Let's wait to eat with Bo Ra.
She should be here soon.

39
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:08,680
Did she call? Is she on her way home?

40
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,921
So she's going to sleep here tonight?

41
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,148
Don't come back, you brat!

42
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:30,678
Hey, it's been a week now.
Are you that busy?

43
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,060
Yes, I am busy, Mom.

44
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,590
Jin Joo, aren't you going
to say hello to your brother?

45
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:40,127
You've changed so much.

46
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:41,561
I used to be your favorite person.

47
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:44,270
You act like you're
the busiest person ever.

48
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,209
When you come home,
all you do is sleep.

49
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,819
You think I should apologize first?

50
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:54,925
But I don't want to.

51
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,982
Just say sorry first.

52
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,248
-It makes you the bigger person.
-Really?

53
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:02,680
But then I would lose.

54
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:05,540
Jin Joo, you're speaking
in informal speech!

55
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,670
Aren't you going to fix that?
You want to get in trouble with me?

56
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:14,895
What's wrong with losing?

57
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:19,565
Back when you fought with Kyung Hee,
she apologized to you first.

58
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:23,179
Did you feel like Kyung Hee
was losing to you?

59
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:24,823
You didn't, right?

60
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,979
You're right. OK, OK.

61
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:34,809
Why isn't Taek here yet?
Does he know that it's his birthday?

62
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,376
Of course, he knows that much.

63
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,467
Do you think he's
struggling to park again?

64
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:41,818
Go outside, check on him.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,217
Hey, that punk.

66
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,389
Hey, get out.

67
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,673
I'll park it. Go on ahead.

68
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,225
-I'll do it.
-Why, I ought to just...

69
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:25,405
The family is waiting for you. Just go.

70
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:34,588
I'm home.

71
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:38,115
You're here?

72
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:41,818
Oppa, why are you so late?
The glass noodles are probably cold now!

73
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:44,464
Get washed up.
The kids will be here soon.

74
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,544
OK.

75
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:53,372
Jin Joo, this is for you.

76
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:54,959
Yeah!

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,483
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

78
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,509
Happy birthday, dear Heedong.
Happy birthday, dear Taek!

79
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,359
Happy birthday to you!

80
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:06,817
Choi Taek, you need to get here earlier!
You're not the only busy one here!

81
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,477
Blow out the candles.

82
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,939
One, two, three!

83
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,253
Yeah!

84
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,453
Hey, Jung Pal. You bought it, right?

85
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:18,121
Yeah... here's your present.

86
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:22,110
Dog Jung Pal, good choice.

87
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,724
Are you a primitive man?

88
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,273
You're probably the only
person on earth without a beeper...

89
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,529
Thats.. this punk.

90
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,311
What's this? It's actually tasty!
What the heck!

91
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,122
She goes to cooking school these days.

92
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:36,054
We wrote our numbers there, so beep us.

93
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,634
I don't need a beeper.

94
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,622
-We need it, OK? Really...
-Hey...

95
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:42,815
I don't know how to use it.

96
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:46,326
There isn't much to it.
Just call the number that's flashing.

97
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,852
All right.

98
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,645
I feel it everytime I come here,
but I really like this room.

99
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,587
What do you mean?

100
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,982
It never changes.

101
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,309
It's like my grandfather's place.

102
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,970
It's very pleasant.

103
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,143
Yeah, but honestly,
you really need to buy a computer.

104
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,336
The millennium is coming up.

105
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,767
Hey, you've improved a lot.
You even know such fancy terms.

106
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:15,741
Are you kidding me?
My TOEIC score was 700.

107
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:18,286
Hey, Deok Sun ranked 989th.

108
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,933
Talk about a success story!

109
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,051
Is Jung Bong hyung doing well?

110
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:26,925
How is he doing,
preparing for his bar exam?

111
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:29,084
Heedong...

112
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:31,419
These days, my brother
is a chat room administrator.

113
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:35,617
Jung Bong hyung leads a quiz room.

114
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,211
He's the leader of a chat room
that learns through quizzes.

115
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,264
What?

116
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:42,194
My brother isn't studying.

117
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:43,825
Just plays.

118
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,597
Thats...

119
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,578
If you think about it,
Bo Ra noona really toughed it out.

120
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,729
She succeeded in the end, you know?

121
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,605
She lived in that room, and didn't
even come home for the holidays.

122
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,285
She's scary. She really is.

123
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,616
She's so dogged. So dogged.

124
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,193
Quiz Chat Room

125
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,422
Quiz Chat Room - Five Users

126
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:50,920
All right now.

127
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,416
James Bond: 1. Commonality Quiz

128
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,823
James Bond: 2. Rubber
James Bond: 3. Mute

129
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,616
Little Mermaid: Please
give us some sugar

130
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,019
James Bond: There's no sugar
Lynch Bob: Gloves!

131
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:17,138
James Bond:
Congratulations on the gloves.

132
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,338
The level in here is pretty high.

133
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:23,907
Let's keep going.

134
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:45,383
Why is that guy coming out on stage
and singing like that, in a skirt?

135
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:48,131
He looks like he'd be crazy about girls.

136
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:52,222
He's so good looking that
he even looks good in that skirt.

137
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,939
He's a singer songwriter.
He's very good at writing songs too.

138
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:58,284
Kim Won Joon is underrated
because of his good looks.

139
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,954
Can't be more underrated because
of his looks than you are!

140
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,640
What do you mean noona?
My classmates tell me I look so young.

141
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:07,810
Don't hang out with people like that.

142
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,789
They're not very honest.

143
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,731
Bo Ra, do you have any side dishes left?
Do you have kimchi?

144
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,741
Should I make you some
stir fry anchovies before you go?

145
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,797
How is that girl, Hyun Joo?
Do you two fight?

146
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:23,166
Did you lock your windows?
You've been locking your door, right?

147
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,070
Yeah, washing machine,
I forgot to tell you.

148
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,722
You have to pour water into the washing
machine and let it spin for a while.

149
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,136
Mom, one at a time.
Just ask one at a time.

150
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:34,497
I should, shouldn't I?

151
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,174
And older noona is Sung Bo Ra.

152
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,818
You could drop her in the middle of the
Amazon and she'd survive. Don't worry.

153
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,328
Yeah, I'm not a child.

154
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,752
I eat well, and I'm quite fine,
so don't worry about me.

155
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:49,266
Hey, brats, your mom is doing this
because she's very lonely these days.

156
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:54,072
Bo Ra, you're living with your friend and
merely come home every two or three weeks.

157
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:56,973
Deok Sun often sleeps at her
friend's place by the airport

158
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,919
only calling to say that
she isn't coming home.

159
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:03,408
And No Eul this punk is always spending
night saying he's preparing for his shows.

160
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,412
This half basement house is so empty.

161
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:09,237
This house is quiet as a Buddhist temple.

162
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,807
You should come home earlier too.
You always have work related issues.

163
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,659
You come home so late.

164
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,278
If it's going to be like this

165
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:19,839
I don't see a point in saving up
and moving into an apartment.

166
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:21,816
Then, are you going
to live here forever?

167
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,096
-What are you saying?
-Of course not!

168
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:25,735
Not at all.

169
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:32,900
Hello?

170
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,935
Yes, hold on.

171
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,689
It's the bank. Here, take this.

172
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,838
Yes, speaking?

173
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:45,661
What!

174
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,386
OK... OK, I got it.

175
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,231
I'll be there. All right.

176
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,631
Why, was there an incident again?

177
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,943
My goodness, what's going on?
Dongdaemun branch accounting...

178
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:03,431
The one in charge of accounting.
That jerk ran off with one billion won.

179
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,538
-Really!
-I'm going to have to go.

180
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,478
You should finish eating. Who knows
when you could come back, right?

181
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:13,974
We don't know where he'll run now.
I have to go and investigate.

182
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,988
Well, I'm sorry about this Bo Ra.

183
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:21,506
I'm going to have to step out.
Finish eating... where's my bag?

184
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,957
I'm getting so sick of this.

185
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,378
Sorry. Go on, keep eating.

186
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,296
Bye.

187
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,869
Dad's going to be retiring soon.
Can't transfer to lighter work department?

188
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:38,461
Your dad still has
lots of energy in him.

189
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:41,145
He should earn money while he still can.

190
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,310
He still has a few good years left in him.

191
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,612
He's just fine.

192
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,987
Where is Deok Sun, anyway?

193
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,124
I thought she didn't have
any flights today or tomorrow.

194
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:53,126
Where else?
The Dooly gang has gathered.

195
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,097
In Taek hyung's room.

196
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,686
It's Choi Taek 9 dan's birthday today.

197
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,572
Been awhile since Jung Hwan
hyung is up from Sacheon.

198
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,271
Salamander hyung left work early too.

199
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,862
Yeah, right! Sun Woo hyung is here too.

200
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,527
Sun Woo never seems to come home
because he's always studying.

201
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:13,175
-He must be here for Taek's birthday.
-I guess.

202
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,476
He's a good looking boy.
Why isn't he dating?

203
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,376
What are you saying, Mom?
I've seen him a few times.

204
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,658
-Sun Woo hyung dates just fine.
-Really?

205
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:25,147
Then... is Jung Hwan the fool?

206
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:31,694
I suppose it may be hard to date
while living over in Sacheon.

207
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,523
Mom, just worry about your own daughters.

208
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,622
Why is it, that neither of my sisters
can ever bring home a single guy?

209
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:43,466
No one even dials the
wrong number by accident.

210
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:44,825
Do you want to die?

211
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,687
The men in this country have
such good taste... they're so smart.

212
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:54,089
It's been a while, hasn't it?
You must have a death wish!

213
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:56,846
- Hey, now.
- You're just asking for a beating.

214
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,349
-You must want to die or something.
-Now this house feels alive again.

215
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,657
Hey, I'm really popular too.

216
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:07,516
I'm supposed to meet him
tomorrow for a movie.

217
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,986
I'm the one who says no.

218
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,995
He was good looking.
Don't get dumped this time, Deok Sun.

219
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,204
What the heck!

220
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:15,396
Who got dumped?
I always did the dumping.

221
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:17,940
- All right, all right.
- Sure, you dumped them.

222
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,702
This time, it was you
who dumped the guy.

223
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:21,183
She always gets worked up like this.

224
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,231
But when did guys
you see him anyway?

225
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:26,051
Earlier, I saw him drop you off.

226
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:27,168
We all saw him together.

227
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,841
Hey, he seemed normal.

228
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:30,675
Of course, he's normal.
Why wouldn't he be?

229
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:34,472
Are you talking about the guy that
the senior introduced you to?

230
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:37,119
So you're still dating well.
You haven't been dumped.

231
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,502
Seriously, I don't get dumped!

232
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,639
I'm the one who always does the dumping!

233
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:46,121
-OK!
-You always dump them.

234
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,813
-You always dump them. We got it, OK?
-We got it, definitely!

235
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,017
I'm being serious.
I dumped them. I dumped them!

236
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,207
I dumped them!

237
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:56,904
-We said, OK!
-We said, OK!

238
00:15:56,942 --> 00:16:01,161
-Deok Sun says she dumped them.
-I said I dumped them. It was me!

239
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,421
OK, Deok Sun. But, Deok Sun?

240
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,182
You got dumped, right?

241
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:08,770
You want to die! I dumped him!

242
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,560
I dumped him. Seriously, I did.

243
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:17,373
Don't you think that I dance
better than those people?

244
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,186
Do you even have to ask?

245
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:24,363
Hey, you!

246
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,734
Missus, we're here.

247
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:30,541
Why did you leave the door open?

248
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,302
It's cold.

249
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:34,591
Because we knew you were coming!

250
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,124
This place is quiet too.

251
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:41,145
Yeah, without the kids around,
it sure is quiet.

252
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:46,015
I called you to come over for some soju,
but the line was busy.

253
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,882
Did you make sure to hang up
the phone properly?

254
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,353
What...

255
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:53,054
-Well...
-What?

256
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,143
OK.

257
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,262
James Bond: 1. Commonality Quiz

258
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,161
James Bond: 2. Space Travel

259
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,848
Little Mermaid: Apollo 13
Nero Wolfe: Sputnik

260
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,272
Lynch Bob: Star Wars

261
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:31,530
Maggie's Memories: Blue Marble

262
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,183
What!

263
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:39,793
Oh!

264
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:38,176
Aigoo... You didn't start yet?

265
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,241
Are we playing Go Stop today?

266
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,731
Teacher Ryu has something
to do at school.

267
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,995
And Manager Sung isn't home either.

268
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:50,618
It's not fun without those two guys.

269
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:58,291
There is an article out about Taek, right?

270
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:01,048
Yes, did you see it already?

271
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:05,863
A famous actress said Taek
was her ideal type of guy.

272
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:06,934
Look at that.

273
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:09,447
We saw that too.

274
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,782
This isn't the first time.
It'll die down eventually.

275
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:15,906
If you can find someone good,
you should just marry him off.

276
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:18,352
No, no. I don't like celebrities.

277
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,024
It would make me happy
if he met a regular person.

278
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:23,548
I'd like that too.

279
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:27,051
And plus, Taek will
figure it out on his own.

280
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:31,756
I think he goes on a lot of blind dates,
and even meetings for arranged marriages.

281
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,529
But the relationships don't last long.

282
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:38,420
Yeah, I thought Taek
was just a naive boy.

283
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:40,129
But he goes on meetings
for arranged marriages.

284
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:42,424
Yeah! He is up at that age now.

285
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:47,533
Also, it doesn't help that
he can't say no to people.

286
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:52,253
What can he do when a close president,
or a senior, asks him?

287
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:54,812
He'll just go out, eat his meal,
and come home.

288
00:19:56,054 --> 00:19:59,515
I'm sure that if he keeps that up,
he'll someday meet his match.

289
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,757
I'm sure the kids are teasing him
about this article, as we speak.

290
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,781
Hey, is Shim So Young crazy?

291
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,267
Why does she like him?

292
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,025
Does she know that you can't
even tie your own shoelaces?

293
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:18,384
I'm disappointed in Shim So Young.

294
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,656
I am a big fan of Shim So Young.

295
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:26,193
Hey, you go on the most
blind dates out of all of us.

296
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:27,798
So why are you so bad at dating?

297
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,571
Are you setting your sights too high?

298
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,964
Thats, you guys must not
know him very well.

299
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:36,205
Hey. You, be quiet.

300
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:37,785
He just keeps getting dumped.

301
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:39,253
Why is that?

302
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:42,298
At first, they meet him, and they're
amazed at the fact that he's Choi Taek.

303
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:44,466
But after a while, they get frustrated.

304
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,793
He doesn't talk!

305
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,048
Thats, you punk.

306
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:53,889
I tried very hard.

307
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:57,489
-Hey, try harder!
-Try harder. More!

308
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:01,594
-Deok Sun?
-Yeah.

309
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,231
Why don't you set something up for us?

310
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,650
Forget it. I don't want to
get cursed by any of the girls.

311
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:10,265
What's wrong with us?
A four way date, including Taek.

312
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,671
You're OK with it, right?

313
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:13,433
If I have time.

314
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:16,516
Jung Pal, you said you're
training in Seoul for a bit.

315
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:19,481
-You join in, too.
-I don't want to. Date for what?

316
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,277
It's pointless, once
I go to Sacheon anyway.

317
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,238
Sacheon, Sacheon, Sacheon!

318
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:26,147
You have no sense of romanticism...

319
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:30,572
Hey Jung Pal. Turn on some music.
Are there any CDs?

320
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,805
CDs? As if Taek would have any CDs.

321
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:35,661
Then turn on anything.

322
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:58,520
Jung Pal, good! Jung Pal, good!

323
00:21:58,929 --> 00:21:59,929
I'm going to sleep.

324
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,009
Deok Sun, you should sleep here too.
Heard me?

325
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,233
Are you trying to ruin
my chances for marriage?

326
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,990
I'm leaving after this song.

327
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,282
Episode 18: Good Bye First Love

328
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:48,261
What about Bo Ra's father?

329
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:50,659
He's even working on a Sunday?

330
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:54,177
Every time something happens at
the bank, he runs right off.

331
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,902
My husband is working so hard,
just to make a little bit of money.

332
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,770
I should make him some herbal medicine.

333
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,034
Yeah, it is so strange.

334
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:06,084
I don't feel like it's a waste to spend
money on my children, whatsoever.

335
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:10,002
But when I'm about to spend money on
my husband, my hands start to shake.

336
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:12,591
-Is it just me?
-Everyone's like that.

337
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:17,199
When Jung Bong or Jung Hwan
come in late and ask me for food

338
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,380
I prepare food that I don't even make
for my mother in law's memorial service.

339
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,809
I'll make vegetables, fish, pork wraps.

340
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:28,815
But when Jung Bong's dad
asks for ramen late at night...

341
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:34,726
Suddenly, I get this anger,
rising up from my stomach...

342
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,841
I could just give him a flying kick!

343
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:46,898
But even with my flying kick...

344
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,894
I think... my poor husband.

345
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,928
He works so hard to earn money, and he
can't even have ramen cooked for him.

346
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:59,792
I tell myself that I should be
understanding, and hold it in.

347
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,262
But then, when he asks me
to cook late at night...

348
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,927
the anger just rises out of me!

349
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:08,217
I'm so hot!

350
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:15,260
It's cold in here! Put your clothes
back on! Stop getting angry!

351
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,479
It's been a while since
Jung Hwan has been home.

352
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,823
Have you seen him as much
as you've wanted to?

353
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,389
Yeah, as he walked out.

354
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:29,388
He hasn't been in Seoul for so long.
So he must have lots to do and buy.

355
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:32,614
I can't really see his face.

356
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:34,997
Of course, that's how it goes!

357
00:28:35,236 --> 00:28:40,106
He's so young, and he's been
with soldiers in Sacheon all this time.

358
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,171
He must be so happy when he's in Seoul.

359
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,182
And on top of that,
he likes his friends so much.

360
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:47,240
How about you?
Have you seen a lot of Sun Woo and Taek?

361
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:49,797
Those two are the busiest in that group.

362
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,862
I saw them quite a lot!

363
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:54,318
I saw them when they
had their eyes closed.

364
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:00,989
Taek?

365
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,083
Taek, let's have breakfast.

366
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,855
It looks like he lost some weight.

367
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:39,875
He lost some in his cheeks.

368
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:42,329
He lost some weight in his nose too.

369
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:45,539
Is that right?

370
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:57,052
Oppa, he's not dead, is he?

371
00:29:58,385 --> 00:30:00,930
No, he's breathing.

372
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:05,528
He looks dead.

373
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:11,480
We have someone in our house
who sleeps all the time too.

374
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,688
That, I think I know
who you're talking about.

375
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:18,336
Our cute Deok Sun is too diligent,
so it can't be her.

376
00:30:18,391 --> 00:30:19,479
It's Bo Ra, isn't it?

377
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:40,542
So, is Bo Ra going
to become a prosecutor?

378
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,123
A judge, or a lawyer?

379
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,116
Her dream is to become a prosecutor.

380
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:48,414
Will she get hired?
Since she was involved in those protests?

381
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,886
The regime has changed,
so she should be OK.

382
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:56,026
As for me... I'm OK with anything.

383
00:30:58,485 --> 00:30:59,715
Congratulations.

384
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:05,873
I don't know when my
Jung Bong will... my goodness...

385
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:19,912
Come on missus, you need to
catch your breath. Come on...

386
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,420
That little bit won't get you drunk.

387
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:29,259
Judicial Research and Training Center

388
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:40,638
What's that?

389
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:43,967
A wedding invitation. They're the sixth
successful couple that I've set up.

390
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:45,864
That's some talent.

391
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,239
This must be my skill, not law.

392
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,142
You haven't forgotten your blind date
on Sunday, have you?

393
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:55,455
I'm only doing it just this once.
I really don't like this stuff.

394
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,630
OK, OK.

395
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,197
By the way, Bo Ra...

396
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:03,700
-He's younger than you.
-What?

397
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:06,188
You got totally lucky!

398
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,341
He's a Yonsei Medical School third year,
and younger than you.

399
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,518
He's my Oppa's favorite student.

400
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:13,216
They say that he's a genius.

401
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:17,117
I'm only introducing him to you,
because it's you!

402
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:22,853
But his nickname is...

403
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,483
...Trash.

404
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:28,803
-What?
-It's fine!

405
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:31,949
He's trash, but he's genius trash.

406
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:36,654
Hey, it's better for guys to be that way.

407
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,933
People who are clean
freaks are a real pain!

408
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:44,121
Just try meeting him once, OK?

409
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:47,552
OK, I got it.

410
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,296
Hey, Michael. Did you get
the past exams for Hematology?

411
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:11,991
How can you sleep right now?

412
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:17,403
Sun Woo, studying is not the most
important thing in the world.

413
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:20,844
Networking!

414
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:23,147
You've done all you can.
Now wait for God's will.

415
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,401
Don't you know that?

416
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:28,207
OK, but did you get them?
You said that you were close to him.

417
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:30,892
He should be here by now.

418
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,425
-Aigoo, President Kim!
-Aigoo, President Kim.

419
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:42,032
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

420
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:43,850
What about the goods?

421
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:45,423
Pay up 6.1 billion won.

422
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,998
-Fine. I'll put it in your account.
-Here you go.

423
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:51,160
Thanks. I owe you one!

424
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,171
Ehh. Are you showing off you're
a Seoul slicker? It's nothing!

425
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:00,289
Hey, what's your beeper number?

426
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,531
You owe me a coupon.
Pay me back, OK?

427
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:08,670
OK, it's 015-273-0917.

428
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,489
-0917?
-Yeah.

429
00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:12,889
OK.

430
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,473
Michael, I'll get going.
The professor is paging me.

431
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,640
See you.

432
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:22,181
Thanks!

433
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:25,402
-Nice to see you, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you, nice to see you!

434
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:00,242
Yes, dear.

435
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:01,734
Honey!

436
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:04,779
-I'm home.
-OK.

437
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,314
Come in.

438
00:35:13,097 --> 00:35:14,541
Oh yeah. Honey.

439
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:18,451
Can you wake me up early in the morning?

440
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:21,922
I have some important documents
to prepare for the bank.

441
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:24,036
Wash up before you go to bed.

442
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:25,713
Just a short bit.

443
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:29,480
I just want to lay down for a bit.

444
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:33,490
This is why home is nice.

445
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,294
Here we go...

446
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,725
Get these off...

447
00:36:20,283 --> 00:36:22,245
Jung Hwan is going to be late tonight.

448
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:26,857
He's going to Dong Ryong's restaurant
for a drink after his training.

449
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:31,092
OK, I made his favorite cutlass fish.

450
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:34,182
I guess he'll have to
eat it in the morning.

451
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,625
Jung Bong! Are you finished?

452
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:43,437
Clean up the soapsuds
next to the sink too!

453
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:00,356
Mother, do you have anything
else that you need me to do?

454
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:04,328
Yes, there is one thing.

455
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:06,194
What is it?

456
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,835
Study.

457
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,530
Well, then...

458
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:26,128
Let's go.

459
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:31,852
Thank you for the meal!

460
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:33,712
He does that everytime it's time to pay.

461
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:36,267
How much is it?

462
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:40,994
Let's see. You had five servings
of ribs and three bottles of soju.

463
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:42,712
We had three bottles of coke too.

464
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,643
The three bottles of coke
will be on the house.

465
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:52,597
So, 65,000 won plus 6,000 won.

466
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:55,318
It's 71,000 won.
But just give me 70,000 won.

467
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:59,410
70,000 won. Here you go.

468
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:03,193
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

469
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:04,717
-Sell lots!
-Thank you. Bye.

470
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:09,982
Hyung, I'll finish up here.
You can go home first.

471
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,002
OK, I'll go home then.

472
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:15,646
Jung Hwan, drink everything
in our restaurant tonight! Got it?

473
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:17,435
Yes, hyungnim! Thank you!

474
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:19,994
-Where are the others?
-They're coming.

475
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:24,681
When did these kids grow up
and start drinking already?

476
00:38:42,805 --> 00:38:45,935
Hey, you bought Park Jin
Young's first album too?

477
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:48,779
Yeah, I got it when I was buying
Lee Moon Se hyung's book.

478
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,884
Park Jin Young's songs are really good!

479
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:53,445
They have audio systems on combat planes?

480
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:57,639
Combat would be pretty great.

481
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
You're crazy...

482
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:04,050
Hey, do you remember when we met
Park Jin Young in high school?

483
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,925
He was number two.

484
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:08,636
Hey, you've got quite the brain.

485
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,874
I was matched up against
someone really great.

486
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:15,441
Matched up?
You ran away immediately.

487
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:18,451
I just can't lie to you guys...

488
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:23,855
What are you reading? What are you looking
at? You taking your college entrance exam?

489
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:25,585
Seriously.

490
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:27,611
It was just laying there.

491
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,017
Nice to meet what?

492
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:35,374
Seriously, this is a book
that you should never read.

493
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:38,401
You, have no romanticism.

494
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:42,890
Why don't you date?

495
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,789
What do you mean? I have.

496
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:46,869
What the heck!

497
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:51,201
Is it dating when you go on some blind
dates and meet up for a couple of months?

498
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:54,156
And you barely even go on blind dates.

499
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,325
Don't use Sacheon as an excuse.

500
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:00,710
People in Sacheon
meet and date just fine.

501
00:40:04,975 --> 00:40:06,025
And what about that?

502
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,758
Do you still have that ring you got when
you graduated from Air Force Academy?

503
00:40:09,513 --> 00:40:11,284
What? The fiancée ring?

504
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,354
Thats, that's an awesome name.

505
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:15,256
Give that to me. I'll use it.

506
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:22,959
It's been almost a year since you
graduated, and you still have it?

507
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,556
Just give it to anybody.

508
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,169
I don't have a girlfriend.

509
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:30,314
Should I give it to a girl that
I just met? That's embarrassing.

510
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,803
It's more embarrassing
that you still have it.

511
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,840
Who is that?
That girl who I met briefly...

512
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:39,387
She was OK.
Why didn't you give it to her?

513
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:44,224
Man, you're going to die without ever
confessing to anyone all your life.

514
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:46,885
You don't have a romantic
bone in your body.

515
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,421
I'll give it to you. You have it.

516
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,415
Really? You're giving it to me?

517
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:54,513
I'm going to give it
to my next girlfriend.

518
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:57,028
I'm going to get married and have kids.
I'm ruined...

519
00:40:58,279 --> 00:40:59,797
Thanks for taking care of it.

520
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:03,713
Wait, wait... let's drink together,
Second Lieutenant Kim.

521
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,397
Let's drink together.

522
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:12,848
I think I know why.

523
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:14,799
I think I know why you don't date.

524
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:16,209
Hold on...

525
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:19,485
The reason you don't date is...
What's that?

526
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:21,711
Let's see now. Where is Jung Hwan?

527
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:24,355
-What are you doing?
-Where is Jung Hwan?

528
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:25,966
What are you two doing?

529
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:28,731
This dude is nuts!

530
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,601
-Hey!
-Hey!

531
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:41,668
You're the last one to leave today, too.
Let's head out together.

532
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:43,478
Do you want a ride?

533
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:46,520
No... it's OK. I'm all right.

534
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:47,641
You really don't need to.

535
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:53,514
Also, my girlfriend is here, downstairs.

536
00:41:53,985 --> 00:41:58,223
That is the top flight attendant here?
It'll be far, all the way to Hongik dong.

537
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:04,034
Hello, Choi Taek 9 dan.
Nice to meet you again.

538
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,756
Hello.

539
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,624
Yes, I hear you're meeting Deok Sun today.

540
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:11,324
Yes, my friends are getting together.

541
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:14,740
I really should buy Deok Sun
a meal sometime.

542
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:16,760
Don't worry about it.

543
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,794
I set her up with
a college junior of mine.

544
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,987
I think they've been dating lately.

545
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:26,263
I heard they went
to see a movie last week.

546
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,533
I'm helping them along.

547
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:31,029
Today, I even gave her concert
tickets for Lee Seung Hwan.

548
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:35,502
Yeah, the concert is this Sunday.
Would you like to go too?

549
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:39,077
I'm close to the person running it,
so I can get some tickets.

550
00:42:39,543 --> 00:42:40,992
I can cover the concert tickets.

551
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:43,073
No, I'll be fine.

552
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:44,718
He's a fan of Wild Chrysanthemum.

553
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:49,166
Please enjoy your date.

554
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,475
Please tell Deok Sun that I said hello.

555
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:53,893
OK.

556
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:01,500
-Should we get going too?
-Yes.

557
00:43:06,746 --> 00:43:08,316
Master Choi.

558
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:14,332
It's nice to have Jung Pal here in Seoul,
getting the chance to see him often.

559
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:17,496
I kind of brought my car here today.

560
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:20,683
Tell Deok Sun to drive.
She quit drinking.

561
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:22,662
Why? Is something going on?

562
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:25,234
-It won't last long.
-Sounds like a lie.

563
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,679
That's what I said.

564
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:31,429
She couldn't drink at all before,
but now she's all grown up and drinking.

565
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:32,630
Our Soo Yeon.

566
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,288
I haven't heard that in ages,
Sung Soo Yeon.

567
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:38,808
How did you remember that?

568
00:43:38,845 --> 00:43:40,704
I wonder how that
fortune teller is doing.

569
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:42,793
She got everything right, in the end.

570
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:46,311
Hi, everyone! I'm here!

571
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:48,738
Long time, Soo Yeon.

572
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:52,168
-Sung Soo Yeon!
-Hey, you're here.

573
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:55,069
-Sung Soo Yeon, Sung Soo Yeon...
-Hurry up. Why are you so late?

574
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,189
Should I just kill them all?

575
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:01,941
I ought to just move
to another neighborhood.

576
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,142
You all know too much about me.

577
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:08,306
How do I get a new identity?

578
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:11,769
Why are you drinking cola?
You really quit drinking?

579
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:13,420
I'm taking herbal medicine these days.

580
00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:15,573
You want to be even healthier?

581
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:18,084
You're plenty healthy now,
but you want to be even healthier?

582
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:19,332
What will happen then?

583
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:23,226
It must be going well
with that guy you're dating.

584
00:44:23,553 --> 00:44:25,759
It's obvious. I say it'll last one month.

585
00:44:25,877 --> 00:44:27,021
Why do you say that?

586
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,255
I may be cold rice here,
but I'm totally popular elsewhere.

587
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:32,856
-Where would that be?
-Hey!

588
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:35,588
Hey, let's not lie to each other.

589
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:41,188
Seriously, you guys, I'm going to watch
a concert with him this Sunday too!

590
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,841
You're just lying now!

591
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:45,945
No, that part is true. I heard it
from Manager Yoo just a while ago.

592
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:50,350
See, see? What do you take
Sung Deok Sun for?

593
00:44:50,723 --> 00:44:53,520
I'm a busy woman on the weekends.

594
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:56,911
I don't have time to watch movies
with my neighborhood friends.

595
00:44:58,024 --> 00:45:00,309
-Sunday?
-Yeah, are you going too?

596
00:45:00,509 --> 00:45:04,992
Hey, we're all supposed to
go watch "Forrest Gump" together.

597
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:07,280
-I saw that already.
-Hey!

598
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,669
- You have no loyalty.
-Hey...

599
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,029
I saw it with him.

600
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,738
Why would I watch it with you guys?
Such a waste of time...

601
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:16,233
-I saw it too.
-Hey!

602
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,451
I forgot. I'm sorry.

603
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,223
The people at Baduk Club
wanted to see it so much.

604
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:26,289
Well, I haven't seen it.
How about you, Jung Pal?

605
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,530
I haven't either.

606
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:31,242
Hey, three guys shouldn't go
watch a movie together.

607
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,079
What kind of image does that put forth?

608
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:39,441
So, what is this?
You guys see me as a girl, then?

609
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:45,201
All right, all right, I'll cancel
the Lee Seung Hwan concert then.

610
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:46,836
I'll go watch the movie with you guys.

611
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:48,735
What can I do?

612
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:52,971
- Hey, you get out!
- Just go!

613
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,413
Just go home already!

614
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:56,887
-I'd rather go with No Eul!
-I just won't go then.

615
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:58,928
I'd rather go with my dad.

616
00:45:59,045 --> 00:46:01,364
-I'll just not go then.
-I'll just go with Jung Bong hyung.

617
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:02,862
Are you still here?

618
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:05,708
-Aren't you leaving?
-Stop talking about that guy.

619
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:06,929
Can you give me a drink?

620
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:09,576
I can't. You have to drive.

621
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,940
What's with your hat?
Go outside and paint something!

622
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:20,062
I don't want to go home.
I really don't want to...

623
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:25,239
My dad... my dad is home.

624
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:30,867
I'm going.

625
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:40,235
With all of us here like this,
it brings back the past, right?

626
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:47,227
It was fun back then,
even though I was always in last place.

627
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:52,979
Right, Deok Sun?

628
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:56,269
Number 989, Deok Sun.
Those days were good, right?

629
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,841
He's really drunk.
He's spouting nonsense.

630
00:46:59,088 --> 00:47:00,836
Get inside. You'll wake up the elders.

631
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:04,904
I'm going. I'm going to wake up my dad.

632
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:08,672
Bye. Goodbye, my friend.

633
00:47:08,918 --> 00:47:11,475
It's not "friend".
It's "friends". Friends!

634
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,975
It's plural, you dummy.

635
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:16,535
OK, good point. Goodbye, my friends!

636
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:19,767
-Father!
-Bye.

637
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,863
Mom, I'm home.

638
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:07,179
You come home every day lately.

639
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,799
My daughter's such a good girl.

640
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:12,099
You too, Mom.

641
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,225
You're being very diligent
about taking your medicine.

642
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:19,499
Of course, you know who bought it for me.
I have to take it diligently.

643
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:26,976
What's wrong with Dad lately?
His face doesn't look good.

644
00:48:27,682 --> 00:48:29,398
Your dad has a lot of work lately.

645
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:32,244
Every week, there's a new employee
running off with the bank's money.

646
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,609
It's causing such a fuss.

647
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,245
Can't he stop working now?

648
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,301
Unnie has a stream of income and so do I.

649
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,469
His face really doesn't look good.

650
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:44,088
There's no need for such talk.

651
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:50,516
The day your dad stops working,
is that day that he'll get sick.

652
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,471
It's OK.

653
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:56,359
I was going to buy him some
herbal medicine tomorrow anyway.

654
00:48:57,609 --> 00:48:58,609
OK.

655
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:35,138
Is that you, Jung Hwan?

656
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:37,999
Yes.

657
00:49:39,373 --> 00:49:41,333
-Good night.
-OK.

658
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,480
-Sleep well, my son.
-OK.

659
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:08,439
Are you just getting in?

660
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,898
Yes. Were you still awake?

661
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:12,359
I'm going to bed now.

662
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:14,699
Did you drink?

663
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:16,959
A little.

664
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:20,161
Then don't take any
sleeping pills tonight. Got that?

665
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,571
Alcohol is better than
the sleeping pills, at least.

666
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,909
OK?

667
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:27,159
Yes. Go to bed.

668
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:28,319
OK.

669
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,413

00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,019
What!

681
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:59,633
Maggie's Memories: Second
floor, not first floor

682
00:53:59,873 --> 00:54:00,990
Banjul...

683
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:03,361
Banjul...

684
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:41,440
Vice Principal, you should
sleep in sometimes.

685
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:43,242
Today is Sunday.

686
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:45,341
The same could be said for you.

687
00:54:45,468 --> 00:54:47,430
Can't you close the store on Sundays?

688
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,964
There are no customers.
Why do you insist on being open?

689
00:54:50,726 --> 00:54:53,213
I feel like if I don't do this,
I'll age a lot faster.

690
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:54,556
Yes.

691
00:54:58,394 --> 00:54:59,466
Really.

692
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:06,522
At this rate,
you'll wear yourself out.

693
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:08,575
Why do you have to go in on a Sunday?

694
00:55:09,134 --> 00:55:13,919
It's just for a moment. I'll be there
for a bit and I'll come right back.

695
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,214
I just can't deal with this...

696
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:21,052
Well, the thing is...

697
00:55:22,755 --> 00:55:26,424
I'm just bringing this up now.

698
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:31,834
I'm sure you've heard about this too.

699
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,763
-What? What is it?
-Thats...

700
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:38,721
It's called... early voluntary retirement.

701
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,630
I really only have
four or five good years left in me.

702
00:55:43,736 --> 00:55:49,072
If I apply for early voluntary retirement,
I get twice the retirement payments.

703
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,389
No, you can't.

704
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:52,699
You can't ever do that.

705
00:55:52,843 --> 00:55:55,294
Yeah, of course not.

706
00:55:55,416 --> 00:56:00,227
That's why I said I'm just
mentioning it in passing.

707
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,022
Neither of our daughters
are even married yet.

708
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,659
What would we say to the in-laws?

709
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,319
That you're unemployed?

710
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:08,528
You can't do that.

711
00:56:08,957 --> 00:56:10,159
There's No Eul too.

712
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:13,422
You have to stick with that bank
until all of our kids are married.

713
00:56:14,257 --> 00:56:16,917
-Do you understand?
-Of course.

714
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:19,206
Of course, I'll stay there.

715
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:21,382
I was just mentioning it.

716
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,727
Look at the time already.

717
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:30,185
-Why? Just eat a little bit more.
-I'll get going now.

718
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:42,175
I'm heading out!

719
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:44,589
I'm meeting some classmates
and then going to see a movie.

720
00:56:45,242 --> 00:56:48,666
OK... be careful on the road.

721
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:50,850
Drive carefully.

722
00:56:51,297 --> 00:56:53,735
Slowly, OK? Drive slowly.

723
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,492
OK. I'm not a kid.

724
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:48,606
This is your first message.

725
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,117
I'm so sorry.

726
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:56,446
I don't think I'll be able to
make it to the concert tonight.

727
00:57:57,428 --> 00:58:00,887
I'm being very rude because this
is related to a personal issue.

728
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:03,080
And I have no excuses to make.

729
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:05,217
I am really sorry.

730
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,273
-Deok Sun.
-Yeah?

731
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:25,421
Can you buy some bean sprouts?
As you said you're heading out, right?

732
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,909
No, I'll go buy them.
Do you need anything else?

733
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:32,833
Well, then can you buy
a half geun of pork too?

734
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,932
-I'll get you the money.
-No, no. I have money.

735
00:58:39,364 --> 00:58:41,734
Bean sprouts and a half
geun of pork, right?

736
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:45,563
Stop talking so much and get going.
Don't be late later.

737
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:48,105
OK. I have lots of time!

738
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:50,559
-Get going, Taek.
-OK.

739
00:58:53,044 --> 00:58:54,044
Hey!

740
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:55,762
Hey, what are you doing?

741
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,033
I thought you were going to the concert.

742
00:59:15,316 --> 00:59:16,716
Why do you still look like that?

743
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:20,234
Ah, you got dumped again?

744
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:25,693
You did come home alone yesterday.

745
00:59:26,122 --> 00:59:27,465
You got dumped. You did.

746
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:29,601
That's not true.
I'm going to the concert right now.

747
00:59:30,008 --> 00:59:33,019
That's a great outfit for a concert!

748
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:35,011
I have to run along with Seung Hwan oppa.

749
00:59:36,102 --> 00:59:37,197
Is that it?

750
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:41,203
Get in. I'll drive you there.

751
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:42,662
-Deal.
-Get in.

752
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:47,056
Open it gently, will you?

753
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:50,719
Shut it gently, seriously.

754
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,209
Let's go.

755
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:55,732
Deok Sun, my driving can be a little
rough, so you hold on tight.

756
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,397
All right, let's go!

757
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:01,648
-See you later, Jung Pal.
-OK.

758
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:04,131
Yeah, let's go!

759
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,729
Hey... it's raining outside.

760
01:00:32,283 --> 01:00:34,396
What are you talking about?
The sun was just shining.

761
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:36,829
I suppose a tiger
is getting married today.

762
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:39,229
When is Sun Woo getting here anyway?

763
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:41,624
He said he was working in the morning.

764
01:00:46,154 --> 01:00:47,783
Hold on a minute.

765
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:11,034
I gave him your number,
so he'll beep you when he arrives.

766
01:01:14,943 --> 01:01:18,644
Kim Jae Joon, 012-387-0527

767
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:20,969
Is it showering this afternoon?

768
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:24,668
-What about Choi Taek 9 dan?
-He's in the bathroom.

769
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,210
What?

770
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:47,839
Isn't that two timing?

771
01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:52,158
It's not really two timing.
I didn't know either.

772
01:02:52,325 --> 01:02:54,959
That he had a long time girlfriend.

773
01:02:55,432 --> 01:02:59,199
He got into a big fight with her
and went on the blind date out of anger.

774
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,494
I feel so bad for Deok Sun.

775
01:03:02,931 --> 01:03:06,427
Then, is Deok Sun waiting by herself
right now? Did he contact her?

776
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:09,652
Of course, he's not that awful.

777
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:13,133
He left her a voice mail on the beeper,
saying that he couldn't go to the concert.

778
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,143
That's a relief.

779
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:18,026
But Deok Sun is behaving quite...

780
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:20,634
She went to watch it on her own.

781
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,023
-What?
-She said the tickets would go to waste.

782
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:25,088
If it were me, I would never go.

783
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,199
Why would you introduce
her to a junior like that?

784
01:03:42,546 --> 01:03:44,538
-Who was it?
-Sun Woo.

785
01:03:45,032 --> 01:03:46,939
-He can't come.
-What? Why?

786
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:48,548
Something came up.

787
01:03:48,885 --> 01:03:51,909
-What plans, all of a sudden?
-Isn't it obvious?

788
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:59,436
Do... Do I really have
to watch this with you?

789
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,383
Isn't that the guy that
Deok Sun was set up with?

790
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:13,157
Why is that jerk here right now?

791
01:04:17,966 --> 01:04:19,036
That punk...

792
01:04:22,761 --> 01:04:25,645
Deok Sun got dumped again.

793
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:28,942
Hey, that idiot.

794
01:04:36,457 --> 01:04:39,687
Jung Pal, don't you think I look
a little bit like Tom Hanks?

795
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:47,107
Hey, Jung Pal, give me the pamphlet.

796
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:54,374
You did come home alone yesterday.

797
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,233
You got dumped. You did.

798
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:58,379
That's not true.
I'm going to the concert right now.

799
01:04:58,684 --> 01:05:01,843
That's a great outfit for a concert!

800
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:03,821
I have to run along with
Seung Hwan oppa.

801
01:05:13,537 --> 01:05:17,025
Hey, Jung Pal! That's all CG.

802
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,633
Hollywood's technology is just, really...

803
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,883
Hey!
Where...

804
01:05:32,373 --> 01:05:33,373
Sorry.

805
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:14,641
Press one to page,
press two to leave a message...

806
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:18,470
Hey, Joey Wong.
This is a rare opportunity.

807
01:06:18,738 --> 01:06:21,393
These are free tickets... free tickets!
Run over here!

808
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,357
And bring some clothes and shoes
when you come here, OK?

809
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:27,003
Hurry up and come, OK?
You have to come!

810
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:34,471
The show is going to start soon.

811
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:37,864
Your boyfriend must not be here yet.

812
01:09:57,854 --> 01:09:58,974
Are you Trash?

813
01:10:11,113 --> 01:10:12,323
What's with you?

814
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,628
What are you doing here?

815
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:31,659
Fate doesn't come around at any time.

816
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:35,195
At the very least, to use the term fate.

817
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:39,906
It has to be a dramatic moment
brought by coincidence.

818
01:10:40,508 --> 01:10:41,765
That's what makes it fate.

819
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:47,581
That's why, another term
for fate, is timing.

820
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:59,976
If I had not been caught at any of
those darn traffic lights...

821
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,387
If any of those red lights
had helped me just once...

822
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:09,318
I might be standing in front
of her, as if it were fate.

823
01:11:11,884 --> 01:11:16,651
My first love was always held
back by that darn thing called timing.

824
01:11:19,244 --> 01:11:20,536
That darned timing.

825
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,179
Are you Trash?

826
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:54,760
What's with you?

827
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:59,012
Why are you here, Noona?

828
01:13:00,332 --> 01:13:01,572
You answer first.

829
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,198
Hey, what's your beeper number?

830
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:13,646
You owe me a coupon.
Pay me back, OK?

831
01:13:14,462 --> 01:13:18,677
OK, it's 015-273-0917.

832
01:13:18,862 --> 01:13:20,534
-0917?
-Yeah.

833
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:22,998
OK.

834
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,418
Michael, I'll get going.
The professor is paging me.

835
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,271
You got that?

836
01:13:40,724 --> 01:13:42,908
I'm only setting you up
because you're my favorite.

837
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:44,955
Yes.

838
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,741
No!

839
01:14:05,913 --> 01:14:06,990
Mom!

840
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:08,553
Are you very hurt?

841
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:11,411
You're in front of Twins Supermarket?

842
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:15,315
Oppa'll be right there.

843
01:14:35,415 --> 01:14:38,220
You have one message.

844
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:41,581
It's me, Trash. Kim Jae Joon.

845
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:44,233
I need to cash in that coupon today.

846
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:46,895
You need to go on
a blind date for me.

847
01:14:47,212 --> 01:14:49,532
It's at 5:00 p.m., at Myung dong Gamu.

848
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:52,391
I'll buy you lunch when I see you.
Please help me out, just this once.

849
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,421
Something really important
just came up. Thanks!

850
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,170
Jeong.

851
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:38,983
Next is baduk news.

852
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:45,708
On the 16th, at the Hongik Baduk Club, for
the first scheduled match of Baccus Cup.

853
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:51,068
Korea's player, Choi Taek 9 dan surprised
everyone by forfeiting the match.

854
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:55,651
This is Choi Taek's first forfeit since
he started his professional career.

855
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:58,242
He informed the organization
and Baduk Club.

856
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,491
And he apologized to his opponent,
Lim Ji Yeon 9 dan, as well.

857
01:16:02,185 --> 01:16:06,872
The reason for his forfeit was personal,
and as such, the details are unknown.

858
01:16:07,531 --> 01:16:09,564
Choi Taek 9 dan who is usually...

859
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:13,162
But fate and timing...

860
01:16:14,076 --> 01:16:16,006
...aren't just coincidences that find you.

861
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:22,203
They are miraculous moments made from
numerous choices arising  of earnestness.

862
01:16:23,486 --> 01:16:27,099
Surrender and decision,
without hesitation...

863
01:16:27,646 --> 01:16:29,250
That is what makes timing.

864
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,566
He was more ardent.
And I should have been more courageous.

865
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,776
It was not the traffic light's fault.

866
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:41,382
It was not timing.

867
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:45,626
It was my many hesitations.

868
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,526
You're really something, Noona.

869
01:17:09,337 --> 01:17:10,687
Even so...

870
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:12,595
...how can you go
on a blind date...

871
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,484
...with someone from my school, my
department, and my class year?

872
01:17:21,122 --> 01:17:22,776
I guess you don't think
of me at all anymore.

873
01:17:30,332 --> 01:17:33,082
I thought that there might be
a one percent chance it would be you.

874
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:40,302
But then I was told
his nickname was "Trash".

875
01:17:41,368 --> 01:17:44,846
"Ah, then, that one
percent chance is gone."

876
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,305
But then I thought about it again.

877
01:17:51,576 --> 01:17:54,278
I should bet on another
one percent chance.

878
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,625
That the word would reach your ears.

879
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,795
Same school, same department.
Same class year.

880
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,643
That the word would reach your ears.

881
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,214
When the word would reach your ears..

882
01:18:11,113 --> 01:18:13,202
Though it's just a one percent chance,

883
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:18,620
If you might still like me...

884
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:26,669
Maybe we can start over again.

885
01:18:29,058 --> 01:18:30,491
I came here with that hope.

886
01:18:38,985 --> 01:18:40,097
Sun Woo...

887
01:18:41,082 --> 01:18:42,622
I know this sounds crazy.

888
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,230
But I missed you.

889
01:19:21,912 --> 01:19:24,687
Hey, I really didn't get stood up.

890
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:27,084
Yeah, I know.

891
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,448
He was supposed to come, but he got
into a big accident on the way here.

892
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,300
I'm not cold.

893
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,989
I'm hot. Just wear it.

894
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:43,398
I really didn't get stood up.

895
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,050
Life is like a box of chocolates.

896
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,971
You never know what you're going to get.

897
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,590
Though you may pick the
bitterest chocolate,

898
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,826
there's nothing you can do about it.

899
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:26,677
That's the fate that I have chosen.

900
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,103
There are no regrets,

901
01:20:30,835 --> 01:20:32,403
...no whining...

902
01:20:33,939 --> 01:20:38,012
And there is no need for heartbreak.

903
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:58,742
Yeah...

904
01:20:59,758 --> 01:21:00,860
It's Lee Seung Hwan.

905
01:21:02,702 --> 01:21:05,282
They play some very old songs here.

906
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,480
I went to see a lot of
Lee Seung Hwan concerts.

907
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,620
I still listen to him often at home.

908
01:21:15,633 --> 01:21:19,938
But, aren't we doing
too many interviews?

909
01:21:21,283 --> 01:21:23,687
It's just that I feel a
little bad for my husband.

910
01:21:24,831 --> 01:21:28,263
It's OK, if you want to keep asking me.

911
01:21:28,812 --> 01:21:31,402
My husband usually
doesn't like interviews.

912
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:36,185
And unnie asked me to do this,
so I just agreed to do it.

913
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,182
I'm all right with it.

914
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:43,447
I'm working as a ground
crew now, so I have time.

915
01:21:44,893 --> 01:21:46,584
Hey, you're here.

916
01:21:49,485 --> 01:21:50,485
Say hello.

917
01:21:54,484 --> 01:21:55,964
Hey, you're here again.

918
01:21:58,341 --> 01:22:00,105
Please do a good job. Thank you.

919
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,910
You can head home first.

920
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,285
I won't bother you today.
You can go work.

921
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:21,176
It's not a bother. I like interviews.

922
01:22:21,683 --> 01:22:23,315
It's fine. You can go.

923
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:26,683
-I'll go now.
-OK.

924
01:22:26,878 --> 01:22:27,880
- Hey.
- Yeah?

925
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,880
- Hey.
- Yeah?

926
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:32,219
Honey, can you throw out
the garbage in the food waste bin?

927
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:34,597
I did that already.

928
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:36,760
I did that on the way
to the comic book store.

929
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:40,953
Hey... stop reading comic books.

930
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,027
You didn't borrow those
weird comics again, did you?

931
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,091
Stop reading comic books.
Think of your image.

932
01:22:51,164 --> 01:22:52,184
OK.

933
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:54,274
Thank you.

934
01:22:54,727 --> 01:22:55,727
Do a good job.

935
01:23:17,055 --> 01:23:20,481
What are you doing?
This is scary!

936
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:22,578
Taek's sleeping and you're sleeping.

937
01:23:23,259 --> 01:23:24,795
Do you guys just come here to sleep?

938
01:23:26,384 --> 01:23:29,586
Oppa, why do you bother coming home
if you're just going to sleep?

939
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,554
It's because I'm really tired.

940
01:23:32,565 --> 01:23:34,835
I sleep best when I'm at home.

941
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:37,573
I'm going to sleep a little more.

942
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:41,282
When can I sleep in, if not now?

943
01:23:56,545 --> 01:24:00,739
Mom, I'm hungry! Give me food!

944
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,631
I think I'm hungry!

945
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,960
Hey!

946
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,640
You scared me.

947
01:24:15,376 --> 01:24:16,532
What are you doing there?

948
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:19,018
Your breakfast is ready.
You can eat it now.

949
01:24:19,702 --> 01:24:21,815
Then you could just wake me up!

950
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:24,760
We didn't wake you on purpose,
so that you could sleep in.

951
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:30,650
Still, why are you standing there,
when you could've just woken me up?

952
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,932
-I'll be right out.
-Come right out.

953
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:41,201
I made your favorite, cutlass fish.

954
01:24:58,824 --> 01:25:01,191
Hey, you surprised me!

955
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,589
When did you get in?

956
01:25:04,671 --> 01:25:06,610
How about you? When did you get in?

957
01:25:06,983 --> 01:25:08,083
You?

958
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:11,235
Maybe my body needs a good warm up.

959
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,960
What's with you?
We're both aging together.

960
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:19,711
Look at how you talk to me.
Do you want to die?

961
01:25:20,205 --> 01:25:21,482
Why are you hitting me?

962
01:25:21,889 --> 01:25:24,190
Why do you think?
Because you did something wrong.

963
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,110
Why are you hitting me
so early in the morning?

964
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,562
You speak so rudely to your older sister.
Am I your friend?

965
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,835
I'm your older sister, OK?

966
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:35,690
Hey, what are you two doing?
You're all grown up now!

967
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,040
Hurry up and eat!

968
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:43,461
Well, now it feels like there are
people living in this house.

969
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:48,797
I feel like Deok Sun noona acts like
that because she wants to get hit.

970
01:25:49,529 --> 01:25:50,912
She just asks to be beaten.

971
01:25:52,588 --> 01:25:55,773
Why is Bo Ra's voice like that?

972
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,515
I think her voice sounds very weak.

973
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:02,289
Her screaming sounds weaker than before.

974
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:07,619
Thats... her health must not
be what it used to be.

975
01:26:07,786 --> 01:26:11,297
If she were any healthier,
she'd wrap up her sister and eat her.

976
01:26:13,655 --> 01:26:15,445
Dad, your nose is bleeding.

977
01:26:17,058 --> 01:26:19,972
Hey, dear! Your nose. Here.

978
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:21,882
Hey...

979
01:26:23,972 --> 01:26:25,072
Put your head back.

980
01:26:25,256 --> 01:26:27,316
I must have picked my nose too much.

981
01:26:29,278 --> 01:26:32,097
Hurry up and eat your breakfast!
I'm fine, I'm fine.

982
01:26:39,488 --> 01:26:40,688
Is Jung Hwan already heading down?

983
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:45,247
Yes, training is over. He's going back
to Sacheon tomorrow morning.

984
01:26:45,725 --> 01:26:48,519
We're all going to have drinks tonight.

985
01:26:48,841 --> 01:26:49,958
Will you be able to come?

986
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,460
I have a match,
but I think it'll end early.

987
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:54,031
I think I can go.

988
01:26:54,927 --> 01:26:58,031
Why do you have so many matches?
You should do less!

989
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:01,392
-OK.
-That was great.

990
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:05,523
And if you only plan to sleep at home,
then don't bother coming at all!

991
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:08,030
Hey now...

992
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:09,519
You think you're the
only one that studies?

993
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:12,084
Why don't you eat,
and go back to sleep? OK?

994
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,397
Don't you laugh.

995
01:27:15,623 --> 01:27:18,220
And don't you dare think of
dating Shim So Young.

996
01:27:18,665 --> 01:27:20,221
OK. Don't worry.

997
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,073
Hey, how did she become
this good at talking?

998
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:25,296
I heard that elementary school
kids were the scariest.

999
01:27:26,092 --> 01:27:27,211
More soup, please.

1000
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:30,531
Of course, that's my favorite
thing to hear.

1001
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,817
Sun Woo, let's play catch ball later.
You need to exercise.

1002
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,734
No, I don't want to.
Maybe if you threw softly.

1003
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:42,268
Never.

1004
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:45,572
You have to exercise.
You need to be fit to study.

1005
01:27:46,077 --> 01:27:47,526
It's fine. It's OK.

1006
01:27:47,655 --> 01:27:50,586
-I want to sleep.
-Oppa!

1007
01:27:51,915 --> 01:27:54,949
All right, all right. I'll do it.

1008
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:12,341
Turn down the volume!

1009
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:15,168
Before I kick you out
in your underwear...

1010
01:28:16,117 --> 01:28:18,997
Such a harsh thing to say.

1011
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,339
Honey, the anniversary of your
mother's death is coming up.

1012
01:28:27,443 --> 01:28:30,248
You had such deep intentions.

1013
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,269
We still have two or
three weeks, don't we?

1014
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:38,636
We can prepare slowly.
My mom doesn't need a lot.

1015
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,520
October.

1016
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,059
I'm heading out to meet the gang.

1017
01:29:28,427 --> 01:29:31,386
I'm meeting the guys.
I'll be back soon.

1018
01:29:38,133 --> 01:29:39,179
Let's go together in my car.

1019
01:29:40,348 --> 01:29:41,363
OK, let's go.

1020
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,008
Hey, put on your seat belt.

1021
01:29:59,568 --> 01:30:00,568
Right.

1022
01:30:05,168 --> 01:30:08,148
Jung Pal, you're going to drink.
Should you be taking your car?

1023
01:30:08,244 --> 01:30:10,940
-You can drive it back.
-Hey...

1024
01:30:15,851 --> 01:30:18,206
-Turn on some music.
-Should I?

1025
01:30:21,668 --> 01:30:23,168
You only have Lee Moon Se.

1026
01:30:23,412 --> 01:30:25,566
Right. Just turn on whatever I have.

1027
01:30:40,712 --> 01:30:44,078
I love Moon Se orabeonim's songs.

1028
01:30:44,714 --> 01:30:45,962
Even now, I like them.

1029
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:50,069
Why do you waste energy on making
such an obvious statement?

1030
01:30:51,468 --> 01:30:53,342
Can't you talk more nicely?

1031
01:30:55,873 --> 01:30:56,873
OK.

1032
01:30:59,105 --> 01:31:00,964
Which album was this again?
Was it his third?

1033
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,267
It was his fourth album, you dummy!
It was 1987.

1034
01:31:04,253 --> 01:31:06,705
A person can forget!
Who are you calling dumb?

1035
01:31:06,724 --> 01:31:09,624
How can you fly around
with such bad memory?

1036
01:31:10,408 --> 01:31:12,054
What kind of nonsense is that?

1037
01:31:12,448 --> 01:31:14,921
As someone who also flies, I feel ashamed.

1038
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:16,102
Ashamed?

1039
01:31:16,113 --> 01:31:17,303
It's shameful.

1040
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:20,640
-OK, salute!
-Salute!

1041
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,703
Who says salute instead of cheers?

1042
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:30,094
Anyway, Second Lieutenant Kim,

1043
01:31:30,263 --> 01:31:31,838
when will you be back,
once you leave this time?

1044
01:31:32,608 --> 01:31:33,608
I'm not immigrating.

1045
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:35,228
You should come back every two weeks.

1046
01:31:36,002 --> 01:31:37,162
It gets exhausting.

1047
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:39,946
You can come on your fighter jet.
You'll get here really fast.

1048
01:31:43,034 --> 01:31:46,517
Deok Sun, I really like how
you never change.

1049
01:31:47,061 --> 01:31:48,447
It was a joke. A joke.

1050
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:52,516
What about Taek? Is he coming?

1051
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:56,345
Yeah, he is coming. I called the
Baduk Club and he had left already.

1052
01:31:57,162 --> 01:31:58,178
He should be here soon.

1053
01:31:58,428 --> 01:32:00,174
Do you think he got lost again?

1054
01:32:00,538 --> 01:32:03,504
How can someone who plays
baduk get lost on the road?

1055
01:32:05,808 --> 01:32:09,303
I don't understand how someone
who plays baduk can get lost.

1056
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:15,794
Jung Pal, did you bring the ring?

1057
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,084
What ring? Do you mean the fiancée ring?

1058
01:32:21,873 --> 01:32:23,142
What's the fiancée ring?

1059
01:32:23,325 --> 01:32:25,126
It's a graduation ring for
the fiancée ring.

1060
01:32:25,438 --> 01:32:27,025
He still has that thing.

1061
01:32:28,098 --> 01:32:29,228
I brought it.

1062
01:32:30,308 --> 01:32:31,394
You're giving it to me, right?

1063
01:32:31,949 --> 01:32:33,179
I'm thinking about it.

1064
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,394
I suddenly thought it'd be
a waste to give it to you.

1065
01:32:35,808 --> 01:32:38,477
Then who would you give it to?

1066
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:42,712
You're going to die before
you propose to anyone.

1067
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,247
Our Jung Pal isn't very romantic.

1068
01:32:48,948 --> 01:32:50,150
Whatever, you idiot.

1069
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:54,090
Hey, it's my wish to see you confess
your feelings to someone before I die.

1070
01:32:54,657 --> 01:32:57,736
Are you going to live alone forever?
You're so frustrating...

1071
01:33:00,637 --> 01:33:01,685
Deok Sun.

1072
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,268
I was going to give it to you
when I graduated this year.

1073
01:33:22,678 --> 01:33:23,748
I'm only giving it to you now.

1074
01:33:34,971 --> 01:33:36,069
I like you.

1075
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:45,859
I said, I like you.

1076
01:33:53,682 --> 01:33:57,013
Hey... do you know what
I've done because of you?

1077
01:34:00,309 --> 01:34:04,559
I waited over an hour by our front door
every day to go to school with you.

1078
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,401
Until you came home
from the study rooms...

1079
01:34:09,834 --> 01:34:11,591
I was so worried that I couldn't
get a wink of sleep.

1080
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:14,791
"Why is she so late?"

1081
01:34:16,771 --> 01:34:17,922
"Did she fall asleep again?"

1082
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:19,918
Hey.

1083
01:34:21,013 --> 01:34:23,491
My mind was only on you. You.

1084
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:30,937
He must be serious.

1085
01:34:31,823 --> 01:34:33,042
Just stay put.

1086
01:34:35,563 --> 01:34:37,382
When we ran into each other
accidentally on the bus,

1087
01:34:38,628 --> 01:34:40,138
and when we went to the
concert together...

1088
01:34:40,198 --> 01:34:41,518
Also, on my birthday...

1089
01:34:41,972 --> 01:34:43,750
...when I got the shirt as a
present from you

1090
01:34:44,628 --> 01:34:45,778
I was really...

1091
01:34:49,282 --> 01:34:51,322
...so happy that I thought I
was going to go crazy.

1092
01:34:55,608 --> 01:34:57,008
This punk must be for real.

1093
01:34:59,943 --> 01:35:02,040
I wanted to see you more
than a dozen times a day.

1094
01:35:05,139 --> 01:35:06,576
I was happy just to see you.

1095
01:35:13,767 --> 01:35:15,666
I wanted to say this
since a long time ago.

1096
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:21,520
I really like you.

1097
01:35:26,003 --> 01:35:27,051
I love you.

1098
01:35:43,778 --> 01:35:45,022
Are you satisfied, you idiot?

1099
01:35:47,628 --> 01:35:48,796
About what?

1100
01:35:49,138 --> 01:35:50,623
You said that this was your wish.

1101
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:52,578
What wish...

1102
01:35:55,878 --> 01:35:58,638
Man you startled me!

1103
01:35:58,649 --> 01:36:01,139
I thought that was real, you crazy punk!

1104
01:36:01,178 --> 01:36:03,778
What the heck was that?

1105
01:36:03,813 --> 01:36:05,924
Hey, you fell for it too, right?

1106
01:36:07,934 --> 01:36:09,844
He's a total player.

1107
01:36:09,862 --> 01:36:12,109
You completely fooled me.

1108
01:36:12,868 --> 01:36:14,498
My gosh.

1109
01:36:15,071 --> 01:36:17,724
Jung Pal, I'm shaking.
I think I've fallen for you.

1110
01:36:19,218 --> 01:36:20,495
Let's date. I love you.

1111
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:23,524
I waited for you at the bus stop
and in the study rooms.

1112
01:36:23,535 --> 01:36:25,095
Crazy jerk, go away!

1113
01:36:25,787 --> 01:36:28,322
I was really totally fooled by you.

1114
01:36:28,647 --> 01:36:31,286
Hey, Deok Sun. Give me the menu.
Jung Pal's paying today.

1115
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,843
What was that?

1116
01:36:34,932 --> 01:36:37,537
Look at my hands shaking.
I'm the one shaking here.

1117
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:43,703
Really, what...

1118
01:36:44,395 --> 01:36:47,699
What is this between friends?
I was so flabbergasted.

1119
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:51,339
Really... I love you.

1120
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:53,102
Can I get one more of this?

1121
01:36:58,434 --> 01:37:01,293
Are you a ghost?

1122
01:37:01,722 --> 01:37:03,740
What? Haven't you seen
someone in a hanbok before?

1123
01:37:04,209 --> 01:37:06,118
You sure do all sorts of things.

1124
01:37:07,942 --> 01:37:10,636
I changed into a hanbok. What do
you think? Isn't this better?

1125
01:37:11,384 --> 01:37:13,426
Don't do anything. That would be best.

1126
01:37:28,688 --> 01:37:29,998
What the heck...

1127
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:34,974
What is that? It switched to hanbok now?

1128
01:37:35,395 --> 01:37:37,748
-Yeah, aren't I pretty?
-No, you're not.

1129
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,480
Jung Pal... what are you doing?

1130
01:37:51,426 --> 01:37:52,776
You should knock, punk.

1131
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:18,557
Go home early.

1132
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,626
My mom says to let her
know if you need more!

1133
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:53,330
-Hey, No Eul.
-Yeah?

1134
01:38:59,402 --> 01:39:01,230
-Is your younger noona at home?
-Yeah.

1135
01:39:01,745 --> 01:39:03,374
-She's inside?
-Yeah.

1136
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:07,870
OK... here.

1137
01:39:09,648 --> 01:39:10,738
Give that to her.

1138
01:39:13,719 --> 01:39:15,959
-What is it?
-A present.

1139
01:39:19,129 --> 01:39:21,139
It's a present. Isn't that obvious?

1140
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,713
A Christmas present.

1141
01:39:26,847 --> 01:39:27,847
What?

1142
01:39:28,237 --> 01:39:31,428
Give the Christmas
present to your sister! Go.

1143
01:39:33,577 --> 01:39:35,528
Just go and give it to her.

1144
01:39:36,943 --> 01:39:38,478
Go! Why are you standing there?

1145
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:41,375
Your mom's calling. Go!

1146
01:39:46,978 --> 01:39:47,978
Are you crazy?

1147
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,938
I said give her the present.
Get over here!

1148
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,860
I'll give it to her. Bring it here.

1149
01:39:54,767 --> 01:40:00,409
You know, back then, I didn't know that
the cube was in Jung Bong hyung's pocket.

1150
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,695
What? You crazy punk.

1151
01:40:04,737 --> 01:40:07,025
The atmosphere isn't good. You know?

1152
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:15,129
-Yeah, I know.
-You know what mom did?

1153
01:40:15,268 --> 01:40:16,709
It was a week ago.

1154
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:20,168
Yeah, and I carried him on my back.

1155
01:40:22,398 --> 01:40:25,241
Sun Woo, page Taek and tell
him to come to round two.

1156
01:40:25,463 --> 01:40:27,101
OK. Thanks for paying, Jung Pal.

1157
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:31,898
That punk is truly a player.

1158
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,758
Everyone would fall for him.
