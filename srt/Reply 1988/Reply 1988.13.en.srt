1
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,636
Hey, Kim Jung Pal.
You should have bought a poster too.

2
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,240
It's fine. It's enough to have
listened with my own ears.

3
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:43,054
Hurry up! It's a long walk
to the bus station.

4
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:44,750
I'm coming!

5
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,647
Deok Sun!

6
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,439
Oh my... Ho Young! It's been so long!

7
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,623
I know. Hey, why did you get so pretty?

8
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,696
Hey... that's not true!
What are you saying?

9
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:07,798
I tried to get in touch with you a few
times after we graduated middle school.

10
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,132
I know.

11
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:13,916
Your home phone number
hasn't changed, right?

12
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:15,240
Is it ok if I call you?

13
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,133
Hey, Ho Young, what are you doing?

14
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:24,481
Yeah. Coming!

15
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:27,934
-Deok Sun, I'll be going then, ok?
-Ok. Bye!

16
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:29,803
-I'll call you!
-Ok!

17
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,492
Hey, you know him, right?

18
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,734
No.

19
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:43,336
If you attended Banghak Middle School
and didn't know him, you were a spy.

20
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,580
He totally had the hots for me!

21
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:48,175
And he wrote me tons of love letters!

22
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:52,258
I was incredibly pretty, after all...

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,876
Then who's the person I knew
back in middle school? A ghost?

24
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,221
Who do you think you're lying to?

25
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:02,222
Stop spouting nonsense and stay here.
I have to use the bathroom.

26
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:13,381
Who was that chick?

27
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,761
My first love. Isn't she pretty?

28
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,796
Well, she isn't what I'd call pretty...

29
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,387
She's not exactly pretty,
but she's so cute, right?

30
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,659
I was crazy about her
back in middle school.

31
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:28,558
She's as cute as ever.

32
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,835
You sure have strange taste in women!

33
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,396
-Darn it!
-I'm sorry.

34
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:39,595
Darn it! Geez!

35
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,997
That jerk must be out of his mind!

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,860
Darn it!

37
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:48,889
Geez.

38
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,543
How do you not have a gram
of caution in you?

39
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,829
Where is there even a spot where you
could sprain your ankle around here?

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,619
Where? Huh? Show me!

41
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:04,153
Geez, you couldn't
even sit still for a second.

42
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,202
Hey. You think I sprained my ankle
because I wanted to?

43
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:09,688
It happened on my way to the bathroom!

44
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:17,581
Ow,Jung Pal, I don't think I can
even take a single step, what do I do?

45
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:22,407
Seriously...

46
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:42,834
Hey, hey, hey.

47
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,848
-Be careful!
-Ok!

48
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:49,276
You have to put more pressure
on this side! What are you even.

49
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,587
Ok.

50
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:57,404
You're killing me here. Seriously.

51
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,698
What are you laughing about?
You did nothing right.

52
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,254
Fine.

53
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:08,008
You have to put pressure here.
Are you stupid?

54
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,600
-Like this?
-Yeah!

55
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,648
Ok.

56
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,385
-Are you enjoying this?
-No.

57
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:23,608
It's really late, right?
Shouldn't we call home?

58
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,092
Yeah. I'll go make a call.

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,543
Ok. Hurry back.

60
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:36,218
Juicy fresh!
Fresh mint!

61
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,635
You're not going to sleep, Noona?

62
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:11,722
I'm a senior now. I'm going to study.

63
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:14,238
Then turn the TV off.

64
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,736
No Eul. Who's prettier,
Me or Chae Si Ra?

65
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:22,343
Noona. Who's more handsome,
Me or Tom Cruise?

66
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:26,728
To me, it's you!

67
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:27,779
To me, it's Chae Si Ra!

68
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,114
Jin Joo, want to sleep
in my room tonight?

69
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,450
No, she can't, sir. Jin Joo
is reading a book right now.

70
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,449
What book? She can't even read.

71
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:15,267
Jin Joo. I'll read that for you.
Let's sleep in my room.

72
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,871
So you're going with your older brother?

73
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:22,777
Good night, Mom.

74
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,844
Hmmph!
Hmmphity-hmmph!

75
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:31,908
Episode 13: Superman Returns

76
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:42,205
February, 1989
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong

77
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:49,021
Teacher, I mean, Father.
It's 7:20 a.m...

78
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,731
...time for Scholarly Quiz.

79
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,523
I will be going back inside now.

80
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:56,727
All right. Scholarly Quiz
is a great TV program.

81
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,322
Every student should watch it.

82
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,235
-Proceed to enter the house!
-Yes, sir!

83
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,924
Deok Sun.

84
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,043
-Soo Yeon.
-Soo Yeon.

85
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,923
All right, already.
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon.

86
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,697
I have a wish, you see...

87
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,408
What is it, Dad? Tell me.
I'll grant any wish you have.

88
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:25,732
You competing on that show,
Scholarly Quiz.

89
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:33,778
I don't even expect you to win
first place on the show.

90
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,838
I don't care if you get
everything wrong...

91
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,336
...but I just want to
see you on the show.

92
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:41,248
Sorry, Dad.

93
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:42,691
Why's that, my child?

94
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:45,098
I don't think I'll be able to
grant you that wish.

95
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,243
Yeah, I thought as much.

96
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,068
Your honesty is very good!

97
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:52,128
Bo Ra. Don't be like that
and help Soo Yeon study.

98
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,219
She's a senior now.

99
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,597
No! I'm going to study
inside the room from now on.

100
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,884
So, you go to the library to study.

101
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,758
There's construction going on
at the library today.

102
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:01,278
Why don't you go to
Taek's place to study?

103
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,282
Taek is busy! I can't disturb him.

104
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:09,179
That's right. Next week is the finals
of the Fujitsu Tournament, right?

105
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,223
-Yeah.
-Wow.

106
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:14,468
If our Taek wins this, he'll have
achieved the Grand Slam, right?

107
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:19,337
So don't bother him, or disturb him,
or even go anywhere near him.

108
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:21,594
I know it better than you do.
So don't worry.

109
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,573
Wait a minute.
There's something else, right?

110
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,858
Sun Woo! Bring this over to Taek's.

111
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:31,896
What is it?

112
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,516
Oh, I'ved seasoned some seaweed.

113
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,228
I heard it's good for
high blood pressure.

114
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,254
Bring it to Taek's dad.

115
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,479
Ok. I will.

116
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:45,762
Mister!

117
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,056
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:50,906
Studying.

119
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:52,810
This house is the quietest place
in this neighborhood.

120
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,637
What about you, being here
so early in the morning?

121
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,478
-Oh.
-You're here, Sun Woo?

122
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,138
Oh,yes.
My mom wanted you to have this.

123
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:05,496
Oh. Thanks.
Sun Woo, about your plumbing...

124
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,218
Our plumbing?
At our house?

125
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:12,264
Yeah. Tell your mom to just leave it.
I'll go over there later and fix it.

126
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,266
Ok. I understand.

127
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,926
Soo Yeon, you haven't had
breakfast yet, right?

128
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:20,471
I did, but I can eat again.

129
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:24,976
Oh, don't go to Taek's room.
Entry is forbidden until Saturday.

130
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,884
Oh, I know.
Fujitsu finals. Bye.

131
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,278
Goodbye, mister.

132
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,348
Ok.

133
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:32,928
Thank you for the meal!

134
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,904
Mister.
Did Taek eat dinner last night?

135
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:43,663
No. He won't eat
breakfast today either.

136
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:46,819
Can you go get him?

137
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:51,152
I don't think I can provoke him
during competition time either.

138
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,919
I feel like, if I did,
he'd keel over and die.

139
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,314
-Taek!
-Be quiet!

140
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,336
Not this week.
Go play somewhere else.

141
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,377
Why, does he have
a competition coming up?

142
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:10,538
Futsuji.

143
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,051
It's Fujitsu.

144
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:16,633
Ah. Hurry up and piss off already.

145
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,676
Soo Yeon.
I'll just quietly play Blue Marble.

146
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:24,061
I'll be really, really quiet.
And the dean's at home.

147
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:27,151
It's just all around complicated.
So,just don't tell me to go home.

148
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:31,453
-Then, I'll be going--
-You can't. No matter what.

149
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,572
I can trust you, but not your
blabbering mouth. Piss off.

150
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,766
Fine. I'll go home. I'm going home!

151
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:38,917
Home!

152
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:42,699
Fine, fine. What a cruel world
we live in, seriously.

153
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,909
I'll play Blue Marble with the dean!
With the dean!

154
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,781
Yeah. Come in.

155
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:03,980
How did you know it was me?

156
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,470
My dad usually calls me and you knock.

157
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:09,732
Oh.

158
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,851
Come out. Let's eat breakfast.

159
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,346
It's ok. I'll just have coffee.

160
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,110
What about lunch?

161
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:24,708
What about dinner?

162
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,910
Should our Taek at least eat
breakfast then, or not?

163
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:34,547
I should eat.

164
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,609
Right? What a good boy. Let's go.

165
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,474
If you eat breakfast, I won't
bother you about lunch or dinner.

166
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:48,398
Ok. Thanks.

167
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:54,534
Geez...

168
00:11:54,597 --> 00:12:00,724
I've never even taken my kids
to Nature's Farm.

169
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,608
Geez.

170
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,755
What the hell are you doing?

171
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:16,524
I'm Sung Dong Il, of the Hanil Bank
Fraud Department!

172
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:20,878
Want to try on some "silver bracelets"
with these shenanigans you're pulling?

173
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:28,419
Just let me go this once, please?

174
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:32,295
Hey this person. There's no such thing
as cheating in Baduk.

175
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,787
Don't you even feel sorry to Taek?

176
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,337
Baduk is a game that is to be played
with the utmost fairness.

177
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,908
Speaking of which, it's so quiet on
Sunday. Did everyone go somewhere?

178
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,428
The kids' mom is chatting out front
about the pollock bought yesterday.

179
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,534
And Jung Hwan is
studying in his room...

180
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:56,832
Oh, speaking of which,
Jung Bong hasn't left his desk today.

181
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:02,322
Bo Ra's dad. I guess my eldest son
is finally coming to his senses!

182
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:31,603
Luck will befall anyone
who has received this letter.

183
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:36,364
It may be difficult,
but consider this a great opportunity.

184
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:39,326
I wish you seven years of good luck.

185
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,645
Sung Soo Yeon

186
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,407
-Wow, look at those!
-They look great!

187
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,804
-So fresh!
-They look amazing!

188
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,100
No, no! You should have more
for yourself!

189
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,568
You don't need to be
giving us all of these...

190
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:55,423
It's not like the pollock
even cost that much.

191
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,755
Make a soup of them to have tonight.

192
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,238
Ok!

193
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,708
It'd be so great to have this
with a bit of soju.

194
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:03,210
That would be great!

195
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:06,361
You don't need to
say that again, for sure!

196
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:08,403
Shall we all have a drink later?

197
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:09,915
The kids are home today.

198
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,896
How about tomorrow,
after the kids are at school?

199
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,246
Sure.

200
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,789
-I don't need any more!
-Wow, they look delicious!

201
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,789
The men are so quiet.

202
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:21,656
Do you think they're drinking,
by any chance?

203
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:31,361
Just one sip.
Bo Ra's dad! Let's just have one sip!

204
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,962
I told you, let's just have soju!

205
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:38,306
Let's try a bit of
your wild ginseng liquor!

206
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,708
It'll go to waste
if you don't drink it!

207
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,217
Spouting some kind of
"Deok Sun winning...

208
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:43,407
...first place at Scholarly Quiz"
type of nonsense.

209
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,386
That wild ginseng liquor
is as precious as my own life!

210
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:52,435
I made it so that I can have it
on Bo Ra's wedding day!

211
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,476
Just a sip. Please?

212
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,867
Oh my, look at that.

213
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:03,210
Just what kind of
world are we living in?

214
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,188
How is it that robbers are breaking
into houses in broad daylight?

215
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:08,533
Geez... really.

216
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,147
It's a thief!

217
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,517
-Thieves just break in, like that!
-It's a thief!

218
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,187
It's a thief!

219
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:21,872
-Omo!
-What do we do? Thief!

220
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:25,537
Thief? Where? Where?

221
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,254
-Over there!
-Where?

222
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,381
He's gone!

223
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,426
Honey, are you ok?

224
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,305
Oh, I'm fine.
I can't believe it, a thief!

225
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,777
-Where? Where? Where?
-Hey!

226
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,482
Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief!

227
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,518
-Oh my God!
-Thief!

228
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,297
Where? Where?
Did you catch him, Dad?

229
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,425
Huh?
Where?

230
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,750
I don't know.
I think they got away.

231
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,848
Wasn't that the voice of the man
who owns the ice store?

232
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,678
What's this,
a thief in broad daylight?

233
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:00,762
He ran away via the roof!
I saw his backside!

234
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,271
-Really? -Yes! He looked
like he was flying away!

235
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,300
This jerk,
just wait until I catch him.

236
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,625
But, um, nobody is hurt, right?

237
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:10,977
-Yes.
-Yes.

238
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,298
Who's missing? Huh?

239
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,655
Um, Section Chief Jo.

240
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,421
Your mother is at a seminar, boy!

241
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:20,155
Oh! Where's Bonghwangdang
father and son? Where are those two?

242
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:21,611
Taek is practicing Baduk.

243
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,868
I bet he doesn't even care
about this whole thing.

244
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,321
All right, that's that for him, then.

245
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:26,761
What about Taek's dad? His father?

246
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,439
Sun Woo's mom,
your plumbing is all fixed now.

247
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:36,669
Taek's dad! There's a thief
on the loose in our neighborhood!

248
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,761
Yeah. I know. I heard.

249
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,881
But, why are you all outside?
It's so cold today.

250
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:51,958
Wow. I bet he'd be that calm
even if a crazy hog were chasing him.

251
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,330
He's like a bear.

252
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:57,863
Should I pour some hot water on him,
to see if he reacts to it?

253
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:00,516
Don't bother!
It's just a waste of water.

254
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,650
Let me know if
anything else needs fixing.

255
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:05,201
I'll do it for you. Well, then.

256
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,817
-Mother, I'll be going inside now.
-Ok.

257
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,696
I'll be going inside too.

258
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,720
Wow. He's no human.

259
00:18:54,067 --> 00:19:00,436
Next time, I'll try having a dog
on the loose behind Bonghwangdang.

260
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,481
He's human after all, so he should
be a bit scared of that, right?

261
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:09,545
Geez, they're all in such a rush.

262
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,921
Are they the wind within the mist?
Come on baby.

263
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:32,565
Jin Joo. Jin Joo.

264
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,149
Go to Jung Bong oppa. It's time
for him to be having ramen.

265
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:38,251
-Ramen?
-Yeah!

266
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:50,518
Sun Woo.

267
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:52,544
What is it?

268
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:54,854
So seriously, how is it?

269
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,565
Huh? What is?

270
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,718
You know, Taek's dad.

271
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:02,814
You really haven't thought about
getting hitched?

272
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:04,051
What?

273
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:09,597
Yeah. I wish you two
would get together already.

274
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,713
Geez, why are you two
acting like this, again?

275
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:15,487
Stop saying such nonsense!

276
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:19,419
How is it nonsense? Both of your kids
are pretty much all grown.

277
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:22,153
It'd be great if you could spend the
rest of your lives with each other.

278
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:25,797
Yeah, it's not like
you two are strangers, either.

279
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,961
And you two have both
been through a lot.

280
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:31,218
Wouldn't it be great if you two
depended on each other?

281
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:34,595
I think that he does have
some feelings toward you.

282
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:37,748
Geez, you two must
be out of your minds.

283
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,514
I already feel
uncomfortable as it is...

284
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:43,205
...because I'm afraid the
neighbors will see it that way.

285
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:44,732
What for?

286
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,928
Yeah! Why trouble yourself
over something like that?

287
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:50,527
Geez, you two have
no idea what it's like.

288
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:58,045
I was afraid of this, which is why
I purposely avoided him before.

289
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:00,527
Because I was afraid that people
would misunderstand, like this.

290
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:04,481
This time around, I took care of him
a bit because he was ill...

291
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,272
...but look at what's happened.
People are talking again.

292
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:12,432
We really don't have
that type of relationship.

293
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:18,097
Don't just dismiss it like that
and just give it some thought.

294
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,100
Taek's dad is a great guy.

295
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,040
Geez, just before, you were saying
that he's like a bear!

296
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:27,850
He is, but he's a rich bear.

297
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,379
And he's good to you.

298
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:37,707
Yeah, Sun Young. Jin Joo will
start attending school soon too.

299
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,366
Wouldn't it be better for you
to raise her with someone else?

300
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,612
Geez, never mind that!

301
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:49,358
Sheesh. I don't want to hurt Sun Woo.

302
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:55,955
I will never ever remarry,
even if for Sun Woo's sake.

303
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:01,572
Also, of course Taek's dad
is a great person.

304
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:07,652
Even back in Gimhae, he was well-known
for being a good and kind person.

305
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:12,240
That's why I want to do at least
one more good thing for him.

306
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:15,381
If you two keep talking like this...

307
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:17,976
...I won't ever set foot
in their house again!

308
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,717
All right, already! Geez.

309
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,665
But even so, I'm a bit disappointed.

310
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:34,596
But Sun Young.
What about your own life?

311
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,111
I mean, your kids are important, yes.

312
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:48,742
You can ignore me,
saying that I'm just blabbing on...

313
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:51,954
...because I don't
understand your situation...

314
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,522
...but you only live once, too.
Ok?

315
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:00,551
Isn't that right?

316
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:09,140
You should live happily just once too.
Isn't that right?

317
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:13,752
I'm just saying this because
it's such a waste of your young age.

318
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:15,927
You're too young.

319
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:26,127
You're too young to pour everything
you have into your kids alone.

320
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:27,453
And a waste of your youth.

321
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:38,795
Geez, that's enough.

322
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,686
My kids being happy...

323
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:47,765
Wow, these garlic are stinging
my eyes like crazy!

324
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:51,252
...is my happiness.

325
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,631
That's enough for me.

326
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,861
That's enough.

327
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,556
Sheesh.

328
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:01,724
Sun Young.

329
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:05,457
The bear's here.

330
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:07,633
Oh, you're here, oppa?

331
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:08,722
Oh, you're all here.

332
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:09,812
-Yes.
-Yes.

333
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,398
Would you like some garlic?

334
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:15,201
Sun Woo's mom, you're coming with me
to the hospital tomorrow, right?

335
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:21,200
Yes, of course!
Of course I should come!

336
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:26,862
Um, it's Taek's dad's first checkup
since he was discharged...

337
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:30,983
...and he needs to get a prescription,
and get a lot of exams!

338
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:35,582
And it said on the notice that
someone has to come with him.

339
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:40,607
And I decided to come as this
neighborhood's representative right?

340
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,499
I mean, of course
I should be the one to go!

341
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,329
I'm the youngest of us all, after all!

342
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,646
As the oldest, you want to go instead?

343
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:55,552
-I don't think he'd like that.
-Oh, well, I should go, then.

344
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:56,812
Do you hate mister?

345
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,065
No, I like him. I like him, but...

346
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:02,872
...I don't like him being
too close to my mom.

347
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,617
Hey. Everyone is about that close
in our neighborhood!

348
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:08,612
It's not like it's just
the two of them.

349
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:11,744
Even so, I don't like it.

350
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:16,061
Don't concern yourself too much about it.

351
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,771
It's not like he said that he wants
to marry your mom right away.

352
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:25,377
Also,I thought it was nice to see the
two of them depending on each other.

353
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,329
Well, figures. Yeah. I can see
where you're coming from.

354
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:34,272
I understand how you feel.
I think I'd feel the same way.

355
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,012
What?

356
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,097
At times like these,
you really seem like an adult.

357
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:42,993
You have a death wish?

358
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:44,666
I'm not even scared
of your threats anymore.

359
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:49,577
Want to see each other
for a bit tomorrow?

360
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:51,835
I'll go to the front of your school
around dinnertime.

361
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,161
You just used informal speech
with me, punk?

362
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:55,952
Everyone else does it!

363
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,291
You can't, no matter what!

364
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:02,626
I'll meet you in front of the train
station in front of my school.

365
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,788
Yes, noonim.
=Noonim is the formal version of noona=

366
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:08,536
Are you mad at me?

367
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,687
Yes.

368
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:13,614
You sure have a lot of things
to get mad about.

369
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:16,917
When other people's boyfriends
get mad...

370
00:26:16,928 --> 00:26:22,600
...the girlfriend tries to make them
feel better and kisses them... ow!

371
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:24,739
Ow, noona!

372
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:31,527
You're going to the hospital tomorrow,
right, Bo Ra's mom? What time?

373
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,915
Early tomorrow morning.

374
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:36,172
Why? Are you sick?

375
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:40,244
No. Bo Ra's dad's bank is
giving them a free physical.

376
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:44,229
Wow, what a great workplace!
They do that for you?

377
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:45,488
Not really.

378
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:49,589
What's so great about a workplace
that pays so little?

379
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,230
We only got it because he's
been working for them for 25 years.

380
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:55,892
He worked so hard for 25 years
and they merely give him that.

381
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,707
But it's still nice that
he has a decent job.

382
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,149
It's your first time getting
a full physical, right?

383
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:02,816
Yes. It's my first time.

384
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,207
But,what if there's something
that turns out to be bad?

385
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:09,330
Geez, why are you worrying
about such useless things?

386
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:13,352
To tell you the truth...

387
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:19,514
...I think I have a lump
under my left breast.

388
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,281
Since when?

389
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:23,554
It's been a while.

390
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:28,912
What if it's cancer?

391
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,240
-Stop saying such useless things!
-Missus!

392
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:34,136
Your words will sprout into reality!
Stop saying such things!

393
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,596
There's tons of people
who have lumpiness in their breasts.

394
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:42,814
It's probably just cyst. Don't worry.

395
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:48,106
But, are you going
to the hospital alone tomorrow?

396
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,903
Even the bear living next door
is going with his girlfriend.

397
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,675
Geez, really!

398
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:55,603
Sorry. It was a joke.

399
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:58,737
Don't you dare say that
where Sun Woo will hear.

400
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:01,723
-He'll pass out in shock.
-I won't, I won't!

401
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,613
If it's scary to go to the
hospital alone, I'll go with you.

402
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:09,669
It's ok. Bo Ra's dad is taking
the day off to come with me tomorrow.

403
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:11,087
I'm such a scaredy-cat, you see.

404
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:12,801
That's good.

405
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,973
Despite everything, it feels nice
to have your husband...

406
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,203
...by your side at
times like these.

407
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:19,176
Even if you feel like wanting to kill
them sometimes.

408
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:35,134
Geez, you, go to sleep already.

409
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:39,411
It'll be hard on you to get
all those exams tomorrow.

410
00:28:42,107 --> 00:28:47,112
If, by any chance, there's
something wrong.

411
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,845
What could possibly be wrong?

412
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:55,602
Stop worrying about such
useless things for no reason.

413
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,523
Hurry up and go to sleep.

414
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:03,450
If, by any chance,
there's something wrong.

415
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:07,873
Tell me everything.

416
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:10,699
Don't hide it from me.

417
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,620
Geez, all right, already.
Now stop it and go to sleep.

418
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:33,781
-Ok! We understand!
-Ok! We understand!

419
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,213
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:47,891
Huh?

421
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:52,840
The electricity went out, right?

422
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,181
Yes, it seems like it.

423
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,241
Call your dad and
ask him to come home.

424
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:48,798
-Wow!
-Wow!

425
00:30:56,078 --> 00:30:59,218
This is why you need
a man around the house.

426
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,896
What, is there anything else
that needs fixing?

427
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,049
All you did was switch a fuse.

428
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,673
I could do that too.

429
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:08,616
Even though it seems easy...

430
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,982
...it's a lot more intricate
and complex than it seems!

431
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:14,443
It's because it's me
that it was able to be fixed.

432
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:42,311
Is there something
troubling you, honey?

433
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:45,074
Not me.

434
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,282
Bo Ra's mom is getting
a physical exam today.

435
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,674
She'll be fine, right honey?

436
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:56,324
Of course.
She can't not be fine.

437
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:59,211
She'll be fine, no matter what.
Ok?

438
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:02,509
Don't you worry one...

439
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:15,730
...bit!

440
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,358
That's enough, already!

441
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:21,990
I feel cruddy enough as it is.

442
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:30,813
I thought that was a good one.

443
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:39,851
So there's nothing
certain as of yet...

444
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:43,061
...but we have to do
a biopsy to make sure?

445
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:45,643
Yes. There's a point of
concern on the x-ray...

446
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:51,204
...so we have to do a biopsy
to be sure of anything.

447
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,624
Then, will you be doing
the biopsy right away?

448
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:58,097
Yes. We'll be doing local anesthesia
and then be carrying out the exam.

449
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,598
You'll be able to be
discharged in the evening.

450
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:07,618
Um, Doctor. Could it possibly
be cancer?

451
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:12,228
Geez, what do you mean, cancer?
Stop saying things like that!

452
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,919
It's only natural for you
to be going through a biopsy.

453
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,414
Don't you worry about a thing.

454
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:18,815
Just trust me.

455
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:21,902
We don't know anything yet.

456
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:26,531
We'll need the results of the biopsy
to know whether or not it's malignant.

457
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:31,338
Don't worry too much, and
please prepare for the biopsy.

458
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:35,408
Ms. Lee Il Hwa? Please come out.

459
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,446
We have to get you changed.

460
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,502
Ok.

461
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:44,224
Yeah. Hurry and get ready.

462
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,765
Um, Doctor.

463
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:03,086
What are the chances
that it could be something bad?

464
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:07,875
It's probably not cancer, right?

465
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:12,979
Um, to be honest, the shape doesn't
look good, so I'm a bit worried.

466
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:18,858
I'm a bit worried,
but nothing's certain as of now.

467
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:22,070
We'll only know for sure when
the results of the biopsy come out.

468
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:25,844
I can't give you any definite
answers right now.

469
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:33,018
Yes, I see. Thank you, Doctor.
Please take care of her.

470
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:38,916
Ssangmun Girls' High

471
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,177
Yes!

472
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:52,953
Why not mix everything together?

473
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,771
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

474
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:01,853
Hey, what about the red pepper paste?

475
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:17,524
-Is this enough?
-Stop putting it in, darn it!

476
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,556
-There we go!
-Looks delicious!

477
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:27,559
It seems a bit lacking
since Man Ok isn't here.

478
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,184
Our poor Mi Ok.
I'll bet she's so bored.

479
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:34,338
She couldn't even move for two weeks.

480
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,580
Is it really ok for us
to not visit her?

481
00:35:36,836 --> 00:35:38,098
She said not to come
no matter what.

482
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,534
She says her dad is really scary.

483
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,572
I saw him on the street a bit one time.

484
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,798
He really does look scary.

485
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:49,223
But, what kind of work does he do?
You don't know either, right?

486
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,262
Yeah. I don't think Man Ok likes
talking about it...

487
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,306
...so I didn't bring it up.

488
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,623
Soo Yeon. Do you think,
by any chance...

489
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,715
...that he could be a thug,
um, Mr. Thug?

490
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:07,604
Or maybe, a mobster?

491
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,488
Maybe that's why she told us
not to come to the hospital?

492
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:12,898
Maybe?

493
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,771
Geez, no way!

494
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,051
She goes traveling with him often
and eats out with him every day.

495
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:22,709
No way.

496
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,734
-Right?
-Yeah.

497
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:27,186
No way.

498
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:29,315
He looks really scary, though.

499
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,482
Really?

500
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:47,437
Don't move. You'll hurt
yourself again.

501
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:51,246
Just endure it for one more week.

502
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,858
Dad, hurry up and leave.
It's already nighttime.

503
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:06,433
You have to go open up your store.

504
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:32,017
Hey, Bo Ra. Let's go get dinner together.

505
00:37:32,272 --> 00:37:34,212
I already have plans.
Have fun, you two.

506
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:37,723
Hey. You got a boyfriend, didn't you?

507
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:42,946
Hey, Sung Bo Ra!

508
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:45,598
Judging from the fact you're
smiling, you really did get one, huh?

509
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:46,936
You're quite skilled, Sung Bo Ra!

510
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,541
When did you have the time to date?

511
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:51,257
I know, right? I'm shocked at myself.

512
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,479
Who is it? An upperclassman?
Someone in our year?

513
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:56,351
You guys don't need to know.

514
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:59,159
Come on, who is it?

515
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:00,335
Noona!

516
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:07,330
Who's that kid?

517
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:12,783
Hello.

518
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:14,580
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

519
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:17,103
But, who are you?

520
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,144
-He's my younger brother.
-Younger brother?

521
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:23,298
I know what he looks like,
and he doesn't look this young.

522
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,609
Student. What's your relationship
with Bo Ra?

523
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:27,430
Um, I mean, he's a younger kid
who lives next door.

524
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,179
He's my a friend of
my younger sister, Deok Sun.

525
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:32,386
-Oh.
-Wow. What a great neighborhood.

526
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:34,885
An older girl from your
neighborhood is buying you dinner.

527
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,073
I guess there's a reason why Dooly
landed in Ssangmundong.

528
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:43,140
Eat a lot of delicious things, ok?

529
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:44,677
Little punk. You're pretty handsome.

530
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:47,145
Bye!

531
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:51,296
Ask her to buy you a parfait, ok?

532
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:53,160
There's a place that's famous
for them on Nokdu Street.

533
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,924
-We'll be going, Bo Ra!
-Ok.

534
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:09,188
Finish all of that, at least.

535
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:11,262
Ok.

536
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:21,724
Oh yeah. Didn't you
go to the hospital today?

537
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:25,615
Yeah. I went.
They said I'm fine.

538
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:28,421
No problems whatsoever. Don't worry.

539
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,585
You should have come with me.

540
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,542
I'm all better, anyway.

541
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:36,902
I just got a prescription.

542
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,661
I just have to go back for a checkup
once every two months.

543
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:45,588
I'm fine, so just
do what you need to do.

544
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:51,875
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm your son, and yet.

545
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,343
What are you sorry about?

546
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:01,904
I'm fine, so, Taek.

547
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,200
Please, at least finish your rice.
Quickly.

548
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:09,627
Yes.

549
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:35,463
Hey, I'm sorry. So hurry up and eat.

550
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,568
Their fried tofu stew
is really delicious.

551
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,581
You're such a good person.

552
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,920
You even buy dinner for the next door
friend of your younger sister.

553
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,591
I'm sorry. I'm apologizing now,
aren't I?

554
00:40:58,074 --> 00:41:01,911
I'm sorry, so hurry up and eat. Ok?

555
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,818
Geez.

556
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:18,404
Hey. Look at me.

557
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:23,101
I'm going to count to three.
One. Two. Three.

558
00:41:32,981 --> 00:41:34,691
Hurry up and eat.

559
00:41:36,365 --> 00:41:37,984
Ok.

560
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,641
Thanks for the meal, Bo Ra.

561
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:43,799
-What?!
-Huh?

562
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,319
Why, I ought to.

563
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:56,678
I'm home!

564
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,922
I'm home, too! Soo Yeon's home!

565
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:00,166
Mom, I'm home, too!

566
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:03,719
Oh, you're here?

567
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:07,146
What a coincidence, all three of you
coming home at the same time.

568
00:42:07,226 --> 00:42:08,643
Mom, I'm hungry. Feed me.

569
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:10,068
You didn't eat yet, right?

570
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,857
We have dinner early.
It was such a long time ago.

571
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:16,565
Mom. I want to eat too.

572
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:20,565
Ok, ok.
I'll get it for you, just wait.

573
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:25,416
Here we go, eat up.

574
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:30,546
Mom. We only have cold rice?

575
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,713
Yeah. I was busy today, and...

576
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:36,686
Geez, I'm just going to
eat ramen, then.

577
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,117
How come? Eat this.
You can mix it with the stew.

578
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:44,587
Mom. Just make ramen for me too.

579
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,906
How can I eat cold rice
so late at night?

580
00:42:47,204 --> 00:42:49,886
Mom, did you wash my button-up?
I was going to wear it tomorrow.

581
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,866
Oh, that. Something got on it,
so I put it in the wash.

582
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,951
If I iron it tomorrow,
you should be able to wear it.

583
00:42:56,979 --> 00:43:01,033
Geez, you should have asked me
before washing it!

584
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:03,092
Darn it!

585
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:06,280
What's wrong with this food?
You rotten kids.

586
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:09,406
No Eul, you make yourself
your own darn rice!

587
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:11,699
Deok Sun, you make yourself
some darn ramen!

588
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,172
And Bo Ra, do your own darn laundry!

589
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:18,370
Why does your mom have to do laundry
for a grown-ass college student?

590
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,320
You rotten kids.

591
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,738
Geez, geez.

592
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,687
You terrible lot.

593
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:42,729
Do you think that your mom
will be with you forever?

594
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:44,050
Huh?

595
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,374
Don't you feel sorry for her?

596
00:43:47,055 --> 00:43:48,618
Be nice to her while
she's still around.

597
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:50,460
Please, grow up a little!

598
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:53,312
You little rascals...

599
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,008
You're no children of mine,
you might as well be my enemies.

600
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:58,267
Jerks.

601
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,682
Hurry the hell up and eat!

602
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,576
Honey!

603
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:14,196
I bet those two fought again.

604
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:17,922
Then why are they taking out
their anger on me?

605
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:49,366
Um.

606
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:51,228
Bo Ra.

607
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:55,246
Let's have a chat.

608
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,632
It's nothing serious, right?

609
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,782
Of course not.

610
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:15,383
People sometimes get
a biopsy just in case...

611
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:20,908
...but I'm sure it'll all be fine.

612
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:23,231
You don't need to worry a single bit.

613
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,222
Despite everything...

614
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:32,704
...you're the eldest daughter,
so I thought you should know.

615
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:35,188
That's why I'm telling you.

616
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:38,565
Don't tell your younger siblings.

617
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,637
Just keep it to yourself, ok?

618
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:42,788
Ok.

619
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:55,115
Um, if, by any chance,
you're having a hard time lately...

620
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,244
I'm going to sleep.

621
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:00,740
Oh, ok. Go to sleep early.

622
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,222
Ahjumma, can I have some seasoned
cartilage and fish cake?

623
00:46:23,245 --> 00:46:24,288
300 won's worth?

624
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:25,558
I want to give it to my wife.

625
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:32,725
Hey. Have a seat. Let's have a drink.

626
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:38,802
Apocalypse Now

627
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:45,153
Geez.

628
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:49,948
Oh, it's fine! I'm sure it's nothing!

629
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:52,858
Yes, don't you worry!

630
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:56,288
Right?

631
00:46:56,299 --> 00:47:00,026
Of course. My younger sister
got a biopsy on her chest...

632
00:47:00,037 --> 00:47:02,294
...and they said that the lump was
just a water pocket. Don't worry.

633
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:03,886
So when are your results coming out?

634
00:47:04,786 --> 00:47:06,559
This Saturday.

635
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:09,795
I was so anxious that they
said they'd get me my results faster.

636
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,006
They're going to call me.

637
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:16,295
But, missus.

638
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:18,703
It's really probably nothing, right?

639
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:23,144
Of course! Geez,
you're such a worrywart.

640
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:29,126
I know. But I can't help how I feel.

641
00:47:52,314 --> 00:47:53,454
-Oh.
-Oh!

642
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:55,055
Why are you coming out
from over there?

643
00:47:56,342 --> 00:48:00,051
She was sitting in her room all day
so I brought her over for some coffee.

644
00:48:00,092 --> 00:48:03,436
Oh, thank you so much,
Jung Bong's mom.

645
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:11,739
Geez, stop frowning!
It's really nothing!

646
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:15,674
Ok? I'm not worried in
the slightest! Sheesh.

647
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:18,991
Let's go inside and have some
goldfish bread together.

648
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:27,699
Oh, President Sung!

649
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:29,629
Oh, President Kim!

650
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,243
-It's so nice to see you!
-It's so nice to see you!

651
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:35,218
Why are you coming out from there?

652
00:48:35,286 --> 00:48:39,202
Oh, the lightbulb went out,
so I fixed it.

653
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:42,189
You hear that sound, right?

654
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,408
It turns out
that the filament is all worn out!

655
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:48,094
I fixed everything, so the light
should be nice and bright now!

656
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:50,866
All right, all right.

657
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:55,144
What's so amazing about
having changed a lightbulb?

658
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:59,963
In my house, my No Eul could do that
with both his eyes closed! Geez.

659
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:04,725
Honey. Do you know what happened
yesterday? Well, Bo Ra's father...

660
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:09,452
Wow, you're so talented!

661
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:13,337
All Edison did was invent it. I'll bet
he didn't know how to change one!

662
00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:18,332
I'm just saying, the face of a
craftsman stands out from others.

663
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:21,645
Not just anyone can run a GoldStar store!

664
00:49:23,346 --> 00:49:25,596
I'm cold, so I'll be going inside now.

665
00:49:25,647 --> 00:49:27,285
-Ok.
-Yeah, get inside.

666
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,712
Ok.

667
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,466
She's really ok, right? I'm worried.

668
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:37,878
Yes, well, that is...

669
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:47,353
Geez, Jung Bong's mom!
There's nothing to worry about!

670
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:52,712
I secretly asked the doctor about my
wife while she was getting examined.

671
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,773
But he told me...

672
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:59,956
...that a lot of people get biopsies,
even for little problems!

673
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:05,831
I'm not worried at all!
Not even a tiny bit!

674
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:14,230
Yes.

675
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:20,903
It's the morning news for
Saturday, February 25th, 1989.

676
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:24,671
The final round of the Fujitsu
Baduk Tournament taking place in Japan...

677
00:50:24,732 --> 00:50:26,359
...is just one day away.

678
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:29,512
The grand prize for
Fujitsu is 15,000,000 yen.

679
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,136
In Korean currency,
that's 70,000,000 won.

680
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:35,308
Choi Taek, of Korea who unfortunately
got second place last year...

681
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,102
...will proceed to the finals.

682
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:41,194
He will be heading toward Gimpo
Airport today for the tournament.

683
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:44,246
He seems to be quite calm,
just as usual.

684
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:46,526
Now, our next story.

685
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:50,463
All high schools in Seoul will be
starting their spring break today.

686
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:55,326
Most schools are planning to begin
the new school year on March second.

687
00:50:55,682 --> 00:50:56,989
Taek hasn't left yet, right?

688
00:50:57,026 --> 00:50:58,209
Oh, you're here?

689
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:05,807
Here. Give Taek this before he goes.

690
00:51:06,005 --> 00:51:07,585
It's a lot easier to digest than rice.

691
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:10,214
Oh. That's good. Thanks.

692
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:12,271
Bye.

693
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:13,932
Ok.

694
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:20,150
-Mom, I'm going to the study room.
-Ok.

695
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,744
It's my spring break starting today.
You don't need to iron that.

696
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:24,701
Even so, I want to have it
ironed for you in advance.

697
00:51:24,712 --> 00:51:25,706
Ok.

698
00:51:25,722 --> 00:51:28,579
Oh yeah. Taek is going
to Japan tomorrow, right?

699
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:30,045
I guess it's a big match.

700
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:31,184
Oh, it's called Fujitsu...

701
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:33,435
...and it's a tournament where Taek
was the runner-up twice.

702
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:34,631
I'll be going now.

703
00:51:34,642 --> 00:51:35,979
Ok. Bye.

704
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,395
Why isn't this working?

705
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:53,026
Honey! Honey!

706
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,102
Yes, Master?
What can I do for you?

707
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:01,418
-This iron isn't working.
-Huh?

708
00:52:05,478 --> 00:52:07,701
Oh, I see.
The line is disconnected there.

709
00:52:08,076 --> 00:52:10,870
Give it here.
I'll fix it for you right away.

710
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:14,380
Geez, how can you fix this?
Just call someone.

711
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:18,161
"Call someone?"
Because of this lousy thing?

712
00:52:18,977 --> 00:52:21,202
Just give me an hour.
I'll fix it right away!

713
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:28,897
Geez, this makes me feel uneasy.

714
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:39,980
Manager Lee is already here.
He's waiting outside.

715
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:42,296
-Ok.
-Oh, Taek.

716
00:52:43,314 --> 00:52:45,028
Where did you say your
hotel was this time, again?

717
00:52:45,605 --> 00:52:48,431
Leave me the hotel's number.

718
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:50,697
Just a moment.

719
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:09,846
Tokyo Garden Hotel

720
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:25,014
Put this away.
We might need it again later.

721
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:26,426
Ok.

722
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:40,137
Hello.

723
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:41,647
I've parked the car down there.

724
00:53:42,676 --> 00:53:44,656
We'll be late for the plane. Let's go.

725
00:53:45,445 --> 00:53:46,607
Please take good care of him.

726
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:47,618
Yes.

727
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,769
Manager.
Just a moment.

728
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,036
Did you sleep well?

729
00:54:01,874 --> 00:54:04,285
That's good.
So you're going now?

730
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:06,688
Yeah. Aren't you cold?

731
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,604
Nope. But, aren't you?

732
00:54:09,986 --> 00:54:12,258
Me? A little.

733
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,756
Geez, close your zipper, you dunce.

734
00:54:21,486 --> 00:54:22,499
Get me a souvenir.

735
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:24,046
What do you want?

736
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,006
-You're really going to bring me
back something? -Yeah

737
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:29,177
Geez, that's fine.
There's no way you'd remember.

738
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,048
I'm serious. I'll bring you
back something this time.

739
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,684
Never mind that. Just get me any
old thing you get from the tournament.

740
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,285
They gave you keychains and towels
last time for participating, right?

741
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:44,427
You'll be late. Hurry and go.

742
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:45,856
Ok.

743
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:49,367
-I'm off.
-You little.

744
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:56,877
Deok Sun.

745
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:01,166
It's ok if I lose, right?

746
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,579
Bye.

747
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,426
Honey, come on. Get up
and have some of this.

748
00:55:22,962 --> 00:55:25,201
I don't think I'll be able
to get it down.

749
00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:32,351
Geez, come on, get up. Come on.

750
00:55:32,953 --> 00:55:33,973
Yes, just like that.

751
00:55:34,726 --> 00:55:37,782
You haven't had breakfast or lunch.

752
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,014
You'll really die at this rate.

753
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:43,455
Don't be like that
and have this drumstick.

754
00:55:46,418 --> 00:55:47,421
What about the kids?

755
00:55:47,774 --> 00:55:50,264
I'm sure they'll take care of
shoving their own faces.

756
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:51,483
No need to worry.

757
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:57,694
Honey.
Why haven't they called?

758
00:55:59,842 --> 00:56:02,973
They said they'd call this afternoon.

759
00:56:03,035 --> 00:56:05,368
Geez, you, it's 2:00 p.m. now.

760
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:08,521
If they said they'd call
in the afternoon, they will.

761
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,472
I'm sure they have tons of people
to call.

762
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:13,652
Right? There are
tons of people to be called.

763
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:16,695
So just wait a bit longer
and don't worry.

764
00:56:16,815 --> 00:56:19,900
Geez, also, just stay put.

765
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,213
There won't be anything wrong
with you.

766
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:25,595
Just trust in me.

767
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,827
Are you a doctor?

768
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:34,447
What good would it do to trust in you,
who's not even a doctor?

769
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,567
Geez, that's how it seemed like
when I was there!

770
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:40,829
I'm sure you're really scared.

771
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:46,806
But judging from how the doctor
and nurse seemed that day...

772
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,042
...it didn't seem serious at all.

773
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:52,213
So, don't worry.

774
00:56:53,388 --> 00:56:54,406
Eat up.

775
00:57:09,143 --> 00:57:11,124
-It's not finished yet?
-Yeah. Hold on.

776
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:15,919
You cut the cord?

777
00:57:16,753 --> 00:57:18,271
How am I supposed to use this, then?

778
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:22,415
You're supposed to cut it a bit like
this to connect it back together!

779
00:57:22,752 --> 00:57:27,424
Ms. Zebra, don't worry.
Go out and watch some TV.

780
00:57:32,018 --> 00:57:34,255
Where did the kids go?
I don't see them anywhere.

781
00:57:48,108 --> 00:57:50,684
First, take 4 million won each
as salary.

782
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:06,917
You have to watch the bank well.

783
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:08,478
Being the banker really
is no easy feat.

784
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:10,999
I feel uneasy.
Can I be the banker while I play?

785
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,952
Dong Ryong.

786
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,757
Do you know what marked
the beginning...

787
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:16,520
...of my long seven years as a
college exam retaker?

788
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:21,155
Blue Marble Game

789
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,385
It's this.

790
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:26,364
Oh.

791
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,562
But, um, I'm not really good
at Blue Marble.

792
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:32,894
What's the problem when I'll
tell you everything perfectly?

793
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,475
10!

794
00:58:44,405 --> 00:58:45,414
Deserted Island

795
00:58:45,425 --> 00:58:46,658
You're going to a deserted island.

796
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:49,521
You won't have any chances
for three days straight.

797
00:58:49,938 --> 00:58:50,959
Next!

798
00:58:54,974 --> 00:58:58,096
Taipei. I don't know about Taipei.

799
00:58:58,756 --> 00:59:00,620
Even if you build there,
you'll only get 10,000 won.

800
00:59:00,636 --> 00:59:02,880
I'm not sure it's worth investing in.

801
00:59:03,342 --> 00:59:04,356
12.

802
00:59:04,463 --> 00:59:06,516
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine

803
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,999
-10, 11, 12.
-Ah, Seoul! You can't build there.

804
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,753
However, the towing fee
is 2 million won!

805
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:17,105
Golden Key!
You've gotten it again, Sung No Eul!

806
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:19,398
Please turn over a card.

807
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:21,950
Hey. I thought you said
you weren't good!

808
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:23,974
Why are you so good?
Practically everything is yours!

809
00:59:24,587 --> 00:59:26,532
I heard that everyone has
at least one talent.

810
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,131
Hurry up and flip over a card!

811
00:59:31,418 --> 00:59:33,026
An Invitation for Space Travel

812
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:34,046
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

813
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:38,288
Noona, what does this
"Space Travel" card do?

814
00:59:40,051 --> 00:59:41,627
They say, "A novice shaman kills."

815
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,032
How does someone who doesn't
even know the rules get...

816
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:46,071
...the Space Travel card and
Golden Key card all the time!

817
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,101
It pisses me off!

818
00:59:47,197 --> 00:59:50,503
You don't even know that?
We told you in the beginning!

819
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:55,640
Soo Yeon. Bool Chi Ha Moon.

820
00:59:56,523 --> 01:00:00,605
"Do not be ashamed to ask about
something to someone beneath you."

821
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:04,369
So you're implying that I'm beneath him?

822
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:08,170
999th place and 1000th place
are all about the same.

823
01:00:10,025 --> 01:00:11,607
You're ranked last place on
the sciences track.

824
01:00:11,618 --> 01:00:12,928
Darn you!

825
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,960
Can you all please be quiet?

826
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:17,428
Jung Bong hyungnim.

827
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:20,585
What kind of card is the
Space Travel card?

828
01:00:21,377 --> 01:00:23,028
It's the best card in Blue Marble.

829
01:00:29,344 --> 01:00:32,542
With this card, you can go
anywhere you want to go.

830
01:00:34,196 --> 01:00:35,536
What the!

831
01:00:35,817 --> 01:00:37,452
It's also my favorite card.

832
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:41,196
No Eul! Where do you want to go?

833
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:42,882
Just say the word!

834
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:47,832
Aw, yes!

835
01:01:01,035 --> 01:01:02,169
Let's split up here.

836
01:01:02,256 --> 01:01:03,496
I have to hurry home.

837
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,235
Did something happen at home?

838
01:01:05,436 --> 01:01:08,777
No. I just have some
things to study, is all. Bye!

839
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:16,415
I'm home.

840
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:19,299
Oh, you're home, Bo Ra?

841
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:24,386
Geez, I must be out of it.
I need to be preparing dinner.

842
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:26,102
No, no, no.
Let's just order in today.

843
01:01:26,351 --> 01:01:27,472
I want to eat jjajjangmyun.

844
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:32,596
Yeah, yeah, let's order in!
Call Deok Sun, Soo Yeon, and No Eul.

845
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:38,340
Ok, let's do that, then.

846
01:01:39,026 --> 01:01:40,760
Did they call yet?

847
01:01:43,941 --> 01:01:44,965
Go on in.

848
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,592
Stop.

849
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:15,324
Give it here.

850
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:28,173
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mi Ran.

851
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:35,685
If you couldn't do it,
you should have just said so!

852
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,522
How am I supposed to use this?

853
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:41,881
We could have just left it to
a pro from the get-go!

854
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:44,886
It's really difficult to fix that.
Not just anyone can do it!

855
01:02:44,914 --> 01:02:46,727
It's because it's me
that I even got this far with it!

856
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:50,982
How am I supposed to use this, huh?

857
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,900
Let's put that iron down
before we continue talking, ok?

858
01:02:55,977 --> 01:02:58,869
See you all tomorrow. Mister,
don't remove the Blue Marble game.

859
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,068
Ok!

860
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,611
Um, Soo Yeon.

861
01:03:06,577 --> 01:03:07,580
Yeah, what is it oppa?

862
01:03:09,212 --> 01:03:10,435
You know, your friend.

863
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,328
Man Ok?

864
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,490
Oppa, it'll be a long time
before Man Ok is discharged.

865
01:03:17,412 --> 01:03:19,388
I'm thinking about going to
visit her at the hospital.

866
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:22,076
What does Miss Man Ok like?

867
01:03:22,702 --> 01:03:24,735
I want to bring her a gift.

868
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:26,536
What do you think would be good,
Soo Yeon?

869
01:03:26,547 --> 01:03:28,302
She's rich. There's nothing
she doesn't have.

870
01:03:28,753 --> 01:03:29,753
Still.

871
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,820
Well, I don't know.

872
01:03:31,322 --> 01:03:33,717
-A bouquet of flowers?
-Her room is flooded with them.

873
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:35,464
-Cake?
-She doesn't like it.

874
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:42,219
What Man Ok wants the most
right now, is to go outside.

875
01:03:44,304 --> 01:03:46,564
She's been cooped up in that
hospital room for two weeks now.

876
01:03:46,575 --> 01:03:47,976
She feels like she's
suffocating to death.

877
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,119
We want to go hang out
with her at least...

878
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:51,942
...but her dad is super scary.

879
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,745
When she gets discharged later,
I'll help you out.

880
01:03:57,564 --> 01:03:58,574
Just trust in me.

881
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,008
Bye!

882
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,685
Ok, Jin Joo.

883
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,813
Just wait a bit longer.

884
01:04:31,488 --> 01:04:35,639
Ok.
Ta-da!

885
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:46,644
Sun Young.
It's all finished.

886
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,152
Already?
Wow, you're so talented!

887
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:53,730
Jin Joo!

888
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:59,052
Jin Joo can watch her cartoons now!

889
01:04:59,888 --> 01:05:02,267
Jin Joo must be so happy!

890
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:04,956
I'll be going then.

891
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:10,892
Huh? Oh, Jin Joo!
Oh?

892
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:13,776
Oh boy. I have to go, though.

893
01:05:15,903 --> 01:05:18,685
What do I do?
I have to go, though.

894
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:21,402
Are you having fun?

895
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,238
Oppa.

896
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:26,516
Have dinner before you go. If you
leave now, she'll cry all night.

897
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:29,002
Should I, then?

898
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:32,209
Ok. I'll eat dinner before I go.

899
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:33,830
Jin Joo, say "Ah."

900
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,319
Is that good?

901
01:05:41,523 --> 01:05:42,540
Give that here.

902
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:44,915
Mom, I'm home.

903
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:50,927
Oh, you're back, Sun Woo?
Hurry over. Let's eat.

904
01:05:57,063 --> 01:05:58,079
Hello.

905
01:05:58,221 --> 01:05:59,228
Oh, hey.

906
01:06:03,337 --> 01:06:04,870
The VCR broke...

907
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:07,256
...Jin Joo was watching a cartoon...

908
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:09,178
...but the VCR broke,
so I came to fix it.

909
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:11,499
But, she's stuck to me like glue.

910
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:16,247
Jin Joo, you like him that much?

911
01:06:20,616 --> 01:06:23,116
-Mom, I want rice.
-Oh, yes!

912
01:06:27,077 --> 01:06:28,126
I want that!

913
01:06:38,757 --> 01:06:39,758
Here we go.

914
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:47,460
But, Ms. Il Hwa's results
still haven't come out yet?

915
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:50,010
The sun's almost setting.

916
01:06:53,214 --> 01:06:54,488
I'm going to Jung Bong hyung room's.

917
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:57,668
I'm going to go meet Jo Hyun outside.

918
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,104
Mom, you're not eating any more?

919
01:07:09,865 --> 01:07:12,329
I'm fine.
I don't really like jjajangmyun.

920
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,636
Hey. You should eat some more,
at least.

921
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:22,427
I don't like jjajangmyun
that much either.

922
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:46,103
Don't worry, ok? I'll bring you
the best one from my store tomorrow!

923
01:07:46,738 --> 01:07:48,490
You think I'm worried about
some darn iron right now?

924
01:07:50,178 --> 01:07:51,180
What, then?

925
01:07:53,723 --> 01:07:56,098
Today's the day that the results of
Bo Ra's mom's biopsy comes out...

926
01:07:56,716 --> 01:07:57,949
...but I haven't heard from her yet.

927
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:00,906
She told me she'd call right away
when the results came out.

928
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:23,435
Hello?

929
01:08:25,203 --> 01:08:27,835
Yes, that's me. I'm Lee Il Hwa.

930
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,647
Yes, yes.
Go ahead.

931
01:08:33,934 --> 01:08:35,208
The results are out?

932
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:38,518
Are they not good?

933
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:47,730
Oh. I see.
Yes. Yes.

934
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:50,774
Then it's nothing, right?

935
01:08:53,424 --> 01:09:00,735
Ah, yes. Yes. I understand.
Yes, I will. Yes, yes.

936
01:09:01,154 --> 01:09:02,889
Thank you! Yes!

937
01:09:05,927 --> 01:09:08,992
Geez. I told you that it was nothing!

938
01:09:10,904 --> 01:09:12,310
They said that it was
just a water pocket.

939
01:09:12,321 --> 01:09:15,115
They said that I just have to do...
um...

940
01:09:15,138 --> 01:09:17,681
...follow-up tests once
a year from now on

941
01:09:18,466 --> 01:09:23,576
What did I tell you? I told you that
there's nothing to worry about!

942
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:26,632
Geez.
Not even once, seriously!

943
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:33,629
I wasn't worried for even a second
from the very beginning! Really!

944
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:40,396
Really? Even so, I thought that
you might have been a tiny bit uneasy.

945
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:44,136
But wow, my husband Sung Dong Il
is truly a man among men!

946
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:52,004
I wasn't worried for even a second
from the very beginning! Really!

947
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:54,074
I wasn't worried at all! Sheesh.

948
01:09:54,086 --> 01:09:56,102
All right, all right.

949
01:09:56,134 --> 01:09:57,219
Bo Ra's mom!

950
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:05,269
Judging from the look on your face,
I'll bet your results came out!

951
01:10:05,684 --> 01:10:07,278
Sheesh, they said that
it was nothing, right?

952
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,340
They said that it was
just a water pocket!

953
01:10:10,351 --> 01:10:11,775
Oh, thank goodness.

954
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:16,226
Even so, you were so worried about it
so I was getting a bit worried.

955
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:19,675
Wow, congratulations!

956
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:22,097
Yes, thank you!

957
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:24,135
I'll bet that Bo Ra's dad was going
through a lot too.

958
01:10:24,146 --> 01:10:25,306
You can rest easy now!

959
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:27,758
What do you mean,
going through a rough time?

960
01:10:27,809 --> 01:10:32,570
Seriously, I wasn't worried
for even a second from the beginning!

961
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,462
Oh, why not have a drink
tonight to celebrate?

962
01:10:40,473 --> 01:10:41,499
Oh, good idea!

963
01:10:41,634 --> 01:10:42,786
Thank you for the meal.

964
01:10:42,815 --> 01:10:44,369
-Oh, ok.
-Head inside, then!

965
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,423
Good work!

966
01:10:45,686 --> 01:10:48,779
We have some sake and a box
of dried pollock. Let's have that.

967
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:53,180
Yeah. Wait, no. Instead of that,
let's have some wild ginseng liquor.

968
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:54,890
Let's drink that today.

969
01:10:55,337 --> 01:10:57,069
Wild ginseng liquor?
You have such a thing?

970
01:10:57,645 --> 01:10:59,716
Wow, you have some balls, Jung Bong's dad.

971
01:11:00,101 --> 01:11:04,140
He values that more than his own life.
He'll never drink that.

972
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:12,034
On a chilly day like this, warm sake
is just the thing to warm us up!

973
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:17,352
Bo Ra's mom. Did you know...

974
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:19,090
Let's have the wild ginseng liquor!

975
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:24,274
Should we drink it upstairs or
downstairs? Where?

976
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,357
He's talking about drinking
the wild ginseng liquor, right?

977
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:30,154
Yeah! Where should we drink it?

978
01:11:31,446 --> 01:11:34,048
What does it matter,
when it's wild ginseng liquor?

979
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,813
Oh, come inside!

980
01:11:44,321 --> 01:11:46,851
Taek's dad.
Have you heard?

981
01:11:47,288 --> 01:11:50,533
-Heard what?
-You know that thief from before?

982
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:54,357
The owner of the ice store
said that the thief had a knife!

983
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:57,100
Really?
He didn't get hurt?

984
01:11:57,287 --> 01:11:59,118
-He did!
-What?

985
01:11:59,705 --> 01:12:02,095
Apparently, his arm
was scratched up a bit!

986
01:12:02,596 --> 01:12:04,346
He could have gotten seriously hurt!

987
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:08,607
Oppa.
Aren't you scared?

988
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,175
Yeah, I am scared.

989
01:12:18,954 --> 01:12:22,973
Excuse me, sir.
A person was stabbed!

990
01:12:26,303 --> 01:12:28,598
I heard.
How scary.

991
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:35,010
I'm just wasting my breath.

992
01:12:36,157 --> 01:12:37,535
Oh, it's a plane!

993
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:40,462
-A plane? Where?
-Breaking news...

994
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:45,691
...a plane headed to Tokyo carrying
182 passengers from Gimpo Airport...

995
01:12:46,048 --> 01:12:49,212
...has run off the runway at
the Narita Airport.

996
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:53,374
We are currently checking how
many of the passengers were Korean.

997
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:57,307
We do not currently have any specific
numbers of casualties or injuries.

998
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:59,585
Based on our most
current information...

999
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:02,723
...it seems that Choi Taek, 6-dan,
and his entourage...

1000
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:06,407
...who were headed toward the
Fujitsu Tournament, were on board.

1001
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:12,351
However, we do not have any
specifics regarding the situation.

1002
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:15,106
Based on our current
information, however...

1003
01:13:15,168 --> 01:13:17,479
...it is almost certain that
Choi Taek was on board.

1004
01:13:17,513 --> 01:13:19,980
Omo, what do we do?
What do we do?

1005
01:13:19,991 --> 01:13:21,603
Omo!

1006
01:13:21,842 --> 01:13:24,677
Um, mister!
Have you gotten any calls from Taek?

1007
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:27,576
What time was his flight?
You know his hotel's number, right?

1008
01:13:28,922 --> 01:13:30,135
I wrote it down.

1009
01:13:31,747 --> 01:13:36,071
Wait, wait a minute. Wait.

1010
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,827
Call the Baduk Club! The Baduk Club!

1011
01:13:47,844 --> 01:13:49,328
-Ok, I'll do that.
-Wait.

1012
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:52,057
Taek put the contact info
in his journal this morning.

1013
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:58,450
You call this wild ginseng liquor?

1014
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,880
Are you messing with me?

1015
01:14:02,899 --> 01:14:03,944
Where's the wild ginseng?

1016
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:07,756
There it is, floating in the middle!

1017
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:12,230
It's been alive like that for 20 years
because it's a real wild ginseng!

1018
01:14:14,061 --> 01:14:15,667
It really is a real wild ginseng, though.

1019
01:14:16,089 --> 01:14:20,716
He secretly snatched a root off from
his branch manager's wild ginseng.

1020
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:25,977
A plane en route to Narita Airport
from Gimpo...

1021
01:14:26,056 --> 01:14:31,240
...was involved in an accident where
it ran off the runway.

1022
01:14:31,613 --> 01:14:34,720
The names of the passengers on board
have not been released yet...

1023
01:14:34,919 --> 01:14:36,274
...but according
to the airport's reports...

1024
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:39,203
...Choi Taek, 6-dan,
and his entourage were on board...

1025
01:14:39,277 --> 01:14:41,462
What kind of nonsense is this?

1026
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,681
Now, now.

1027
01:14:54,419 --> 01:14:55,795
Please go back home, everyone.

1028
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:57,784
The situation has already
been taken care of.

1029
01:14:58,092 --> 01:14:59,129
What do you mean?

1030
01:14:59,531 --> 01:15:00,630
Is Taek ok?

1031
01:15:00,865 --> 01:15:03,054
-Were they able to get in touch with him?
-Yes. He's fine.

1032
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,453
He's at the hotel now.
Taek's dad is speaking with him now.

1033
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:08,825
-Thank goodness.
-I felt my heart drop!

1034
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:11,138
Wow. I still feel uneasy.

1035
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:14,216
Is Taek's dad ok?
I'm sure he was very shocked.

1036
01:15:14,227 --> 01:15:19,432
Who, him? I've seriously never
seen such a collected guy in my life.

1037
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,918
Geez, all right,
head back home, everyone!

1038
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,006
I heard it's raining a lot there.

1039
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:30,267
Yeah. Make sure
you take care of yourself.

1040
01:15:31,082 --> 01:15:32,506
And make sure to eat well.

1041
01:15:33,514 --> 01:15:37,279
Geez.
Are you all right?

1042
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,445
No matter how much I think about it,
he isn't normal.

1043
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:56,256
Yeah. I think so, too.

1044
01:15:57,293 --> 01:16:01,756
Geez, he's seriously not human.
He's like a bear.

1045
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:07,657
Don't worry about your old man
and go to sleep early tonight, ok?

1046
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:10,872
And don't take too many
pain relievers, ok?

1047
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:13,757
Yeah.
Ok.

1048
01:16:15,205 --> 01:16:18,645
And make sure you pack
an umbrella in the morning.

1049
01:16:19,362 --> 01:16:20,362
Ok.

1050
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:26,701
Ok. Good night.
Ok.

1051
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:30,471
Did you go somewhere?

1052
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,663
Look over there.

1053
01:16:35,688 --> 01:16:39,150
A full list of the casualties
has not come in.

1054
01:16:40,118 --> 01:16:42,141
According to most recent news...

1055
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:48,855
...Korean Taek had planned
to participate…

1056
01:16:48,866 --> 01:16:49,988
Is that me?

1057
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:54,689
People have been freaking out
because of that news.

1058
01:16:54,944 --> 01:17:00,371
Everyone's been calling to ask if
you're all right.

1059
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:03,283
The corrected news will be out soon.

1060
01:17:04,797 --> 01:17:07,249
Oh yeah.
Did you speak with your father?

1061
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:11,570
Yes, a little while ago.
My dad seemed to be completely fine.

1062
01:17:15,091 --> 01:17:17,421
He usually doesn't get worked up
that easily.

1063
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:18,964
Are you kidding me right now?

1064
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:27,416
I mean his child was potentially hurt
so how could he be completely fine?

1065
01:17:28,286 --> 01:17:30,873
I think Taek takes after his father.

1066
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,933
He's like a stone Buddha!

1067
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,805
But, even so...

1068
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:41,010
...it's only natural for a parent's
heart to break over their child.

1069
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:45,681
No matter how much I think about it,
I don't get it.

1070
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,489
Geez, that bear jerk!

1071
01:17:54,943 --> 01:17:55,952
Are you kidding me right now?

1072
01:17:57,398 --> 01:17:58,399
Excuse me?

1073
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:02,438
It's the first time I've seen
your father freak out like that.

1074
01:18:03,908 --> 01:18:05,627
I thought he was going
to blow a hole in my ear!

1075
01:18:10,706 --> 01:18:11,874
-Um, Manager Lee?
-Yes?

1076
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,187
Just a moment, please.

1077
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:15,754
Ok.
Rest up.

1078
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,155
Hello?

1079
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,035
-Choi Taek?
-Yeah.

1080
01:18:31,353 --> 01:18:34,756
Oh, I had to hear
your voice to make sure.

1081
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:36,310
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

1082
01:18:36,642 --> 01:18:39,362
Hey, what the hell were you doing
that you didn't pick up the phone?

1083
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:43,660
When?
You called me before?

1084
01:18:43,796 --> 01:18:49,181
We kept,
your dad kept crying because of you.

1085
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,508
Hey, it was no joke.

1086
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:58,683
Taek. I thought your dad
was Superman today.

1087
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:00,764
What do you mean?

1088
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:03,299
I don't know where he got such
superhuman strength.

1089
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:07,215
I said, what do you mean?

1090
01:19:31,879 --> 01:19:32,992
What do we do?

1091
01:19:37,437 --> 01:19:38,438
Aigoo.

1092
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:57,554
Here.
I'll do it.

1093
01:20:00,715 --> 01:20:02,257
It's the brown one,
yes, this one.

1094
01:20:04,412 --> 01:20:05,973
Sun Woo, my hands are shaking so much.

1095
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:08,697
Can you call? I don't think
I can do anything.

1096
01:20:08,777 --> 01:20:09,781
Ok. I got it.

1097
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:11,208
Aigoo, what do we do?

1098
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:49,933
[Choi Taek]

1099
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,287
He's not picking up.

1100
01:20:59,884 --> 01:21:03,887
Aigoo! My child!

1101
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,305
-Oppa oppa! It'll be ok!
-Aigoo!

1102
01:21:07,335 --> 01:21:08,762
-Aigoo.
-What do we do?

1103
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:26,989
Hello?

1104
01:21:28,193 --> 01:21:29,994
Hello? We're calling from Korea.

1105
01:21:30,388 --> 01:21:31,390
Who is it?

1106
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:33,914
Is Taek there?
We're Choi Taek, 6-dan's family.

1107
01:21:34,016 --> 01:21:35,078
Is Taek in the room?

1108
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:37,410
He's taking a shower right now.

1109
01:21:37,938 --> 01:21:39,448
Really? You're telling me the truth,
right?

1110
01:21:39,471 --> 01:21:41,223
But, what--

1111
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,899
Where is Taek right now?
Where is he?

1112
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:47,797
This is Taek's father, right?

1113
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,690
Is Taek in the hotel room right now?
Huh?

1114
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,505
Is he in the hotel room?
Huh?

1115
01:21:57,531 --> 01:21:59,924
He really is there, right?

1116
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:04,329
Yes, sir.
He's taking a shower right now.

1117
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:07,403
I saw him go in with my own two eyes.

1118
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,779
But, um, what is it...

1119
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:14,438
He's there?
Huh?

1120
01:22:16,088 --> 01:22:17,169
Hello?

1121
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:22,257
The news is saying that Taek
was in an accident, so.

1122
01:22:23,027 --> 01:22:24,064
What?

1123
01:22:25,842 --> 01:22:27,034
An accident?

1124
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:30,408
Manager Lee, there's huge trouble
because of the media.

1125
01:22:30,806 --> 01:22:32,857
-Please come downstairs, quickly.
-Oh, ok.

1126
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,227
Yes. I understand.

1127
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:51,434
Hello?

1128
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:54,619
Dad!

1129
01:22:56,348 --> 01:22:57,438
Is something the matter?

1130
01:22:57,988 --> 01:22:59,413
I heard it's raining a lot over there.

1131
01:23:00,554 --> 01:23:04,114
Ah, yes, it is.
The weather here isn't too good.

1132
01:23:04,335 --> 01:23:07,250
I see. Make sure you
take care of yourself.

1133
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:09,993
-And make sure to eat properly.
-Ok.

1134
01:23:10,492 --> 01:23:13,901
And make sure you pack
an umbrella in the morning.

1135
01:23:16,607 --> 01:23:21,635
Ok.
I'm hanging up now.

1136
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,256
Way to go.

1137
01:23:53,524 --> 01:23:56,286
You sure kept calm, didn't you, oppa?

1138
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:08,253
Taek.

1139
01:24:08,948 --> 01:24:10,218
Be good to your dad.

1140
01:24:11,017 --> 01:24:14,939
It really seems like you're
everything to him.

1141
01:24:19,392 --> 01:24:20,740
Good night!

1142
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:21,896
Hey!

1143
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,484
It's ok if you lose!

1144
01:24:23,796 --> 01:24:24,797
I'm hanging up!

1145
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:52,287
Mr. Choi! Let's go have a drink!

1146
01:24:52,298 --> 01:24:53,988
Let's have some soju!

1147
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:04,110
Speaking of which, you must have
been really shocked. Are you ok?

1148
01:25:04,657 --> 01:25:05,720
Yes. I'm ok.

1149
01:25:07,327 --> 01:25:10,752
Geez, he's really not human.

1150
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:12,099
No.

1151
01:25:12,132 --> 01:25:15,182
It's not like it was something that
would be resolved by getting worked up.

1152
01:25:15,563 --> 01:25:17,702
Wow, you're a true man!

1153
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:24,062
If it were Bo Ra's dad over here,
he would've been crying up a storm!

1154
01:25:26,383 --> 01:25:28,541
What? It's just us men here.

1155
01:25:29,154 --> 01:25:30,692
What's so embarrassing
about crying?

1156
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,225
Can't men cry a little too?

1157
01:25:35,358 --> 01:25:38,516
You cried?
Did something happen?

1158
01:25:38,986 --> 01:25:41,606
Geez, no, I...
Darn it.

1159
01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:46,004
On the day when Bo Ra's mother
got her physical examination.

1160
01:25:46,696 --> 01:25:50,140
She had to get a biopsy and he latched
onto me, as I was heading home...

1161
01:25:50,202 --> 01:25:54,106
...and cried up a storm!

1162
01:25:56,282 --> 01:26:00,920
What do I do about my poor Il Hwa?

1163
01:26:02,004 --> 01:26:03,190
My poor Il Hwa.

1164
01:26:04,216 --> 01:26:09,006
She had to meet a rotten husband
like me and suffer so much...

1165
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:13,856
...and now it even seems like
she might have a disease.

1166
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:16,381
What do we do?

1167
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,467
My poor Il Hwa!

1168
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:27,326
My poor Il Hwa!

1169
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:31,460
I can't live without my Il Hwa!

1170
01:26:33,656 --> 01:26:35,098
My Il Hwa!

1171
01:26:37,472 --> 01:26:39,256
Il Hwa!

1172
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:44,658
But it's not like a biopsy is a big deal.

1173
01:26:45,009 --> 01:26:48,147
I'm sure everything will be just fine.

1174
01:26:50,357 --> 01:26:53,891
But what if, just what if, she has
a disease or something?

1175
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:57,974
Say something, darn you!

1176
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:02,589
It'll be fine Bo Ra's dad.
I'm sure it's nothing!

1177
01:27:03,712 --> 01:27:07,360
What are you just saying that
because it's not your situation?

1178
01:27:07,385 --> 01:27:08,420
No.

1179
01:27:08,882 --> 01:27:11,475
"It'll be ok?"
You're just saying that!

1180
01:27:12,837 --> 01:27:15,263
My poor Il Hwa!

1181
01:27:15,733 --> 01:27:21,332
I can't live without my Il Hwa!
If she dies, I'll die with her!

1182
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:22,797
I'll just die, too!

1183
01:27:25,327 --> 01:27:29,539
But when the doctor said "Biopsy,"
he was definitely smiling.

1184
01:27:30,256 --> 01:27:35,482
But just if, if!
If Il Hwa is ill.

1185
01:27:35,856 --> 01:27:41,279
How can I raise three kids by myself?

1186
01:27:41,411 --> 01:27:43,042
Three kids!

1187
01:27:44,814 --> 01:27:46,161
I can raise them just fine
without her.

1188
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:48,151
Right?

1189
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:54,487
No, no! Who cares about the kids
when I won't have Il Hwa?

1190
01:27:57,466 --> 01:28:00,513
Everyone around us saw.
It was no joke!

1191
01:28:01,329 --> 01:28:03,667
Seriously, so embarrassing.

1192
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:05,778
What about you? What a man you are!

1193
01:28:06,206 --> 01:28:09,578
You didn't even know how to fix
an iron so you cut the entire wire up!

1194
01:28:10,797 --> 01:28:11,831
Who said that?

1195
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:14,212
There are no such things as
secrets in this neighborhood!

1196
01:28:14,402 --> 01:28:17,316
You didn't even know how
to fix something like that...

1197
01:28:17,362 --> 01:28:19,029
...and chopped it all up?

1198
01:28:21,376 --> 01:28:27,634
There's only one true man in our
neighborhood. Bonghwangdang over here.

1199
01:28:28,112 --> 01:28:29,375
All right, bottoms up!

1200
01:28:35,786 --> 01:28:38,731
But, was your personality
always like that?

1201
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:40,026
Even when you were younger?

1202
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,997
"Mool Ryung Mang Dong,
Jung Joong Yuh San."

1203
01:28:44,547 --> 01:28:47,334
What the hell does that mean?

1204
01:28:48,493 --> 01:28:51,470
It's what Admiral Yi Soon Shin
said to a soldier...

1205
01:28:51,976 --> 01:28:53,523
...quaking in fear during the
Imjin War.

1206
01:28:54,494 --> 01:28:56,031
"Don't act thoughtlessly."

1207
01:28:56,395 --> 01:28:59,172
"A real man should conduct
himself calmly.

1208
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:01,470
And move his body with prudence as
if he were moving a mountain.

1209
01:29:04,902 --> 01:29:06,431
Ahh! A mouse!

1210
01:29:08,114 --> 01:29:11,084
Geez, why is she making such
a huge fuss about one small mouse?

1211
01:29:13,068 --> 01:29:14,918
-What are you doing?
-Over there!

1212
01:29:14,929 --> 01:29:16,630
What the heck!

1213
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:21,111
-Over here!
-Oh my!

1214
01:29:24,285 --> 01:29:26,377
It's gone now.

1215
01:29:27,919 --> 01:29:29,579
She said it's gone!
Get back over here!

1216
01:29:29,933 --> 01:29:31,645
What's with you?

1217
01:29:32,225 --> 01:29:39,925
Oh, oh, it's not because
I was scared.

1218
01:29:40,303 --> 01:29:43,843
I'm fine with literally everything
else but mice are really.

1219
01:29:44,274 --> 01:29:46,581
Geez, aigoo.

1220
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:48,922
-A mouse!
-Where?

1221
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:54,781
Geez.

1222
01:29:55,995 --> 01:29:59,498
I'm telling you this in
case you misunderstand.

1223
01:29:59,935 --> 01:30:03,728
But, honestly,
I'm not scared.

1224
01:30:04,295 --> 01:30:08,610
It's just because I was bitten by
a mouse when I was 6 years old.

1225
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:12,483
Um, so I got an illness sort of thing.

1226
01:30:12,531 --> 01:30:14,115
I guess that mouse
was freakishly huge.

1227
01:30:14,126 --> 01:30:15,859
Yes. It was about the
size of a Jindo dog.

1228
01:30:16,304 --> 01:30:22,995
And because I was bit so hard,
I developed a trauma.

1229
01:30:23,032 --> 01:30:24,217
Oh.

1230
01:30:24,228 --> 01:30:29,309
When I was in the army, I stopped a
wild dog the size of a bull...

1231
01:30:29,417 --> 01:30:32,503
...just by staring it down.

1232
01:30:33,092 --> 01:30:36,003
When I was young,
Superman lived at my house.

1233
01:30:41,323 --> 01:30:45,370
He was a MacGyver-type of guy
who could fix anything in the world...

1234
01:30:46,192 --> 01:30:47,328
Wow!

1235
01:30:49,097 --> 01:30:51,510
-"Esta Bom!"
-"Esta Bom!"

1236
01:30:57,883 --> 01:30:59,325
So the blow dryer's broken, eh?

1237
01:31:00,374 --> 01:31:02,236
Give it here. I'll fix it.

1238
01:31:07,407 --> 01:31:10,513
He was the JJanga who'd appear
out of nowhere...

1239
01:31:10,524 --> 01:31:12,822
...to fix every sort of problem.

1240
01:31:31,506 --> 01:31:35,591
He was the hero of all heroes
who had no weakness.

1241
01:31:37,373 --> 01:31:39,458
-Bye, mister.
-Bye!

1242
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:42,072
-Bye!
-Bye! Let's go.

However, I came to know the truth
after growing out of my childhood.

1244
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,503
He was just not discovered.

I'm almost done fixing it!

1247
01:32:28,233 --> 01:32:31,869
Mi Ran! I can really fix it!
Ok? Give me just one chance!

1248
01:32:32,553 --> 01:32:36,847
I told you, I'm almost done fixing it!

We don't know how many dirty,

...worlds have passed Dad by.

1251
01:33:03,973 --> 01:33:05,012
And only now...

1252
01:33:05,023 --> 01:33:06,295
...I realize...

1253
01:33:08,022 --> 01:33:11,029
...no matter how dirty, petty, unfair,
sad...

1254
01:33:11,061 --> 01:33:15,079
...scary, or difficult,
the reason he endured...

1255
01:33:16,251 --> 01:33:19,124
...was because he had
people to protect.

1256
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:24,305
It's because he had a family.
And he had me.

1257
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:30,659
Because he had to live the world
by the name Dad, and not another.

[Victory at Fujitsu for
Choi Taek, 6-dan!]

1259
01:33:51,456 --> 01:33:54,191
Taek hyung is so amazing.
He won at Fujisu!

1260
01:33:54,523 --> 01:33:57,272
And the prize money was 70,000,000 won!

1261
01:33:58,038 --> 01:34:01,769
Wow, but wait.
What's that, noona?

1262
01:34:02,848 --> 01:34:04,455
I don't know.
Taek gave it to me.

1263
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:05,929
What? Where did he get it?

1264
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,460
Oh, I'm going to die of frustration.

1265
01:34:08,481 --> 01:34:09,648
He must be an idiot!

1266
01:34:09,676 --> 01:34:11,268
That's like the pot
calling the kettle black.

1267
01:34:12,498 --> 01:34:13,499
You have a death wish?

1268
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:17,758
I mean, I asked him to bring me
anything he got from the competition

1269
01:34:17,775 --> 01:34:18,892
...and he brought me that thing.

1270
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,944
I bet it was a hassle in itself,
just bringing that over.

1271
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:22,592
So frustrating! That stupid idiot!

1272
01:34:24,697 --> 01:34:28,717
Soo Yeon. Lend me that pot.
I'll put this kimchi in there.

1273
01:34:28,775 --> 01:34:29,807
Sure.

1274
01:34:34,821 --> 01:34:36,328
You can't! Stop!

But, where did Jung Bong go?

01:35:11,464 --> 01:35:12,818

It was so frustrating to watch that

I won't tell your dad.

Thank you.
