1
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,459
Year 1988

2
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,080
Year 1989,
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:54,053
Stop eating so much so late!
You'll fart up a storm later!

4
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:59,611
Geez... the New Year's holiday is over,
and I have to go back to work tomorrow...

5
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:02,265
I just want to hit somebody.

6
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:06,406
It'd be nice if banks
had vacations too?

7
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:07,937
Right, Dad?

8
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:10,251
Life really feels like it's worth living
because there's no school.

9
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:11,862
You'll be a junior in high school soon!

10
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:14,195
Don't you dare sink any lower
than 1000th place.

11
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,717
What about Duk Seok?
She's in 1000th place too.

12
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:20,032
Even so, she's never gotten lower
than 1000th place.

13
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:21,160
She's better that you are, at least.

14
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:26,839
Yeah. Last month, Duk Seon
jumped up 10 ranks.

15
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,821
Speaking of which,
where's our little Miss 989th Place?

16
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,694
Dooly Supermarket to buy snacks.

17
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,521
Wow, that girl has no fear.

18
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,921
There are so many dangerous
street crimes lately.

19
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,873
What's with you?

20
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:09,114
Darn it. Hey, you surprised me!

21
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,812
Why the hell were you following me?

22
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:14,867
What are you talking about?
This is my house.

23
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,445
Then make some noise
when you walk or something!

24
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,563
What do you mean? Who does that?

25
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,767
Hey, I was about to call out to you too.

26
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:23,861
But you walked so darn fast!
Is someone following you?

27
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,609
You! You! You did!

28
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:31,320
Who the hell followed who?
I was just walking home!

29
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,867
-What's with you?
-I don't know! Whatever!

30
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,518
-Hey!
-What?

31
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,053
Good night.

32
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,956
You bought it, Duk Seon?

33
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,329
-Here.
-Thank you!

34
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,266
What about Sung Bo Ra?

35
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,366
Bo Ra? She's on a date.

36
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:02,170
What? Didn't they break up?

37
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:03,766
I think they got back together.

38
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,310
Oh. So he's her first love?

39
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,066
Duk Seon. Who sings this song?

40
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,216
It's awesome.

41
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:28,175
On the radio? It's Zoo.

42
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:29,494
Can't you tell?

43
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:30,831
What's the title?

44
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,732
That was Zoo's "Hyehwa-dong."

45
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:39,131
Listeners of "Starry Night,"
I have some great news.

46
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:45,931
"Starry Night," which began in 1969
is now 20 years old this year.

47
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:51,131
So we at "Starry Night"
had a bit of an outrageous idea.

48
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,142
You're all curious as
to what it may be, right?

49
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:57,936
"Starry Night" and musicians
who love our shows...

50
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:04,062
...are planning to have
a "Starry Night Jam Concert!"

51
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:09,231
I can hear our audience crying out
all the way from here.

52
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:12,132
Yes, I hear it all the way
from MBC's office.

53
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,377
Since this is our first Jam Concert...

54
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:22,967
...a lot of great musicians from all over
Korea are coming to help us celebrate.

55
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:28,563
First, on the guitar is Lee Chi Hyun
and Lee Moon Sae on the second guitar!

56
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,227
Oh, yeah!

57
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,037
On the drums, Kim Soo Chul!

58
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,725
Wow!

59
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:36,246
On the piano, Woo Soon Shil!

60
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:38,197
On the synthesizer, Kim Chang Nam!

61
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:41,931
Oh, and this person...
he was really hard to get.

62
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:47,431
On the bass guitar, Masam Trio's
Lee Soo Man!

63
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,231
We have one more special...

64
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,653
Did you hear?
Lee Soo Man is playing the bass.

65
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:53,955
The lineup sounds awesome!

66
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,980
A new comedian at "Starry Night,"
Lee Kyung Kyu!

67
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:01,805
Hey! The new comedian, Lee Kyung Kyu
is joining them, too!

68
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:03,486
Who's funnier, me or him?

69
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:08,731
Sun Woo.

70
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:10,131
You're not sleeping?

71
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:11,956
The floor is really warm.

72
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,390
Go home and sleep.

73
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:15,800
Your house is warmer.

74
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:18,832
Would you be able to sleep in the
teacher's lounge, even if it were warm?

75
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:21,295
I'm sleeping.

76
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,423
Would you sleep in the teacher's lounge?

77
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,732
Weirdo.

78
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:35,373
Anyone who loves "Starry Night"
is welcome!

79
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,249
Okay. Let's meet at the Convention Hall...

80
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,431
...at Hanhwa 63 City at 8:00 p.m.
on January 11th.

81
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:46,407
Now, with that bit of great news,
here's the last song.

82
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,293
He's the eldest of the Masam Trio...

83
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,762
...and the one taking on the bass
at our Jam Concert.

84
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,459
He went to the States for a bit
to buy a bass guitar.

85
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,944
Here's Lee Soo Man's "Happiness."

86
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:54,831
I don't see Mr. Choi today.

87
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:57,644
Why isn't he out today?

88
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:00,831
Taek!

89
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,631
Where's your dad?

90
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:03,815
Hello!

91
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:06,225
Where's your dad?
He's not sweeping like usual.

92
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:11,044
He went to Gimhae.
His best friend passed out.

93
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,455
Oh no.

94
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,631
Then come over, Taek!
Let's have breakfast together.

95
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,231
I made braised short ribs!

96
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,211
Yes!

97
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,740
Madam, me too.

98
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,216
Did your mother go somewhere?

99
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,327
No. I just want to eat
braised short ribs.

100
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,199
Is my place the Red Cross
or something?

101
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,685
What's that?

102
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:54,795
It's a charity.

103
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:00,803
Speaking of which,
why are you here, Dong Ryong?

104
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,219
Go eat at your own place!
You guys are well off, too.

105
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:06,285
My mom left for work early,
and the dean's making curry.

106
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,326
How could I not come,
when there's braised short ribs?

107
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,234
How did you know that there were
braised short ribs here?

108
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,191
I can hear everything
from my room.

109
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:14,153
Your father went to Gimhae?

110
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:16,257
Let's watch a video in your room today.

111
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,731
Madam!

112
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:21,810
Oh, you're here?

113
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:22,822
Hey, come and eat.

114
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,393
No thanks. I already ate.

115
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,951
Can you tell your mom
that we enjoyed the japchae?

116
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:27,962
Sure.

117
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,131
Oh yeah. They're having the Starry Night
Jam Concert next week!

118
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,965
-Let's go together.
-It's not pronounced "Jam"...

119
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:37,231
...it's "Jem."

120
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,331
Good for you.

121
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:42,400
Anyway, let's go! Lee Moon Sae,
Lee Chi Hyun, Lee Soo Man!

122
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:46,390
And naturally, Lee Kyung Kyu!

123
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:48,931
I'm down.

124
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,242
What about you?

125
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,131
I have a competition.

126
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,318
I want to go too, but I can't.

127
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:55,494
-I have...
-Whatever. Don't care.

128
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:56,505
Dong Ryong, let's go.

129
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:59,363
I'm going to Jeju Island next week
to visit my older brother.

130
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,193
What the hell?

131
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,414
So you guys want me to go alone
with Jung Hwan?

132
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,432
Let's go next time, then.

133
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,928
I'm going.

134
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:14,632
Just come. I thought you
liked Lee Moon Sae.

135
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,931
Mom!

136
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,432
Where's the crispy rice?

137
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:25,883
Didn't you say you bought
concert tickets too, Sun Woo?

138
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:26,993
For a Lee Sun Hee concert?

139
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,025
Lee Sun Hee?

140
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,221
The one who wears round glasses?

141
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,343
Wow, how do you know who Lee Sun Hee is?

142
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:33,693
I thought you only knew Deulgukhwa.

143
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:35,103
Sun Woo lent me some of her tapes.

144
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:36,912
When's the concert?

145
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,938
The 28th. But you can't come.

146
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,324
What?

147
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,932
I only have two tickets.

148
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:46,405
Who are you going with, then?

149
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:48,831
Thanks, Sun Woo.

150
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,631
What are you saying?
You can't come either.

151
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,632
I have someone I'm going with.

152
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:15,912
What are you doing here?

153
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,545
Bo Ra. Let's go watch Lee Sun Hee
concert with me.

154
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:24,161
I don't want to. Why would I?

155
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,942
It's just a concert ticket.
It has no deep meaning behind it.

156
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,496
Even so, I'm not going with you.

157
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,931
I held back all this time
because I know you're a good kid.

158
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,431
Yeah, you're going through puberty,
so this kind of thing is normal.

159
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:44,932
That's why I let you off the hook,
but I won't be so generous anymore.

160
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:47,931
Stop messing around.

161
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,339
You're only my
younger sister's friend to me.

162
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:51,849
To me, you're just Duk Seon's friend.

163
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,731
So don't cross the line anymore.

164
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:58,132
The fact that you keep doing things like
this makes me annoyed and uncomfortable.

165
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Episode 9: What it Means
to Cross the Line

166
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:24,533
That was freaking awesome!

167
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:27,218
They were right next to me!

168
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,329
Stop it! That hurts!

169
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:31,253
What's with you?

170
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,663
It's so cold.

171
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,931
So why'd you wear a skirt?

172
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,832
Geez, you have no common sense.

173
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,505
How would you go on without me?

174
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,771
What are you talking about?

175
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:50,223
You know, since you seem to live off
the joy you get from tormenting me!

176
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:53,431
Also, when a girl says she's cold, a guy
should give her his jacket or something!

177
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:56,114
Are you crazy? Why should I?

178
00:12:57,337 --> 00:13:01,182
I'm sorry, but could you
take a photo of us?

179
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:02,252
Yes, of course.

180
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:06,962
I'm taking it now.

181
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,294
OK, one, two, three!

182
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,262
Thank you. I'll take
one for you two, too.

183
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,132
-Oh, no thank...
-Yes, thank you.

184
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,717
Can you two stand a bit closer?

185
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:40,632
I'm taking it now.

186
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,032
A bit closer, if you will.

187
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,432
Can you just hurry up and...

188
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,431
I'm taking it now!

189
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,832
One, two, three!

190
00:13:58,553 --> 00:13:59,593
[December 2015]

191
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:03,132
I think he must have liked me
since then.

192
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,631
Look at how he put his hand
on my shoulder.

193
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:09,932
Look at that expression.
He's so happy.

194
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,732
Well, she was pretty back then.

195
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:16,849
What about now, honey?

196
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:19,638
Want me to pass you a mirror?

197
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:22,232
Hey!

198
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,131
What's this?

199
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,232
He's had the store closed
for so long.

200
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:40,662
He's the type to keep the store open
even on holidays, though...

201
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:42,799
Sun Young!

202
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,505
-Yes?
-Come in. Let's play cards.

203
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:47,637
Cards? Okay!

204
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,493
Let's play!

205
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:21,843
How could this happen?

206
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:29,732
That jerk and I were
supposed to go to Jirisan next month...

207
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,414
Moo Sung.

208
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,449
Are we already at this age?

209
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:46,584
Is 45 years old really an acceptable age
to die?

210
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:55,232
His young girl is just 10 years old.

211
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,431
There's no set order
when it comes to dying.

212
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:02,632
This is just the way life is.

213
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:05,621
What's the point of living intensely?

214
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:08,592
People live and die in a day.

215
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:23,296
Let's see here...

216
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:25,511
All right!

217
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,731
I don't see Jung Bong around.
Did he go somewhere?

218
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:32,472
Oh. He went to a Buddhist temple.

219
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,687
A Buddhist temple?

220
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:36,110
Why? Is he sick again?

221
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,426
No. He said he's just going
to get some fresh air.

222
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:41,583
I guess he wants to think about
a lot of things on his own.

223
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,594
He really likes Buddhist temples.

224
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,304
He's the only Buddhist
in our family.

225
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:48,362
Even so, I'm sure the food there
won't suit his tastes.

226
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:52,214
Do you know what Jung Bong likes most
after ramyun?

227
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,231
Herbs and greens.

228
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:57,731
He goes nuts for bibimbap
with greens and herbs in it.

229
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,632
It's not easy to gain weight
on herbs and greens either, you know.

230
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,862
Excuse me, sir...

231
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,961
I'll have just one more bowl.

232
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,211
Peace be with you.

233
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:58,932
Ms. Kang Man Soon!
Are you there?

234
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,116
Excuse me.

235
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:03,946
Why are you looking for Kang Man Soon?

236
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,029
Are you Kang Man Soon?

237
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,913
No, I'm not, but I live here.

238
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:09,932
Oh, you live here, ma'am?

239
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:11,931
What's your name?

240
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,631
Kim Sun Young.

241
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,731
Oh. And what's your relationship
with Kang Man Soon?

242
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:17,280
She's my mother-in-law.

243
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,975
Can you sign here, please?

244
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,998
Right here.

245
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,093
Seoul District Court, Northern Branch

246
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:31,405
What is this?

247
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,878
It says that our house
will be auctioned off!

248
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,133
What is all this?

249
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:40,861
Ms. Kang Man Soon put your house up
as collateral when taking out a loan.

250
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,048
Excuse me?

251
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,058
What do you mean by that?

252
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:48,814
Ms. Kang Man Soon
didn't repay her debt to the bank...

253
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:52,321
...so we're foreclosing your home.

254
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:55,003
The amount you'll need to
reclaim it is... let's see...

255
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,536
...10 million won.

256
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:59,143
If you don't pay us 10 million won
by the first of next month...

257
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:02,114
...the court will proceed
with the foreclosing process.

258
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:06,411
You still have time, so you just have
to pay us back by then to nullify this.

259
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:10,664
Why should I repay money
that I didn't even borrow?

260
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:16,831
Please stop saying nonsensical things.
They have no authority to do this!

261
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:20,631
Please cancel this auction
or foreclosing thing, right now!

262
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,631
The property is under
Ms. Kang Man Soon's name.

263
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,735
Thus, she's the homeowner
and there are no issues on our end.

264
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,532
The home is only hers by name!
This is my house!

265
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:34,592
This is the home that my husband
gave to me!

266
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,230
Please discuss that with the person
who took out the loan.

267
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:39,980
I'll be hanging up now.

268
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:41,473
Hello?

269
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,568
Hello!

270
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,987
What do I do now?

271
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:51,131
Mother-in-Law!
How could you do this?

272
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:53,931
How will we live now?

273
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:56,894
Am I supposed to just let my child
go to jail?

274
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,931
Are you saying that we're strangers now?

275
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,747
The person who was hurt is dying...

276
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:03,354
...but they said that we just had to pay
them to keep my child out of jail.

277
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,853
Would you feel better if they
went to jail instead?

278
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:10,160
Even so, you should have
left this house alone!

279
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,725
How could you do this?

280
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:14,760
Oh my, how could you not
even have 10 million won?

281
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:18,632
Just how do you manage to use up
all of my son's pension?

282
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:24,232
I don't know if you're going to host
clubs  or seeing other men but...

283
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,835
...don't forget that you're doing
that with my child's own life.

284
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,626
What a fate you have.

285
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:33,978
You live in my house
and receive my son's money.

286
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:35,886
What a nice life you live.

287
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:39,535
Anyway, whatever.

288
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,987
Send the kids to my place
when the place gets foreclosed.

289
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:47,232
I can raise them so much better
than you ever could.

290
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,741
What the hell is this?

291
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,245
What do I do?

292
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:57,474
What do I do now?

293
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,898
How could this happen?

294
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,535
Huh, this is really easy.

295
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:23,735
Wow... you really can't dance.

296
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:25,935
How could you be that bad?

297
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,936
You do it, then!

298
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:33,336
Why do I miss you so much?

299
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:37,227
Why can't I see myself?

300
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,612
I'm sure you know how I feel...

301
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:41,436
You can't do this?

302
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,085
You piss me off.

303
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,225
-Duk Seon.
-Yeah?

304
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:50,336
Call Taek.
Tell him to come eat dinner here.

305
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:55,535
Even so, come eat dinner here.
You have to have dinner, at least.

306
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:57,922
It's okay. I don't have an appetite.

307
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:00,236
Okay.

308
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:03,536
Mom, he says he doesn't want to eat!

309
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:06,553
I guess he's holed up in his room again!
Leave him be, Mom.

310
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,379
I'm sure he'll feed himself
if he gets hungry.

311
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:16,984
Give this to him, and don't you dare
spill it on the way there!

312
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:19,137
Tell him to eat it while it's hot!

313
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:24,736
Taekkie sure knows how
to inconvenience other people...

314
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:30,836
Geez... so annoying...

315
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:37,485
Where are you going?

316
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,754
I thought you said
you weren't having dinner.

317
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:43,875
I want to rest my head a bit.

318
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,035
Is that mine?

319
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,335
Yeah.

320
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,764
Let's eat together at my place then.

321
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,536
Okay. Give that here.

322
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,046
Choi Taek.

323
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,756
What's with you?

324
00:22:57,534 --> 00:23:00,325
Why, what did I do wrong?

325
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,769
Aren't you cold?

326
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:03,564
Your house is right here, though
It's fine.

327
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,800
You're always making me
worried about you.

328
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:10,317
Hurry it up.

329
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:20,625
Here you are.

330
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:22,358
Eat up.

331
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:24,808
When is your father coming back?

332
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:26,835
Tomorrow morning.

333
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:28,622
He said he's left the store
for too long.

334
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,559
I guess he must have been really close
to him to have left his store that long.

335
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,366
They were like the Three Musketeers.

336
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,585
My Dad, Mr. Tae Yong
and the one who passed away.

337
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:40,513
Is that right?

338
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,208
Thank you for the meal.

339
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:44,261
Sure! Eat up!

340
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,735
Hello?

341
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:49,025
Yeah. Yes.
What's up?

342
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:51,519
Okay, hold on.
I'll be right over.

343
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:54,181
I'm going to Sun Woo's for a bit.
Eat up, Taek.

344
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,092
-Yes.
-If you want more rice, ask Duk Seon...

345
00:23:57,874 --> 00:24:00,974
I'm helping him out!
He doesn't eat that much.

346
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:07,227
That mother-in-law is just too much.

347
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:11,138
What about her grandkids?
She wants to throw them on the street?

348
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,468
She says that she'll raise them.

349
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:18,040
And she said if I don't like that...

350
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:21,504
...I should sell this house
and move to a smaller one.

351
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:23,640
What a twisted old wretch!

352
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:26,185
She pisses me off!

353
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:30,705
But where will you get 10 million won?
Geez...

354
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:32,811
You have to give it to the bank
by the end of this month?

355
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,069
Yes.

356
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,570
If I repay the money to a nice bank
by the end of the month...

357
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:42,160
...they said that the foreclosure thing
will automatically disappear.

358
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:44,798
She's basically telling me to go die.

359
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:49,886
I barely manage to scrape by
every month with 300,000 won.

360
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:52,526
Where will I get 10 million won?

361
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:55,413
She's telling me to go die!

362
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:59,559
If it were just a couple
million won, I could do something...

363
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:04,425
...but I spent a lot last month on
Jung Bong's surgery so I don't have much.

364
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,932
Even so, I'll try my best
to try and get some money for you.

365
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:09,832
I have about 2 million won
that I hid away from my husband.

366
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:13,255
I'll go and borrow money
from some people I know.

367
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,449
No, no, it's fine!

368
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,485
Please don't say things like that.

369
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,851
I have a sense of decency.

370
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:25,558
I'm sure the money I've borrowed
from you both amounts to a lot as it is.

371
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,131
This time, I'll try and figure
something out of my own.

372
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,112
And if it doesn't work out,
it can't be helped.

373
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:34,743
I'll have to move out.

374
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,349
Sun Young. It's okay.

375
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,824
You don't have to feel ashamed
by feeling indebted to others.

376
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:45,025
It's okay to feel that way.

377
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:48,725
It's okay.

378
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:50,598
I...

379
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:54,453
I'm really okay.

380
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:56,028
I'll take care of it.

381
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:06,329
Missus.

382
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:20,503
Isn't life... and this world...
so unfair?

383
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:29,267
Even though I borrowed money
here and there from you two...

384
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:32,793
...I've never taken out huge loans

385
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:38,339
...or been hugely indebted
to others all my life.

386
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:44,582
And what about my Sun Woo?

387
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:50,466
He hates seeing me suffer
so he doesn't want me doing dishes...

388
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,777
...or doing other part time jobs.

389
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:55,500
And because of that...

390
00:26:55,591 --> 00:27:01,921
...he's never asked for brand name
goods his whole life.

391
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:05,424
Yeah. Where could you find
a better child than Sun Woo?

392
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:08,725
It's because you raised him so well.

393
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,390
Even though I've lived like that...

394
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:15,283
I've lived like that all my life...

395
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:19,097
but even so, it seems
that the three of us...

396
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,163
...will be cast out into the streets
in this cold weather.

397
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,225
Sun Young.

398
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:36,898
Madam... is life so hard for just me?

399
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:41,308
Why is mine so difficult?

400
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,254
Mom, your son's home!

401
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,221
You're here, my son?

402
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:20,683
You're hungry, right? Wash up.
I bought some tangerines for you.

403
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,438
Okay. What about Jin Joo?

404
00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:24,843
She's already asleep.

405
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:26,847
Mom, you go to sleep first.
I'll go to sleep later.

406
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:30,391
Is your wrist okay?
I told you to go to the doctor.

407
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,024
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll go.

408
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:34,903
You always say you will,
but you don't...

409
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,739
I'll really go!

410
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,639
Stop worrying so much.

411
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,204
Should I bring you the tangerines
to your room?

412
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,252
Yeah.

413
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:03,085
Sun Woo's College Fund

414
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:20,253
Wow!

415
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,070
Hey, Mr. Choi!
When did you get back?

416
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:27,134
How about a drink this evening?

417
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:48,332
Wow... it's already 6:00 p.m.
Tour of Duty is on, huh?

418
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,259
How does time pass by so quickly
on Sundays?

419
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:57,927
I'm going out for a bit.
Have dinner and go to sleep early.

420
00:30:58,729 --> 00:30:59,804
You're going out to drink again,
aren't you?

421
00:31:00,178 --> 00:31:02,766
The important thing
isn't the alcohol.

422
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:06,754
Mr. Choi's friend abruptly passed away.

423
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:10,988
So it's to console him,
not because I want to drink.

424
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:13,223
Nice excuse you've got there.

425
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:17,446
How do you manage to find
so many reasons to go drinking?

426
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,933
That's a real talent
you've got there.

427
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:25,533
I told you today,
it's really all about consoling Mr. Choi.

428
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:29,165
I'll just have one glass and come home.

429
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,653
So have dinner
and go to sleep early.

430
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:36,498
No Eul, help out your mother.

431
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,763
I'll bet he's so sad!

432
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,416
Have a safe night.

433
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:43,034
I'm sure he won't
even be in the right mind.

434
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:56,734
Mr. Choi! I'm here!

435
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,194
Mr. Choi.

436
00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:05,895
Mr. Choi! I'm here!

437
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:08,806
Mr. Choi, wake up!
Mr. Choi!

438
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:11,008
Mr. Choi, wake up!
Mr. Choi!

439
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,140
Mr. Choi, wake up!
Mr. Choi!

440
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:14,188
Mr. Choi.

441
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,171
Mr. Choi!

442
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:33,996
What a close call.

443
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,551
I was so shocked...

444
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:41,913
If you'd brought him 30 minutes later,
he would have become a vegetable.

445
00:32:41,914 --> 00:32:46,167
Oh my God...
Is he okay now?

446
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,718
Yes. Thankfully,
you discovered him early...

447
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:50,744
...so he doesn't have any
life-threatening conditions.

448
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,238
He almost died.

449
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,559
-Oh my...
-Oh my...

450
00:32:55,104 --> 00:33:00,460
But a brain hemorrhage
surgery is a big deal.

451
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,413
Did his surgery go well?

452
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,813
He has high blood pressure,
so he should've been more careful.

453
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,876
Even so, there wasn't too much
hemorrhaging, so the surgery ended well.

454
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,286
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

455
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:12,909
He'll regain consciousness soon.

456
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,406
We'll have to continue monitoring him
but he'll be able to eat and talk soon.

457
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:19,971
His hands may tremble.

458
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:24,603
This is a common symptom after brain
hemorrhages, so you don't need to worry.

459
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,313
If he takes care of himself well,
it'll cease after time.

460
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:28,413
-Yes.
-Yes.

461
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,985
At any rate, you saved his life.

462
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:35,894
It's very rare that a brain hemorrhage
patient is discovered so early.

463
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:37,727
Oh... yes.

464
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:45,221
He's such a nice guy
so I guess he was blessed.

465
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:49,178
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Yes.

466
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:53,815
What a relief.

467
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:59,134
I feel so bad for him.

468
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,813
He doesn't have a wife
and I can't reach Taek...

469
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:05,858
Hey, you heard what
he said, right?

470
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,303
Alcohol saved his life!

471
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:14,755
Oh, all right, already.

472
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:16,966
Can you call the Baduk Club
one more time?

473
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:32,713
When are you going to the hospital?

474
00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:34,713
I was about to head out soon.
What's that?

475
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:37,613
Oh, I made some rice porridge. I thought
anything else would be too much.

476
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:39,254
He can eat starting today, right?

477
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,499
Yes, he'll be allowed to eat
starting this evening.

478
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:43,297
Oh, really?

479
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:45,293
Then I'll have to grill him some croakers
when it's my turn.

480
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm sure fish would be better
than red meat.

481
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,764
Wow, I'm sure he'll be so happy,
eating croakers!

482
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:54,948
But he didn't hire
a personal nurse, right?

483
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,975
Probably not.

484
00:34:57,483 --> 00:35:00,282
I don't know what he's planning to do
with all the money he has.

485
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:02,592
It'd be so convenient for him
to have a personal nurse.

486
00:35:02,797 --> 00:35:04,194
We can make him food,
but I'm sure...

487
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:06,662
...it'd be really difficult for him
to use the bathroom and wash up.

488
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:09,213
It's because he's always been alone.

489
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:11,050
I'm sure Taek will
be in and out.

490
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:12,748
He takes good care
of himself, so...

491
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:13,994
...you don't need to worry.

492
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,462
Wow, looks delicious.

493
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:17,707
-Wow, look at this.
-It's nothing much.

494
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:19,218
Looks yummy.

495
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,312
Mr. Choi Moo Sung?
I'll be taking your blood pressure.

496
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,541
Why are you sitting up?
I'm sure you're dizzy.

497
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:50,971
Your guardian isn't here?

498
00:35:51,176 --> 00:35:53,451
Your hands will be shaking a lot...

499
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:55,648
...and you'll be very uncomfortable
for the time being.

500
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,986
Oh, I do have one...
my son.

501
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:01,776
Oh... the famous one?

502
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:04,358
But I heard he's very busy.

503
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:07,047
The doctor told me
that he just met him today.

504
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,381
Your father is a very lucky case.

505
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,018
When people usually pass out from
blood hemorrhages...

506
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:14,120
...they're rendered paralyzed
or become aphasic...

507
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,519
...but your father was
very quickly discovered

508
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:19,461
...so he'll have no time
re-assimilating into society.

509
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,412
The surgery ended well, too.

510
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,772
He'll be able to be discharged
after a week or so.

511
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:28,416
Thank you.

512
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,949
We've overcome a huge hurdle
so don't worry too much.

513
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:33,169
All you have to do is take care
of him well from here on in.

514
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:35,759
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

515
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:38,871
Also...

516
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:46,253
...can I have your autograph?

517
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,841
Oh... yes.

518
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:02,001
I'm fine.

519
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:03,867
Really.

520
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,216
They said that you almost died.

521
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,772
I almost became an orphan.

522
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,674
I can't leave you behind so easily.

523
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:17,094
Hey.

524
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:19,921
Everything ended
without a hitch...

525
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,618
...so don't worry and focus
on your own stuff.

526
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:26,209
Get a personal nurse, Dad.

527
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:30,388
My limbs are fine,
so why would I need one? No.

528
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:32,199
I'm going to China this week.

529
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:34,424
I won't be by your side, so
how will you manage on your own?

530
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:38,388
The ladies come by once a day.

531
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:42,853
I'm fine, so worry about
your own stuff. Okay?

532
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,065
But... what do we do?

533
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:49,035
I heard that Mr. Lee
from the Baduk Club...

534
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,797
...won't be able to go
with you this time, either.

535
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:55,077
Then I'll have to go to China with you.

536
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:56,455
It's fine.

537
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,038
The chief is coming with me.

538
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,960
And I'll be fine if I go alone.

539
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,538
But even so, someone has to stick by you
and take care of you.

540
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,788
Just worry about yourself.

541
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:12,434
Mr. Guardian? We have to take care
of the subtotal for the hospital fees.

542
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:13,484
Yes.

543
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,928
-Yes?
-Hey, you! I'm here!

544
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,709
-The one who saved...
-Hurry up!

545
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,146
Hello!

546
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:35,775
Oh, you're here?

547
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,102
Speaking of which,
are you feeling okay?

548
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,215
Are your hands shaking a lot?

549
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:41,717
I've gotten a lot better.

550
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,489
Ms. Mi Ran made you some rice porridge.

551
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,056
Have some with some doenjang soup.

552
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:47,284
Oh, thank you.

553
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:51,441
Oh yeah. If you want anything,
let me know.

554
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:54,981
I'll bring it to you
on my way home from work.

555
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:58,288
I do have one request.

556
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:05,088
Since you've saved my life,
can I ask you for one more favor?

557
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,589
But... why her?

558
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:53,143
There's Jung Hwan and Sun Woo too.

559
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,472
Duk Seon?

560
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,686
Our second daughter?
Ms. 989th Place?

561
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:01,198
You're talking about Duk Seon
right now?

562
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,810
This time, Taek is going to China...

563
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:07,830
...and I was wondering
if she could go with him.

564
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:10,580
When he goes abroad for a competition...

565
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:13,996
...Mr. Lee from the Baduk Club
or I always go with him.

566
00:40:14,075 --> 00:40:17,274
But this time, neither of us can make it.

567
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:22,299
If someone doesn't take care of him,
he's like a corpse in his room.

568
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:23,765
He doesn't come out at all.

569
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:27,676
So, all she has to do
is make sure that he eats.

570
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:31,903
Oh my. You must not be
in your right mind.

571
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:34,492
That girl is a total idiot
who doesn't know anything.

572
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:36,404
Duk Seon will do well.

573
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:39,277
And Taek will be more comfortable
with her than with anyone else.

574
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,858
But there's Jung Hwan
and Sun Woo, too.

575
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:46,574
Those two will be seniors in high school
soon, so they have to study...

576
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,358
Oh, no.

577
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:53,967
That's not what I meant
to say was...

578
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,749
-...that is...
-No, no, I get it.

579
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:58,227
What you're saying is right.

580
00:40:58,238 --> 00:41:03,238
The only kid on our block who
doesn't study is Duk Seon.

581
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:05,908
No, that's not it.

582
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:10,381
It seems that it takes a while
for guys to get their passports.

583
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:12,605
They said that it takes
a couple of months.

584
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:14,456
But Duk Seon is a girl.

585
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:18,748
So she can get one in a couple days
if the Baduk Club helps out.

586
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:27,787
Oh... if it's difficult,
you don't need to send her.

587
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,487
I just asked, just in case.

588
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:35,352
No, it's nothing like that it's just
because I feel bad for Taek.

589
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:37,618
Taek's scary when he gets angry,
isn't he?

590
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:41,884
No. Taek likes Duk Seon.

591
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,824
I'm sure that the two of them
will get along fine.

592
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,831
I'll bet Taek feels so ashamed.

593
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,268
Who's taking care of who, exactly?

594
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,980
Duk Seon.
Where did you get that suitcase?

595
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:58,103
From Taek's room.

596
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:59,262
What about the camera?

597
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,987
It's Taek's.

598
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,778
Thieving wretch.

599
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,089
It's okay. He won't notice anyway.
He's an idiot.

600
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,688
How can you call your older sister
a thieving wretch, you jerk?

601
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:24,688
Guangzhou, China
TV Baduk Asia Championship Finals

602
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,837
Wow, why all the luggage?

603
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:38,711
Is this all yours, Miss?

604
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:41,899
Oh, yes.
It's my first time abroad, so...

605
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,702
I brought everything
just in case.

606
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,524
You're friends with
Choi Taek, 6-dan?

607
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:49,472
Yes. We're neighbors.
We're childhood friends.

608
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:55,988
Master Choi has such a cute friend.
I'm jealous.

609
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,035
Are you his girlfriend?

610
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:00,093
Excuse me?
What are you saying?

611
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:01,507
We're just friends.

612
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:04,304
But, are you from
the Baduk Club too, Mister?

613
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:05,913
Do you play Baduk too?

614
00:43:05,938 --> 00:43:07,637
These two are reporters.

615
00:43:09,305 --> 00:43:11,404
Wow as to be expected,
your cameras are awesome!

616
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:14,251
This guy here is a newbie too.

617
00:43:14,398 --> 00:43:16,397
It's his first time abroad.

618
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:20,178
It's the first time abroad
for you too, right, Mr. Yoo?

619
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:22,214
I've been to Japan once or twice before.

620
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:24,016
Here are your room keys.

621
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:25,541
This concludes
your check-in process.

622
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:26,752
Oh, thank you.

623
00:43:29,288 --> 00:43:31,488
We all can use the same room.

624
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:34,587
This one is for Ms. Duk Seon... room 403.

625
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:37,498
And this one is for Master Choi...
room 405.

626
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:38,750
I asked them to give you two
rooms across from each other...

627
00:43:38,761 --> 00:43:39,684
...so it'll be easy
to go back and forth.

628
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,654
Also, this is a spare key
for Master Choi's room.

629
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:45,451
Hold onto this, Duk Seon.

630
00:43:46,277 --> 00:43:50,233
He passed out in his room one time,
so keep it just in case.

631
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,988
Ah... yes.

632
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,134
This is your room key. Room 405.

633
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:09,508
Okay.

634
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,979
We've decided to have dinner
at this hotel's Chinese restaurant.

635
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:13,923
You just need to come
to the lobby by 6:00 p.m.

636
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:18,429
I'll head up first. I'll go on ahead.

637
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:22,635
I'll come get you by 5:55 p.m.

638
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:25,978
He won't come.

639
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:28,028
He doesn't eat before matches.

640
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:31,475
And during competitions in China,
he really doesn't eat much.

641
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:34,463
He can't digest well, and the food
doesn't really suit his palate.

642
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:37,323
He's a bit sensitive before matches.

643
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,540
Mister...

644
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:43,394
...do they have tangsooyook
Korean-Chinese fusion dish here?

645
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:49,611
I bet it'll be delicious.

646
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,160
Yeah. Sure.

647
00:44:57,182 --> 00:44:59,760
Wow... what the heck?

648
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:01,341
Can I eat all of this?

649
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:02,751
Yeah. Hurry and sit.

650
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,970
Yes!

651
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:07,617
How's Master Choi?

652
00:45:07,628 --> 00:45:09,027
He says he'll eat later.

653
00:45:09,888 --> 00:45:11,303
I knew this would happen.

654
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:14,489
Even so, he would've acted like
he were eating if his father were here.

655
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:20,592
Is this place famous?

656
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:22,156
They make great food here.

657
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:24,691
This city is near the sea,
so they make great fish dishes.

658
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,552
What other restaurants
have good food?

659
00:45:28,788 --> 00:45:31,412
I heard that there's a famous
Japanese place around here.

660
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:34,256
Oh the place across the street?
The sushi place?

661
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,537
It is famous, but we can't go there.

662
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:39,628
How come? Can't we have dinner
there tomorrow?

663
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:42,745
It's way too crowded so we have
to wait in line for at least an hour.

664
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,808
You eat well. You really do.

665
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:53,619
I have no food at home, so...

666
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:01,889
Wow, who has that kind of money?

667
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:04,519
That's too cruel!

668
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,902
How can such a vile creature
be a human?

669
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:07,956
How could she take that house away?

670
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:12,069
Sun Young. Want me
to go beat them all up?

671
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:16,610
It's fine. That won't solve anything.

672
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:21,664
Forget about that. Just
take care of yourself, Tae Soo.

673
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,842
Is this the time to be worrying
about me right now?

674
00:46:24,404 --> 00:46:26,462
Where do we get 10 million won?

675
00:46:26,948 --> 00:46:28,869
I'll take care of everything.

676
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:33,494
Don't you say a word about this to Mom.
Got that?

677
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,119
All right.

678
00:46:35,558 --> 00:46:37,358
Okay. I'm hanging up.

679
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:49,184
Sun Young. I made some short ribs.

680
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,608
Take this with you when you're going
to visit Mr. Choi tomorrow.

681
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:53,031
He can eat things like this now, right?

682
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,152
Yeah. I'll get your plate from him
tomorrow, too.

683
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,381
Can you watch Jin Joo for me?

684
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:02,755
Even so, Mr. Choi is doing well
even without a nurse.

685
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:04,582
Amazing, really.

686
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:06,110
Good for him.

687
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:07,662
Looks great.

688
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:01,739
Wow, what's this? Ribs?

689
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,569
Oh, speaking of which.

690
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:06,909
I wonder if our Duk Seon is doing well?

691
00:48:07,703 --> 00:48:09,810
I'll bet she's prancing around.

692
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,990
I'm worried that she's going
to cause trouble.

693
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,716
Not too big, but one or two
small incidents.

694
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:24,787
Bathroom! Broken!

695
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,494
So much water, all night!

696
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:31,174
I couldn't sleep all night!
Okay? Okay?

697
00:48:31,634 --> 00:48:35,287
The room is too cold!
I almost froze to death!

698
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:37,942
My lips almost became like this!

699
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:40,787
Wow... well, she's justified
in acting like that.

700
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:43,687
I couldn't sleep all night, either.

701
00:48:43,813 --> 00:48:47,182
I heard the water from the bathroom
all night.

702
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:48,985
I almost froze to death.

703
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:50,352
The window wouldn't close.

704
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:52,905
I'm sure she must have been
even more uncomfortable, as a girl.

705
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:55,528
I think all the rooms on our floor
are like that.

706
00:48:57,973 --> 00:49:00,245
I'll bet that Master Choi
won't be in such good condition.

707
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:02,355
First come, best served.

708
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:04,288
Really?

709
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:07,488
It's something that happens often.

710
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:09,961
Master Choi is late today.

711
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:10,947
I wonder if he overslept?

712
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,057
The competition
is on the 7th floor, right?

713
00:49:13,068 --> 00:49:15,568
I'll bet that the Chinese reporters
got the best spots already.

714
00:49:46,488 --> 00:49:47,688
Excuse me.

715
00:50:08,368 --> 00:50:11,368
[Choi Taek, 6-dan's
Waiting Room]

716
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:29,884
There's still 30 minutes left.

717
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:32,642
Then we wait here until then?

718
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:36,164
Yeah. He won't come out of there
before the game, no matter what.

719
00:50:36,338 --> 00:50:37,738
It's his alone time.

720
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:40,931
I'm going to the bathroom.

721
00:50:41,012 --> 00:50:42,012
Yes.

722
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:08,859
Mr. Choi! Can you pose for me?

723
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:13,766
I'm sorry but can you leave?

724
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:19,288
Oh... yes. I'm sorry.

725
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:22,922
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

726
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:25,614
I ought to beat you to death!

727
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:26,961
He doesn't even drink
a glass of water before a match!

728
00:51:26,972 --> 00:51:28,969
Even for lesser types
of competitions, too!

729
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:31,298
I ought to really...

730
00:51:32,017 --> 00:51:34,588
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

731
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:39,162
The match is starting. Please enter.

732
00:51:39,173 --> 00:51:40,173
Oh, thank you.

733
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,690
Hello?

734
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:12,091
Tae Yong! Why are you calling?

735
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:15,963
Geez... Tae Soo told you,
didn't he?

736
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,973
He went to you already
and told you, huh?

737
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:23,034
I'm looking into it. Don't worry.

738
00:52:23,764 --> 00:52:27,260
I know that you don't have money!
It's fine!

739
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:30,405
It's not like 10 million won
is small change.

740
00:52:33,614 --> 00:52:36,714
I know that you have a rich friend.

741
00:52:38,472 --> 00:52:41,028
Okay. I'll talk to them.

742
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:43,459
The person borrowing the money
should ask directly, shouldn't they?

743
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:46,187
I'll ask them, so don't you say a word.

744
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:49,474
I told you, I really will!

745
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:51,518
I'll call them!

746
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,476
Okay, okay. Got it. Okay, bye.

747
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:06,991
Dong Jin Real Estate

748
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,607
Come in.

749
00:53:44,991 --> 00:53:47,723
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

750
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:50,753
Mister, what happened with Taek?

751
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:52,592
Victor.

752
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,632
I'm saying he won.

753
00:53:55,643 --> 00:53:57,082
Oh! Is it all over now, then?

754
00:53:57,093 --> 00:53:59,918
No, he has to win two out of three.
This is only the first game.

755
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:03,788
If he wins tomorrow, he's the winner,
but if not, he has to play a third round.

756
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:05,896
Oh.

757
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:26,549
Taek, get out. We're here.

758
00:54:27,975 --> 00:54:29,185
Okay.

759
00:54:29,408 --> 00:54:32,407
Tonight's dinner is Korean food.
I'll come get you later.

760
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,272
I don't want any.

761
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,300
Just wake me up tomorrow.

762
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:40,613
Okay.

763
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:46,770
He won't come.

764
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:48,738
What do I do?

765
00:54:48,848 --> 00:54:52,314
What do you mean? He'll probably eat
tomorrow, after this is all over.

766
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:53,910
What do I do?

767
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,447
I think I'll eat a lot, Mister.

768
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:00,223
I'm so hungry.

769
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:08,406
The chairmen of Student
Associations...

770
00:55:08,478 --> 00:55:10,111
...from colleges in the Seoul
area held a meeting

771
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:14,511
...and demanded that legislators run
the country as a proper democracy.

772
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,390
About 10 students were injured...

773
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,700
Bo Ra came home early, right?

774
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:21,031
She came home a while ago
and is sleeping.

775
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:37,672
This girl... if she protests
like that again...

776
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:39,833
...I'll shave her bald
and send her off to a temple.

777
00:55:41,394 --> 00:55:42,503
Oh yeah.

778
00:55:43,024 --> 00:55:47,913
Speaking of which, Jung Bong
is still at a temple, right?

779
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,054
Which one is it?

780
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,838
It's a really famous one.
A real brand name one.

781
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:54,902
What are you saying?

782
00:55:55,323 --> 00:55:56,972
All Buddhist temples are the same.

783
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:59,607
There's no such thing as
brand names among them.

784
00:55:59,714 --> 00:56:02,214
There's one that's always on TV lately.

785
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:10,937
I wonder if he had breakfast.

786
00:57:11,368 --> 00:57:12,930
The breakfast they have here
is great.

787

01:13:19,923 --> 01:13:22,222
I was in peak condition this time around.

951
01:13:22,502 --> 01:13:23,702
Excuse me?

952
01:13:24,117 --> 01:13:25,842
You... you ate?

953
01:13:26,382 --> 01:13:27,501
Yes.

954
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:29,675
You weren't the one who
bought it for me?

955
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:31,016
Me?

956
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:32,804
What do you mean?

957
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,080
Taek!
I made you a fried egg!

958
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:47,948
Jang Pyo! Thank you!

959
01:14:02,072 --> 01:14:05,182
[Japanese Food "Welcome!"]

960
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,365
Bathroom! Broken!

961
01:14:29,438 --> 01:14:34,155
So much water, all night!
I couldn't sleep all night!

962
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:37,832
Okay? Okay?
The room is too cold!

963
01:14:37,904 --> 01:14:40,364
I almost froze to death!

964
01:14:40,718 --> 01:14:44,292
My lips almost became like this!

965
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:47,000
My friend is a national treasure
of Korea!

966
01:14:47,136 --> 01:14:51,029
If you don't change our rooms,
we could have an international conflict!

967
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:53,007
Okay? Okay?

968
01:14:53,096 --> 01:14:55,899
Change our room!
Okay?

969
01:14:56,018 --> 01:14:58,112
Okay?

970
01:15:02,918 --> 01:15:04,418
Thank you!

971
01:16:02,755 --> 01:16:05,539
Darn it... Sung Duk Seon!

972
01:16:26,484 --> 01:16:27,981
Jang Pyo, this one is burnt, though.

973
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,165
This one is burnt. Look at the color.

974
01:16:31,812 --> 01:16:32,851
The burnt part tastes better.

975
01:16:32,866 --> 01:16:35,044
No, this isn't right.
It's burnt.

976
01:16:35,743 --> 01:16:37,221
It's tastier.

977
01:16:37,295 --> 01:16:39,994
Okay, okay.
Then just make me one more.

978
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:40,787
What?

979
01:16:40,798 --> 01:16:42,596
Make me just one more
because it's burnt.

980
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,430
It's tastier.

981
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:46,659
Okay, come on.
Just one more.

982
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:48,605
-Come on?
-Yes, Jang Pyo. Thank you.

983
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:50,998
Your friend is great.

984
01:16:51,089 --> 01:16:52,594
She's better than your father.

985
01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:56,763
Oh yeah. I'll make a call
and come right back.

986
01:16:59,526 --> 01:17:03,735
You've worked hard. I'm fine.

987
01:17:04,058 --> 01:17:05,950
Yeah. The ladies
come by the hospital every day.

988
01:17:06,736 --> 01:17:09,812
What about Duk Seon?
Did you buy her a lot of delicious food?

989
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,949
Really?

990
01:17:13,153 --> 01:17:17,753
Rest for the whole day tomorrow, and...
Yeah. Okay.

991
01:17:18,285 --> 01:17:21,574
Food? Oh, the food at the hospital
is fine.

992
01:17:21,822 --> 01:17:24,912
Make sure you don't skip any meals. Yeah.

993
01:17:37,316 --> 01:17:40,605
I don't know if it's because fancy people
live in Gangnam, but...

994
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:42,912
...even the goldfish bread they sell here
is so skinny.

995
01:17:50,412 --> 01:17:52,050
Why are you looking at me
like that?

996
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:54,634
Is there something on my face?

997
01:17:57,412 --> 01:17:59,002
Sun Young.

998
01:18:01,308 --> 01:18:05,207
Why didn't you tell me?

999
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,189
My older brother told you, didn't he?

1000
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,109
Girl. We see each other
every day...

1001
01:18:13,812 --> 01:18:17,112
...and yet, I had to hear about that
from Tae Yong?

1002
01:18:18,336 --> 01:18:21,335
Oh yeah, Moo Sung.

1003
01:18:21,519 --> 01:18:22,519
Yeah?

1004
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:25,276
You haven't heard, right?

1005
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,349
What are you talking about?

1006
01:18:28,089 --> 01:18:30,424
She didn't tell you, it seems.

1007
01:18:30,589 --> 01:18:33,479
About what? Huh?

1008
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:37,702
My younger sister... Sun Young.

1009
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:40,119
Why? What happened?

1010
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:47,401
I was going to tell you but
she told me that she'd tell you herself...

1011
01:18:47,609 --> 01:18:49,411
...and asked me not to tell you.

1012
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:50,851
It's that...

1013
01:19:06,412 --> 01:19:10,770
Moo Sung.
It's because this is so humiliating.

1014
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:15,257
Girl what are you embarrassed about?
I'm like your older brother!

1015
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:21,445
I'm not embarrassed
at the state I'm in at all.

1016
01:19:25,396 --> 01:19:26,985
Sun Young.

1017
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:32,545
In life, sometimes you become indebted
to others or inconvenience others.

1018
01:19:33,088 --> 01:19:34,497
It happens.

1019
01:19:34,912 --> 01:19:37,202
Everyone lives like that.

1020
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:41,951
Don't suffer too much on your own.

1021
01:19:44,081 --> 01:19:51,060
I only wanted you to see me
living a good life.

1022
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,112
What kind of nonsense...

1023
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:55,643
You're living a perfectly good life!

1024
01:19:55,781 --> 01:19:57,806
How could one live a better life
than yours?

1025
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:02,523
You raised Sun Woo and Jin Joo so well.

1026
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:06,139
Even that's an incredible feat in itself.

1027
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,411
You're running your household well
and you've raised your children well.

1028
01:20:10,453 --> 01:20:15,632
And... you take such good care
of your older friend from your hometown.

1029
01:20:21,715 --> 01:20:25,882
If you hadn't called me to Seoul
at that time, Sun Young...

1030
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:30,893
I would have still been drinking every
day, unable to forget Taek's mom.

1031
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:38,608
Thanks for calling me here.

1032
01:20:39,462 --> 01:20:41,352
That's nothing worth thanking me for.

1033
01:20:48,612 --> 01:20:50,111
Fall 1977

1034
01:20:50,215 --> 01:20:51,525
Hello?

1035
01:20:53,356 --> 01:20:55,311
Kyungnam, Gimhae,
Bonghwangdong

1036
01:20:55,312 --> 01:20:57,202
Oh, Sun Young?

1037
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,840
Why would I go to Seoul?

1038
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:04,285
I'm just going to stay here.

1039
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:06,000
Come up to Seoul!

1040
01:21:06,311 --> 01:21:10,840
If you stay there, you won't be able
to forget about Min Joo, who passed away!

1041
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:13,256
And it'd be better for Taek
to grow up in Seoul.

1042
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:15,266
Come move to our neighborhood.

1043
01:21:15,702 --> 01:21:18,111
Seoul is no place for a person to live.

1044
01:21:18,112 --> 01:21:19,913
I can't live in a place like that.

1045
01:21:19,943 --> 01:21:23,232
Moo Sung, it's even more rural
here than in Gimhae.

1046
01:21:23,297 --> 01:21:26,096
Everyone here is so nice.
Hurry up and move up here.

1047
01:21:26,422 --> 01:21:28,510
You have to live your own life!

1048
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:31,021
How long will you cling on
to Min Joo?

1049
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,130
Are you Taek?

1050
01:21:50,808 --> 01:21:52,308
You are, right?

1051
01:21:55,613 --> 01:21:59,272
Wow... you're so pretty looking!

1052
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:01,441
You don't look like
your dad at all.

1053
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:03,676
The heavens really
helped you out with that one.

1054
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:06,962
Let's go have dinner at my place.

1055
01:22:10,114 --> 01:22:12,324
Come on!
Let's go.

1056
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:18,702
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1057
01:22:22,558 --> 01:22:28,557
The best thing I ever did
was moving to Seoul.

1058
01:22:29,582 --> 01:22:34,017
This time, too... if not for the people
in the neighborhood, I'd already be dead.

1059
01:22:34,443 --> 01:22:37,885
I'm indebted to a lot of people
and have inconvenienced people...

1060
01:22:38,052 --> 01:22:39,713
...and I do feel sorry
about that, but...

1061
01:22:39,904 --> 01:22:41,937
...but I'm not going to worry
too much about it anymore.

1062
01:22:42,372 --> 01:22:44,812
It's not like I'll ever forget
their kindness toward me.

1063
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:49,198
So don't try to do everything
on your own, either.

1064
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:51,831
Who cares if you're indebted
to other people?

1065
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,982
Here you go. 10 million.

1066
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:17,233
Take it. My arm hurts.

1067
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:23,648
No... Moo Sung... I won't accept this.

1068
01:23:23,733 --> 01:23:25,570
Girl, have you heard anything
that I just said?

1069
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:27,985
Hurry up and take it!

1070
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:37,965
I'm not giving this to you.
I'm lending it to you. Okay?

1071
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,116
You can pay me back later.

1072
01:23:40,177 --> 01:23:41,477
Take it!

1073
01:23:53,808 --> 01:23:57,461
And this... is something
I'm just giving you.

1074
01:23:58,461 --> 01:24:01,482
Get your wrist fixed while
I'm still saying it nicely.

1075
01:24:01,966 --> 01:24:04,763
I've made all the arrangements.

1076
01:24:05,002 --> 01:24:09,501
When you come to the hospital,
go to the first floor to take care of it...

1077
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,958
...and you can come whenever you want.

1078
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,430
You'd better go. All right?

1079
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:22,424
When Tae Yong came by,
he didn't worry about me one bit...

1080
01:24:22,517 --> 01:24:25,975
...and just worried about you
the whole time.

1081
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:33,308
Stop making him worry and be indebted
to people when you need to be.

1082
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:38,220
And when you're
having a hard time, say so.

1083
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:40,912
Don't live life in such a difficult way.

1084
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,444
Have some goldfish bread.

1085
01:24:46,702 --> 01:24:48,002
Here.

1086
01:24:55,637 --> 01:25:01,401
Speaking of which,
just how many did you buy?

1087
01:25:01,484 --> 01:25:03,573
How many is this?

1088
01:25:03,662 --> 01:25:04,985
We can finish them all if we try.

1089
01:25:06,104 --> 01:25:09,362
You're even greedier
than you were before.

1090
01:25:09,373 --> 01:25:10,435
I'm going to eat them all!

1091
01:25:10,524 --> 01:25:12,024
I can take some home too.

1092
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:14,915
Are Gangnam's goldfish breads
any different?

1093
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:17,897
How many is this, really?

1094
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:22,231
I couldn't help myself.

1095
01:25:25,866 --> 01:25:27,255
-I...
-Yeah.

1096
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,189
-Photo.
-Photo?

1097
01:25:29,252 --> 01:25:30,252
Yes.

1098
01:25:30,706 --> 01:25:32,494
-With him.
-Oh, with Taek?

1099
01:25:32,743 --> 01:25:34,762
-Yeah. Photo.
-Of course I can do that much.

1100
01:25:34,846 --> 01:25:36,763
Duk Seon. Let's go upstairs.

1101
01:25:36,967 --> 01:25:39,667
Taek. Jang Pyo wants to take
a photo with you.

1102
01:25:40,912 --> 01:25:42,792
-Okay.
-His name is Jang Pyo?

1103
01:25:43,213 --> 01:25:44,716
I guess you two are friends now.

1104
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:46,798
Yes. We became friendly
while we were arguing.

1105
01:25:52,591 --> 01:25:54,569
Hey. Smile a bit.

1106
01:25:54,912 --> 01:25:56,277
Okay.

1107
01:25:57,009 --> 01:26:01,419
One, two, three!

1108
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:04,788
Thank you.

1109
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:07,606
Thank you.

1110
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:11,070
Why don't you two stand together?
I'll take a photo for you.

1111
01:26:11,081 --> 01:26:13,057
-Us?
-Go stand there. It's fine.

1112
01:26:13,737 --> 01:26:15,636
Go! It's fine!

1113
01:26:15,647 --> 01:26:17,446
His photos are really like masterpieces.

1114
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,702
-Hurry. Go and stand together.
-Go, go, go.

1115
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:26,502
Darn it... I don't look pretty today.

1116
01:26:27,508 --> 01:26:29,757
-You look pretty.
-Really?

1117
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,299
Yeah. Your clothes
are pretty, too.

1118
01:26:34,007 --> 01:26:35,572
These clothes look okay?

1119
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:36,812
Yeah.

1120
01:26:37,545 --> 01:26:38,909
It's your clothes.

1121
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:47,976
Okay... I'm taking it now!

1122
01:26:49,912 --> 01:26:55,332
One, two, three!

1123
01:27:01,523 --> 01:27:02,449
Honey.

1124
01:27:02,469 --> 01:27:03,141
[December 2015]

1125
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,652
When was this?

1126
01:27:08,412 --> 01:27:10,680
I told you to wear warmer clothes.

1127
01:27:10,924 --> 01:27:12,834
You really don't listen.

1128
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:17,961
January, 1989.

1129
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,200
Wow. You remember
the most peculiar things, huh?

1130
01:27:24,563 --> 01:27:26,960
This was the best day
of your life, right?

1131
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:29,835
Right?

1132
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:35,978
How could you remember something
that happened 30 years ago so well?

1133
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,362
I guess people come to remember
everything when they get older?

1134
01:27:43,287 --> 01:27:44,977
Are you getting senile?

1135
01:27:46,502 --> 01:27:48,523
The date is written right there
on the bottom.

1136
01:27:52,024 --> 01:27:53,274
You're embarrassed, right?

1137
01:27:53,885 --> 01:27:55,053
I bet you are.

1138
01:27:55,429 --> 01:27:56,538
Want some water?

1139
01:27:56,808 --> 01:27:59,055
No thanks. Choke some down yourself.

1140
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:33,912
Bo Ra. Are you okay?

1141
01:29:46,769 --> 01:29:49,068
There are no more buses tonight,
so I called a cab.

1142
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:50,608
They said they'll take about 30 minutes.

1143
01:29:56,152 --> 01:29:57,652
You're not ill, are you?

1144
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:00,088
No.

1145
01:30:04,466 --> 01:30:06,556
What do you want to eat?

1146
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,530
Oh no, they don't have
anything you like.

1147
01:30:11,564 --> 01:30:13,654
It's fine. Order whatever.

1148
01:30:15,308 --> 01:30:17,603
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

1149
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:20,150
Can we have two soondae soups,
and...

1150
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:39,429
The soup tastes okay, at least.

1151
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,312
This young man kept asking me, so...

1152
01:30:53,492 --> 01:30:54,835
Thank you.

1153
01:30:55,256 --> 01:30:57,502
Youth, what a great time to be alive!

1154
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,001
I didn't say anything.

1155
01:31:06,563 --> 01:31:08,295
Sun Woo. How old are you now?

1156
01:31:08,548 --> 01:31:09,748
Excuse me?

1157
01:31:09,815 --> 01:31:11,242
I said, how old are you?

1158
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:14,612
18 years old. Why all of the sudden?

1159
01:31:15,812 --> 01:31:17,678
I've been watching you
for eighteen years.

1160
01:31:18,424 --> 01:31:21,244
Have I ever gotten angry at you
in those eighteen years?

1161
01:31:22,558 --> 01:31:26,702
I've been harsh to all the other kids,
but I don't think I ever was to you.

1162
01:31:27,249 --> 01:31:28,749
Right?

1163
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:31,017
Yes.

1164
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:33,676
You're such a good kid.

1165
01:31:34,516 --> 01:31:39,525
You're kind, righteous and smart.

1166
01:31:45,691 --> 01:31:48,191
I do like you, as a person.

1167
01:31:48,843 --> 01:31:54,573
Can't we just go back
to the way we were before?

1168
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:00,374
I don't want to not have
a relationship with you at all.

1169
01:32:00,856 --> 01:32:02,417
You understand what I'm saying, right?

1170
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:10,314
I don't want to.

1171
01:32:13,702 --> 01:32:15,755
I hate having this type of
relationship with you.

1172
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:18,502
It has no meaning to me.

1173
01:32:34,546 --> 01:32:36,140
Let's go to the concert together.

1174
01:32:43,597 --> 01:32:47,566
Not as friends but as a man and a woman.

1175
01:33:00,835 --> 01:33:05,002
A line indicates a limit,
saying, "That's as far as you get."

1176
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:10,599
To maintain that boundary means
to maintain the same familiarity...

1177
01:33:11,109 --> 01:33:13,028
...and it means that one
will respect the universe...

1178
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:15,031
...that it outlines through
abiding by its rules...

1179
01:33:15,388 --> 01:33:17,632
...and maintaining the relationships
existing in it as they are.

1180
01:33:18,412 --> 01:33:21,411
This also means that, if one were to
never cross that line, one would never...

1181
01:33:21,959 --> 01:33:24,991
...experience the world, rules,
and relationships

1182
01:33:25,448 --> 01:33:27,592
...outside of the currently
established boundaries.

1183
01:33:35,355 --> 01:33:39,359
If one wishes for a new relationship...
if one wishes for love...

1184
01:33:39,629 --> 01:33:41,739
...one must cross the line.

1185
01:33:44,358 --> 01:33:45,900
If one were to not cross the line...

1186
01:33:46,342 --> 01:33:50,542
...that line would demarcate the limit
of how far you and that person can go.

1187
01:34:07,839 --> 01:34:13,429
Of course, there are some lines in
this world that should never be crossed.

1188
01:34:45,532 --> 01:34:47,232
you are him... right?

1189
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:50,358
You are.

1190
01:35:06,937 --> 01:35:08,659
That person...

1191
01:35:08,922 --> 01:35:09,922
That person!

1192
01:35:10,503 --> 01:35:12,412
It's him!

1193
01:35:12,526 --> 01:35:14,436
Chun Doo Hwan!
Controversial Korean president

1194
01:35:15,412 --> 01:35:17,502
It's you!

1195
01:35:31,002 --> 01:35:32,925
Throw these out, already!

1196
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:36,144
Bring all of those, as they are,
back inside.

1197
01:35:38,438 --> 01:35:40,179
How fascinating.

1198
01:35:40,959 --> 01:35:42,125
What's the reason?

1199
01:35:42,197 --> 01:35:45,359
I don't know. He doesn't know.
I don't know. Nobody knows.

1200
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:49,069
But I haven't seen Jung Bong all day.
Do you know where he went?

1201
01:35:49,502 --> 01:35:51,269
-Hey, punk!
-Stop right there!

1202
01:35:51,674 --> 01:35:53,419
Okay, don't go anywhere.

1203
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:55,480
He's really not the type of kid
to do that.

1204
01:35:55,599 --> 01:35:57,730
You're so annoying!

1205
01:36:04,112 --> 01:36:05,721
Don't concern yourself over me.

1206
01:36:08,264 --> 01:36:11,409
How do you know you might not
meet the man you're fated for?

1207
01:36:11,588 --> 01:36:14,688
Hey. I'm a guy.
You are a girl, then?

1208
01:36:18,697 --> 01:36:19,949
I have something
to talk to you about.

1209
01:36:20,081 --> 01:36:20,926
With me?

1210
01:36:20,937 --> 01:36:23,159
Excuse me!
You have to go in now.

1211
01:36:23,451 --> 01:36:25,351
Yes, just a moment.

1212
01:36:27,112 --> 01:36:28,602
[Can't go.]

1213
01:36:28,707 --> 01:36:30,407
What do I do if he
really does like me?

1214
01:36:30,852 --> 01:36:32,458
You two really do
suit each other.

1215
01:36:32,608 --> 01:36:33,537
Do your best.

1216
01:36:36,025 --> 01:36:37,185
What are you doing here?

1217
01:36:37,312 --> 01:36:38,932
I have something to ask you.

1218
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,450
Hey, you know...
