1
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,038
March 1989, Seoul
Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong

2
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,054
If you have anything
you need ironed, bring it here!

3
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:28,715
Soong guri dang dang,
soong dang dang...

4
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:31,495
Soogu soogu dang dang, soong dang dang.

5
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:34,553
Soong guri dang dang,
soong dang dang...

6
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:37,294
Soogu soogu dang dang,
soong dang dang.

7
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,217
Soong guri dang dang,
soong dang dang...

8
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:42,560
Soogu soogu dang dang,
soong...

9
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:47,322
-What, come on!
-What?...

10
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,833
Go exercise! Or go to the bath house!
It's your day off!

11
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,223
Don't just sit around watching TV!

12
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:58,173
Why are you just picking on me?
OK, OK, OK! I'll stop!

13
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,932
Mi Ran, Mi Ran, Mi Ran, Mi Ran!

14
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:03,916
Are you throwing that away?

15
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,912
Don't throw it away.
We can use that for another 10 years.

16
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:13,737
Hey, me or Dad? You have to choose.

17
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:14,652
What?

18
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:16,685
Your dad and I are getting
divorced because of this iron.

19
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,369
-Who are you going to live with?
-Dad.

20
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,024
I choose you, Mother.

21
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:25,661
I will follow you mother.

22
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,553
Yes!

23
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,667
Dad, I'll deliver it.

24
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,335
You'll do that?

25
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,102
I'll go to Sun Woo's house.

26
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,867
You just go to Jung Hwan's
and Soo Yeon's houses.

27
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,313
-OK.
-Also, Dong Ryong's house too.

28
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,754
There's no need for that.

29
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,861
I came here personally
to spare Master Choi the trouble.

30
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,643
How did you know to come here?

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,242
Taek, God is fair.

32
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,586
He gave you the talent
to play baduk well, but to me...

33
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:18,321
Jung Hwan's dad's car...

34
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,750
Bo Ra noona's car, and the car from
the Baduk Club that drops you off.

35
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:23,577
He gave me amazing hearing,
and the ability to distinguish sounds.

36
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:27,750
I was studying in my room,
and I heard your car from afar.

37
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:31,872
Rustle, rustle, I hear.

38
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,542
I figured that you received an expensive
fruit basket, and at the same time

39
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,639
I realized that some of that fruit
will be delivered to our house--

40
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:41,371
Your dad is waiting.
Hurry up and go home. Hurry.

41
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,724
He's on night duty today,
so he's not home.

42
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:45,915
Regardless, thank you for the fruit.

43
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,570
Taek, you know it's Jung Hwan's
birthday this weekend, right?

44
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:53,258
Happy birthday to you!...

45
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:55,036
-Bye.
-I know. Bye!

46
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:58,906
What do you need me to take?

47
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:02,283
Just give each family a plastic bag.

48
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,312
What about these bananas?

49
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,123
Thats, I'm going to give them to Jin Joo.
She likes bananas.

50
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:12,729
OK.

51
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,317
-Is it OK if I take one?
-Of course you can, you brought them.

52
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,571
Ahjumma!

53
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:30,980
Goodness, President Choi!

54
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,768
Hello.

55
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:36,747
Hey! You're supposed to say,
"Goodness, President Kim!".

56
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,750
How? I don't know how.

57
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:42,850
OK, raise your arm,
right up next to your ear.

58
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:46,320
Goodness...

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,070
Hi, Taek.

60
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,547
What is this?

61
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:53,392
It's fruit. My dad told me
to give this to you.

62
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:55,679
Goodness, tell him I said thank you!

63
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:58,286
-There's oranges too, right?
-Yes, I saw them in there.

64
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,391
Jung Hwan, Taek is here!

65
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,003
Taek, eat with us.

66
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,460
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

67
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,860
Thank you, but I have to
go to Deok Sun's house.

68
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,392
I'm going to head out. Goodbye.

69
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,673
I'll see you on your birthday.

70
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,486
-Do you have time to come?
-Yes, I do. See you then.

71
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:20,811
It's nice to have a friend.
He doesn't even have time to sleep.

72
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,392
But he always celebrates your birthdays.

73
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:25,682
Is it that good?

74
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:28,823
Deok Sun.

75
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,873
Deok Sun.

76
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:34,754
It's Soo Yeon, you dummy!

77
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,703
Soo Yeon, I need to talk to you.

78
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,891
You could have just come inside.
It's cold, come in.

79
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,356
Yeah, Yeah!

80
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,247
My ghosh... a banana!
Awesome!

81
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,829
Awesome.

82
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:57,563
Your pronunciation
has gotten much better!

83
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,505
Hey, no socks?

84
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,913
Goodness, this human!

85
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,948
-Is everyone gone?
-Yeah.

86
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,723
My mom went to the market,
my dad and No Eul went to meet a friend.

87
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,617
And Sung Bo Ra left
for the library at dawn.

88
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,565
Sung Bo Ra must be possessed by a ghost
that died of not being able to study.

89
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,107
She studies so freaking hard.

90
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,739
Bo Ra noona must have
been you in her past life.

91
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:24,791
Do you want to die?

92
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:26,888
You should only learn
what's good for you.

93
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,210
-Want some?
-No, you eat it.

94
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,118
You didn't get any sleep
yesterday, right?

95
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,725
-Is it obvious?
-It's so obvious!

96
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,339
You didn't take a sleeping pill?

97
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,938
-You told me not to, so I didn't.
-Good job.

98
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,208
-What about headache medicine?
-Just one pill.

99
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,767
Good job! Good job, our Heedong.

100
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:53,637
Taek hyung!

101
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:59,699
Why are you here?
You don't have a match today?

102
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:05,859
Hyung, would you mind
giving me ten autographs?

103
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,575
My teacher asked me.

104
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
OK.

105
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,935
Is it your first year teacher
or your second year teacher?

106
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,160
What's up with the banana?

107
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:17,361
You brought it, didn't you?

108
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:19,815
Thank you.

109
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,215
It's my homeroom teacher
from my first year, naturally.

110
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,441
I don't know who is my second
year homeroom teacher.

111
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,022
I'll find out when school starts tomorrow.

112
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,566
Where's older noona?
Did she go to the library again?

113
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:32,263
I don't know.

114
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,735
She said it was a part time job...

115
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,280
...but I don't know why
she's working so hard.

116
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,201
She's really invested in it.

117
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,559
Your skin is so dry!
Put on some lotion!

118
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,278
How is it possible that you're
getting older than your dad?

119
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,694
It's OK. A face like mine
looks younger later on.

120
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:27,144
Seriously, this is too much.

121
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,545
Noona, it's a national holiday today.

122
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:30,751
You're supposed to rest.

123
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:34,374
I can't. I start work next week.

124
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,045
I don't want to look like
an idiot when I'm there.

125
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,304
My goodness.

126
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:40,401
What are you doing?

127
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:48,098
Let's go.

128
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,550
How is your hand so  warm?

129
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:58,133
What did you do to it?

130
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:01,309
What do you mean?
It's always been warm.

131
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,393
Noona, I'll see you at
the food cart tonight.

132
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:09,500
- I have to study.
- Noona.

133
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,593
OK, I'll be there.

134
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:29,323
Jin Joo, eat slowly.
No one is going to snatch it away.

135
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,583
Where's Sun Woo?
Did he go to the study room?

136
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,947
He went out to meet
someone for a moment.

137
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:41,430
Oppa, when the kids return to school,
I need you to watch Jin Joo again.

138
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,939
I decided to work
at the bath house again.

139
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:46,870
Don't worry about Jin Joo.

140
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,713
Sun Young.

141
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:54,503
Sun Woo knows.

142
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:57,397
What?

143
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:00,758
Sun Woo knows that you're working.

144
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,959
How does he know?

145
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:05,023
How did he find out?

146
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:07,863
Well... he just found out somehow.

147
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:10,181
Don't worry.

148
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:12,659
You know, Sun Woo is very understanding.

149
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,433
Mom.

150
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,743
-Hello, ahjussi.
-Hey there.

151
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,179
Hey, Sun Woo. Come here
and eat some of this fruit.

152
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,783
Ahjussi brought it.

153
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:32,109
Bananas. Jin Joo, have lots!

154
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,366
Yes.

155
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,656
-Taek must have returned, ahjussi.
-Yes, he came home last night.

156
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:42,335
He doesn't really bring home gifts

157
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,934
but he never fails to
bring fruit back with him.

158
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,002
-Jin Joo, isn't it yummy?
-Goodness, she's excited.

159
00:10:55,032 --> 00:11:00,106
Episode 14: Don't Worry, Dear

160
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,980
-That's not how you do it.
-Why not?

161
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:32,673
You're supposed to
use glue for the wings.

162
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:35,985
Here.

163
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:38,938
Really? Isn't it the same thing?

164
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,515
It'll fall off immediately
once the rice dries up.

165
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,844
But if you use the glue,
it'll become sturdy.

166
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,829
Don't forget to roll up
the rubber too. Got it?

167
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,381
Yes. I'll win it all with this.

168
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,440
Sun Woo, dinner is ready! Come out!

169
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,243
OK.

170
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,723
Soo Yeon, set the table.

171
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:14,376
OK.

172
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:21,002
Mom, what about Dad?

173
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:25,396
He should be home soon.

174
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,533
I wonder who he's meeting,
for it to be taking so long.

175
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:31,799
Mom, you don't think Dad is lending
money to his friends, do you?

176
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,733
Hey, don't worry.
We don't have any money to lend.

177
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,361
Stop talking nonsense and eat your food.

178
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,120
Bastard.

179
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,611
Really? These shoes are really for me?

180
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,758
I said I would buy you a new pair of
sneakers when you become a senior.

181
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:32,873
Can I throw away my old pair, then?

182
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,783
Of course, you've worn
them for a long time.

183
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:37,028
I'll burn those raggedy shoes!

184
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,469
Yes!

185
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,455
They're not even Nike or Adidas.
Do you really like them that much?

186
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:51,364
There's nothing wrong with Tiger!
Man Ok, and many girls are also wearing these.

187
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,593
Mom, what about me?
My sneakers are all worn out too.

188
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:02,256
I'll buy you a pair next year,
when you become a third year, OK?

189
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,490
My god...

190
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:15,298
Don't look so sad, because Tiger is here.

191
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,641
Mom, buy me a new pair of sneakers too!

192
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:22,203
The bottoms are all torn up!

193
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,191
They get soaked when it rains.

194
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:27,575
Hey, she said that she will
buy you a new pair next year.

195
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:28,918
Yeah.

196
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:34,773
If you rank 100th or higher at school,
I'll buy you a new pair, OK?

197
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,498
Rank 100th at school?

198
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:41,287
Forget it. If you don't want to
buy them for me, then just say so.

199
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,354
What nonsense.

200
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:48,510
No Eul, don't look so sad,
because I have Tiger with me.

201
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,631
I'm so excited.

202
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,293
Mom, why isn't Dad coming home?
What's he going to do for dinner?

203
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,883
My goodness, Wife!

204
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,072
Honey, it's cold.
Why are you outside...

205
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:18,075
Oh my, you've been
waiting for your husband.

206
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,857
Do you know how late it is?
What took you so long?

207
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,541
Were you out seeing your girlfriend?

208
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:26,948
Honey, I already broke up with her.

209
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,526
You bought meat?

210
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:33,847
I swear, you drive me crazy.

211
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:37,645
We don't have money for meat. We've spent
all of our living expenses this month.

212
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,795
This meat...

213
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,433
Hong Shik bought this meat.

214
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,099
Hong Shik...

215
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:53,778
Hong Shik?

216
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:55,701
You met with that punk?

217
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,547
That's the person you met today?

218
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:03,075
Goodness, I guess he wasn't
dead after all?

219
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:06,547
How dare he show his face after
he turned our family into this mess?

220
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,640
Where is he? I'm going to catch him and
hand him over to the police right now.

221
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,792
Where is he? Let's go! Let's go!

222
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:13,919
Honey...

223
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:17,423
It's all over.

224
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:21,856
It's over.

225
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:28,108
Hong Shik... paid off all of the debt.

226
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:34,898
He went to the bank,
and he paid off all of the debt.

227
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:43,927
He said he didn't have the heart
to tell you to your face.

228
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,764
He said, what he did was unforgivable.

229
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:56,042
He said if he can't pay us back
while he's alive...

230
00:16:56,862 --> 00:17:02,773
...he'll pay it all back when he's dead.

231
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,241
You've been through a lot.

232
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,366
You've suffered so much.

233
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:23,363
Even though we can't live in luxury...

234
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:28,243
From now on, you can actually
look forward to a regular paycheck.

235
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:33,209
From now on, my wife
doesn't have to go around...

236
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,721
To borrow and pay back 10,000 won,
here and there.

237
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,412
From now on...

238
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,891
...you will never have to
plead to others like this.

239
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,430
You've gone through so much until now.

240
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:58,109
Ms. Lee Il Hwa.

241
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,128
I'm not the one who suffered.

242
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,856
It was our children who suffered.

243
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,493
My goodness.

244
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,270
Sun Woo.

245
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,853
You know, I was only going to work
until the end of the month and then quit.

246
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:02,539
I was bored, staying at home.

247
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,867
It's not because of money.

248
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:06,948
Jin Joo has grown up a lot...

249
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,536
...and it felt stuffy,
staying home all the time.

250
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:14,137
I'm not going to work anymore,
so don't worry.

251
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,743
It's OK, Mom.

252
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,747
I'm OK with it.

253
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,497
You can keep working.

254
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,499
But, if it's hard...

255
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,991
...if your wrists start to hurt,
you have to quit immediately.

256
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:33,467
OK?

257
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:56,301
Korean Language

258
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:03,775
Sung Deok Sun

259
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:10,221
All done. Hey, hey, don't touch it yet,
or it'll get smudged.

260
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,940
Man, I'm good.

261
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,599
-Really Dad, you're awesome.
-Dad, write it for me too.

262
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:21,719
Sure, bring your book.
I'll write it nicely with the ink brush.

263
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,194
Way to go, making textbook covers
on your first day of school.

264
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,148
Mind your own business.

265
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:32,757
-Breakfast is ready, clear the area.
-OK.

266
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:47,819
Let's eat, let's eat.
Let's stuff our faces today.

267
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:52,284
Mom, what's wrong? Are we bankrupt?

268
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,336
Are we totally ruined now?

269
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,859
We're not running away late at night
after we eat all of this, right?

270
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,998
Running away, my butt.

271
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,630
Honey, are you that happy?

272
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:07,870
Yes, I'm happy.

273
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,772
I couldn't sleep for a moment last night.

274
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,269
-What? Really?
-What? Really?

275
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:18,652
Yes, really.

276
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:21,672
Your dad will bring home
a regular paycheck from now on.

277
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:25,266
The debt is all paid off?
Dad's wages are no longer garnished?

278
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,075
Yes, it's over now.

279
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:30,046
It's all over!

280
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:34,231
-Are we going to be rich now?
-Not to that extent.

281
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,124
We're just going to live
like other people now.

282
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:41,106
Dad, buy me a new pair
of sneakers then! Please!

283
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:43,569
Dad, I need pocket money.

284
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,307
I have to buy a birthday
present for Jung Pal.

285
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:47,508
Here.

286
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:55,431
No Eul, go and buy yourself
a new pair of sneakers.

287
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:59,308
Seriously... I can buy a pair of Nike's?

288
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,914
Buy Nike, buy whatever you want.

289
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,115
Yes! Nike! Nike!

290
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:09,713
Dad, me too! I need spending money, too!
Give me some too!

291
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,734
Deok Sun... no, I mean Soo Yeon.
Here's your allowance.

292
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:15,975
All right!

293
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,120
Dad, I love you!

294
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,018
I love you, Dad!

295
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:21,796
What the heck?

296
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:24,489
What about you, Bo Ra?
Is there anything you want?

297
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:26,011
I'm good.

298
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:29,147
Sung Bo Ra, you're all grown up.

299
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:34,297
Well, she is the oldest one,
so she's mature and considerate.

300
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:38,220
By the way, Bo Ra.

301
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:45,385
I have something else
I have in mind for you.

302
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,996
What are they saying?
Can you hear them?

303
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,988
I can't hear anything.

304
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,703
You don't think Dad is giving her
100,000 won, do you?

305
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,738
If that's the case,
I won't stand for it.

306
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:08,706
Be quiet, noona.

307
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,228
Didn't you say that your school
is instituting uniforms this year?

308
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:13,716
Only the freshmen.

309
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,319
That's such a waste of money,
to only wear it for a year.

310
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:23,419
What are they saying?
You still can't hear them?

311
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:27,371
I can't hear anything.
It must be very serious.

312
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:07,196
Hey, girls...

313
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,217
Hey. Hey!

314
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,197
Come here quickly.

315
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:22,864
What's up with the atmosphere in here?

316
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:24,445
We're third-years now.

317
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,048
Big Ji Young and Little Ji Young
are both in our class?

318
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:32,495
Yes. Fat Mi Yeon and Skinny Mi Yeon
are in our class too.

319
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:36,419
How long has Namgoong
Slowpoke been sleeping?

320
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,409
I don't know.
She was sleeping when I got here.

321
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,219
The rumors are true.
She does sleep a lot.

322
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:44,708
That's why she's called Namgoong Slowpoke.

323
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,662
Is the student body president here?

324
00:24:48,164 --> 00:24:49,824
Yeah, a long time ago.

325
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:53,859
She's been studying math
since early in the morning.

326
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,003
She left to wash her face.

327
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,734
She's so annoying.

328
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,698
You're going to be so exhausted.

329
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:02,375
Why are we sitting like this?

330
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,259
Can't we sit wherever we want?

331
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,612
I miss Man Ok.

332
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,639
She said will come and lunch with us.

333
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,839
I heard that the boys in my
neighborhood are all in the same class.

334
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:16,327
Hey, the rumor is that our
homeroom teacher will stay the same...

335
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:19,343
-Yes!
-Yay!

336
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,189
Good morning.

337
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:59,198
Stop shaking your leg.

338
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:01,819
What's up with this punk this morning?

339
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,013
Jung Pal, do you have lead refills?

340
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:06,188
No.

341
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:09,620
-Dong Ryong, do you have lead refills?
-No, I don't use those.

342
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:15,899
Hey... have you guys heard
about our homeroom teacher?

343
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,829
I'm sure he'll be here. Who is it?

344
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:21,244
This can't be happening.
Seriously, this is wrong.

345
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,731
Why? Who is it?

346
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:30,151
No way. Come on,
what's the matter with you?

347
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:31,986
There's no way.

348
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:34,099
This friend's father?

349
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,229
Good morning, my precious babies!

350
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:55,567
You are all so dead now.

351
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,933
What are you going to do now?

352
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,002
Hey, are you OK?

353
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:04,060
Who is that?
Who fainted?

354
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:06,037
It's Dong Ryong, Teacher.

355
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:07,930
Is that so?

356
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,839
Just let him be, then.
It's all an act.

357
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,197
Cover him with his jacket.

358
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:18,275
The floor is quite cold,
so leave him there. That rascal...

359
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,795
OK, I'll go ahead
and introduce myself. My name...

360
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:28,787
Ryu Jae Myung.

361
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,002
-We know!
- We know!

362
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:34,950
Starting today,
I will be your homeroom teacher.

363
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:36,301
It's nice to meet you all!

364
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:41,425
You rascals!
Look how excited all of you are!

365
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:44,769
That's enough.

366
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,341
You know late night studying
starts today, right?

367
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,099
I better not catch any of
you running away.

368
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:52,683
If caught, it will be one-way
ticket to hell, understood?

369
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,606
-Yes.
-Understood?

370
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:55,939
Yes!

371
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:57,631
That's it for morning announcements.

372
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,643
Sun Woo will be the
temporary class president.

373
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:04,758
Attention.

374
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:08,902
-Salute!
-Thank you!

375
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,168
What do we do?

376
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:20,418
Are you crying?

377
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:26,648
-He's crying.
-Really?

378
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,611
Shouldn't we wake up Namgoong Slowpoke?

379
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,470
Hey, wake up and eat.

380
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:42,246
Namgong Slowpoke, wake up!
It's lunch time.

381
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:46,094
I'm going to sleep,
don't wake me up. I ate earlier.

382
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:48,838
Sure, go to sleep.

383
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:51,975
Let's eat together.

384
00:28:54,352 --> 00:28:55,392
OK.

385
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:01,922
Your family is pretty well off?

386
00:29:04,188 --> 00:29:05,283
I'm going to eat one.

387
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:12,895
Teach me some math later on,
at the evening study hall.

388
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:15,348
-Got it?
-If I have time.

389
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,620
Hey!

390
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,924
Fine.

391
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:23,042
You have older sister. What's the worry?
You have a sister in Seoul University.

392
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:28,547
I'd rather fail than learn from her.

393
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,447
And she's really busy these days.

394
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:34,729
Once she starts studying,
she studies like crazy. It's annoying.

395
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,246
-Here.
-I'm good.

396
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:55,569
How can you eat that?
We just had lunch.

397
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,484
What's the matter with you?
Did you hurt your head?

398
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:01,400
When have you ever not eaten this?

399
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,172
You're crazy for fried toast.
Jo Hyun bought it because of you.

400
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,920
I'm on a diet.

401
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:09,179
-Why?
-Have you lost your mind?

402
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,846
I have a date on Saturday.

403
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:22,111
-For real? I can't believe it!
-Really, good for you, Mi Ok!

404
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,662
You're meeting Kim Jung Bong?

405
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,838
Yeah, I got a letter from him.
We're going to meet up on Saturday.

406
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:30,157
No way! For real? Where?

407
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:32,081
7 p.m. at Jongro Banjul.

408
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,918
-I can't believe it!
-Yes!

409
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:39,494
Are you going to meet up and eat steak?

410
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:47,868
Sung Soo Yeon, you better play dumb.

411
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,719
Don't act like you know
what's going on.

412
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:50,910
It's embarrassing.

413
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,111
How can I play dumb?
We live in the same house.

414
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:55,725
Still, I really want you
to act like you don't know.

415
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:59,180
-What if it doesn't work out?
-All right, I'll try.

416
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:42,289
Man Ok, pow!

417
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,738
Hey, where are you going, at this hour?

418
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,340
To my room.

419
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,567
-Aigoo, President Sung!
-Aigoo, President Kim!

420
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:16,962
-It's good to see you!...
-It's good to see you!...

421
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:23,719
-Soo Yeon, did you come to see me?
-No, I came to see Jung Bong oppa.

422
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,417
Why hyung? Is there something going on?

423
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:36,759
What? A date?
With your friend?

424
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,251
You've got to be kidding me.
Your friend, who?

425
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,787
Thats ugly girls you hang out with?

426
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,652
They're better than your friends.

427
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,997
My brother has to go to college.

428
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,372
My friend has to go to college too.

429
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:54,099
All right.

430
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:57,434
We're going to celebrate your birthday
tomorrow in Taek's room, right?

431
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,325
My birthday is tomorrow?

432
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:01,113
You don't even know your own birthday?

433
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:05,129
Forget about it.

434
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,224
There's no need to celebrate,
and Taek has a match the very next day.

435
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,679
-Let's celebrate some other time.
-No, we're going to do it.

436
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:17,359
Your mom said she's going to order
sweet and sour fried pork for us.

437
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,794
Where are they meeting?

438
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,328
-Jongro Banjul.
-The coffee shop?

439
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:27,899
-Isn't that a restaurant?
-On the first floor, it's a cafe.

440
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:31,462
What are you talking about? Floors two
through four are all restaurants.

441
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,305
How pretty!

442
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,564
My goodness, do you like it that much?

443
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:20,688
I got a call from your husband,
and I picked the best one in our shop.

444
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,771
I even sold it to him for half price.

445
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:26,639
-Hurry up and turn it on.
-OK, OK.

446
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:33,257
Yes.

447
00:35:38,884 --> 00:35:41,680
I'm going to trash that thing.

448
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,209
What? Give it to me
if you're going to throw it away.

449
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:47,968
You surprised me!

450
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,956
I will hurt you.

451
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,572
Yes, it's 150,000 won.

452
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,066
She bought it for 150,000 won.

453
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:06,747
They're such swindlers,
they'll do anything for money!

454
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:08,143
I'm so annoyed!

455
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:17,041
Yeah, I feel better when I think that way.

456
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,979
You're right.

457
00:36:20,337 --> 00:36:21,832
That's how I'm going to think.

458
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:25,178
All right, I won't make
a fuss about it to Mom.

459
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:29,317
I got it. Good night.

460
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:31,836
My goodness...

461
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,117
Look, it's so late!

462
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:39,265
Jin Joo, it's time to wash up
and get ready for bed.

463
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,425
Get up now.

464
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:51,142
I'm sure they met up.

465
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,818
Of course they did,
it's way too late already.

466
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:57,878
She would have called me if they didn't.

467
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:16,201
I have a bad feeling about this.

468
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,646
It'll only take ten minutes.
I'll see you at the food cart.

469
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:23,651
-I have something to give you.
-OK, but what is it?

470
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:26,020
You'll know once we meet up.

471
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,587
It's the most precious thing
in the world to me.

472
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:32,527
What is it? OK, I'm leaving right now.

473
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:35,449
What would we have done
if phones didn't exist?

474
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:39,662
No kidding. I wonder, how did people
ever date without phones?

475
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,361
They probably wrote letters.

476
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:45,040
Even so, they all seem
to live happily ever after anyway.

477
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:47,313
I'm sure it was very inconvenient though.

478
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,117
Noona, I'm going to leave now as well.

479
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,579
I'm really going to give it to her.

480
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:01,509
I can give it to her, right?

481
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:05,013
Of course, it's been several years.

482
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:07,483
It's OK.

483
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:11,162
Do you like Bo Ra that much?

484
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:30,493
Jung Pal, your brother
hasn't come back yet, right?

485
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,808
If he's not home,
then he must be with her.

486
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:36,338
Have you called your friend?

487
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,279
Her dad is unbelievably scary.
I've never called her house, not once.

488
00:40:40,692 --> 00:40:42,972
She said she would call me
once their date ended.

489
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,703
Go inside, it's cold.

490
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:49,990
I'll call you when my brother comes home.

491
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,295
OK, see you tomorrow, Jung Pal.

492
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:54,613
Yeah.

493
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,176
It's for me! It's for me!

494
00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:13,664
Here, girl.

495
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,429
Hello? Is it you, Mi Ok?

496
00:41:19,196 --> 00:41:20,640
Oppa, what are you talking about?

497
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,343
You still haven't seen her?
Do you know what time it is right now?

498
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:49,090
Hello, I apologize for calling so late.

499
00:41:49,146 --> 00:41:51,499
I'm Sung Soo Yeon, Mi Ok's friend.

500
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:55,999
May I speak to Mi Ok?
It's really, really urgent.

501
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,383
Hey, why are you home?

502
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:05,426
Deok Sun... I got stood up.

503
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:08,817
Please! Oppa is still over there,
waiting for you!

504
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:10,633
What?

505
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:14,522
Oppa still waiting for you at Banjul!
What the heck were you two doing?

506
00:42:14,752 --> 00:42:17,947
No! Deok Sun, what should I do?

507
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:22,046
What do you think? Get over there!
You're insane! Get going!

508
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:41,767
Ahjussi, Jongro Banjul, please.

509
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:45,008
Banjul?
I think they're closed right now.

510
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:47,119
I know, please hurry.

511
00:42:53,877 --> 00:42:55,017
Am I wrong?

512
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:57,563
Maybe the coffee shop on
the first floor is still open.

513
00:42:58,355 --> 00:43:00,571
The restaurant on the second floor
closes at 10 p.m.

514
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:12,005
He's not feeling well.
Seriously, I'm going nuts here.

515
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:16,550
Oppa wore a coat that he's never
worn and bought flowers before he left.

516
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,569
I didn't tell you ahead of time because
it would have spoiled the surprise.

517
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,284
Seriously, you're all a bunch of idiots.

518
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:25,075
Get going, oppa can't catch a cold!
He has to be mindful of his health!

519
00:43:25,408 --> 00:43:26,638
I swear!

520
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,226
How long have you been here?

521
00:44:56,879 --> 00:44:58,683
It hasn't been too long.

522
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:03,353
I just got here.

523
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:11,664
So...

524
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,207
Here.

525
00:45:31,627 --> 00:45:37,071
You must be cold. Why don't we
go somewhere and eat some hot...

526
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,408
Late winter of 1989.

527
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,057
Whether my heart was
pounding crazily...

528
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:02,947
...because of my illness,
or because of her.

529
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:04,812
I...

530
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,475
...wanted to find out.

531
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:09,978
Confirm.

532
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:42,473
She's doing that because
she's afraid you might worry.

533
00:46:42,655 --> 00:46:44,173
Don't get upset over that.

534
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,376
Still, she told me everything before.

535
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,136
Lately, it seems like she talks
to ahjussi more than me.

536
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:56,844
Even with what happened
with my grandma today.

537
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,610
If it was like old times

538
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:02,566
we would've stayed up all night
talking behind that swindler's back.

539
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:08,364
Why do you hate ahjussi?

540
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:12,633
Me? I don't hate him.

541
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,598
I mean it! I don't hate him.

542
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,436
I'm just... not happy about
the whole situation.

543
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:23,811
I don't hate ahjussi.

544
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:32,796
You said that you were
going to give me something.

545
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,169
What...

546
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,872
Let's leave.
What if someone else comes?

547
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,678
Just give it to me here.
What is it?

548
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:46,199
No, what if all the ahjussis
come again? Let's go. Hurry.

549
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:49,981
Come on, let's go.

550
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:57,244
Hey... I don't wear necklaces.

551
00:47:58,177 --> 00:47:59,182
You know that.

552
00:48:00,493 --> 00:48:04,196
You don't have to wear it.
Just keep it, I'm giving it to you.

553
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,818
Your dad gave this to you
before he passed away.

554
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,654
It's just a necklace. A necklace.
Don't be burdened by it.

555
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,465
How is this just a necklace?

556
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:29,912
I really do feel burdened.

557
00:49:16,082 --> 00:49:19,608
Noona, the guys want you to hurry up.
The birthday party is about to start.

558
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:23,019
No Eul, which look suits me
the least, when I dress up?

559
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,719
Be honest, and I'll do
everything except that.

560
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,272
You look the worst when
you try to dress it up.

561
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:38,755
You said to be honest!

562
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:44,780
I'm such an idiot for asking you! Die...

563
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:48,982
What about Jung Hwan hyung's present?
You said you bought him a present.

564
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:52,278
I already gave it to him!

565
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:13,515
-Lil bro.
-Yeah?

566
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,517
Happy birthday.

567
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,676
Thanks, hyung.

568
00:50:30,137 --> 00:50:33,281
What's up with this shirt?
Did you buy it?

569
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:41,163
It's pink. It's my favorite color.

570
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:49,387
I'm going to go.
We're going to meet up at Taek's room.

571
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:52,967
-Happy birthday again, Little Brother.
-Thank you.

572
00:50:58,411 --> 00:51:01,124
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

573
00:51:01,135 --> 00:51:04,567
Happy birthday, dear Jung Hwannie!
Happy birthday to you!

574
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:11,241
It's a birthday present.
It wouldn't have hurt you to wrap it up.

575
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:15,722
How are we supposed to wrap that?
We worked hard to buy that for you.

576
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:18,464
Yeah, we thought long and hard
about what we should get you.

577
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,131
We had no money,
but we saved every cent.

578
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,117
We all ate a piece of fish cake each,
and bought it with Taek's money.

579
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:27,376
OK, thanks.

580
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,626
No, they pitched in too.

581
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:34,362
Man, I'm really touched. Truly.

582
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:36,349
Seriously, your personality
is perfect and you perfectly...

583
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,779
...suck at chopsticks.
Who the heck would lose to you in Baduk?

584
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:41,035
Hey, stop.

585
00:51:42,522 --> 00:51:45,261
Turn on "Top Gun."
I want to see Tom Cruise oppa.

586
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:50,163
Jung Pal and I already saw this twice.

587
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,779
Let's watch something else.

588
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,396
- I haven't seen it.
- Me neither.

589
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:56,836
Me neither.
Jung Pal, can't we watch this?

590
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,276
You can, go ahead.

591
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:03,199
Soo Yeon...

592
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:06,802
...if I'm you we wouldn't be watching
something so wholesome like this at night.

593
00:52:07,397 --> 00:52:10,107
Why? I don't mind.
Let's watch it together.

594
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:12,577
We're not OK with it.

595
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:17,733
Choi Heedong, you like movies like that?

596
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,762
No, I don't like them.

597
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:23,777
I ought to...

598
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:29,335
It was you, wasn't it? You got
involved, right? You fool!

599
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:33,942
-This is what you teach him?
-I didn't teach him anything!

600
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:36,539
Excuse me, but what the heck
do you know about Taek?

601
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:40,209
Say what? What don't I know?
What is there I don't know about him?!

602
00:52:40,336 --> 00:52:42,799
I swear, you would
corrupt an innocent kid!

603
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,007
Taek, I...

604
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:56,138
Taek, I want to write down the name
of the hotel you're staying at tomorrow.

605
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:57,353
I need the business card.

606
00:52:58,072 --> 00:52:59,082
Sure.

607
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,406
Here, Dad.

608
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:13,403
-I have to leave now, don't I?
-Yes, it's late.

609
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:16,080
You're going to leave now?

610
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,670
Taek has a match
tomorrow at 9 a.m. at Busan.

611
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,920
Why didn't you leave
in the afternoon, then?

612
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:24,899
It's fine, I can sleep on the way.
I'm going to go wash up.

613
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,162
OK.

614
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:38,588
I'm so sorry for telling you this now.

615
00:54:43,735 --> 00:54:46,526
Anyway, it's still not too late.

616
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,611
We can support you now.

617
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:55,489
So, study what you've always wanted to.
Prepare for the bar exam.

618
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:05,142
As parents, it breaks our hearts that we
can't help our child fulfill her dream.

619
00:55:06,253 --> 00:55:08,096
I'm truly sorry.

620
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:13,108
Every time we think about that...

621
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:16,826
...we're too ashamed to face you.

622
00:55:18,466 --> 00:55:23,397
So, don't worry about money,
because we're debt free now.

623
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:28,267
Be at least, and prepare for the exam.

624
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:34,648
Even if it takes several years,
I'm going to support you.

625
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:37,298
OK?

626
00:55:43,255 --> 00:55:44,483
I'll...

627
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:47,209
...think about it.

628
00:55:48,704 --> 00:55:51,183
OK. OK.

629
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:56,791
Take your time. Think carefully.

630
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,356
My god.

631
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:09,917
I swear. We're going to have to move
to a house with an indoor bathroom.

632
00:56:09,928 --> 00:56:11,266
It's too cold like this.

633
00:56:13,222 --> 00:56:17,076
By the way, Bo Ra hasn't
mentioned anything, has she?

634
00:56:17,998 --> 00:56:19,999
She needs time to think.

635
00:56:21,914 --> 00:56:25,269
She's starting work tomorrow,
and it seems like she hasn't quit.

636
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,737
Now is not the time
for her to start working.

637
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:31,050
I'm upset as it is that she had
to waste that smart brain all this time.

638
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:34,574
What's taking her so long?
There's nothing to think about.

639
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:37,603
Honey, be quiet.
It's not an easy decision.

640
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,719
She must have forgotten all about it.
The thought of pursuing it, pretty scary.

641
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:50,926
I trust our Bo Ra.
She'll make the right decision.

642
00:57:07,947 --> 00:57:11,639
Thats, you two practically
made a movie together.

643
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:14,261
They're both idiots.

644
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:16,859
It was right in front of you.
How could you not find it?

645
00:57:17,566 --> 00:57:19,338
So, what did you two do?

646
00:57:23,121 --> 00:57:26,973
My God. By any chance, did you guys...

647
00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:30,874
-Hold hands?
-Come on!

648
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,369
Jung Bong oppa is not that type of person.
He's totally innocent.

649
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,863
It would be lucky if he even
made eye contact with Man Ok.

650
00:57:37,118 --> 00:57:40,320
Right? His face got red and he
couldn't say anything, right?

651
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:48,020
Our Soo Yeon is clueless
when it comes to guys.

652
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:53,834
No way! Then, did you two... hug?

653
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,028
I don't know!

654
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:00,788
They must have!

655
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:05,212
Soo Yeon, did you give him the present?
I thought it was pretty.

656
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:06,511
What present?

657
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:08,867
It was Dog Jung Pal's birthday,
so I bought him a shirt.

658
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:12,099
It was a pink button down shirt.
Man Ok picked it out.

659
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:13,808
Did he wear it?

660
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:18,519
No. I thought he'd wear it on his
birthday yesterday, but he didn't.

661
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,132
No way.

662
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,000
He was probably embarrassed
to wear it right away.

663
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:27,346
I guess I was wrong again this time.

664
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:32,087
-Soo Yeon.
-Yeah?

665
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:34,700
Some lady is looking for you.
She's over there.

666
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:40,488
-Who is she?
-She says she's the class president's mom.

667
00:58:40,832 --> 00:58:41,841
What?

668
00:58:48,307 --> 00:58:49,621
Let's go.

669
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,387
Ssangmun Girls' High

670
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:24,424
Hey! Be quiet!
Aren't you guys going to college?

671
00:59:25,386 --> 00:59:28,635
Hey, you're louder.

672
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:31,988
Is getting good grades everything?

673
00:59:33,356 --> 00:59:34,705
We're seniors.

674
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,469
I know.

675
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,318
Hello, ahjussi.

676
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,781
-You're here.
-Yes.

677
00:59:54,313 --> 00:59:57,300
-Did Jin Joo have a good time?
-Yes, we had fun together.

678
00:59:57,578 --> 00:59:58,786
We see things eye to eye.

679
00:59:59,787 --> 01:00:01,543
-Thank you, Ahjussi.
-No, no!

680
01:00:02,106 --> 01:00:04,889
It's cold, hurry up and go inside.
Your mom is waiting.

681
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,285
I will. Have a good night.

682
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:28,839
Thats, when OB won the
championship in 1982,

683
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:31,079
Park Chul Soo personally gave this to us.

684
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:32,504
Do you remember?

685
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,670
Of course, I'm the one
who caught the ball.

686
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:41,518
You were jumping up and down with joy.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

687
01:00:42,616 --> 01:00:46,396
My friends only like soccer.
I like baseball more.

688
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:51,382
It's been such a long time
since I played catch.

689
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,051
By the way, is grumbling
Jung Hwan doing well?

690
01:00:55,506 --> 01:01:00,130
Yes, he's doing well.
He's still the same, always grumbling.

691
01:01:01,068 --> 01:01:05,477
Sun Woo, I made
zucchini pancakes! Come out!

692
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,479
OK.

693
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:43,239
-Lil bro, eat this plate of apples.
-OK.

694
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:49,815
Are you planning on not
wearing this shirt?

695
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:53,900
It must be because you don't
like the color, isn't it?

696
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:56,760
It's a color that I like.

697
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:01,802
Would you mind giving it to me?

698
01:02:08,185 --> 01:02:09,915
Ssangmun Girls' High

699
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,889
Don't let her get to you.
Our class president is the same way.

700
01:02:13,388 --> 01:02:15,631
Anyway, all class presidents
are so annoying.

701
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,146
They think good grades
are all that matter.

702
01:02:18,483 --> 01:02:21,002
-I'm going to go.
-You're coming to eat lunch with us later?

703
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:22,182
Yes.

704
01:02:24,776 --> 01:02:28,815
-What should we do?
-Call the teacher!

705
01:02:28,826 --> 01:02:34,561
-Do something!
-What do we do?

706
01:02:36,054 --> 01:02:37,679
Move!

707
01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:46,296
Go away! If you don't like
what you see, then go away!

708
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:58,229
The doors! Shut the doors!

709
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:14,325
Ssangmun Girls' High

710
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:17,247
Infirmary

711
01:03:35,408 --> 01:03:36,554
You're awake.

712
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,082
Are you OK?

713
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:52,229
I passed out again, didn't I?

714
01:03:56,506 --> 01:03:59,619
The girls must have seen everything.

715
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,052
It's OK.
They're your classmates, who cares?

716
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:06,983
It happens.

717
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:17,533
It's OK.
It's OK!

718
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:21,092
It's OK.

719
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:43,733
Class president, it's cold.
Close the door.

720
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,944
Yeah.

721
01:04:55,178 --> 01:04:57,251
Hey, what took you so long?
Get over here.

722
01:04:57,973 --> 01:05:01,429
Hurry up and take out your lunch.
We want to eat your sausages.

723
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:19,194
That's way better than mine.
That's awesome!

724
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:23,103
What's this underneath?

725
01:05:25,073 --> 01:05:26,981
-What.
-Whoa, what the heck?

726
01:05:27,596 --> 01:05:30,088
Darn, I forgot to bring a spoon again.
What should I do?

727
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:46,939
Yeah! Thank you!

728
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:57,410
-This is really good.
-I want one.

729
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,017
That, nice.

730
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,372
-It's good.
-You like it?

731
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:10,353
-You eat it.
-What are you doing?

732
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:13,157
-You guys are awful.
-She's ignoring you.

733
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:14,453
This tastes a little strange.

734
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:17,788
-It's fine.
-The kimchi is too sour!

735
01:06:20,571 --> 01:06:23,477
You came home early today!
I just got home too.

736
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:26,341
I only stayed for the evening study hall.
The school is under construction.

737
01:06:26,855 --> 01:06:28,158
Mom, where's Jin Joo?

738
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:30,969
She's at ahjussi's place.
She's having fun, so I left her alone.

739
01:06:31,307 --> 01:06:33,115
They're best friends lately.

740
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,814
Yeah.

741
01:06:35,394 --> 01:06:36,484
Aren't you hungry?

742
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:38,286
I am.

743
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:42,339
Mom, I need to step outside for a moment.
I'll be right back.

744
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:43,966
OK.

745
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:56,155
-Hello, ahjussi.
-Jin Joo's asleep! I'll take her.

746
01:06:56,235 --> 01:06:59,810
No, open the bedroom door.
I'll tuck her in.

747
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,321
Your wrists are in bad shape.

748
01:07:28,572 --> 01:07:29,714
You're here?

749
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:33,950
What were you thinking about?
You didn't even notice that I walked in.

750
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:35,857
I was thinking about you.

751
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:41,155
Who are you trying to fool?
I know you, noona.

752
01:07:48,537 --> 01:07:52,683
Noona... can I have a shot of that?

753
01:08:14,613 --> 01:08:15,875
Ahjussi came over?

754
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,070
Did you find it?

755
01:08:27,227 --> 01:08:28,235
Find what?

756
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,382
The reason you hate ahjussi.
Did you find it?

757
01:08:32,337 --> 01:08:34,728
I told you, I don't hate him.

758
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,240
Fine, let's leave it at that.

759
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:43,015
It's true, I don't hate Ahjussi.

760
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:06,524
We're here.

761
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:09,097
I'm going to go first.

762
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:11,703
Good night.

763
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:18,274
-I will.
-Noona, everything's fine, right?

764
01:09:19,108 --> 01:09:20,221
There's nothing going on.

765
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,675
-Why do I feel so nervous?
-About what?

766
01:09:26,365 --> 01:09:27,401
Just because.

767
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,622
Be careful, someone might
see you two again.

768
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,951
Hello, noona.

769
01:09:38,323 --> 01:09:39,423
Hey.

770
01:09:40,296 --> 01:09:42,751
Why doesn't he make any noise?

771
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:45,786
You take care of it.

772
01:09:49,617 --> 01:09:50,799
Hey, Choi Heedong.

773
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,380
Yes?

774
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:55,059
I believe in you.

775
01:10:09,308 --> 01:10:10,610
I'm going to sleep in Taek's room.

776
01:10:10,983 --> 01:10:13,612
OK. Taek is just coming home now?

777
01:10:13,866 --> 01:10:15,519
Yes, I met him in the alley.

778
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,243
Ask if he took a lot of medicine today.

779
01:10:18,854 --> 01:10:21,029
It's not good to take
too many pain relievers.

780
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,470
Hold on. How many pain
relievers did you take today?

781
01:10:31,344 --> 01:10:33,514
He didn't take too many.
Go to sleep, Mom.

782
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:36,635
I will. Tell Taek I said good night!

783
01:10:36,794 --> 01:10:37,794
OK.

784
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:50,092
Great, you're warm. You're like a heater.
Why are you so warm?

785
01:10:50,103 --> 01:10:52,800
-Don't.
-Wait.

786
01:10:52,811 --> 01:10:58,529
-What's wrong with you, man?
-Sun Woo, stop!

787
01:10:58,972 --> 01:11:00,532
My goodness, you're warm.

788
01:11:01,412 --> 01:11:02,492
Sun Woo.

789
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:06,866
Is everything going well with Bo Ra noona?

790
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:10,448
Yes.

791
01:11:11,972 --> 01:11:13,014
It's good.

792
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,740
-But, Taek.
-Yeah?

793
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,396
Why is it Deok Sun?

794
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:26,625
I mean, there's tons
of girls who like you.

795
01:11:27,635 --> 01:11:28,650
Why is it Deok Sun?

796
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:32,949
What's the reason? Why do you like her?

797
01:11:37,646 --> 01:11:38,876
I just like her.

798
01:11:42,997 --> 01:11:45,717
I just like it when I'm with her.

799
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:51,867
Without her...

800
01:11:56,113 --> 01:11:57,830
I think I could die.

801
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,474
Hey... This dude has totally gone insane.

802
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,556
Wake up, Choi Taek!

803
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,419
You need to take more medicine.
I noticed you take less of it lately.

804
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:12,647
Take some more pills.

805
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,987
-Let's take it together.
-I don't need medicine.

806
01:12:18,823 --> 01:12:21,928
Hey, let's go to Brazil tomorrow.
It's on you.

807
01:12:22,287 --> 01:12:24,678
I spent all my allowance for the month.

808
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:28,667
And... I have a date tomorrow.

809
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:32,408
- You brat!
- Brat!

810
01:12:32,616 --> 01:12:38,024
Yes, right. Sung Soo Yeon,
you were really awesome today.

811
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:41,513
-Forget it.
-Why? Did something happen?

812
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:43,347
-It's nothing.
-You don't need to know.

813
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:46,342
-What is it?
-It's a secret!

814
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,813
-We're going to go ahead.
-See you.

815
01:12:57,118 --> 01:12:58,147
See you!

816
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:07,825
Song Hee left.

817
01:13:10,883 --> 01:13:13,650
Can I give you a hug?

818
01:13:27,593 --> 01:13:33,083
Thank you, Deok Sun.
I am so, so thankful.

819
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:38,041
It's no problem at all. But I think
that I forgot to do several things.

820
01:13:38,963 --> 01:13:41,641
No, no, you did a great job.

821
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:45,778
Thank you. Thank you so much.

822
01:13:46,685 --> 01:13:48,042
Thank you.

823
01:13:50,112 --> 01:13:51,634
You are so lovely.

824
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,230
I'm sorry student,
but please do this favor for me.

825
01:14:07,502 --> 01:14:08,707
It's not difficult.

826
01:14:09,187 --> 01:14:10,488
If she passes out...

827
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:12,807
...just remove any dangerous
objects around her...

828
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,526
...and take her to the infirmary, OK?

829
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:20,291
-I will, ma'am.
-And... she might throw up...

830
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:23,186
...so just turn her head
slightly to the side.

831
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:29,047
I'm counting on you. I'm so sorry.

832
01:14:37,842 --> 01:14:42,433
Yes, Teacher. What can I
help you with, at this hour?

833
01:14:43,677 --> 01:14:48,273
Did... did Deok Sun
get into trouble again?

834
01:14:49,456 --> 01:14:55,090
No. Please give her lots of praises
when she comes home, ma'am.

835
01:14:57,108 --> 01:15:00,700
To be honest with you, we have
an epilepsy patient in our class.

836
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,372
That child's mother was very concerned.

837
01:15:04,776 --> 01:15:06,286
My goodness, is that so?

838
01:15:06,693 --> 01:15:10,249
- Yes.
-Thats, my...

839
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,530
-She must be so worried.
-Yes.

840
01:15:15,027 --> 01:15:16,410
Are you serious?

841
01:15:19,697 --> 01:15:22,984
I see. My goodness!

842
01:15:25,394 --> 01:15:26,421
Yes.

843
01:15:26,506 --> 01:15:29,189
I had no idea, ma'am.

844
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:33,575
Song Hee's previous homeroom
teacher hasn't talked about it.

845
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:37,238
The kids in that class
are very tight lipped.

846
01:15:37,507 --> 01:15:39,207
I had no idea.

847
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:43,285
I have a lot of debt I need to pay back.

848
01:15:43,507 --> 01:15:45,390
Please, don't worry!

849
01:15:46,202 --> 01:15:50,300
There's a sweet and kind girl
in our class named Deok Sun.

850
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:51,968
You can count on her.

851
01:15:52,351 --> 01:15:55,351
If something were to happen,
there's nothing to worry about.

852
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,545
She's very smart.

853
01:16:00,438 --> 01:16:02,092
Thank you, Teacher.

854
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,577
-Thank you.
-No problem at all.

855
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:08,152
She must have very good grades.

856
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,082
No, she can't study at all.

857
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:14,078
But she is smart.

858
01:16:19,707 --> 01:16:24,224
Our Soo Yeon is really sweet. Good girl.

859
01:16:24,804 --> 01:16:26,599
Is she sleeping?

860
01:16:27,744 --> 01:16:31,271
No, she's studying in her room.
She's a senior now.

861
01:16:31,702 --> 01:16:34,379
Sweet little rascal!

862
01:16:35,213 --> 01:16:39,058
What am I doing? I'm going
to tell her she did a good job.

863
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,910
I should pay her a visit of encouragement.

864
01:16:48,716 --> 01:16:51,015
She's definitely our Deok Sun.

865
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:07,778
She's definitely our Deok Sun.

866
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:18,878
My god, that boy is hilarious.

867
01:17:19,129 --> 01:17:21,570
He's going to be a very
famous comedian someday.

868
01:17:21,698 --> 01:17:23,229
For sure, Mom.

869
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:26,352
So far, he's the funniest guy
I've seen on "Viva Youth".

870
01:17:27,785 --> 01:17:32,921
Thats, and our Deok... and our Soo Yeon
will get accepted to Seoul University.

871
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:37,508
Do you think becoming a comedian is easy?
Not anyone can be one.

872
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:42,218
The way I see it,
this is as good as he'll ever be.

873
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:44,509
Not more, not less.
He looks like a grasshopper.

874
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:46,755
- Want to bet?
- Let's bet on it!

875
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:59,157
No Eul, I need you to leave for a moment.
I need to talk to Mom and Dad.

876
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:09,813
Hello? OK, noona.
I'll leave right now.

877
01:18:22,636 --> 01:18:25,042
Mom, I'll be right back.
Bye, Jin Joo!

878
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,395
-I made dumpling soup, come home early!
-OK.

879
01:18:50,855 --> 01:18:54,827
What happened?
Jin Joo, did you hurt your head?

880
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,613
What do I do?

881
01:18:59,441 --> 01:19:02,382
There's something going on, isn't there?
Did your part time job not work out?

882
01:19:02,562 --> 01:19:03,589
No.

883
01:19:04,498 --> 01:19:07,006
What is it, then?
Why won't you tell me?

884
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,620
I'm going to tell you.

885
01:19:09,322 --> 01:19:11,209
Sun Woo, I...

886
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:13,736
Sun Woo, come quickly!
Jin Joo is going to the hospital!

887
01:19:16,182 --> 01:19:18,908
-I'll go with you.
-No, I'll call you later.

888
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:34,100
Noona, are you going somewhere?

889
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:37,238
I'm going to Taek's room.
He's going to buy pizza tonight.

890
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,304
Taek is such a saint.

891
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:43,935
Dooly group members are such jerks!

892
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:46,621
Who are you calling Dooly group members?
Who? Who? Who?

893
01:19:53,419 --> 01:19:55,866
Isn't it time for "Knight Rider" to start?

894
01:19:58,821 --> 01:20:01,036
I'll see you later.

895
01:20:09,789 --> 01:20:11,569
Hi, Soo Yeon.

896
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:16,480
I'm off to see my date.

897
01:20:17,874 --> 01:20:18,954
Wish me luck.

898
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,010
Is Taek here already? Go on without me,
I'm going to leave later...

899
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:35,127
I'm going to get going, then.

900
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:46,479
Hey...

901
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:56,895
Darn it!

902
01:21:05,135 --> 01:21:07,677
Seoul Dobong Clinic

903
01:21:29,463 --> 01:21:33,278
-Is Jin Joo all right?
-She's fine, don't worry.

904
01:21:35,144 --> 01:21:36,360
She must have been so shocked.

905
01:21:38,012 --> 01:21:39,942
Her head is fine, right?

906
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:44,289
Her X-rays are fine, so don't worry.

907
01:21:45,763 --> 01:21:48,403
She just took some medicine
to calm down from the shock.

908
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:49,827
It's OK, it's OK.

909
01:21:58,361 --> 01:22:01,632
-Mom, you must have been so shocked.
-A little. I'm fine now.

910
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:05,319
-I bet you were so shocked.
-Yes.

911
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:07,630
You more than me.

912
01:22:08,045 --> 01:22:09,848
No, I'm fine now.

913
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:12,707
Didn't you say you had plans today?

914
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:14,757
I'm all right,
go take care of your business.

915
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:17,713
No, it's OK. I'll stay here.

916
01:22:19,533 --> 01:22:23,027
I'll go get a cup of coffee, then.

917
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:35,524
Jin Joo, you're awake.

918
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:39,370
It must have hurt a lot.
I bet you were so shocked.

919
01:22:39,966 --> 01:22:41,317
Ahjussi.

920
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:45,057
-What?
-Where is Ahjussi?

921
01:22:48,404 --> 01:22:50,857
Do you miss Ahjussi?

922
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,274
Yes.

923
01:22:53,183 --> 01:22:56,705
OK, stay here.
I'll go get him for you.

924
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:12,701
I hope Jin Joo is all right.

925
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,956
I was scared to death.

926
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,716
What if something's wrong with her?

927
01:23:23,073 --> 01:23:28,206
Should we go to a bigger hospital?

928
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:32,132
No, she's fine.

929
01:23:33,156 --> 01:23:35,308
It's OK. It's OK.

930
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:41,126
Don't cry. It's nothing to cry about.

931
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:48,080
She fell while I was doing the laundry.

932
01:23:48,414 --> 01:23:51,617
I should have been watching her
the whole time! I'm such an idiot!

933
01:23:52,651 --> 01:23:57,755
You can't watch her 24 hours a day.
It's OK, it's OK.

934
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:01,950
It was an accident, it happens.

935
01:24:02,809 --> 01:24:06,263
I'm so angry at myself!

936
01:24:08,321 --> 01:24:11,772
It's OK, don't worry. Don't cry.

937
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,382
Why did you come?

938
01:24:20,934 --> 01:24:23,227
Is Jin Joo all right?

939
01:24:24,649 --> 01:24:25,904
Yes, she's fine.

940
01:24:26,599 --> 01:24:27,629
That's good.

941
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,379
Let's go.

942
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:45,770
Is something wrong?

943
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:53,713
Noona.

944
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:56,748
I think I know now.

945
01:24:58,358 --> 01:24:59,370
About what?

946
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,864
The reason why I hate ahjussi.

947
01:25:15,956 --> 01:25:18,939
Why I hate him...

948
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:25,763
I think I know now.

949
01:25:31,258 --> 01:25:33,286
I feel sorry for my dad.

950
01:25:39,393 --> 01:25:40,913
I...

951
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,038
feel so sorry for my dad.

952
01:26:02,044 --> 01:26:03,374
My dad.

953
01:26:27,289 --> 01:26:33,548
I think Mom makes the best
dumpling soup in the world.

954
01:26:34,582 --> 01:26:37,585
I think everything your mom
makes is delicious.

955
01:26:49,568 --> 01:26:50,578
Dad.

956
01:26:53,772 --> 01:26:58,036
Today... Jin Joo got hurt.

957
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:07,722
Mom was really shocked.

958
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:12,242
She told me she was fine.

959
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:17,158
But she told Taek's dad...

960
01:27:19,331 --> 01:27:22,426
...that she was scared, and she cried.

961
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:32,134
It seems... Mom is more comfortable
with ahjussi than she is with me.

962
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,388
It's because she didn't
want you to worry.

963
01:27:37,405 --> 01:27:39,286
I understand completely.

964
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:43,011
Dad.

965
01:27:45,873 --> 01:27:46,928
Aren't you upset?

966
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:51,846
Sun Woo, I'm not upset at all.

967
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,364
Sun Woo.

968
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,170
You see...

969
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:04,226
There's nothing that
I can do for your mom.

970
01:28:07,735 --> 01:28:12,282
I just had... to be by her side.

971
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:19,661
And now... I can't even do that.

972
01:28:21,815 --> 01:28:22,838
Sun Woo.

973
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:25,629
I...

974
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:30,144
...want your mom to be happy.

975
01:28:34,037 --> 01:28:35,400
That's all I want.

976
01:28:39,284 --> 01:28:40,434
Dad...

977
01:28:43,034 --> 01:28:44,338
I'm sorry.

978
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,671
I'm really sorry.

979
01:29:08,795 --> 01:29:10,540
Dad...

980
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,620
What's up with you?
Are you shooting a movie?

981
01:29:34,107 --> 01:29:37,131
Master, there's something
I'm curious about.

982
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:39,618
Tell me.

983
01:29:41,241 --> 01:29:43,765
Why won't anyone like me?

984
01:29:49,575 --> 01:29:50,647
Thats, it's Taek.

985
01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:54,023
Nope, never mind.

986
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:57,327
I'm serious.

987
01:29:58,013 --> 01:29:59,257
I know, I'm serious too.

988
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:04,542
Why isn't there anyone who likes me?

989
01:30:06,525 --> 01:30:09,087
I guess I'm a woman who
doesn't deserve to be loved.

990
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:12,644
-Deok Sun.
-Yeah?

991
01:30:13,056 --> 01:30:15,135
Do you like boiled sweet potatoes
or baked sweet potatoes?

992
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:18,130
-Boiled sweet potatoes.
-Do you like Lee Moon Se or Park Nam Jung?

993
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:20,392
-Lee Moon Se.
-Do you like me or Taek?

994
01:30:20,496 --> 01:30:22,777
-Taek.
-How annoying.

995
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:26,597
-You hate me?
-No, but I still like Taek more.

996
01:30:28,134 --> 01:30:32,048
If that's the case, do you like
Jung Pal or Sun Woo?

997
01:30:33,893 --> 01:30:36,124
Why are you asking such a thing?

998
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:42,176
Deok Sun.

999
01:30:44,741 --> 01:30:45,903
How do you feel?

1000
01:30:48,224 --> 01:30:52,712
Instead of other people liking you,
who is it that you like?

1001
01:30:54,936 --> 01:30:56,986
You're so clear about the way
you like to eat sweet potatoes.

1002
01:30:57,269 --> 01:30:58,957
Don't you have a type of person you like?

1003
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,849
Deok Sun... I mean, Soo Yeon.

1004
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:09,198
You can like someone instead
of someone liking you, right?

1005
01:31:13,155 --> 01:31:16,451
Kids only know the quadratic formula.
They don't know about life.

1006
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,445
But you don't know the quadratic formula
or about life? What is it that you do know?

1007
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:23,739
What's up with you?

1008
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:25,874
I swear...

1009
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:28,575
Hurry, get up.

1010
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:30,879
Are we going somewhere?

1011
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:33,994
Pizza's here.

1012
01:31:47,783 --> 01:31:49,835
How many pizzas did you buy?

1013
01:31:50,591 --> 01:31:51,696
Five.

1014
01:31:52,325 --> 01:31:53,801
You're definitely rich.

1015
01:31:53,946 --> 01:31:56,430
I figured we couldn't eat together
since my match ended late.

1016
01:31:57,243 --> 01:31:59,075
So, I bought each one of you
a pizza to eat at home.

1017
01:32:00,131 --> 01:32:02,547
Heedong... let's get married.

1018
01:32:04,373 --> 01:32:05,409
No, thank you.

1019
01:32:06,283 --> 01:32:08,118
Go home, he needs to sleep.

1020
01:32:08,188 --> 01:32:12,232
OK, bye! I'm going to eat this all
by myself, and not give any to the dean.

1021
01:32:14,015 --> 01:32:15,165
I'm going to go too.

1022
01:32:19,235 --> 01:32:20,552
Stay a bit.

1023
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:24,690
OK.

1024
01:32:35,307 --> 01:32:38,287
From: Im Soo Min
To Taek, whom I love

1025
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,159
Sit down.

1026
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,110
Do you reply back?

1027
01:32:49,983 --> 01:32:53,474
It must be nice to not to be interested
in anything except for baduk.

1028
01:33:02,539 --> 01:33:04,258
You've never even liked
anyone before, right?

1029
01:33:09,525 --> 01:33:11,266
You have no interest in
anything but baduk.

1030
01:33:12,635 --> 01:33:13,649
That's not true.

1031
01:33:14,228 --> 01:33:17,452
Yeah right, don't lie.
Who are you trying to fool?

1032
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:21,822
You're in the palm of my hand.

1033
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,142
There's nothing that
I don't know about you.

1034
01:33:31,384 --> 01:33:33,495
You don't know anything about me.

1035
01:33:39,702 --> 01:33:41,297
There's someone I like.

1036
01:33:45,975 --> 01:33:48,295
And... I'm going to confess...

1037
01:33:49,465 --> 01:33:50,527
Soon.

1038
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:02,331
Are you planning on not
wearing this shirt?

1039
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:05,898
It must be because you don't
like the color, isn't it?

1040
01:35:07,272 --> 01:35:08,908
It's a color that I like.

1041
01:35:10,966 --> 01:35:13,023
Would you mind giving it to me?

1042
01:35:24,566 --> 01:35:25,580
No.

1043
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,153
Not this shirt.

1044
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:50,101
But... how did you know my size?

1045
01:35:51,316 --> 01:35:53,606
It fits me perfectly.

1046
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:56,737
I really wanted this shirt.

1047
01:35:58,084 --> 01:35:59,335
When did you receive it?

1048
01:35:59,656 --> 01:36:01,281
It was delivered in the morning.

1049
01:36:03,765 --> 01:36:05,492
Don't tell Soo Yeon.

1050
01:36:06,214 --> 01:36:08,399
She's going to make fun of me
if she finds out that I copied her.

1051
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:12,803
It'll be our secret.

1052
01:36:15,088 --> 01:36:16,393
Then...

1053
01:36:18,255 --> 01:36:19,332
Good night.

1054
01:36:59,976 --> 01:37:01,057
Soo Yeon!

1055
01:37:02,596 --> 01:37:04,394
Oppa, what's wrong?
Why are you running?

1056
01:37:04,978 --> 01:37:05,983
Have you lost your mind?

1057
01:37:06,544 --> 01:37:08,517
Everyone likes Deok Sun.

1058
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,806
How is that possible?

1059
01:37:11,507 --> 01:37:13,094
Did something happen?

1060
01:37:15,056 --> 01:37:16,090
What?

1061
01:37:18,024 --> 01:37:19,037
Crazy jerk.

1062
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:20,921
Someone got hurt?

1063
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:25,520
There was an accident at
Gwangsan Supermarket.

1064
01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:28,093
Do I transfer him to a different hospital?
What should I do?

1065
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:37,129
Will you be confessing to Deok Sun, then?

1066
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,807
Taek...

1067
01:37:47,965 --> 01:37:51,169
If you want to know if someone
likes you, look into their eyes.

1068
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,455
Eyes can't lie.

1069
01:37:57,913 --> 01:38:01,544
Do you think Deok Sun will believe me
if I confess my feelings for her?
