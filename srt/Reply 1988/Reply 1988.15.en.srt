1
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:49,793
Hi.

2
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:52,215
Ahjussi... do you know
how to play baseball?

3
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,202
Yeah. A bit.

4
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,380
Then... do you want to
play with me for a bit?

5
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:02,927
Sure.

6
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,881
I'll be at the vacant lot up front.

7
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,245
OK.

8
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:29,973
This...

9
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:03,734
Hey, Bo Ra.

10
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:08,565
Come have lunch at my place today
and bring your siblings.

11
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:09,576
Excuse me?

12
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,131
The moms are protesting because
we're tired of cooking.

13
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:16,460
We are going out to eat for
the first time in a while...

14
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:19,267
...so gather all the kids on the block
and have lunch with them here, OK?

15
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:23,665
But, there's a lot of them... I think
they'd be fine fending for themselves.

16
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:26,321
Don't worry, Mother.

17
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,921
What do you worry about,
when you have your eldest son?

18
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:36,611
OK, then. Make sure they eat.
I'll leave you some money.

19
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:37,716
Yes.

20
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,221
Oppa, did something good
happen to you lately?

21
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:45,993
Nope.

22
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:47,828
You're seeing someone, right?

23
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:50,673
No, that's not it.

24
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,545
Hey... you're so bad at lying.

25
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,921
Look at me straight in the
eye and say that again.

26
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,391
You're seeing someone, right? Right?

27
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:01,086
No. Definitely not.

28
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:03,199
I can see it in your eyes.

29
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:06,766
Best of luck to you, Mr. Kim Jung Bong.

30
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,563
Oppa, good luck!

31
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:14,577
What the heck! What the heck!
Kim Jung heck!

32
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,654
Hyungnim... you're seeing someone?
Congrats hyungnim!

33
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,161
I'm off to the office.

34
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,362
I left you money, so buy
yourself some food, OK?

35
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,500
Yes!

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,939
Or if not, order
jjajangmyun for dinner!

37
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:36,134
Yes!

38
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:39,532
I did that for dinner
yesterday, though...

39
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,346
Hey, Dong Ryong!

40
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,896
-Did you hear everything?
-Indeed I did, hyungnim!

41
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:51,663
I heard everything that was said after
"Don't worry, Mother."

42
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,496
I've felt this way
since a while back, but...

43
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,664
...you really do have an
incredible sense of hearing.

44
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,166
Yes, hyungnim! Thank you!

45
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,318
I get that quite often.

46
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:11,136
-It's a secret, OK?
-Yes, it's a secret!

47
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,141
I'll see you for lunch later
at your place, hyungnim!

48
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:32,470
Bo Ra, can you pass me your dad's shirt?

49
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:39,182
Mom, throw this out.
The collar is all worn out.

50
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:47,055
Right... We'll have to buy him a
new one with his paycheck this month.

51
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:49,544
Bo Ra, lift your butt for a second.

52
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,774
See! It turned out so well!
It's even better than ironing it!

53
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:02,282
Bo Ra.

54
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:04,995
You're only going to your part time job
until next week, right?

55
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:08,459
-Did you talk to your upperclassman?
-Yeah. He said that it's fine.

56
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,526
-He's a good guy.
-Really?

57
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:17,401
I'm so happy nowadays.

58
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:19,061
I feel like I could fly!

59
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:45,697
No Eul, leave for a bit.
I have something to say to Mom and Dad.

60
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,385
I'll start preparing to take the bar exam.

61
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:04,837
That's a great decision
you've made, Bo Ra.

62
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:08,690
But even so, I made a promise to work,
so I'll be working for a month.

63
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:14,872
-Need give them time to find replacement.
-Yes, of course.

64
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:21,681
So you'll only work for a month and
then start preparing for the bar?

65
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:26,284
Yes, Bo Ra. Don't worry about
anything else from now on.

66
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,015
Finish up that part time job,
and then focus solely on your studies.

67
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:32,678
Don't you worry about anything
other than that.

68
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,379
Your dad and I can support you,
no problem! OK?

69
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,559
My daughter... you really can't concern
yourself with anything else now, OK?

70
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:45,158
OK. Also, keep this a secret
for the time being.

71
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:49,292
From my siblings, and from other people.
It'll just become troublesome.

72
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:52,063
OK, OK! No problem!

73
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:58,614
We won't say a
single word about it...

74
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,828
...until you're done with
your part time job.

75
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:02,128
Don't worry!

76
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,345
Yeah. Don't you worry.

77
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:09,686
Bo Ra. You've made the right choice.

78
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:11,852
You've made the right...

79
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,635
Yeah. You've made the right decision.

80
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:34,487
That's right, you put it on like that!

81
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,174
Well, I guess you really
don't get much exercise.

82
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,507
You're really like a bear.

83
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:45,641
-It's not that... honestly, I...
-Yes, I'll go easy on you!

84
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,915
I'll pretend you're Jin
Joo, and throw it gently.

85
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,213
This distance is good enough, right?

86
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:55,114
No, it's not... actually,
you're a bit too close.

87
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:57,791
You can't close your eyes, OK?

88
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:03,017
Hey, so you are a bit
athletic, aren't you?

89
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,126
Even so, this is a bit too close.

90
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,176
But do you want to
throw it from there, anyway?

91
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:13,720
I think we're a bit too close.

92
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,617
Is this OK?

93
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:21,649
No, I think you'll have
to walk a bit further.

94
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,180
Is this OK? I think
this is too far, though.

95
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,356
-I'll throw it now.
-OK... OK.

96
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,654
I think you've watched a bit too
much professional baseball.

97
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,244
Strike!

98
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,767
My Jin Joo! Have fun with ahjussi, OK?

99
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,563
I'm going to the market. I'll buy you
some goldfish bread that you like.

100
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:30,714
You're here?

101
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:32,647
You're having lunch this late?

102
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,617
Yeah. I'm just going to eat whatever.

103
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,423
But... you didn't go to the market yet?

104
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:40,773
I'm just about to head out now.

105
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:43,998
Jin Joo had lunch,
so you don't need to feed her.

106
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:48,367
OK. Go and have a lot
of delicious things, and have fun.

107
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,346
You can't even let loose often,
working all the time in bathhouse.

108
00:09:57,387 --> 00:10:01,016
What is that? You don't even have soup?

109
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,995
I like kimchi. Kimchi is good enough.

110
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,785
How can a patient be eating like this?
Is there anything you want to eat?

111
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,850
I'll make it for you.
I'll get ingredients while I'm out.

112
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,289
What I want to eat?

113
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,719
I have had a hankering
for that lately.

114
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,314
What? What is it?

115
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:24,094
Cucumber kimchi.

116
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,761
Well... you've got such
an unrefined palate.

117
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:32,001
I'll pick up some cucumbers
if there are any good ones.

118
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:33,244
OK.

119
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,211
Did you have fun?

120
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:44,665
Yes. Ahjussi is really
different than he seems.

121
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:46,089
I thought my arm was going to break off.

122
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,603
How unexpected.

123
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,291
Let's meet up later at the food cart...

124
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,181
-I'm not eating!
-Hey, Salamander!

125
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,904
-Stop it.
-Why don't you eat at home?

126
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,676
I told you, I don't want to eat!

127
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:01,740
Well, I caught a whiff of
an amazing smell here, so...

128
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,235
-I'm sorry.
-Bye.

129
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,652
-Let's go!
-Darn it!

130
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:12,477
I told you, I don't want to eat!

131
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:14,569
-Why aren't you eating!
-Hey!

132
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,531
Hurry up here!

133
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:19,940
I'm not eating.

134
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,747
Hyung, it's not finished yet?
Do you want me to help?

135
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,120
Ten more seconds!

136
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,727
Weren't we having jjajangmyun?

137
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,161
That's what I thought, too.

138
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:32,635
I told him to make us something else
because I'm sick of jjajangmyun.

139
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,119
What gives you the right?

140
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,975
Do you know what the most
important thing nowadays is?

141
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:41,067
"Inpormatyon."

142
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:43,925
Information.
I have that.

143
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,700
One can consider information to be the
most important thing in this day and age.

144
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:49,137
It's almost as valuable as
money itself.

145
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:50,148
Hey.

146
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,300
-Money is something that comes and goes.
-Hey.

147
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:53,571
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,357
-Let's eat quietly.
-Yes.

149
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:56,814
-Got it?
-Yes.

150
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:01,030
Put something down on the table...

151
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:07,484
- Great. Looks delicious.
-It's kimchi fried rice.

152
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:08,627
Unexpected...

153
00:12:08,638 --> 00:12:11,105
But is this really enough for everyone?
It doesn't look enough.

154
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:15,863
Put something down on the table!...

155
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,724
OK, then... enjoy, everyone!

156
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:29,052
-How are we supposed to eat all of this?
-Thats... looks delicious.

157
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:32,342
You even know how to
make kimchi fried rice?

158
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:33,443
Of course.

159
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,509
Anyone can make this.
The one dish my dad can make is this.

160
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,937
At any rate, thanks for the food, Oppa!

161
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:41,196
Thank you!

162
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:46,111
Do you have anything else you
want to eat, Dong Ryong?

163
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,534
No, I don't. I'm fine with anything,
as long as it's not delivery.

164
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:53,876
But... where did Jung Pal go?

165
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,082
He went to go borrow a video.
I told him to go borrow Amadeus.

166
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,047
Hey.

167
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:00,521
I'm home, hyung.

168
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,205
Is today a holiday or something?

169
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,645
Hurry up and come sit!
Your brother is so good at cooking!

170
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,558
-It tastes awesome!
-Hyung, hurry and sit.

171
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,413
-It's going to get cold.
-Come sit over here, lil Bro.

172
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,335
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and sit.

173
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,293
So... Taek went to the
Baduk Club today, too?

174
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,548
The Tong Yang Cup has begun...

175
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,280
...and next week is the final
match of the Ing Cup.

176
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:45,490
It's 5 ki, so if he wins this time,
he'll be the victor.

177
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:47,198
What does 5-ki mean?

178
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Hey.

179
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,578
If you wipe this off, we'll tell you.

180
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:00,936
What?

181
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:41,564
What's that?

182
00:14:43,385 --> 00:14:45,348
Master Choi's passionate fans.

183
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:49,058
People whose wish is to play
Baduk with Master Choi.

184
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:54,364
-Aigoo. There's no way he'd agree to it.
-Exactly.

185
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,767
It'd even be a reach to
bring it up with him.

186
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:05,708
Hello?

187
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,168
Yes... Producer Choi!

188
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:13,171
Hey... What's with Producer Choi?

189
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,730
My junior... save your
sunbae just this once.

190
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:21,618
I really need an interview with Choi Taek,
6-dan! I thought you two were close!

191
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:25,516
Sunbae. Of course I'd ask if I could.

192
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:30,014
But he really won't agree
to things like this.

193
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:33,486
Even so, just bring it
up to him just once!

194
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,728
He hates making requests
and receiving them, too!

195
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,953
He really doesn't care about
anything except Baduk!

196
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,988
Fine. But don't have your hopes up.

197
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,261
OK.

198
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:51,973
OK.

199
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,242
Is that Producer Choi from UBS?

200
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,518
Yeah.

201
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:04,306
He had helped us out a
lot in promoting Baduk.

202
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,635
The broadcast of last year's
Guksu Cup was all thanks to him.

203
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:13,067
Thats... I do owe him one...

204
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,984
But there's no way Choi Taek
6-dan will agree to do it.

205
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:47,166
If I had placed this stone here first,
would I have not lost?

206
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
That's correct.

207
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,015
How does it look?

208
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:56,016
It seems that black has the
advantage, a little bit.

209
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,696
And here, I thought that
I had the advantage.

210
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,576
Market Noodle House

211
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:24,412
-Hello!
-Hello!

212
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:27,823
-Please give us three noodles.
-Of course.

213
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,499
This looks nice. It's a great buy.

214
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,342
But why are you buying
Jung Bong's dad pajamas?

215
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:42,052
I don't want to see him
walking around naked.

216
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,919
That's enough! That's way too much!

217
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,425
That's fine! It's way too much!

218
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,896
How will you make
any profit like this?

219
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:58,171
-Granny, can we have some kimchi, too?
-Of course.

220
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,592
Making seasoned blood clams
is so much work!

221
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,257
When you put the
sauce for every one?

222
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:09,748
Bo Ra's dad and Bo Ra both like them.

223
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,321
If I make it once, we can
eat it for several days.

224
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,348
Thats right, the chives!

225
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,516
Didn't you say you were going
to make chive pancakes?

226
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,128
It's such a hassle. My arm will fall off!

227
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,098
I don't have time to make that!
I'm just going to tell them...

228
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:23,126
...there wasn't any today.
They always seem to fall for it.

229
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,674
But Sun Woo's mom, why did you buy
so many cucumbers?

230
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:29,984
Are you making cucumber kimchi?

231
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:32,707
Yes, I've been craving them for
the first time in a while!

232
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,836
Granny, your anchovy stock
is perfect today! It's delicious!

233
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:45,533
-Thank you.
-Granny, it's really great today!

234
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,767
How much is everything?

235
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:55,668
No, no! I'll pay.
I have some money now too.

236
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:59,068
Then I, as the youngest, will buy
you some vending machine coffee!

237
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,697
-OK, it's fine. Buy next time.
-I don't need the change.

238
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:07,515
N o! I can't let you do that every time.
Please, take your change.

239
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:10,494
No, it's fine! We all ate about
1000 won's worth! It's fine!

240
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:14,147
-We ate so much! Please, take it!
-Goodbye!

241
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,492
I'll just take these, OK? Bye!

242
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,964
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

243
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:27,971
Episode 15: Between Love and Friendship

244
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:01,708
Bo Ra! Soo Yeon! No Eul!
Fold up your blankets!

245
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,899
I'm bringing the food in!

246
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:05,900
Hey, how come you didn't
call my name?

247
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,791
Dong Il, let's eat!

248
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,055
OK.

249
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,418
All of you, come on out!

250
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:27,218
Scram out here before I count
to three! One! Two!

251
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:34,024
We're here.

252
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:35,949
Jung Hwan, set the silverware.

253
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:45,037
-Mom, I want a younger sibling.
-Shut your trap.

254
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,866
Let's go. It's Jung Hwan's wish,
after all.

255
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:50,305
Crazy.... crazy!

256
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:56,350
Chopsticks. Hurry it up.

257
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:58,759
I'm really in need of a younger sibling.

258
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,460
Hey, the kimchi stew looks great,
doesn't it?

259
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,674
Yeah, it looks good.

260
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,774
-Have some too, Mom.
-OK. I will.

261
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,482
I thought you were making cucumber kimchi.

262
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:11,224
Yeah, I'm soaking them now.
I'm going to make it tomorrow.

263
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:12,812
Hurry up and eat.

264
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:20,284
Why don't you invite ahjussi, too, Mom?

265
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,202
I'm sure Taek will be late
today too, anyway.

266
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,812
For what? Taek's dad can
eat well alone.

267
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,038
How come there's
no place for us to live...

268
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,731
...when they are building
so many new apartments?

269
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:08,479
Dad. When are we moving?
I want to live in an apartment, too.

270
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:11,446
More than half my friends
live in apartments now.

271
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,981
OK. Just wait a bit longer.

272
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,586
I'm working hard to earn money,
aren't I?

273
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:18,882
Sorry.

274
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,171
It's OK, Dad.

275
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:23,656
I'll earn tons of money later
and buy you a nice house.

276
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:25,769
Just believe in me.
I'll buy one for you.

277
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:28,708
You girl worry about getting
into college first.

278
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,038
If you can't get into college even
after we changed your name...

279
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:34,684
I'll kill you with my own two hands.
Got that?

280
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,774
Who cares if she can't
get into some college?

281
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:42,286
Our Soo Yeon is so
pretty, smart, and kind!

282
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,751
Tomorrow is Soo Yeon's
college consultation.

283
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:57,406
College consultations already?

284
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,646
They do them right after
you become a senior.

285
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,521
Mom, don't pass out tomorrow
after seeing her grades.

286
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,248
-Hey!
-"Hey?"

287
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:05,463
You little!

288
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,244
Hey, hey... even so, I'm sure there's
some college out there that'll take her.

289
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:14,185
I'm not even hoping for you
to get into a good school. OK?

290
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,894
You shouldn't even be expecting
her to get into college at all, Mom.

291
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:19,214
-Hey!
-Why, I ought to...

292
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:22,488
Thank you for the meal.
I'm going to get some fresh air.

293
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:27,652
That's Soo Yeon's greatest positive trait.

294
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:30,150
She's immature sometimes...

295
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:34,927
...but she always makes those
around her feel better.

296
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,324
And she's very cutesy, too.

297
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,477
I envy that.

298
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:42,796
Everyone likes Deok Sun.

299
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:46,096
She's cute and is always smiling.

300
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:50,012
She has a charm about her
that makes people feel good.

301
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:51,169
Right?

302
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,526
I don't have any of those traits.

303
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:59,734
She even hugs and kisses my dad
without any hesitation whatsoever.

304
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:03,040
How does she do that?

305
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,336
You don't act like that with your dad?

306
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,633
Never. I could never act
like that with him.

307
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:14,947
Now that I think about it,
you don't seem very close with your dad.

308
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:21,355
Did something happen between you two?

309
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,945
No! What do you mean?

310
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:27,441
Nothing like that has ever happened.

311
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:31,932
My personality is probably
to blame for this.

312
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,204
My personality is a bit... you know.

313
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,113
You must be suffering
through so much, dating me.

314
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:42,482
I like you, though.

315
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,264
I think your personality
is better than Soo Yeon's.

316
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:52,969
I really am a crazy jerk, aren't I?

317
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:55,979
Yeah. Are you drunk?

318
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:14,958
Thats... my salary isn't much, and you're
already starting installment savings.

319
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,676
What? It's great that we can
finally save some money!

320
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:22,705
I never thought would come a day when
I'd start saving 80,000 won every month.

321
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:27,559
Well... we're finally done suffering!

322
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:34,614
Well. This one really is the one
with the highest interest, right?

323
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:38,150
I'm telling you, it is!
How many times do I have to tell you?

324
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:43,464
I opened the account with the highest
rate at our bank at 17 percent!

325
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:56,032
But... honey. There's nothing going
on between you and Bo Ra, right?

326
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:59,260
What are you talking about?

327
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,773
Seeing that you two aren't
close at all,

328
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,634
I wondered if you two got into
a fight without me knowing.

329
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,940
Stop talking nonsense!

330
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:13,339
What do you mean, a fight
between a parent and a child?

331
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,686
No.

332
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:20,558
It's just you act differently with her
from how you with Soo Yeon and No Eul.

333
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:26,196
Well, we did treat Bo Ra a bit
differently since she was younger.

334
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,062
Stop talking nonsense!

335
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:33,003
I'm so close with Bo Ra!
She's my eldest, after all!

336
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,677
Always... saying such useless things...

337
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,852
You'll go deaf.
Lift your head, you punk.

338
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,657
What nonsense.

339
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:47,812
Sticky rice cakes!

340
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,402
Buckwheat jelly!

341
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,496
Go on in.

342
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:00,834
Good night noona.

343
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:05,448
Sun Woo.

344
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:11,610
Want to meet me outside
somewhere, next Sunday?

345
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:16,570
How about we have a cup of that
Vienna coffee that's all the rage lately?

346
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:18,829
What's this, all of the sudden?

347
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:20,891
You're making me feel uneasy.

348
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,068
If you don't want to, that's fine.

349
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,539
You have to keep your promise, OK?

350
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:56,963
Darn... who's calling at this hour?

351
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:02,775
Hello?

352
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:05,634
What? You crazy jerk.

353
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:07,016
OK.

354
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,975
Thats... it hurts!

355
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:19,464
Quiet. Ahjussi will wake up.

356
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,268
Did you get beat up
by a thug or something?

357
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:23,864
This jerk rides motorcycle these days.

358
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,733
- What? Are you out of your mind?
- Hey... Be quiet!

359
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:31,507
I told you not to follow
Michael around, didn't I?

360
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:36,123
That guy is a pro! He's been
riding since first year of high school!

361
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:37,770
Why are you so...

362
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:42,393
Why are you rebelling now,
when you're practically all grown?

363
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:44,784
How are you going to go home?

364
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:48,558
Even Taek gets home late today,
he'll be up all night because of his match.

365
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,280
You can't sleep here.

366
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:56,986
I can... just... do this.
Just... like...

367
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:02,225
I can just do this, and go home.

368
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:05,772
Are you seriously asking that, as if
you don't know my family situation?

369
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,836
They're all asleep. I just have to make
sure I don't get caught in the morning.

370
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:13,459
Hey... isn't your mom really scary
when she gets mad?

371
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:17,747
Chief Jo is busy. I think she'll rise
all the way to CEO.

372
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:18,967
Isn't that amazing?

373
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,675
Thats... how exciting...
Thats... how... amazing.

374
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:33,343
Hey. Hey, Jung Pal!

375
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,451
Taek's going to come home anyway,
so leave the light on!

376
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:36,585
OK.

377
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:42,303
You came dressed like that?

378
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:43,857
It's right in front of my house.
Whatever.

379
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:50,014
Let's go.

380
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:14,387
Soo Yeon! Go bring this to Taek's house!

381
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:16,103
OK.

382
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:19,893
Hello! Here are some seasoned blood clams.

383
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,635
Oh, really?
Thanks.

384
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:24,510
Ahjussi, what about Taek?
He came home late yesterday, right?

385
00:30:24,743 --> 00:30:26,783
Yeah. He came home
early this morning.

386
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:28,033
Really...

387
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:40,964
Really? He's good at soccer, too?

388
00:31:41,072 --> 00:31:44,732
Yeah! There's no sport that
Taek's dad isn't good at.

389
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:47,262
It's only that he looks
like a bear, is all...

390
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,020
He's good at basketball, soccer,
baseball, wrestling... everything!

391
00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:55,511
What have I been doing?

392
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:59,300
But... why didn't he tell me that?

393
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:04,050
He probably was trying to.
But was too slow.

394
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:10,469
Sun Woo. Don't you dare make
bets with Taek's father.

395
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:13,156
He's extremely competitive.

396
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,059
Who do you think Taek took after?

397
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,422
He takes after his dad.

398
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:29,110
Mom. I think he's really a great guy.

399
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:32,555
What?

400
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:38,269
I mean, I'm just saying... I like him.

401
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,686
What does that have to do with me?

402
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:52,475
Why are you saying such a thing?

403
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:56,374
No reason, Mom.. I'll be going now.

404
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:58,387
Jin Joo, I'm leaving!

405
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,526
I'm off to school.

406
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,702
Soo Yeon, you said that it's
2:00 p.m. today, right?

407
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:29,170
Really... how long are you
going to call her that?

408
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:31,921
At this rate, we're going to forget our
daughter Deok Sun's pretty name!

409
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,146
I'm not giving up on this until the end.

410
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:37,635
Soo Yeon! I just have to go to the
college conference room?

411
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,424
Yes... Mother.

412
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:42,094
-Then, I'll be going.
-OK.

413
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:55,240
-I'm leaving, too.
-OK.

414
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:00,758
Honey, throw that shirt out after today.

415
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:04,249
The collar is all worn out.
What will others think?

416
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:06,647
Who will be looking at
an old geezer like me?

417
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:11,344
Also, I can just button it tightly, like
this, so it doesn't show. Look.

418
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:14,005
I can do this. Look.

419
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,747
I'm off!

420
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,523
Hello? Is anyone here?

421
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:35,679
I know nobody is here, but... I'm off.

422
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,493
Ssangmun Girls' High School

423
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,726
Wang Ja Hyun. You're next.

424
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,815
Your parents are here.

425
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,593
You're next, Woo Yu Hyun.

426
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:10,446
Hey, Sung Soo Yeon. It's your turn.

427
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:28,922
Yeah! Math, Social Sciences, Physics
English, Korean, Math, and then Gym!

428
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,248
Gym! Yeah!

429
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:32,980
Hey. What are you doing,
not getting changed?

430
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:39,850
Ssangmun High

431
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:42,607
Self-Study

432
00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:53,285
1989's 103 College Admissions'
Acceptance Statistics

433
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:15,137
-Teacher.
-Yes?

434
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:19,025
I'm not even hoping for her
to get into a good college.

435
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:23,820
I just want her to get into a four
year college. Anywhere is fine.

436
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:28,226
I feel that way, and so
does Soo Yeon's father.

437
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,943
We don't really have
the bar set too high.

438
00:37:33,607 --> 00:37:35,757
With Soo Yeon's current grades...

439
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,447
Admission to a four year college
will be difficult as well.

440
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,116
Well...

441
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,844
With her current grades,
a four year is out of her reach...

442
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:52,006
...and colleges in Seoul are
pretty much out of the question.

443
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,286
I see...

444
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:04,494
Soo Yeon's mother. But she
still has one year left.

445
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,934
If she starts studying hard now,
she still has some hope.

446
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:11,371
It all depends on how hard
she works from here on in.

447
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:15,104
There are still 400 students
who rank below Soo Yeon.

448
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:18,844
I'll work harder as well, ma'am.

449
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:49,037
Go back to the classroom.
I'll be going now.

450
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,276
Hurry up and go back to your classroom,
and study.

451
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,785
Mom! I'm sorry!

452
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:19,717
Deok Sun.

453
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:23,211
I'm fine.

454
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,884
Hurry and go back to your classroom.

455
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:35,119
Mom... have you given up on me?

456
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,114
Have you given up on me?

457
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:41,357
Why am I Deok Sun?
I'm Soo Yeon, Mom!

458
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:47,917
Mom... I'm sorry,
Mom! I'm sorry, Mom...

459
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,141
It's OK. It's OK.

460
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,414
It's OK, Deok Sun. It's OK.

461
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:15,945
Korean Baduk Club

462
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:38,003
It's almost 11:00 p.m.
Hurry up and go home.

463
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,089
OK... yes.

464
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,775
-Master Choi...
-Yes?

465
00:40:49,924 --> 00:40:53,027
I'd usually refrain from asking
anything of you, but...

466
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:56,793
but... there's a guy, Producer
Choi Dae Oh from UBS.

467
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:59,027
He's helped the Baduk
Club out quite a bit.

468
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,436
Master Choi. Can you do an interview?
Just 30 minutes!

469
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,638
There won't be cameras.
It'll just be an interview.

470
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:10,736
He won't ask you about anything else
besides Baduk, either.

471
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,687
I'm begging you. Please?

472
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:19,246
A person who is best in
the field should.

473
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:15,630
Sorry I'm a bit late today.

474
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:25,061
Did something happen?

475
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:32,774
-I got my bag mugged on the way here!
-What?

476
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:37,201
You know the road by the hill past the
three way street near the barber shop?

477
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,766
I was trying to go up the
road on that hillside...

478
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,961
...and a motorcycle sped down the hill!

479
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:46,234
The person on that motorcycle
snatched my purse away!

480
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:52,247
Really... I thought that my arm
was going to get ripped off!

481
00:42:53,992 --> 00:42:56,482
Are you hurt anywhere?
Is your arm OK?

482
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:01,177
Yeah, I'm OK.
I'm just a bit shaken up. I'm not hurt.

483
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:08,033
Really... I always take that road!
And now I'm too scared to take it!

484
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,530
How come...

485
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:14,003
What about Jin Joo?
She's sleeping, right?

486
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:17,531
-I'll go get her.
-No, it's OK. I'll go get her.

487
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:20,827
No, it's fine. I'll go get her.

488
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:35,604
I keep thinking that I'm going to
drop something and lose it...

489
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,800
Hey, Noonim.
How are you Noonim.

490
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,204
Yes, yes.

491
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:46,457
Excuse me, but what are you
doing out so late at night all alone?

492
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:48,080
Mind your own.

493
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:52,622
I'll take that to heart, Noonim!
Have a safe trip!

494
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:55,466
You two go on ahead.
I'm going to Dooly Supermarket.

495
00:44:01,036 --> 00:44:02,212
But Dooly's closed.

496
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:18,453
You're coming home now?

497
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:22,050
Did you cause trouble again?

498
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:25,419
-Mind your own.
-You little...

499
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:39,743
Jung Pal. I'm going to go see Michael.

500
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,214
If the dean or Chief Jo look
for me, tell them I'm at Taek's.

501
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:46,011
I told you to stop riding
those motorcycles already.

502
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,666
You're not even good at it.

503
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,453
Do you even know the rush that comes
with riding in the wind on a motorcycle?

504
00:44:51,896 --> 00:44:54,107
What are you talking about?
Wipe your nose first.

505
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:47,809
Deok Sun.

506
00:46:02,308 --> 00:46:05,667
What are you doing here?
Is something the matter?

507
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:10,840
No... you're just getting home?

508
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,106
Does your head hurt again?

509
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,829
Did you lose today?

510
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:24,809
So why do you have no energy?

511
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,300
She's heading out so early
even on a Saturday.

512
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,892
Ahjussi. My mom wanted you to have this.

513
00:47:31,086 --> 00:47:32,086
OK.

514
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:34,198
What about Taek?
He's not asleep, right?

515
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,470
Yeah, he's awake.

516
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:44,454
It's next week, right?
The final round of Ing Cup?

517
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:45,891
Yeah.

518
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:48,007
So, is it all over after
you win this one?

519
00:47:50,547 --> 00:47:55,292
So... will you be confessing
to Deok Sun, then?

520
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:58,844
You totally read my mind.

521
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:00,671
This is nothing.

522
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:03,443
You have time tomorrow, right?

523
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,628
Let's hang out with everyone
before you go to China.

524
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:07,996
I've seen too little of you lately.

525
00:48:08,314 --> 00:48:09,394
How about we play Blue Marble?

526
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:11,074
OK.

527
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:12,383
But... Sun Woo.

528
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:14,646
-What?
-Aren't you going to school?

529
00:48:14,963 --> 00:48:16,228
That's right!

530
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,833
Bye!

531
00:48:20,152 --> 00:48:21,734
Prime English-Korean Dictionary

532
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,048
What's this, all of the sudden?

533
00:48:27,455 --> 00:48:29,537
-You're really giving this to me?
-You don't want it?

534
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,245
No, no, I do. Thanks, noona.

535
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:38,618
Here. Allowance.

536
00:48:39,171 --> 00:48:41,691
What's this? Thank you.

537
00:48:43,576 --> 00:48:46,735
She got paid from her part time job.

538
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:48,254
It's her first and last paycheck.

539
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,019
How come? You're not working anymore?

540
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,451
You don't need to know.

541
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,526
This is for you, Mom.

542
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,846
Relly... There's something for me, too?

543
00:49:04,387 --> 00:49:05,407
It was cheap.

544
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:09,893
We're late. Noona, we're late!

545
00:49:11,956 --> 00:49:12,972
We're off to school!

546
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:15,445
-I'm off!
-OK.

547
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:24,335
I'm running late, so I'll be going, too.
Bo Ra, Dad's leaving. Dad. Dad.

548
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,792
-Have a good day!
-OK!

549
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:31,209
It's Saturday, though. He can leave
late today. I wonder if something's up.

550
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:35,110
-Mom.
-Yeah? What is it?

551
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:42,209
I'm off to school.

552
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,982
Really... my second son...
you've worked hard...

553
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:47,146
Not at all.

554
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:57,772
You're not getting up?...

555
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,006
Please, go outside and
exercise or something!

556
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:07,032
If you like the sofa so much,
take the sofa as your wife instead!

557
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:12,819
OK. Exercise... exercise.

558
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:29,558
Shall I give a call to Bo Ra's mom?

559
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,761
I hear "Byun Gang-Soe 3" is out.

560
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,600
Mother, I'm using the phone right now!

561
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:35,828
OK...

562
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,384
Ok: 986-874

563
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:58,875
To: Ok

564
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,297
I guess spring is already here,

565
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:07,241
as heat shimmer forms...

566
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:10,854
and the frogs croak
together in harmony.

567
00:51:11,022 --> 00:51:15,813
Miss Mi Ok. If you have time, I'd like to
have a cup of Vienna coffee with you...

568
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:21,611
...at Banjul's first floor cafe in
Jongro this Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

569
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:24,970
Miss Mi Ok, do you know this?

570
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:28,835
Vienna is the capital city of Austria,
but the capital city of my heart is you.

571
00:51:31,727 --> 00:51:32,827
Hello?

572
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,136
Hello?... Who is this?...

573
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:50,251
If you've called, you should
say something. Hello?

574
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:53,579
Which jerk is prank calling
first thing in the morning?

575
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:21,436
-How old are you?
-It wasn't me.

576
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,311
You really think I'd do such a thing?

577
00:52:25,304 --> 00:52:26,404
So childish...

578
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:34,909
Grow up!
Grow up, Salamander!

579
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:38,628
Come here!

580
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:42,912
Yeah! It's here.

581
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:47,289
Deok Sun! Deok Sun! Soo Yeon!

582
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,926
What's the matter? Why are you running?
Have you gone mad?

583
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:54,542
Can you give this to your friend?

584
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,457
OK! I will. Don't worry.

585
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:59,548
Mister, just a moment.

586
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:02,307
Can you wait for just 10 seconds?

587
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:05,647
I'll give it to her for sure.
Don't worry. Hurry and go.

588
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:07,139
Thank you!

589
00:53:07,591 --> 00:53:08,820
Yes, thank you.

590
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:26,071
Soo Yeon... I mean, Deok Sun.

591
00:53:26,322 --> 00:53:27,622
I can call you Deok Sun now, right?

592
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:36,308
Do your legs hurt? Sit here.

593
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:38,088
I'm fine. You sit.

594
00:53:38,471 --> 00:53:39,487
OK. Thanks.

595
00:53:43,743 --> 00:53:45,684
-Have a seat here, sir.
-No, it's fine.

596
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:47,670
-I insist, sir.
-OK, then.

597
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:53,383
Student, give me your bag.

598
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,275
Thank you.

599
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:57,950
You too, Student.

600
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,104
Really, thank you.

601
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,739
Why are we going to school so
early when it's Saturday?

602
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:13,379
Ensure we're high school seniors!
Ensure us! Ensure us!

603
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,492
Are we studying machines? Machines?

604
00:54:17,217 --> 00:54:18,811
Why not saying that after
you've studied?

605
00:54:18,947 --> 00:54:21,483
-This punk has no conscience!
-You inhumane punk!

606
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:25,238
It's nice that if so empty here.
It's better than being crammed in.

607
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,926
Hold onto something, will you?

608
00:54:34,996 --> 00:54:36,496
Yeah... OK.

609
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:12,425
Master Choi. They're here.

610
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:15,522
They're getting ready in the special
match room so stay here, OK?

611
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:17,437
I'll call you when they're ready.

612
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:24,737
Just thirty minutes.
I promise.

613
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:42,438
Hey, Jin Joo, you're here?

614
00:55:43,354 --> 00:55:47,617
I borrowed
"Young Goo and Ddengchil 2."

615
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,704
You'll be late. Go on ahead.

616
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
OK.

617
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:58,169
Isn't it better to take weekends off?

618
00:55:58,464 --> 00:56:01,283
I get paid double on weekends though!

619
00:56:01,635 --> 00:56:05,914
Also, Sun Woo is a senior now,
so he comes home late on Saturdays, too.

620
00:56:06,144 --> 00:56:09,844
Also, word has been getting around
that I'm a good worker...

621
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:12,184
...and I've gotten so many
job offers lately!

622
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:16,195
Working is good,
but take care of your body, too.

623
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:21,823
Then I'll be going, Oppa.

624
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:24,100
Thank you as always.

625
00:56:24,802 --> 00:56:26,024
Stop it.

626
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:40,707
Hello.

627
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:42,770
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

628
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:44,375
Exercising.

629
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:48,316
We're now at an age where we
should be exercising, after all.

630
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:00,473
Taek's father, you need to work out a bit!
Your belly is so squishy.

631
00:57:00,935 --> 00:57:03,571
Buy yourself one of these.
Do you know how to use it?

632
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:05,525
I've never tried it.

633
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:12,517
Even though it looks easy,
it's actually quite difficult.

634
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:18,944
Would you like to give it a try?

635
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:20,657
Sure.

636
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,176
Does this...

637
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:37,155
really help you get any exercise?

638
00:58:00,888 --> 00:58:03,428
Manager Lee. What happened?

639
00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:05,865
I thought they weren't taking any photos!

640
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:11,386
Ghosh... what's up with this sunbae?
Seriously...

641
00:58:11,452 --> 00:58:15,813
I heard that you're very close to your
father and that he cooks himself.

642
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:18,672
What's the dish that he's the
best at making?

643
00:58:19,752 --> 00:58:20,752
What's?

644
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:42,135
What are you doing in the middle of
the night? Hurry up and come inside!

645
00:58:44,038 --> 00:58:46,480
You're going to get hurt!
Do it when it's bright out tomorrow!

646
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,362
My back!... My back!...

647
00:58:56,464 --> 00:59:00,668
Honey! Honey!

648
00:59:19,497 --> 00:59:20,722
Give me some lead.

649
00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:23,211
How many times I tell you that
I don't have.

650
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:25,745
Sun Woo. Lead.

651
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:32,545
You know we meeting at Taek's
room tomorrow, right?

652
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,230
Why?

653
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,002
We have to have one last hurrah
before he goes to China.

654
00:59:37,684 --> 00:59:39,433
Let's play Blue Marble together.

655
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,499
Thats... Taek is so lucky.
He's surrounded by people who love him.

656
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:55,038
Jung Pal.

657
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,389
I'm sure that I can't
go to college anyway...

658
00:59:57,551 --> 00:59:59,836
...so should I ask Taek to get
me a good job somewhere?

659
01:00:00,507 --> 01:00:01,967
There's that company that
sponsors him, too.

660
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:05,064
I'm sure I'll get hired easily
if he puts in a good word for me.

661
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:07,478
He hates asking favors
more than anything.

662
01:00:07,948 --> 01:00:09,829
He's the kind who wouldn't go even
if the president summoned him.

663
01:00:11,247 --> 01:00:12,984
Stop bothering him and study.

664
01:00:15,624 --> 01:00:19,127
How is it that there's nothing that
you guys don't know about Choi Taek?

665
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:22,137
You guys don't know what I hate, right?

666
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:23,624
Right?

667
01:00:46,658 --> 01:00:49,355
Never give up!

668
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:00,087
So... so that's one way?

669
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:01,868
Over here.

670
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:08,653
-Hey...
-Yeah?

671
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:15,644
Why is x this?

672
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,615
It's because you use
the quadratic formula.

673
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:27,539
"x equals -b plus and minus
radical b squared minus 4ac over 2a."

674
01:01:29,564 --> 01:01:31,367
Hey... this is a 1st year problem.

675
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,498
It's quadratic equation.

676
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:36,650
OK. I'm asking because
I don't know, obviously.

677
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:37,792
Don't get mad at me.

678
01:01:41,173 --> 01:01:46,133
Here. A is 1, b is 8, and c is 12, so...

679
01:01:46,182 --> 01:01:47,662
Why is a 1?

680
01:01:49,598 --> 01:01:52,112
When there is no coefficient,
you can assume that it's 1.

681
01:01:52,724 --> 01:01:54,432
So a is 1.

682
01:01:54,702 --> 01:01:57,164
-That's how it is.
-How come?

683
01:02:00,404 --> 01:02:01,408
Hey.

684
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:03,965
Why is your name Sung Deok Sun?

685
01:02:06,963 --> 01:02:08,669
I thought you said you
were giving up on math.

686
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,710
Just give up.

687
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,284
Even so, I want to try my
best as much as I can.

688
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:15,413
I'm sorry, but can you explain
it to me one more time?

689
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:16,424
I'm really sorry.

690
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,888
-Memorize this.
-OK.

691
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:26,196
"ax squared plus bx plus c = 0!"

692
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:27,395
And here...

693
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:36,543
"x equals -b plus and minus radical
b squared minus 4ac over 2a."

694
01:02:37,703 --> 01:02:39,346
-Memorize it.
-OK.

695
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:41,624
I'm leaving now!

696
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:59,042
Korea University Hospital

697
01:04:09,768 --> 01:04:11,814
-Please... excuse me!
-Yes?

698
01:04:12,244 --> 01:04:14,353
Please take care of this man.
He's in too much pain.

699
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:15,844
Mr. Kim Sung Kyun, correct?
Yes, I'm sorry.

700
01:04:15,855 --> 01:04:19,154
Just a moment. There was multi car hits
in front of Gwangsan Supermarket...

701
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:22,266
...and we keep getting emergency
patients, so... I'm sorry! Just a moment!

702
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:32,116
Mi Ran... I seriously feel like
I'm going to die...

703
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:34,484
Don't move.

704
01:04:38,697 --> 01:04:40,124
-Don't move.
-Painful!

705
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:41,551
-Is he OK?
-You're here.

706
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,991
Is he badly hurt?

707
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:44,821
I think he broke his back.

708
01:04:45,304 --> 01:04:48,109
-Really?
-He got an x-ray and a CT scan...

709
01:04:48,482 --> 01:04:50,484
...but there's too much
going on here right now.

710
01:04:50,495 --> 01:04:53,565
They said that there was an accident
in front of Gwangsan Supermarket...

711
01:04:53,576 --> 01:04:56,323
...or something like that... should we
transfer him to another hospital?

712
01:04:56,347 --> 01:04:57,833
What do we do?
Seriously...

713
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,576
Why did a car accident have
to happen amid all this?

714
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:06,582
Taek's father. I'm sure
it's a mess over there.

715
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,274
Honey, I'm home.

716
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,497
Did he get a CT scan?

717
01:05:10,935 --> 01:05:13,707
Yes, he got an x-ray and a CT scan...

718
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:15,767
...but all the doctors here
are so busy right now.

719
01:05:16,243 --> 01:05:18,006
He has to get surgery soon...

720
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:19,619
Is that Korea University Hospital, right?

721
01:05:19,714 --> 01:05:21,692
We'll head over there now, too.
Just wait a bit.

722
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:25,291
No, it's OK. Even if you were to,
it's so busy here...

723
01:05:25,537 --> 01:05:26,897
...there's nowhere for you
to even stand.

724
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:30,845
I think it'd be best if you came
just as he's coming out of surgery.

725
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,698
I'll monitor the situation
and give you another call.

726
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:37,053
OK... OK. I understand.
I'll be waiting for your call, then.

727
01:05:37,064 --> 01:05:39,599
Please give us a call as soon as
he's going into surgery!

728
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:41,848
OK! OK!

729
01:05:42,628 --> 01:05:44,526
Did someone get hurt?

730
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,699
Yeah. Jung Bong's dad hurt his back.

731
01:05:46,904 --> 01:05:50,640
Then... what are you doing?
Get dressed! We have to go!

732
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:52,550
No, that's OK.
He said it's too busy over there...

733
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:54,490
...so that we should come later.
He said he'd call again.

734
01:05:56,294 --> 01:05:58,794
How... of all things to happen...

735
01:05:58,805 --> 01:06:01,575
...how is it that it's never
quiet in this neighborhood?

736
01:06:01,873 --> 01:06:03,816
So, how exactly did he get hurt, anyway?

737
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:06,884
He fell down some stairs
while he was exercising.

738
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:08,607
How... I can't believe it.

739
01:06:08,854 --> 01:06:13,147
He never works out and
his first work out...

740
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:17,877
...he gets hurt!
Hey, can you wash this?

741
01:06:18,304 --> 01:06:19,484
Sure.

742
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:23,385
Honey, you're hungry, right?
I boiled some sweet potatoes.

743
01:06:23,724 --> 01:06:24,902
Want me to bring some?

744
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:29,670
Hey, why are you throwing away
a perfectly good shirt?

745
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,949
Thats... throw it out, already!
You've worn it long enough!

746
01:06:33,499 --> 01:06:35,961
Here. Here's a new one for you.

747
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:53,504
Manager Lee. You know that
it's almost 11:00 p.m., right?

748
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,800
Just how many hours did
that last, exactly?

749
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,534
Those jerks...

750
01:06:58,545 --> 01:07:03,610
All right, good work today.
There's a delicious place nearby...

751
01:07:03,724 --> 01:07:05,023
I'll buy today.

752
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:09,104
It's over between me and Choi Taek...

753
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:29,749
Excuse me... excuse me.
What about the doctors?

754
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:32,444
-Please take care of this person quickly!
-I'm sorry.

755
01:07:32,577 --> 01:07:35,445
All of the doctors are operating on
the patients in critical condition.

756
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:39,251
-Please wait just a bit longer.
-This person here in critical too!

757
01:07:39,697 --> 01:07:44,843
My god!
What can I do!...

758
01:07:46,012 --> 01:07:47,664
His injury is nothing compared
to that person's...

759
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:49,539
Who's Mr. Kim Sung Kyun?

760
01:07:49,957 --> 01:07:51,501
What brings you here at
this hour, Professor?

761
01:07:52,282 --> 01:07:53,749
Who's Mr. Kim Sung Kyun?

762
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,510
That's... me...

763
01:07:56,809 --> 01:07:59,360
Over here! We're Kim Sung Kyun!

764
01:08:04,634 --> 01:08:06,278
Give me Mr. Kim Sung Kyun's chart.

765
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:10,435
Deputy Chief! What brings you here?

766
01:08:10,705 --> 01:08:12,945
I'm going to perform surgery now,
so please make the preparations.

767
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,741
-No, Professor. We'll...
-What do you mean, no?

768
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:18,479
He's saying that he'll do it.

769
01:08:19,254 --> 01:08:21,724
All right. Don't worry about this patient
and focus on your own work.

770
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,551
You have many patients
to handle too, right?

771
01:08:23,965 --> 01:08:25,991
-All right... hurry, quickly!
-Yes, sir.

772
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:31,536
Don't worry too much.
We'll be operating on him soon.

773
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,770
Based on his chart,
he does have a fracture...

774
01:08:34,992 --> 01:08:37,330
But since it's a compression
fracture and not a burst fracture...

775
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:39,742
...the surgery won't take too long.

776
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:42,675
-Thank you.
-OK, then.

777
01:08:43,446 --> 01:08:45,019
Really, thank you so much!

778
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:53,098
Hey... who is that man,
who appeared out of nowhere like a comet?

779
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,665
Thats... he's the Deputy
Chief at this hospital.

780
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:58,940
His position is too high coming down
to help out at the ER, though.

781
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,210
So, why were you in such a rush
to leave this morning?

782
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,771
Bo Ra hid that under the
table to give to you.

783
01:09:41,638 --> 01:09:44,050
-Mom.
-Yes, what is it?

784
01:09:47,562 --> 01:09:48,887
This is Dad's.

785
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,750
-What is it?
-A present for him. You give it to him.

786
01:09:53,267 --> 01:09:55,682
Why? You give it to him yourself.

787
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,859
What does it matter who gives it to him?
Just give it to him, Mom.

788
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:05,184
Thinking about it, you two
really have similar personalities.

789
01:10:06,654 --> 01:10:08,289
Maybe that's why you two
aren't that close...

790
01:10:08,606 --> 01:10:12,039
Stop it with that nonsense, already!

791
01:10:12,405 --> 01:10:15,232
I am close with Bo Ra! Stop it!

792
01:10:18,099 --> 01:10:19,588
I'm home.

793
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,469
Why were you out so late on a Saturday?

794
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,194
Aren't you done with your part time job?

795
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:26,530
Yeah. A sunbae bought dinner.

796
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:27,899
I'm going to bed.

797
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:29,799
Bo Ra.

798
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,889
About this... thanks.

799
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:38,711
I'll enjoy wearing it.

800
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:40,799
Really... OK.

801
01:10:52,467 --> 01:10:53,689
Is Dad OK?

802
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:57,899
Yeah, he's OK.
He's having surgery right now.

803
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,592
They said he'll be fine. Don't worry.

804
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:05,987
Have a seat.

805
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:10,079
-Mr. Kim Sung Kyun's guardian?
-Yes, that's me.

806
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:13,108
Yes. We just need a few more
personal details about him.

807
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:14,153
Over here, please.

808
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,600
-Here?
-Yes.

809
01:11:17,747 --> 01:11:21,503
But... how did we get the Deputy Chief
himself to perform surgery on him?

810
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:24,808
Thats... apparently, the Director of the
hospital himself called him.

811
01:11:24,968 --> 01:11:27,184
He asked him to do it, as a favor.

812
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:31,084
The Director of our hospital is a huge
fan of Baduk and of Player Choi Taek.

813
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,778
And Player Choi Taek himself
called the Director.

814
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:37,646
He said that Mr. Kim was a relative,
and asked him to take good care of him.

815
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:43,891
Really... really thanks so much.

816
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:49,286
Is he badly injured?

817
01:11:49,509 --> 01:11:52,107
Yeah. I think he fractured his back.

818
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:54,625
Really...

819
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:57,087
I'll make a call right away.

820
01:11:57,573 --> 01:11:59,392
Please get his home phone number for me.

821
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:02,819
Yes.

822
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:05,541
OK.

823
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,956
Here... by the way...

824
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:16,030
In baduk, it's called
"Gisa," not "Player."

825
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,276
"Gisa" is the correct term to use.

826
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,313
OK... I see. I don't know much
about Baduk, you see.

827
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:23,689
Then... I'll take my leave.

828
01:12:29,203 --> 01:12:30,395
Taek's dad.

829
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,576
When did you call Taek?

830
01:12:35,694 --> 01:12:36,837
I'm sure he's busy...

831
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:38,508
A while ago, just for a little bit.

832
01:12:40,182 --> 01:12:41,391
Really...

833
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,227
Thank you.

834
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:03,206
Hey... Master Choi.

835
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,621
-Thats...
-OK, yeah.

836
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:13,130
Here you go.

837
01:13:16,428 --> 01:13:17,683
What is it?

838
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:23,195
Everyone worked so hard today, so please
buy everyone a round of drinks.

839
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:24,699
What?

840
01:13:25,049 --> 01:13:26,629
I'm still a minor, so...

841
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,116
...so please, buy some drinks
for the press team in my stead.

842
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,015
Then, I'll be heading home now.

843
01:13:59,905 --> 01:14:01,474
Why did he have to hurt
his back, of all places?

844
01:14:05,339 --> 01:14:06,339
Jung Hwan.

845
01:14:07,097 --> 01:14:08,977
Hurry and go home.
Go home and study.

846
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:12,688
-There's no place for you to sleep here.
-It's fine.

847
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:16,126
No, it's not. It's not like
it was a huge surgery.

848
01:14:16,395 --> 01:14:18,084
No need for the whole
family to sleep here.

849
01:14:18,599 --> 01:14:20,836
The back surgery is an
inconvenience to your dad, at best.

850
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:22,917
His mental state will be fine,
and he'll able to eat soon, too.

851
01:14:23,068 --> 01:14:24,959
So hurry and go home. OK?

852
01:14:25,765 --> 01:14:27,159
That's what'll make me feel better, too.

853
01:14:29,222 --> 01:14:30,262
Hurry up!

854
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:32,843
OK.

855
01:14:49,954 --> 01:14:51,134
Jung Pal.

856
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:54,759
What are you doing here?

857
01:14:55,734 --> 01:14:56,754
You're just getting home?

858
01:14:57,599 --> 01:14:58,788
Yeah.

859
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:01,449
Is your dad OK?

860
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:04,139
Yeah. The surgery ended well.

861
01:15:04,557 --> 01:15:06,043
That's a relief.

862
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:11,579
You didn't get any sleep?

863
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:14,877
No... but I can get some sleep tonight.

864
01:15:15,837 --> 01:15:16,837
OK.

865
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:25,022
Taek.

866
01:15:26,365 --> 01:15:27,365
Yeah?

867
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:33,413
Thanks. For today.

868
01:15:35,557 --> 01:15:36,917
No need for that.

869
01:15:40,325 --> 01:15:42,337
Hey. Your shoelace is untied.

870
01:15:53,035 --> 01:15:54,173
Thanks.

871
01:15:56,175 --> 01:15:57,423
No need for that.

872
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:30,337
My god... this is great!
Deok Sun, you don't need a tutor.

873
01:16:30,405 --> 01:16:33,284
You can just get tutored
by watching KBS3 station!

874
01:16:33,295 --> 01:16:34,647
That's great!

875
01:16:35,785 --> 01:16:36,967
OK...

876
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:41,896
...here's some seasoned
blood clams!

877
01:16:43,555 --> 01:16:47,323
Whats! Did you make extinct all the
blood clams in Beolgyo?

878
01:16:47,334 --> 01:16:49,765
Or did blood clams ever wrong you,
or something? Wow!

879
01:16:49,911 --> 01:16:52,038
They were selling them for cheap
yesterday, so I bought a lot.

880
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,948
-Why? You don't like it?
-What do you mean? I'm ecstatic!

881
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,266
I'm thinking about how much you
suffered, stacking them up like this!

882
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,500
Yeah. Deok Sun. No Eul.

883
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,911
I have some blood clams and doenjang
soup in the kitchen. Go bring some.

884
01:17:07,099 --> 01:17:09,362
The two boys won't have anything
to eat for breakfast. OK?

885
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:25,515
Hey!

886
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:28,033
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

887
01:17:28,111 --> 01:17:29,271
Vroom, vroom!

888
01:17:29,426 --> 01:17:31,815
Are you crazy? Why are you riding that?
It's dangerous!

889
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:34,968
I'm just going for an hour.
I'm riding behind Michael.

890
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:36,406
And since I'm riding behind him...

891
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,220
...people think that I'm his
girlfriend from afar.

892
01:17:39,063 --> 01:17:42,287
-Don't worry!
-Be quiet! What if your mom hears?

893
01:17:42,463 --> 01:17:44,370
-She's not here!
-What?

894
01:17:44,855 --> 01:17:46,458
Chief Jo went to her
company's athletic meet.

895
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:48,358
I had breakfast alone today!

896
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:51,964
Even so, you'll get beaten
to death if you're caught.

897
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:53,474
Your mom is totally scary.

898
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,898
I told you, Chief Jo is busy.
Hey. See you at Taek's later.

899
01:17:57,175 --> 01:17:59,877
I can win against Taek in Blue Marble
at the very least. See you later!

900
01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:05,000
Hey.

901
01:18:19,898 --> 01:18:23,847
Hey, Bo Ra. Did you decide
where you'll be studying?

902
01:18:25,008 --> 01:18:29,184
It's probably best to study
right in front of your school, right?

903
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:30,980
I haven't decided yet.

904
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:33,394
I know for sure that
I can't study at home, though.

905
01:18:35,195 --> 01:18:36,695
That, of course.

906
01:18:37,121 --> 01:18:41,451
Just find a place where
you're the most comfortable.

907
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:46,234
-I'll go and...
-I can eat it myself. You eat, Dad.

908
01:18:48,355 --> 01:18:49,355
OK...

909
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:58,273
Just let me know... OK?

910
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:05,079
Hi, Jin Joo!

911
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:07,724
Look at me.

912
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:11,452
And your hair is a mess.

913
01:19:12,337 --> 01:19:14,081
Mom, I'm hungry!

914
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:18,704
OK, you're hungry,
aren't you, my son?

915
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:22,883
What about the cucumber kimchi?
You made some yesterday.

916
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,594
Yeah. Just a minute!

917
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:38,575
Well... Mom, this is amazing!

918
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,006
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

919
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:42,042
Well, I know how to whip up some
good cucumber kimchi.

920
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:57,019
Taek's father!

921
01:19:58,853 --> 01:19:59,862
Hey!

922
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,547
Taek's dad!

923
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:09,311
Oppa!

924
01:20:14,339 --> 01:20:15,981
Yes... anything?

925
01:20:16,866 --> 01:20:18,762
-Come over.
-What?

926
01:20:19,619 --> 01:20:23,942
-Come over and have some cucumber kimchi.
-OK! I'll be right there!

927
01:20:23,995 --> 01:20:26,255
What about Taek? Bring him, too.

928
01:20:26,603 --> 01:20:28,503
He's asleep. I'll come
over right now though.

929
01:20:33,657 --> 01:20:36,325
Blue Marble Game

930
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:41,597
Don't you memorize those.
Just play casually.

931
01:20:42,435 --> 01:20:43,435
OK.

932
01:20:47,195 --> 01:20:49,572
-But... Sun Woo.
-What is it?

933
01:20:51,786 --> 01:20:55,355
Do you think Deok Sun will
believe me if I confess to her?

934
01:20:56,547 --> 01:20:57,849
What do I do if she doesn't believe me?

935
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:00,773
How could she look into your eyes
and not believe you?

936
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:03,775
What?

937
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:06,398
You're only ever looking at her,
even when we're all together.

938
01:21:09,358 --> 01:21:11,538
Also, the way you look
at her is different...

939
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:13,455
...compared to how you look at us.

940
01:21:14,015 --> 01:21:15,335
Isn't that obvious?

941
01:21:16,275 --> 01:21:18,013
How can it be the same as
the way I look at you guys?

942
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:23,255
It's because Deok Sun is a bit dense...

943
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:24,615
But after hearing your confession...

944
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:26,508
And now that I see how you act,
I can tell right away!

945
01:21:28,735 --> 01:21:30,550
They say that one needs to
look at someone's eyes...

946
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:31,904
...to know whether
they like someone.

947
01:21:32,324 --> 01:21:33,888
They say that one's eyes can't lie.

948
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:37,235
And you, in particular,
are so easy to read.

949
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:39,348
How do you play Baduk with
such easy to read eyes?

950
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,711
Your opponents can
probably see everything!

951
01:21:48,302 --> 01:21:50,325
Yes?
This is Master Choi's home.

952
01:21:52,055 --> 01:21:53,137
This is Sun Woo.

953
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,375
What?

954
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:57,779
Really?

955
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,149
Yeah, he's at the police station now.

956
01:21:59,298 --> 01:22:02,363
He was riding the motorcycle with
Michael without a helmet and he fell.

957
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:06,024
I don't think he's too badly hurt,
but... this jerk...

958
01:22:06,164 --> 01:22:07,677
Hey, I'm heading there now.

959
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:10,354
He's... that crazy jerk.

960
01:22:35,297 --> 01:22:37,336
Hey, Salamander. Are you OK?

961
01:22:38,143 --> 01:22:39,383
Hey, you're not hurt?

962
01:22:40,385 --> 01:22:42,919
Kim Joon Ki.
Are you OK?

963
01:22:45,278 --> 01:22:47,638
We're fine for now, but I think
we'll become not so OK.

964
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:49,513
What do you mean?

965
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:54,722
This guy... called Section Chief Jo in
her company and she'll be here soon.

966
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:57,672
You know that she's really scary
when she gets mad, right?

967
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:00,391
She still doesn't talk to
So Ryong hyung.

968
01:23:01,693 --> 01:23:04,086
Darn... I wish the dean
was coming instead...

969
01:23:05,038 --> 01:23:06,413
Excuse me...

970
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,833
This rascal...

971
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,371
You're Ryu Dong Ryong's
parent, correct?

972
01:23:12,475 --> 01:23:15,248
Yes, I'm his dad.
Thank you for your hard work.

973
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:17,504
Joon Ki, are you OK?

974
01:23:17,995 --> 01:23:18,995
Yes.

975
01:23:20,892 --> 01:23:22,876
They're still minors so they'll
get off with a warning...

976
01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:24,693
...but it could have ended
up being a huge accident!

977
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:27,913
He didn't even have a helmet on,
and riding right next to a car...

978
01:23:28,064 --> 01:23:29,844
...so they panicked, and they
slipped at a corner...

979
01:23:29,889 --> 01:23:32,425
Yes... I'll be sure to
monitor him from now on.

980
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:33,830
I'm very sorry.

981
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:36,675
-Do I just need to sign here?
-Yes.

982
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,050
I'm sorry.

983
01:24:08,707 --> 01:24:09,707
You're not hurt anywhere?

984
01:24:21,036 --> 01:24:22,036
No...

985
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:27,618
If you're not hurt, that's good enough.

986
01:24:31,122 --> 01:24:32,189
It's OK...

987
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:34,882
It's OK...

988
01:24:36,214 --> 01:24:37,754
If you're not hurt,
that's good enough.

989
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:14,415
-Eat up.
-Yes.

990
01:25:17,366 --> 01:25:18,989
No more riding motorcycles, got it?

991
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,073
You know that I'll only let you off
the hook once, but not twice, right?

992
01:25:24,814 --> 01:25:25,814
Yes.

993
01:25:30,614 --> 01:25:31,778
I'm going to work.

994
01:25:33,506 --> 01:25:34,720
Hey, Salamawakr.

995
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:37,291
Get your act straight.

996
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,296
-Yes!
-You're laughing?

997
01:25:44,522 --> 01:25:46,848
Isn't it time for you to go to your
English cram school, honey?

998
01:25:47,153 --> 01:25:48,372
I'm off!

999
01:25:51,075 --> 01:25:52,075
Eat, OK?

1000
01:25:52,968 --> 01:25:55,068
I don't want to eat by myself...

1001
01:26:09,477 --> 01:26:10,677
Hurry up and eat.

1002
01:26:12,186 --> 01:26:13,978
I'll go after I've seen that
you've finished eating.

1003
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:26,173
Mom... we don't have to call Deok Sun
Soo Yeon anymore.

1004
01:26:26,953 --> 01:26:28,931
So I'm going to call her
Deok Soo from now on.

1005
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:30,306
Deok Soo Yeon!

1006
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,832
And Jung Bong hyung is
seeing someone.

1007
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,510
But Mrs. Cheetah can't
find out about it.

1008
01:26:36,717 --> 01:26:37,876
Rules are rules!

1009
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:42,287
And one time at school, Dad came in
through the front of the classroom...

1010
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:45,440
...and told us to be quiet, and then came
through the back door and did it again!

1011
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:53,139
I didn't know that my youngest
was such a chatterbox.

1012
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:59,091
Also, I think that Bo Ra
noona will die as a spinster.

1013
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:04,842
And last time, my friends greeted
No Eul hyung, thinking that he was older.

1014
01:27:07,483 --> 01:27:10,771
Mom... the seaweed soup
is so delicious.

1015
01:27:11,343 --> 01:27:12,343
Eat up.

1016
01:27:17,968 --> 01:27:19,698
-Hey!
-Hey!

1017
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,932
-You little...
-Hey!

1018
01:27:24,663 --> 01:27:27,085
Hey, I'm going to tell on you to my mom!

1019
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:30,466
My mom is the Queen of Insurance at
Daehan Life for seven years!

1020
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:35,740
Please. Go ahead! Go ahead!...

1021
01:27:36,073 --> 01:27:37,675
-Get over here.
-Thats.

1022
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:40,826
I thought you said you hated
your mom? What the heck!

1023
01:27:41,293 --> 01:27:42,685
When did I ever say that I hated her?

1024
01:27:43,897 --> 01:27:45,293
I said that she was busy!

1025
01:27:46,355 --> 01:27:47,515
So you made up with your mom, eh?

1026
01:27:47,675 --> 01:27:49,343
What the heck! What the heck!
Kim Jung heck!

1027
01:27:49,354 --> 01:27:50,811
I've never, like, fought with her, OK?

1028
01:27:50,914 --> 01:27:52,295
I like my mom!

1029
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,045
What the heck!

1030
01:27:56,774 --> 01:28:00,099
You guys... my mom works.

1031
01:28:00,456 --> 01:28:02,791
I guess you could say that she's on
a different level than your moms.

1032
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,454
Well... what would you kids
know about anything?

1033
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,652
What would you know?
Deok Sun, what do you know?

1034
01:28:08,715 --> 01:28:10,862
-What?
-I don't know!

1035
01:28:10,873 --> 01:28:13,749
-He needs a beating!
-Come over here!

1036
01:28:14,106 --> 01:28:16,170
-Hey...
-Hey!

1037
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:19,037
Man, even this...

1038
01:28:32,427 --> 01:28:35,724
Hey, did you teach him? I told you
to give him the watered down version!

1039
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,616
Darn it.

1040
01:28:37,815 --> 01:28:39,816
He read the instructions himself, OK?

1041
01:28:40,102 --> 01:28:41,754
We can't win against him.
He's a crazy jerk.

1042
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,086
Hey, how come the "Space
Adventure" card is missing?

1043
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:51,495
What?

1044
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,346
There's one right here.

1045
01:28:55,771 --> 01:28:56,979
I thought there supposed to be two.

1046
01:28:57,314 --> 01:28:59,711
We've gone through the whole deck
once, but there's only one.

1047
01:29:01,015 --> 01:29:03,827
You're right.
Where did the other one go?

1048
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:40,062
Here's the Vienna Coffee
that you ordered.

1049
01:30:47,495 --> 01:30:50,084
-Enjoy.
-Yes. Thank you.

1050
01:30:51,187 --> 01:30:52,187
Go ahead.

1051
01:31:10,155 --> 01:31:12,695
-Thats...
-No.

1052
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:15,086
It's dirty.

1053
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,254
All right, here we go.

1054
01:31:48,155 --> 01:31:50,047
Why is it that I'm always
the one making ramen?

1055
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:52,009
I'll make it next time.

1056
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:53,463
-No thanks!
-No thanks!

1057
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,789
Hey, Salamawakr.
It's Nami noonim.

1058
01:32:05,889 --> 01:32:09,018
Deok Sun, where are you?
Don't you hear the music, Deok Sun?

1059
01:32:09,963 --> 01:32:11,394
Shouldn't you try and dance along?

1060
01:32:12,184 --> 01:32:14,024
Quit it. Do it yourself.

1061
01:32:15,207 --> 01:32:17,352
Hey. I was at the police station today.

1062
01:32:17,519 --> 01:32:20,125
Can't you dance along for your friend
who had to go through that?

1063
01:33:38,182 --> 01:33:39,547
I'm worn out...

1064
01:33:55,512 --> 01:33:57,981
How are you so good?

1065
01:34:16,898 --> 01:34:17,931
Aren't you tired?

1066
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,007
Why did you come so early noona?

1067
01:34:29,221 --> 01:34:31,509
I just got here, too.
What do you want to drink?

1068
01:34:34,862 --> 01:34:36,467
So, this is Vienna Coffee?

1069
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:38,675
All they did was put
whipped cream on top.

1070
01:34:43,015 --> 01:34:44,375
Thats... so good.

1071
01:34:48,027 --> 01:34:49,114
Noona.

1072
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:50,784
You have something to tell me, right?

1073
01:34:51,244 --> 01:34:53,975
Hurry up and spit it out.
I'm dying of curiosity.

1074
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:59,990
Here, a gift for you.

1075
01:35:01,009 --> 01:35:02,134
Why a gift?

1076
01:35:02,223 --> 01:35:03,852
I got my paycheck from
my part time job.

1077
01:35:04,193 --> 01:35:06,243
I haven't been working that long
so I didn't get paid much.

1078
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:08,961
I'll buy you something better
when I earn more money.

1079
01:35:09,023 --> 01:35:10,183
OK.

1080
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:16,596
Well... I'll wear this next time
when I come out to see you!

1081
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:21,275
Noona.

1082
01:35:22,096 --> 01:35:23,865
Isn't your part time job difficult?

1083
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:27,099
I quit that job.

1084
01:35:27,608 --> 01:35:29,029
What? When?

1085
01:35:29,299 --> 01:35:32,016
Last week.
I'm not working there anymore.

1086
01:35:37,904 --> 01:35:42,275
But... why does that
make me feel so good?

1087
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:46,255
Does that mean we can see
each other more often now?

1088
01:35:50,835 --> 01:35:51,835
Sun Woo.

1089
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:57,726
I'm... going to study
to take the bar exam.

1090
01:36:02,975 --> 01:36:04,718
I've already decided to
begin preparing for it.

1091
01:36:22,435 --> 01:36:23,693
That doesn't mean that...

1092
01:36:25,598 --> 01:36:27,425
...we're breaking up, right?

1093
01:36:32,248 --> 01:36:33,750
Why would you say that?

1094
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,140
Why did I do that?

1095
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,994
Yes, like that, and twist!

1096
01:37:05,943 --> 01:37:08,159
Thats... don't say that
about things you don't know.

1097
01:37:08,444 --> 01:37:10,106
Why are you acting like such amateurs?

1098
01:37:10,296 --> 01:37:11,701
I have one wish.

1099
01:37:12,255 --> 01:37:13,584
It's my wish!

1100
01:37:13,879 --> 01:37:14,959
I'm going to beat your mom.

1101
01:37:15,476 --> 01:37:17,040
My mom's Ra Mi Ran!

1102
01:37:17,183 --> 01:37:20,346
What's with you?
I'm Ssangmundong's Park Nam Jung.

1103
01:37:20,846 --> 01:37:23,785
Bonghwangdang. Listen to me.

1104
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,296
Do you understand?

1105
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:26,883
Sun Young.

1106
01:37:27,155 --> 01:37:28,726
Yes? What is it?

1107
01:37:29,555 --> 01:37:31,285
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1108
01:37:31,978 --> 01:37:36,474
I wish I had a good friend by
my side, like you do.

1109
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,550
He said that he's going to see
the movie and confess, finally.

1110
01:37:41,917 --> 01:37:46,214
Great. I guess Choi Taek, 6 dan,
is finally making his winning move!

1111
01:37:47,175 --> 01:37:48,645
Keep your schedule free
on Saturday.

1112
01:37:49,639 --> 01:37:51,212
I'll call you after my match.

1113
01:37:54,135 --> 01:37:55,208
Competitiveness.

1114
01:37:56,918 --> 01:37:58,418
It's incredible, really.

1115
01:37:58,961 --> 01:38:01,199
There are two fiercely competitive
people in our neighborhood.
