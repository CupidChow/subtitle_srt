1
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,482
The year is 1988.

2
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:40,957
It was a time when it was chilly,
but our hearts were fiery

3
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,462
and we didn't have much,
but people's hearts were warm.

4
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,232
Of course, if you were to compare it
to how things are now

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,730
it was clearly the "Age of Analog."

6
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:59,230
Even so, we were living cutting edge
18 year-old lives.

7
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:07,150
We wore slip-on sneakers,
and of course, we wore lots of denim.

8
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,986
We listened to new songs
on our Walkmans.

9
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,630
Guys were crazy about
Jaime Sommers and Joey Wong

10
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,800
and Sophie Marceau and Teacher Jimena.

11
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,870
And us girls were crazy
about Pierce Brosnan

12
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:30,841
and Tom Cruise and Richard Gere
and the New Kids on the Block.

13
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,679
However, putting gender aside

14
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:40,517
there was a movie that the youth
of our generation all loved.

15
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:42,919
And that was...

16
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,624
A BETTER TOMORROW 2

17
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,534
My daughter is so pretty.
She has my eyes.

18
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,569
I'll know for sure when I see her.

19
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:16,586
September 1988,
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmun-dong

20
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,137
Sorry.

21
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,472
This kid's name is Yoo Dong Young.

22
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,977
Even though he seems nerdy,
he's this block's "Counselor."

23
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:18,048
Darn it, you crazy jerk.
Why couldn't you stuff your face later?

24
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,483
This is Kim Jung Hwan,
whose house is behind ours.

25
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,885
I call him "Dog."

26
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,730
He's not exactly a human yet.

27
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:33,563
Taek, the one who owns this room,
is a genius at playing Baduk.

28
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:35,732
What is he going to do with that

29
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,601
when he's an idiot
when it comes to anything else?

30
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:39,970
Go get me a rag.

31
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,610
I also saw some alcohol in the kitchen.
Get me that. And some milk, too!

32
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,844
Get it yourself, jerk!

33
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,613
It's the first time
he's been home for a while.

34
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,015
This is Sun Woo.

35
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,119
He's the most normal
of the kids on this block.

36
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,457
I couldn't hear what they said!

37
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,626
Why are you annoying me?

38
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,127
I don't know! It's all your fault.

39
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,965
This is... me.

40
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,403
I had such wavy bangs that you
could probably surf through them

41
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,206
with cropped-short hair.

42
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,543
And a shirt that isn't quite pink,
but eye-popping fuschia.

43
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,115
That was the best back then.

44
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,916
What the hell is that guy's name?

45
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,219
We didn't hear, either!

46
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,687
It's Song Woo Yeon.

47
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,356
-How do you know that?
-I read the subtitles.

48
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:43,867
Kim Jung Hwan! Dinnertime!

49
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:49,506
Kim Jung Hwan! Eat!

50
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,315
Kim Jung Hwan!

51
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,084
I told you to come eat!

52
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,894
Sun Woo! Dinnertime!

53
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:18,568
Duk Seon! Come eat!

54
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:25,275
-I'm off.
-I'm off, too.

55
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,077
Bye.

56
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,230
I should go.

57
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,321
Son. Let's eat dinner.

58
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,950
WE ARE CLOSED. WE OPEN AT SEVEN.

59
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,495
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong,
our block.

60
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:22,432
I was born and raised on this block.

61
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,337
There was no internet
or any smartphones back then.

62
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:34,244
Thinking about it now,
how did we spend all that time?

63
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:53,630
EPISODE 1: HAND IN HAND

64
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:57,033
Duk Seon. Set the table.

65
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,914
Good, it came out well.

66
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:46,516
Looks yummy.

67
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,354
Duk Seon. This is Dad's.

68
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,599
Hey, want to die?

69
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,367
This is my older sister, Sung Bo Ra.

70
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,669
She's a sophomore at Seoul University
studying Math Education.

71
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:08,972
She has the most influence
in our household

72
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,730
and the craziest wretch on our block.

73
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,443
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

74
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:14,344
Hey!

75
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:17,547
Sorry.

76
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,415
My younger brother, Sung No Eul.

77
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:23,386
Despite how old he looks,
he's actually 17 years old.

78
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,025
Hey, where are you going?
We're about to eat.

79
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,960
To meet Dad on his way home.

80
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,817
Yes?

81
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,288
I thought you said you were eating
before coming home!

82
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:01,257
OK. Hurry home.

83
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,095
Your dad said he'll be home soon.
Wait just a bit longer.

84
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,705
Darn it...

85
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,645
Yes, this is the gas place, right?

86
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,548
Yes, we're at Bongawakl Street.
The house with the blue gate.

87
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:27,884
Yes, yes. The house
that has a dog.

88
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,587
The usual...
the 10 kilogram one... Yes.

89
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:31,621
OK.

90
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:35,825
Jung Hwan!

91
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,927
Go downstairs and ask for a bowl of rice.

92
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,063
And give them this.

93
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:43,433
OK.

94
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,580
Hey!

95
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,650
You're here, Jung Hwan?

96
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,051
My mom asked me to bring you this.

97
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,954
Wow! No need for that...

98
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,730
Also, she wants to know
if we can have a bowl of rice.

99
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,025
Sure.

100
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,663
I heard your father was coming home late,
but I guess he's coming home early today.

101
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,799
Here. There we go.

102
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,230
Oh yeah. Wait here.

103
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:21,037
I'll give you some radish kimchi.
Give it to your mother.

104
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,543
-She gave you this.
-Wow, looks great!

105
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,345
Wait.

106
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,054
Ma'am!

107
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,789
My mom wants you to have some curry.

108
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,467
My mom wants you to have this.

109
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,550
Ma'am! Have some of this!

110
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,723
Thank you!

111
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,361
Ma'am!

112
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,152
Let's eat.

113
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,030
Gas delivery!

114
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,631
If they're going to be like this,
why not just eat together?

115
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,076
-Duk Seon!
-Dad!

116
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,244
Hello.

117
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,678
-Where are you off to?
-Home.

118
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,480
-All right. Go on.
-Goodbye.

119
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,516
My daughter!

120
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,353
What are you doing?

121
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,288
What's that?
Is that pork?

122
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,222
Did you buy a lot?

123
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,960
I bought a whole lot so our family
could gorge ourselves to death!

124
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,429
Today's payday, after all!

125
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:03,966
Geez... let's go.

126
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,501
Everyone must be hungry.

127
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,104
Did someone come?

128
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,238
Gas delivery.

129
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,540
-Oh.
-Yeah.

130
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:45,107
Oh, dear. How is ice cream 200 won?

131
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:48,511
But then again, the World Cup
ice cream is 300 won.

132
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,814
With 300 won, you could buy
a pack of cigarettes.

133
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,416
Cigarettes are 600 won nowadays.

134
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:54,584
Prices went up for a while now.

135
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,892
You little jerk... why, I ought to...
you smoke, jerk?

136
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,730
Bo Ra made me buy them for her!

137
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,507
What the hell did you say?
What the hell are you saying?

138
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,577
If you smoke, you should own up to it,
not throw me under the bus!

139
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,478
I ought to kill you!

140
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,714
You look like an idiot!

141
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,782
You insolent punk!
You smoke?

142
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,150
OK, I smoke.

143
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,620
It's me, all right?

144
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:31,854
I smoke!

145
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,657
Yes, yes, I smoke!

146
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,793
Anyway, just wait until tonight.
I'm going to beat you good.

147
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,096
What are you doing? If you're done
washing the lettuce, come here already.

148
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,799
Here you go.

149
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:48,571
Let's eat! We only have this much left
after giving it out to the neighbors.

150
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,906
If you need more, just tell me.

151
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,275
So how much was there
at the beginning?

152
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:58,614
Hey. We're not goats, you know.
What's up with this pile of grass?

153
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:01,651
I was wondering where
my paycheck had gone

154
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,730
and obviously, you spent it all
on vegetables.

155
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:06,589
Oh, please. With you talking like that,
people would think we were broke.

156
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:10,726
What would they think if they knew?
Who would know how I feel?

157
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,230
Give it here.

158
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,199
Hey. Let's eat first.

159
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,169
Look... the vegetables are growing
bigger and bigger waiting for us.

160
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,671
Come on... give it here.

161
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:24,640
Where is it? Here it is!

162
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,610
Wow, look how thick it is!

163
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,082
I wonder how much came in
this month?

164
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,995
Three... seven... nine... two.

165
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,467
Hey.

166
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:56,539
Put a Pepero in your mouth
and head for the hills...

167
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:57,473
Pepero...

168
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:58,507
Hey!

169
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,730
Why do you have so little?
You're short 120,000 won!

170
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:13,589
OK, OK, OK.
I... bought a couple of books.

171
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,230
You know Suk Jin, Young Chul's son.

172
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:24,834
But that jerk co-signed on something
and lost everything!

173
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:29,730
But the bank came to find him,
demanding their money

174
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,607
and he was selling bundles of books, so...

175
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:35,044
I couldn't exactly ignore him,
could I?

176
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,512
Is he the only one who went under?

177
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,114
We did too, you know.

178
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,690
We went under because of your debts

179
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:42,218
so you're not exactly in the situation
to be helping other people out, are you?

180
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:47,189
Geez, you... even so,
we have enough to get by.

181
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,191
We're barely managing to scrape by!

182
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,561
I couldn't even pay No Eul
and Duk Seon's other school fees yet.

183
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,230
And what about Bo Ra's tuition?

184
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,932
You're making me out to be the bad guy.

185
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,230
I can't even buy people a cup of coffee
because I'm scrimping and saving

186
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,172
and here you are,
the neighborhood do-gooder.

187
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,407
And I'm the bad guy.

188
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,275
Geez, you.

189
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:10,312
It's fine! What do we have
to worry about?

190
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,181
We have money and we have debt!

191
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,230
Are you seriously saying that?

192
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,354
I mean... I'm fine, and you're healthy.

193
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:21,090
And all three of our kids
are healthy, too.

194
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,230
And... they're good at studying, too.

195
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:27,163
Duk Seon got 999th place
in the whole school this time around.

196
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:29,565
And No Eul got 1000th place!

197
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,634
I gave birth to a bunch of idiots.

198
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,730
Total dunces!

199
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:38,607
But... but we have Bo Ra, our eldest!
She's plenty smart!

200
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,730
She's a student at Seoul University,
the best college in the country!

201
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,481
So what are you worried about?
I'm not even worried this much.

202
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,083
Get me new glasses.

203
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,586
I said, get me new glasses.

204
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,889
Hey, it hasn't even been a year
since we got you new ones.

205
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,357
My eyesight got worse.

206
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,659
I can't study if I can't see anything.

207
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,695
Since it's my birthday next week,
get them for me as my birthday gift.

208
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,564
I'm celebrating
birthday separately this year.

209
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,933
I'm not celebrating with her this year.
No way. OK?

210
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,401
I ought to take this
lettuce and smack you...

211
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,930
Your birthdays are
only three days apart!

212
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,405
Why do we need to celebrate twice?

213
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,974
Also, it'll be hard on your mom,
so... no!

214
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,609
You're going to buy them for me, right?
Right?

215
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,477
Mom.

216
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,279
Those glasses are good ones.
They were expensive.

217
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,830
I told you, I can't see anything!

218
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:20,683
I can't see anything
on the blackboard!

219
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:23,319
I was clear!
I'm not celebrating with her this year!

220
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,830
Hey! Your older
sister is talking.

221
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,960
-My ass.
-"My ass?"

222
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,095
Get over here.

223
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,097
-Mom! Look at what she's doing!
-"She?"

224
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,199
-Are you crazy?
-Mom!

225
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,330
-Say that again. What?
-Ow!

226
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,605
Stop it, already! You're going
to pull all her hair out!

227
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,830
Hey!

228
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:48,330
Can't we live quietly
for just one darn day?

229
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,847
It's my only wish!

230
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,583
God darn it!

231
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,452
Mother!

232
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:08,931
Your father's here.

233
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:12,330
Welcome home, Dad.

234
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,951
Excuse, excuse me.

235
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,788
Please, please, excuse me.

236
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:40,029
Looking, looking really, really
close is this the medium's place?

237
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:43,532
Let's eat.

238
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,135
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

239
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:57,546
You have to go like,
"Yes, yes, it is."

240
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,181
I'm going to clear
your part of the table.

241
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:00,516
Honey!

242
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,852
Treat me well while I'm here!
I'm the village scapegoat.

243
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,493
You made salad today?

244
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:14,964
Oh!

245
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,469
I found one person here
named "Scapegoat."

246
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,638
Wow... how interesting.

247
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,374
KIM JO BONG

248
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,420
24 YEARS OLD, ATTEMPTING TO GET
INTO COLLEGE FOR THE SIXTH TIME.

249
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,330
IS INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING
EXCEPT STUDYING.

250
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:35,517
But... how did Duk Seok
get chosen as a picket girl?

251
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:37,186
Do you take an exam for that?

252
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:39,455
She can't even study,
so how did she get the position?

253
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:41,830
She just got it somehow.

254
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,330
Oh!

255
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,231
Sun Woo's mother made this, right?

256
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:52,830
It's so hard to make curry taste bad.

257
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,236
How did you know?

258
00:20:54,837 --> 00:21:00,330
It's... obvious. Wait, I'll stop.
Honey.

259
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,881
Am I not funny?

260
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,502
Son!

261
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,037
-It's good, right?
-Yeah.

262
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,040
Mom...

263
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,330
What is it?
Is it a rock?

264
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:36,330
-Dad really didn't like these...
-I know.

265
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:40,516
Hey. It looks like Duk Seon is
having a really hard time lately.

266
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,330
She got so tan,
and she doesn't look so good.

267
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,555
But even so, it's great
that she's enduring, isn't it?

268
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,190
Of course she has to work hard.

269
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,592
There are only three high schoolers
among the picket girls.

270
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:55,330
She almost burned to death
in Hyochang Stadium all summer.

271
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:59,768
But... which country
is she representing, again?

272
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:00,969
I heard, but I forgot.

273
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,472
Even if I tell you,
I'm sure you'll forget again.

274
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,941
It's a country I'd never heard of, too.

275
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:11,330
You're all done, Jin Joo? Wow.

276
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,280
You're not going to get out?

277
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,330
-Leave! Get the hell out!
-Ow!

278
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:51,120
Are you that proud to be a part
of the government's plan?

279
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,624
Are you that proud to be participating
in the government's brainwashing?

280
00:22:56,225 --> 00:23:00,662
Do you know how many issues
the Olympics is causing our country?

281
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,330
What are you talking about?

282
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:05,330
Get out! Get out! Get the hell out!

283
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,341
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS
EIGHT DAYS BEFORE D-DAY

284
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,830
I'm off. Mom, I'm off!

285
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,130
Your lunch!

286
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:35,898
Oh.

287
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,469
Can I have 1000 won?
I need it for school.

288
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,830
What's it for, exactly?

289
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,272
Our homeroom teacher
is getting married.

290
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:45,240
We decided to gather funds
and buy her something.

291
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,477
Really? So I guess she finally got
together with that history teacher?

292
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,546
-Yeah.
-Didn't they break up?

293
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,548
I heard she was making
a huge fuss about it before.

294
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:56,118
-Yeah, but she got pregnant.
-Really?

295
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:03,525
Oh my god, how embarrassing!

296
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,830
Oh my god, your poor teacher!
So embarrassing!

297
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,430
The same thing happened
to you too, though.

298
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,299
How much do you need?

299
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:11,330
1000 won.

300
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:16,420
Mom, can I have some money for school?

301
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,673
How much?

302
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:19,808
30,000 won.

303
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,830
Mom, I want a fried egg.

304
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:27,082
Mom, me too.

305
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:35,991
I'm OK. I don't need one.

306
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,495
Here you go.

307
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,804
My Duk Seok likes black beans, right?

308
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,330
She loves them, just like me.

309
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,830
Eat up, my daughter.

310
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,546
I wish our students didn't have
to wear school uniforms.

311
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,448
It'd be so cost-efficient.

312
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:01,283
Her school is going to have them,
starting next year.

313
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,485
She doesn't even go to school often,
so what does she need a uniform for?

314
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,753
I do go to school!

315
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:09,330
Hey. Are you only going to half
of your classes again today?

316
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:10,926
Because of the Olympic thing or whatever?

317
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,327
Yeah. I'm leaving after 2nd period.

318
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,830
Will you be able to go to college
at this rate?

319
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,699
Of course she won't be able to.
How can 999th place go to college?

320
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,501
-Hey!
-"Hey?"

321
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:23,038
Hey, hey, hey. Just eat already.

322
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,408
Duk Seon, you'll only have to suffer
for another week now.

323
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:30,979
Wow... my daughter's face is
going to be on international TV!

324
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,181
-Awesome!
-It's because I'm pretty.

325
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:35,684
You must be out of your mind.

326
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:39,688
Speaking of which, our daughter
is so pretty. What a miracle.

327
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:43,592
Do you remember
when she was born?

328
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:48,830
We totally cried because she
looked like half-chewed food!

329
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:52,668
I was bewildered, even though
I gave birth to her.

330
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,536
I was wondering if
I could shove her back in.

331
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,730
We did shove her back in,
only to pull her out again later.

332
00:25:57,573 --> 00:25:59,841
They say that ugly babies
turn out to be pretty when they're older.

333
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:02,611
It doesn't matter if you were pretty
when you were young.

334
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,415
Hey, Sung Duk Seon.

335
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:13,021
What's that on your lip?
That's mine.

336
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:16,158
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

337
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,927
-No, it's not.
-You're denying it?

338
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,495
It's not.

339
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,967
If you touch my makeup,
I'll kill you.

340
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:27,903
Got that?

341
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,806
I asked if you got that!

342
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,077
-Hey, Sung Duk Seon!
-Fine.

343
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:21,416
Class president.

344
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:23,785
Attention.

345
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:26,621
Bow.

346
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:28,490
Thank you.

347
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,790
-Have a good dinner.
-Yes, ma'am!

348
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,330
So crass.

349
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,541
The upperclassmen are waiting. Hurry up.

350
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,710
I'm taking some of your soup.

351
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,330
There's a person missing,
so we need an extra person.

352
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,830
If you don't come, we're dead.

353
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,183
Do you not see how the weather is
out there?

354
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,518
Soccer, in this weather?

355
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:57,953
You're going to pass out
from heat.

356
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:09,731
Romania...

357
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:12,267
Five, six, seven, eight!

358
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,536
One, two, three...
your arm is slipping!

359
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:15,470
Raise your arm!

360
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,438
Yes! Like that.

361
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,039
One, two, three, four.

362
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,875
Your arm can't fall!
Raise it!

363
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,843
Like that!
Yes! One, two, three, four!

364
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:24,112
Five, six...
this arm is falling, too!

365
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:24,980
Raise your arm!

366
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,048
Rwanda...

367
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:30,218
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

368
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,487
Where are you going?
Walk in a straight line!

369
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,422
Yes, like that. One, two, three, four...

370
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,330
Straight!
Walk straight!

371
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,527
Five, six, seven, eight...
in a straight line!

372
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,095
Follow the line in the middle,
OK?

373
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:43,830
Madagascar...

374
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,170
One, two... your expression!

375
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,272
Your expression! Arm!

376
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:54,209
Expression! A warm smile, OK?

377
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,178
Arm, arm, arm!

378
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,245
Your expression.

379
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,079
Arm!

380
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,330
Expression!

381
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:01,330
Warm smile!

382
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,017
Arm!

383
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,151
Expression!

384
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:04,330
Arm!

385
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,253
Expression!

386
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,330
Arm!

387
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,432
-Hurry up!
-No!

388
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,738
Michael, you asshole...
you surprised me!

389
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:25,874
What do I do now?

390
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,908
What happened?

391
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,879
All the money that I collected
was stolen from me.

392
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:32,214
-What?
-What?

393
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,950
Darn it!

394
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,270
Darn it.

395
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,554
So why did you take that route,
you idiot?

396
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,489
I don't know...
I must have done it without thinking.

397
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:43,558
They sell couple tea sets
at the Dobong Store.

398
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,627
But I guess I was looking for
the entrance in the wrong spot.

399
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,262
When I turned around...

400
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,065
It was Brazil Ddukbokki's back alley!

401
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,034
You got caught.

402
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,104
You basically plotted to
flush our money down the toilet.

403
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:59,507
Did you get all of it
taken from you?

404
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,377
All of the collected funds.

405
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,746
Besides money from the five kids who
hadn't paid up. All 63,000 won.

406
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,616
What do we do?
We have to buy it by tomorrow!

407
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,551
I don't have a penny!

408
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,052
Neither do I.

409
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,363
How much money did you get
from your mom today?

410
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:23,832
Want to die?

411
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,233
Hey, Kim Jae Hwan!

412
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:27,435
Hurry up and get out here.

413
00:31:27,903 --> 00:31:28,670
OK!

414
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,142
Hey, get up.

415
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:35,610
Get up. Quick!

416
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,145
Hey.

417
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:38,770
Hey, Kim Jae Hwan!

418
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:40,015
Want to die, punk?

419
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:42,550
Yes, I'm coming!

420
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,357
Hey, let's go.

421
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,460
30,000 won?

422
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,270
He told you that it was
30,000 won?

423
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,232
-Yeah.
-It's only 1000 won!

424
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:59,270
You should have asked him about it first!

425
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:00,770
What if he's using it for bad things?

426
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,604
I'm sure he needs it for something.

427
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:05,340
Jin Joo is putting on makeup.

428
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,111
Who does she take after,
dressing herself up like this?

429
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,513
She probably takes after you.

430
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:14,816
Would she take after
Sun Woo's tacky dad?

431
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,770
Oh, but... what were
they using it for?

432
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,270
I don't know. He didn't say.

433
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:24,270
Apparently their homeroom teacher is
getting married to the history teacher!

434
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:26,770
Really? I guess she was single, then!

435
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:28,830
Apparently, it's been a year
since they started dating.

436
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,166
She was so popular in school
because she's so pretty.

437
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:34,270
They were dating in secret,
but they got caught holding hands

438
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:35,670
by that kid that they call Michael.

439
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,406
-Who's Michael?
-The secretary of their class.

440
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:41,776
He has dark skin and thick lips

441
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,870
you know, like that character
from the show, "Dooli."

442
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,914
The kids say they look like him,
so they call him that.

443
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:49,270
Geez, really... you sure know a lot.

444
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,770
Sun Woo tells me all of these things.

445
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,770
It was a secret between us.

446
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,770
You're just annoying him.

447
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:59,770
No! He comes and tells me
without me even asking.

448
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,031
He's 100 times better than Jung Hwan,
who comes home and says nothing.

449
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,333
How do you manage to get by,
being so bored?

450
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,968
He tells me everything he needs to.

451
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,770
Don't worry about my son,
and worry about your daughter instead.

452
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,770
She's going to end up
killing that horse.

453
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:18,270
You don't know how much
that horse can handle.

454
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,651
Even that horse is so full of energy...

455
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,027
Ma'am... even though he's younger than
you, you should feed him some good food.

456
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,895
That way, he'll have some energy
in the bedroom.

457
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,431
She even bought 30 eels yesterday
just for that purpose.

458
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,467
Every month, she tries eel, loaches,
and samgyetang to boost his energy.

459
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,236
She must have spent
a fortune on that food already!

460
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:42,770
Really?

461
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,640
Don't be like that, and make some
for your own husband.

462
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,109
He doesn't look like he's
doing so well lately.

463
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,712
Who would think that he's the same age
as Jung Hwan's dad?

464
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,380
He looks 10 years older!

465
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,649
I don't have that kind of money.

466
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,752
More like you don't have
a private room for couple business.

467
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,423
What good is eel?

468
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,991
It's not like it improves
his performance.

469
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:04,959
I feel bad for Bo Ra's father, too.

470
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,530
Ma'am. Today's the perfect chance.

471
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,270
Your kids won't be back home
until after 11:00 p.m., right?

472
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,867
And Bo Ra isn't home today, right?

473
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,336
Why not have some happy fun time today?

474
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,770
Geez... geez! Stop that!

475
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,770
Get over here... get over here!

476
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,270
Oh, you're home, sir?

477
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:28,650
He's coming.

478
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,770
Why are you so early today?

479
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,155
Geez, you...
obviously, it's for the happy fun times.

480
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,024
I didn't even warm up the house yet.

481
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,093
Why worry about that?
You have to warm up your bodies first.

482
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:51,005
Sir, don't worry about anything,
and do everything you want today!

483
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:55,143
We'll be guarding the front door for you!

484
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,446
You two can keep carrying on
even if someone barges in!

485
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,616
Have a Olympic mindset to the task. Go!

486
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,270
Jesus...

487
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:07,270
I feel like those women just expend all
their sexual energy through their mouths.

488
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,057
Geez, those people...

489
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,059
It's not like it's the first or
second time. Come on.

490
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:15,463
I can't even leave work without
a heavy heart because I'm scared of them!

491
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,999
One of these days,
I'm going to kill them both...

492
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,503
speaking of which, go wash up.

493
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,506
Jung Hwan's dad is a bit late today.

494
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,575
He always comes home at 7:00 p.m.
on the dot, doesn't he?

495
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:31,270
I'm sure he's holding someone hostage
to his terrible jokes again somewhere.

496
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,270
Oh, here he comes.
You're a bit late today.

497
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:06,514
Yes. I went to see Taek's dad
on the way here.

498
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,485
Aren't you cold?
Why are your shoulders bare?

499
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:11,619
Oh, dear.

500
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:14,189
Are you afraid that someone
will steal your wife away?

501
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,058
Don't worry.

502
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,770
Nobody else but you
would consider her pretty.

503
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:21,596
Geez.

504
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,565
It's fine if she's only pretty
in my eyes.

505
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,100
Honey.

506
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,237
Stop it! Geez.

507
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:36,878
Stop it. Stop it.

508
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:46,487
Stop it. Stop it.

509
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:49,770
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS
SEVEN DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

510
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,359
Have a good weekend.

511
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,461
Don't slip off somewhere
because it's Saturday

512
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:55,463
and go straight home to show your parents
your report cards.

513
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,770
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

514
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,534
Class rep!

515
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:01,836
Attention.

516
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:05,974
Bow.

517
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:09,270
Teacher, congratulations
on your marriage!

518
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,270
I'm a bit short. You have money, right?

519
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,976
One, two, three, four, five...
I have exactly 500 won.

520
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,677
Let's go.

521
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,045
Where are you going?

522
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,648
Dobong Shopping Complex to buy something.

523
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:48,316
Let's go together.

524
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:50,770
It's OK. You guys go.

525
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:52,754
I promised to play with Jin Joo.

526
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:56,770
He never hangs out with us.

527
00:37:59,627 --> 00:38:00,595
Hey, I have to go to the bathroom.

528
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,696
Go ahead, then.

529
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,097
Let's go together.

530
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,732
Come to the third floor.
I'll be there.

531
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,270
Darn it.

532
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,317
DOBONG SHOPPING COMPLEX

533
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,811
There's two of them and two of us.

534
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:51,770
It's worth a shot.

535
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:55,983
If he takes care of one of them,
I can take care of the other one.

536
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,386
And we can definitely win.

537
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:00,621
Which one should I hit first?

538
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,770
The one on the right? Or on the left?

539
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:04,592
I've given them too much time.

540
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,770
Now... I have to hit them now.

541
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:18,272
Jung Hwan.

542
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,208
They want you to come, too.

543
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:35,270
I want to cry, too.

544
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,390
I want to cry.

545
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:40,361
What's troubling you?

546
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:44,399
Your husband earns a lot of money
and your sons stay out of trouble.

547
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:47,502
Out of all of us,
I'm the most jealous of you.

548
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,606
What's the use of feeding him eel?

549
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,141
It all just turns to shit.

550
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:59,046
He's just pooping out
more expensive poops.

551
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,084
Why? You two didn't go to town yesterday?

552
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:06,421
Town, my ass.

553
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,922
We didn't even get to first base.

554
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:11,359
If he had a conscience, wouldn't he
have gotten past first base, at least?

555
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:12,927
He doesn't even have a consience.

556
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:20,902
When we're apart, you'll see.

557
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:27,475
Perhaps, you'll see.

558
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:35,770
When we're apart, you'll see.

559
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:41,270
Perhaps, perhaps, you'll see.

560
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:43,157
Hello.

561
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,028
He has no conscience.

562
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,770
It's because we wanted to eat
at Brazil Ddukbokki, but have no money.

563
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:08,182
If I become a notable figure,
I'll pay you back for sure.

564
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,319
Is this everything?

565
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,190
If I search you,
it'll be 10 hits per 10 won.

566
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,627
Go.

567
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:27,869
Hey, wait.

568
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,074
What size are your feet?

569
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:34,642
260.

570
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,356
Hey, Cavallo.

571
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:51,592
You can keep yours.

572
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,276
Oh... you're going to meet your dad
on his way home?

573
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,910
Yeah.

574
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:11,546
What's with your son?

575
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,414
Hello!

576
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,249
-Oh, hello!
-Oh, hi!

577
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,485
Hey, Jin Joo!
You ate it all?

578
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:19,770
Are we having bean sprout soup today?

579
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,588
Yeah.

580
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:22,423
What about Jung Hwan?
He didn't come with you?

581
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,892
Oh, he went somewhere with Dong Ryong.
He'll be home soon.

582
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:26,794
Today's the day
you get your report cards, right?

583
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:28,129
You guys had an exam?

584
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,097
Yes. Last week.

585
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,734
You didn't know, did you?

586
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:35,736
Yes, he told me.

587
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:38,306
You said your grades
went down a bit, right?

588
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,075
-Is it because of math?
-Yeah, a bit.

589
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:42,977
So you didn't get first place
this time?

590
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:44,245
Who did, then?

591
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:47,381
-This time, it was...
-Hey, what's this?

592
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:51,619
-Did you get into a fight with someone?
-No. I wouldn't do that.

593
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,220
Who did that to you?

594
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,458
I told you, that's not it. I
just got scratched a bit.

595
00:42:57,959 --> 00:42:59,493
I'll go home first.

596
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,632
And where did you get this?

597
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,340
It's fine!

598
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,270
It's nothing!
Stop bothering him over nothing.

599
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,612
What if he's hanging out
with bad kids?

600
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,213
Do you think he'd be
the type to do that?

601
00:43:19,614 --> 00:43:21,148
Even though I can't say the same
about my own son.

602
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:23,050
I'm sure he had a little spat
with a friend or something.

603
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:24,785
What if he got hit by some bad kids?

604
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:28,089
Geez, stop it!
It's just a band-aid on his chin.

605
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,859
If it were a big deal,
he would have come and told you about it.

606
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:33,794
Stop worrying.

607
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,764
Here's your son now.

608
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,736
-Hello.
-Hey there!

609
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:43,871
Dong Ryong, you seem so bright lately!

610
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,042
You're here, son?

611
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,050
Daughters are better.

612
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,986
Even if she ends up in 999th place,
daughters are better.

613
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:03,491
Why isn't Duk Seon coming?

614
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:06,160
Do they keep her late
even on Saturdays?

615
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,430
But even so, she usually comes home
early on Saturdays.

616
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:13,434
My husband's not coming,
my son who went to get him isn't coming.

617
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,703
And my daughters aren't coming.
Where did they all go?

618
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,770
Hey. Hurry up and eat. Your
mom's probably waiting.

619
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,315
Why are you eating so slowly?

620
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,455
Is it that good?

621
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:35,022
Yeah.

622
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:43,631
Oh.

623
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,599
So this is why you
always came to meet him.

624
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,436
You were eating World Cup
ice cream every day?

625
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:49,670
I want one, too!

626
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,770
Your sister and your mom
have to have some too.

627
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:01,949
How could just the three of us eat it?

628
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,585
I'm so hungry. Let's go home already.

629
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,520
The ladies are in front of the house.

630
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:09,356
Just have that ice cream
for dinner then.

631
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,863
Sit down and eat.

632
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,478
I told you, go see the doctor!
It won't cost you that much.

633
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:34,181
I do have money!
I'll go next week.

634
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,150
But, anyway, son...

635
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:44,125
You're really not going to tell me?
How did this happen? Tell me already!

636
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:46,770
Oh, it's really nothing, Mom.

637
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:48,770
Don't worry. I'm going
to Jung Hwan's for a bit.

638
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,408
Oh my God! Are you a ghost or something?

639
00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:02,143
What?

640
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:03,844
Is it your first time seeing someone
with a Korean traditional dress on?

641
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,046
You sure do all sorts of things.

642
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:10,351
Our outfits were switched
to these instead. It looks better, right?

643
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,287
Just don't do anything.
That would be best.

644
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:23,330
What the hell?

645
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,270
What's this?

646
00:46:27,101 --> 00:46:28,469
Did they change your outfits?

647
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:31,270
-Yeah. Isn't it pretty?
-Not at all.

648
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:37,912
Oh my God! Geez...

649
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:42,950
If you were any closer,
I would have socked you.

650
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,486
What are you doing at night?

651
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:48,722
Madagascar, my ass...

652
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:29,964
Hello!

653
00:47:30,464 --> 00:47:32,099
-Hey!
-Hi.

654
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,270
Mom, do you legs hurt?

655
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,270
Yeah. They hurt so bad.

656
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:46,380
Son!

657
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:06,000
Honey!

658
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:17,444
Hello!

659
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,313
-Oh, you're home?
-Hey!

660
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:20,381
You're back, Sun Woo?

661
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:23,270
Geez... she must be so happy
her brother is here.

662
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,270
She's so lucky.

663
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,770
-I'll be heading in now.
-OK.

664
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,021
-Bye!
-Bye!

665
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,192
You're back?

666
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:03,624
Mom, I'm practicing at the
Seoul Olympic Stadium starting today.

667
00:49:03,657 --> 00:49:04,770
Totally awesome, right?

668
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,270
It's so huge here!
The tiger here is humongous, too!

669
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,167
-Ma'am.
-It's probably nothing, right?

670
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,270
I'm telling you, it's nothing!

671
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,539
He's at the age when he has
his own thoughts and keeps some secrets.

672
00:49:19,106 --> 00:49:21,342
You can't keep him innocent forever.

673
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,011
This much should be enough, right?

674
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,113
I think three families will have
more than enough.

675
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,770
Sun Woo's dad is probably
going to gorge himself with this!

676
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,052
I guess he really liked dumplings.

677
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:34,488
He likes dumplings best second.
There's something else he likes more.

678
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:35,956
Rice wine.

679
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,959
He used to have a bottle a day!

680
00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:41,628
But that wasn't too expensive,
so it was OK.

681
00:49:42,463 --> 00:49:43,530
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

682
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,770
Can I borrow 30,000 won?

683
00:49:45,933 --> 00:49:47,334
I'll pay you back next month.

684
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:48,168
Sure.

685
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:51,038
Oh my. Thinking about it,
it's Sun Woo's birthday.

686
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,506
Don't Duk Seon and Sun Woo
have the same birthday?

687
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,308
Did you guys do it
on the same day?

688
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,770
What are you saying?

689
00:49:56,977 --> 00:49:58,312
Jin Joo will hear.

690
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:00,881
What day did you do it?
For me, it was the last day of December.

691
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,483
It was while we were
picking pears in the woods.

692
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,770
Jin Joo will hear. Stop it.

693
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,021
What are you going to get Sun Woo?

694
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:09,957
Exactly... I don't know.

695
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,926
Yeah... what do you get for your sons
when they're all grown?

696
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,729
You can buy your son
another pair of sneakers.

697
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:20,100
You didn't know, did you? Right?

698
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,770
Geez. Jung Hwan got his sneakers stolen!

699
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:27,270
Oh my God. When? By whom?

700
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,576
Who do you think? Thugs, of course.

701
00:50:29,977 --> 00:50:32,513
Oh, gosh... he dodged a bullet there.

702
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,270
He wasn't hurt anywhere?

703
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:37,518
He wasn't hurt, but he got his money
and sneakers taken from him.

704
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,770
It's been a while since it happened.
I heard it from Sun Woo.

705
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:44,691
I guess Jung Hwan didn't want you
to worry, so he didn't tell you.

706
00:50:45,426 --> 00:50:47,127
If he didn't get hurt, it's fine.

707
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:49,596
Oh dear.

708
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:51,899
Speak of the devil.

709
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:55,536
Hello.

710
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,405
Yeah, Jung Hwan.
It must be tough studying hard.

711
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:00,270
Go inside and rest.

712
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,434
There's nothing to eat.

713
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,471
Your dad said he was
picking up some chicken.

714
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,339
Two of them.

715
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:34,074
Yes.

716
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:45,419
There won't be anyone named
"Chicken Shop" in there.

717
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,188
Who would have such a stupid name?

718
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:52,270
My younger brother.
That's not what I'm looking for.

719
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:57,770
"Two of them."

720
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:02,703
I'm looking for someone named that.

721
00:52:19,486 --> 00:52:21,355
-Jung Hwan.
-Yes?

722
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:30,297
What is it?

723
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:35,636
Nothing's up these days, right?

724
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,612
Dad's here.

725
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:51,919
Oh, President Ra!

726
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,657
You have to say,
"Oh, President Kim!" back.

727
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,760
Want a divorce?

728
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,770
Oh my!

729
00:53:18,812 --> 00:53:23,684
-President Sung!
-Oh, President Kim!

730
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:29,456
-How great it is to see you!
-How great it is to see you!

731
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:32,826
I've only got you, Duk Seon!

732
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,127
Is that chicken?

733
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,431
This is only for you.
Don't you share with anyone. OK?

734
00:53:38,232 --> 00:53:41,770
With four days left,
people grow more curious

735
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,037
about who will be
the final torch bearer.

736
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:47,174
The International Olympic Committee
declared

737
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,744
that they will not be
announcing it until the day of.

738
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:53,547
It's probably Huh Jae, right?

739
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:55,770
Whatever.

740
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,770
Why do we care who it is?

741
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,770
Do you not even read the newspaper?

742
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,260
Huh Jae was already chosen to be
the athletes' representative

743
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:04,270
so he can't do it.

744
00:54:04,558 --> 00:54:05,525
Oh... really?

745
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:10,931
In my opinion, there's only
one person who can do it.

746
00:54:11,098 --> 00:54:12,032
Im Choon Hae.

747
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,166
What?

748
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,034
No way.

749
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:18,338
Well, we'll just see
if I'm right or wrong.

750
00:54:20,974 --> 00:54:23,477
Don't eat the wings.
You'll fly away and commit adultery.

751
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,913
My Duk Seon. Eat up.

752
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,150
What about you, Mom?

753
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,320
I don't really like chicken.
You guys eat up.

754
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:37,591
Oh, it's the girl who's
representing the Soviet Union.

755
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:39,426
I feel pride and a great sense
of responsibility.

756
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:44,865
I would like it if this year's Olympic
games improves international relations.

757
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:47,534
How come you didn't get interviewed?

758
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,303
They aired East Germany's yesterday.

759
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:51,138
Are you crazy?
Why would she do it?

760
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:52,873
Only pretty girls do it.

761
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,909
What? Then I'm sure
our Duk Seon will do it, too.

762
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:58,145
There are only three high schoolers,
after all.

763
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,270
Why wouldn't our great Deok Sun do it?

764
00:55:02,149 --> 00:55:03,050
I'm doing it too.

765
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:06,053
I'm getting interviewed tomorrow.

766
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,521
What the hell?

767
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,022
Lying crazy wretch.

768
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:10,270
It's true!

769
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:14,594
Hey. How can you
call your younger sister that?

770
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,770
This crazy wretch is lying.

771
00:55:16,797 --> 00:55:18,770
Why, I ought to take your mouth, and...

772
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:20,667
Why do you always do that to me?

773
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,469
It's because you're the weird one.

774
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:24,604
"You?"

775
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:26,340
What the hell did you just say to me?

776
00:55:26,373 --> 00:55:27,908
Ow! Mom! Mom!

777
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:28,770
Am I your friend?

778
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:30,644
What's Mom gonna do?

779
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,770
Wow, you must really be crazy.

780
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:36,550
Stop it!

781
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:38,270
Darn it!

782
00:55:40,854 --> 00:55:44,770
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS
THREE DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

783
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:07,047
Duk Seon, they want you now.

784
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:08,782
Really?

785
00:56:22,496 --> 00:56:23,563
Don't be nervous.

786
00:56:23,697 --> 00:56:25,770
You just have to answer
our questions clearly.

787
00:56:26,032 --> 00:56:27,270
Yes, I understand.

788
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,337
We'd like to ask you to
introduce yourself first.

789
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:34,074
Hello. I'm Sung Duk Seon,
who has been chosen to be

790
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:37,270
the picket girl for Madagascar
at this year's Olympics

791
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:41,915
and I am a second year in high school
at Ssangmun Girls' High School.

792
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:45,485
Yes. I heard that you're the youngest
among all the other picket girls.

793
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:49,270
-You didn't have a hard time?
-It wasn't difficult at all.

794
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:52,659
The older picket girls took care of me
as if I were their real younger sister

795
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,929
so I've never once thought
that things were difficult.

796
00:56:56,463 --> 00:56:58,365
Even so, what would you consider to
be the most difficult thing?

797
00:56:59,132 --> 00:57:03,303
I believe that it is an honor to be
participating in a nationwide effort.

798
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:09,075
Even if I had difficult moments, I was
able to overcome it with determination.

799
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:12,345
You have a lot of pride
in your position as picket girl.

800
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,048
So you must be
that much more disappointed.

801
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:18,852
When did you find out that Madagascar
won't be participating this year?

802
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:25,770
Madagascar announced yesterday
that they wouldn't participate.

803
00:57:25,826 --> 00:57:28,770
As their country's picket girl,
you must be quite disappointed.

804
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,096
How do you feel?

805
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:37,770
I think you must still be
quite shocked to hear about that...

806
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:44,511
even so, didn't you suffer for half a
year under the sweltering heat for this?

807
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,717
Ms. Sung Duk Seon?

808
00:57:51,952 --> 00:57:52,770
Yes.

809
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,922
It's quite a shame.

810
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,958
It's a shame, but even so...

811
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:02,395
what's one last thing you'd like to say
to all the citizens of Korea?

812
00:58:11,505 --> 00:58:15,770
Even though I cannot participate
in this year's Olympics...

813
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:19,346
I will pray and cheer harder
than anyone else

814
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:23,483
that the 1988 Seoul Olympics
will be successful.

815
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:26,920
The world to Seoul,
Seoul to the world.

816
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,321
Cheers!

817
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:32,692
With three days left before the Olympics

818
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:35,770
Madagascar announced that
they would not be attending.

819
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:41,468
This appears to be a boycott due to
their relationship with North Korea.

820
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:45,505
The Chairman revealed
to reporters

821
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:50,944
that this is clearly a political move
on Madagascar's part

822
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:54,180
due to their receiving a request
from North Korea.

823
00:59:02,923 --> 00:59:06,026
Sun Woo! Buy me some oil, please!

824
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,263
Sun Woo! Oil, please!

825
00:59:12,866 --> 00:59:13,867
Sun Woo.

826
00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:19,573
He's not here.

827
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,542
He put on his jacket and went outside.

828
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,575
Oh... Duk Seon!

829
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:05,011
Why are you home so late?

830
01:01:05,278 --> 01:01:06,813
We prepared so much.

831
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,915
One, two three...

832
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:15,188
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you!

833
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:18,725
Happy birthday, dear Bo Ra...

834
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:22,170
Happy birthday to you!

835
01:01:23,163 --> 01:01:24,798
-Yay!
-Blow out the candles!

836
01:01:28,802 --> 01:01:29,769
Let's dig in!

837
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:30,570
Wait.

838
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:33,570
Wait just a moment.

839
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:37,977
We'll just take three
of these out, and...

840
01:01:40,814 --> 01:01:41,915
Just a minute.

841
01:01:48,555 --> 01:01:50,056
That one on the end.

842
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,391
-Yeah.
-There we go.

843
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:52,625
OK, OK.

844
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:56,129
OK. This time, our second daughter's
birthday party!

845
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:57,731
OK... one, two, three!

846
01:01:57,997 --> 01:01:58,965
Happy birthday...

847
01:01:59,032 --> 01:01:59,899
God darn it!

848
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:05,038
I told you, didn't I?
That I didn't want to do it with her!

849
01:02:05,772 --> 01:02:07,807
Why don't you ever listen to me?

850
01:02:08,174 --> 01:02:12,178
I told you, Mom and Dad,
that I didn't want to do it with her!

851
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,749
We'll do it separately
starting from next year.

852
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:17,851
You said that last year, too!
And the year before that!

853
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,070
Why do you always only do this to me?

854
01:02:20,353 --> 01:02:21,570
Am I a joke to you?

855
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:23,823
Am I someone who
you can just treat like garbage?

856
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,629
How come you never make me a fried egg?

857
01:02:30,697 --> 01:02:33,299
I loved fried eggs.

858
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,502
You just give me black beans
all the time.

859
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:37,403
I hate black beans!

860
01:02:38,138 --> 01:02:41,007
Also, why do you only buy No Eul 
World Cup ice cream?

861
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,711
And the chicken!

862
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:50,070
Mr. Kim gave it to me to eat and you
gave the legs to Big Sis and No Eul...

863
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,584
and just left me with the wings!

864
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,120
I know how to eat chicken legs, too!

865
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:56,856
Duk Seon.

866
01:02:57,423 --> 01:03:00,660
Why is it that I'm the only one
who's Duk Seon?

867
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,631
Why did you only give me
a terrible name?

868
01:03:05,231 --> 01:03:07,300
Big Sis is named Bo Ra
and he's No Eul

869
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,435
so why is it that my name
is the only crappy one?

870
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:11,437
Why?

871
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:19,179
What's with her?

872
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:26,070
Ethiopia and Madagascar will no longer
be attending due to political reasons.

873
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,570
However, the 1988 Seoul Olympics

874
01:03:28,588 --> 01:03:32,859
will have 162 of the 167 of the
IOC member nations in attendance.

875
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:38,398
This day wasn't that special of a day.

876
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,801
The misery of being the second daughter
was always like this, after all.

877
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,674
As middle children
all over the world know

878
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:49,242
for the eldest, it was
because they're the eldest

879
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,311
and for the youngest,
it was because they're the youngest

880
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:53,570
that I had to always
yield to them.

881
01:03:56,115 --> 01:04:02,655
Even so, I thought that my mom and dad
were aware of how much I'd sacrificed.

882
01:04:04,157 --> 01:04:05,258
But that wasn't the case.

883
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,801
In some ways,
one's own family is the most oblivious.

884
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:37,423
Mom. What are you doing in here?

885
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:44,464
Mom. Did something happen?

886
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:55,642
What's this?

887
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,520
-You smoke?
-What?

888
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,350
-You smoke, don't you?
-No. What are you saying?

889
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,088
When did you start smoking?
Tell me the truth.

890
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:12,020
No, Mom! That's not mine!

891
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,863
You... what have you been
going around doing lately?

892
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:19,332
You're causing trouble,
aren't you?

893
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:21,234
I'm telling you, it's not mine.

894
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,508
Do you... know how I raised you?

895
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,613
Do you really want to see me die?

896
01:05:34,881 --> 01:05:37,520
You hang out with bad kids
and smoke up a storm...

897
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:39,652
why are you acting this way lately?

898
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:41,287
When did I ever?

899
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,823
Why are you acting this way?
I told you, it's not mine!

900
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:50,520
Then what's this on your face?
What happened?

901
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:53,700
Did you get into a fight with someone?
Did you get hit?

902
01:05:55,935 --> 01:05:57,837
You're really not going to tell me?

903
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:02,608
You... are you acting this way
because your Dad's not around?

904
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:05,111
Do you not care about your Mom at all?

905
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:06,212
Mom!

906
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:17,390
Mom, this... it happened
while I tried to shave.

907
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:26,520
I cut myself while I was trying to shave.

908
01:06:45,718 --> 01:06:47,653
Oh... Mom.

909
01:06:48,855 --> 01:06:51,824
Why's my Mom acting this way?

910
01:06:53,493 --> 01:06:56,020
Geez... Mom.

911
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,865
Mom. Mom.

912
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,800
Mom. Mom. Mom.

913
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,870
Mom. I'm fine.

914
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,520
My friends said that they
all cut themselves the first time.

915
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:08,307
It's not because of Dad.

916
01:07:10,843 --> 01:07:13,746
Oh geez... Mom.

917
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:18,751
Mom. Why are you acting this way?

918
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,020
You're making my heart hurt.

919
01:07:21,054 --> 01:07:24,390
-My child...
-Mom, I'm sorry.

920
01:07:24,757 --> 01:07:26,259
Mom, I'm sorry.

921
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:30,020
Mom. I'm sorry I yelled, Mom.

922
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,734
Mom. Mom, I'm sorry.

923
01:08:11,104 --> 01:08:12,438
Jin Joo, be careful.

924
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:15,241
Your older brother went
all the way to the store to get this.

925
01:08:35,828 --> 01:08:38,865
Jin Joo. Let's greet Dad.

926
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:06,400
SEPTEMBER 17, 1988
THE 24TH OLYMPICS IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

927
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,094
It's a historical moment.

928
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:12,520
It is finally the beginning of the 24th
official Olympic games in Seoul.

929
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:18,137
Now it is turning into
the Seoul Olympic Games' emblem.

930
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,020
What bright, beautiful colors.

931
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:30,216
Dad. There isn't even a single
mouse on the streets right now.

932
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:31,450
Did it start?

933
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,818
Why are you drinking
in the daytime?

934
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:34,520
Geez, you...

935
01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:36,489
What better day to get drunk
than today

936
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,259
when my second eldest daughter
gets to participate in the Olympics?

937
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:41,994
What about Bo Ra?

938
01:09:42,562 --> 01:09:44,830
Bo Ra! Come out! It's starting!

939
01:09:44,997 --> 01:09:45,831
I'm not watching it!

940
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,000
You're the only one who'll regret it,
you crazy wretch!

941
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:50,169
Wow, the athletes are entering!

942
01:09:50,469 --> 01:09:51,020
Oh, yeah.

943
01:09:55,374 --> 01:09:57,710
Oh, OK.
I'll record it from now on.

944
01:09:57,877 --> 01:09:58,678
Honey.

945
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:10,156
Didn't Duk Seon get dropped?

946
01:10:10,556 --> 01:10:14,020
I heard that "Magadastar" or whatever
isn't participating.

947
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:17,520
I'm sure she went to them
and talked them out.

948
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,032
Isn't it awesome, Mom?

949
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:20,866
Really?

950
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,602
Wow. How awesome.

951
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,905
So she got to take the place
of someone who got fired?

952
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,874
Wow... Duk Seon is so lucky.

953
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,520
Her tenacity is nothing to laugh at.

954
01:10:30,743 --> 01:10:35,648
No. Duk Seon practiced hard.
That's why they took care of her.

955
01:10:35,748 --> 01:10:37,617
I heard that she was
never late even once.

956
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:38,284
Yeah.

957
01:10:38,951 --> 01:10:41,821
If she studied with that much willpower,
she'd be ranked Number One for sure.

958
01:10:42,755 --> 01:10:45,520
Hey. So... which country
is she representing now?

959
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:50,997
Son. So, which country is Duk Seon
representing now?

960
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:53,966
You'll see.

961
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,820
They're doing it in Korean alphabetical
order and her country starts with U...

962
01:11:05,278 --> 01:11:06,479
They're already up to the Soviet Union?

963
01:11:07,713 --> 01:11:09,181
She should be on soon.

964
01:11:09,415 --> 01:11:11,117
This is the Soviet Union.

965
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,087
There are 518 athletes on their team.

966
01:11:15,154 --> 01:11:16,820
Not long ago, their country was...

967
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:20,559
Bo Ra! Hurry and come out!
She's coming on soon!

968
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,320
I told you, I'm not watching!

969
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,973
Jordan.

970
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,042
The athletes from Jordan
are now entering.

971
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,412
She's next, dad.

972
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:41,620
It's after Jordan.

973
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:45,618
There she is!

974
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,557
Uganda...

975
01:11:51,924 --> 01:11:56,120
There she is...

976
01:11:56,162 --> 01:11:58,431
-Oh my God!
-There she is!

977
01:11:58,497 --> 01:12:05,037
Sung Deok Sun!
My older sister!

978
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,120
Mother!

979
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:09,620
Wow, there she is!

980
01:12:09,675 --> 01:12:12,078
Wow, she's really there!

981
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,120
She looks so pretty!

982
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:15,314
-Yeah!
-Oh my goodness!

983
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:17,120
There she is!

984
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:21,253
There you are, President Sung!
Nice to see you!

985
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,323
All together now!
Yeah!

986
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:30,096
Yeah!

987
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,935
-Uganda!
-Uganda!

988
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:37,737
Dad, what's their capital city?

989
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:41,741
What?
Their capital city is... Oh!

990
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:42,541
Where is...

991
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:45,010
Yeah! That's Duk Seon.

992
01:12:46,078 --> 01:12:48,647
No, that's nothing.

993
01:12:48,714 --> 01:12:52,651
Of course! Are you kidding me? Her face
is being shown all over the world!

994
01:12:52,718 --> 01:12:54,854
Yeah, that's right!

995
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:57,590
Geez... I was so worried that
she could never get married

996
01:12:57,656 --> 01:12:59,125
when she was young
because she was ugly.

997
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:01,827
But she's blossomed! Prettier than
her older sister, for sure.

998
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,620
Here is the torch bearer.

999
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,505
Son Ki Jung enters,
holding the torch.

1000
01:13:13,272 --> 01:13:15,541
Then, Im Choo Hae takes it from him.

1001
01:13:20,713 --> 01:13:22,715
Im Choon Hae. I knew it.

1002
01:13:27,686 --> 01:13:29,922
Where did Im Choon Hae
get a medal, again?

1003
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,461
It was in 1986 during
the 10th Asian Games.

1004
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:39,120
She won the 800 meter, 1500 meter,
and 3000 meter races.

1005
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:42,701
She was the first one who
conquered three titles in track and field

1006
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:44,620
during the Asian Games.
Also known as Ramen Girl.

1007
01:13:45,037 --> 01:13:47,473
Because they had no rice at home,
she said could only eat ramen

1008
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:48,908
and became famous overnight.

1009
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:54,120
However, it was revealed
that she ate herbal medicine as well.

1010
01:13:56,749 --> 01:13:58,120
This happened two years ago.

1011
01:14:02,888 --> 01:14:05,458
Jung Bong. Call me when
they're doing soccer.

1012
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:06,725
OK.

1013
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:27,246
What are you up to?

1014
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,448
I'm studying.

1015
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,619
-Oh.
-Why?

1016
01:14:34,987 --> 01:14:35,888
No reason.

1017
01:14:44,864 --> 01:14:46,665
-Jung Hwan.
-Yes?

1018
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,830
You don't have anything to tell me?

1019
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:52,638
No.

1020
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,081
I heard you guys took an exam.

1021
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:04,683
Oh, yes. We did.

1022
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:08,087
-Did you do well?
-Yes.

1023
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,865
Oh... I got ranked Number One.

1024
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:28,073
So why didn't you tell me?

1025
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,443
It's not like that counts that much.

1026
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,348
Your mom wants to know
everything, though.

1027
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,456
Tell me these things.

1028
01:15:48,494 --> 01:15:51,196
Do you know how jealous I am
of Sun Woo's mom?

1029
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,830
Sun Woo tells him mom everything.

1030
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,204
Even if it's not everything...

1031
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:04,843
just a few things that you think
would be OK to tell me would be nice.

1032
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:10,783
It's because I feel ashamed every time
I hang out with the ladies.

1033
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:17,700
OK?

1034
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,260
Answer me.

1035
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:23,200
Yes, Mom.

1036
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:27,967
Study hard.

1037
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,982
-Mom.
-Yeah?

1038
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:49,922
Can you get me
a new pair of sneakers?

1039
01:16:53,626 --> 01:16:54,700
I lost them.

1040
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:04,837
Son! Want to come buy
sneakers with me today?

1041
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,538
No, it's OK. Just give me the money.

1042
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,340
OK.

1043
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:14,213
Hey.

1044
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:17,583
Jung Hwan plays soccer every day,
but he's so good at soccer.

1045
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:20,085
It's because he doesn't do anything else
except playing soccer.

1046
01:17:20,152 --> 01:17:21,200
He doesn't smoke either.

1047
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,200
Of course he doesn't.
He's different that he seems.

1048
01:17:23,622 --> 01:17:26,025
I thought that those cigarettes
would be Jung Hwan's, if not yours.

1049
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:28,200
No, Mom. Jung Hwan doesn't smoke.

1050
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:29,200
Really?

1051
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:30,963
Then whose were they?

1052
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:34,333
I'm wondering the same thing.
Whose could it be?

1053
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,200
Oh, but... why did they
collect money for school?

1054
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,700
I don't know. He didn't say.

1055
01:18:08,033 --> 01:18:09,700
Who is it? There's nobody
who would be here.

1056
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,740
Who is it?

1057
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:17,200
Oh, Uncle!

1058
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:18,544
What brings you here?

1059
01:18:18,577 --> 01:18:21,447
Sun Woo... let's go to the public baths.

1060
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,948
-Quick.
-What?

1061
01:18:23,515 --> 01:18:26,051
Hey. Get every nook and cranny, OK?

1062
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:27,820
Money, Sun Young.

1063
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:30,389
I took a bath yesterday.

1064
01:18:30,422 --> 01:18:32,291
And I took a crap yesterday.

1065
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:35,094
Do you think I'll not take a crap today
just because I did yesterday, punk?

1066
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,763
Stop talking about crap all the time
and get married already.

1067
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,364
Geez.

1068
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:42,367
Take good care of him.

1069
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:44,200
Wash every nook and cranny of his.

1070
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,572
And teach him how to do this.

1071
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:47,773
OK, OK.

1072
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,477
But, Sun Young...
you packed a razor, right?

1073
01:18:54,012 --> 01:18:54,880
Go on, now.

1074
01:18:55,514 --> 01:18:57,983
Let's go take a bath with Uncle.

1075
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,952
Why are you dragging him
by his ear?

1076
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:01,520
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1077
01:19:27,613 --> 01:19:28,547
How does it look, Dad?

1078
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,418
Where did you get those?

1079
01:19:33,452 --> 01:19:35,700
I got it from a Ugandan athlete.
Doesn't it look cool?

1080
01:19:39,091 --> 01:19:44,062
This is a fan from a Korean athlete, and
a hat from a Equatoguinean athlete.

1081
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,332
And this is an umbrella
from a Danish athlete.

1082
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,500
And...

1083
01:19:51,737 --> 01:19:55,073
What... the hell is that?

1084
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:56,508
A pitiful pigeon.

1085
01:19:56,642 --> 01:19:57,776
I'm going to bury it.

1086
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,945
There's one that got scorched
by the flame, too.

1087
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,700
I picked it up.

1088
01:20:04,516 --> 01:20:08,053
OK, I get it. Put it away.

1089
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:16,700
Geez... My Duk Seon is so kind.

1090
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:18,297
You're like an angel.

1091
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:24,703
Duk Seon.

1092
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:29,474
I have something I want to give you too.

1093
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:30,809
What?

1094
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:33,200
Just wait.

1095
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:44,556
Ta-da!

1096
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:49,200
Happy birthday, my Duk Seon.

1097
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:54,366
Oh my, look at that!
18 candles already?

1098
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:56,700
When did my daughter grow up so much?

1099
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,700
Me and your mom are sorry.

1100
01:21:09,648 --> 01:21:11,083
It's because we didn't know.

1101
01:21:14,253 --> 01:21:17,189
When your sister was born,
we were worried about how to teach her.

1102
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:22,060
When you were born,
we were worried about how to raise you.

1103
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,300
And when your brother was born,
we were worried about

1104
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:27,099
how to shape him into a good person.

1105
01:21:30,535 --> 01:21:35,040
Dads don't automatically become dads
the moment you're born.

1106
01:21:36,275 --> 01:21:38,200
It was my first time being a dad.

1107
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:44,416
So... I'd like it if you could
let me off the hook, just this once.

1108
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:51,523
My daughter grew up to be so pretty.

1109
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:57,963
When did you become
such a pretty young lady?

1110
01:21:58,964 --> 01:22:00,599
You were even on TV.

1111
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:02,534
Looking so pretty, with makeup on.

1112
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:14,680
Anyway, when my Duk Seon gets married,
how will I live? I'll be so miserable.

1113
01:22:16,815 --> 01:22:18,317
I'm not getting married, though.

1114
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,585
You shouldn't say that.

1115
01:22:21,553 --> 01:22:26,725
Here. Let's light these
and sing you "Happy Birthday."

1116
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:28,200
OK? Here.

1117
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,200
Wow, how pretty.

1118
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,567
OK.

1119
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:37,269
Duk Seon.

1120
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,438
Happy birthday.

1121
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:42,374
OK, blow them out.

1122
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:48,200
Have some, Dad.

1123
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,450
No. I don't like creamy things.

1124
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,700
In some ways, one's family
is the most oblivious.

1125
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:02,527
But... what's so important
about knowing?

1126
01:23:03,962 --> 01:23:09,434
In the end, what helps you
overcome obstacles isn't brains

1127
01:23:09,868 --> 01:23:14,700
but someone who'll take your hand
and won't let you go.

1128
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:18,944
In the end, that's family.

1129
01:23:23,548 --> 01:23:31,200
Even for heroes, the people
they go back to in the end is family.

1130
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,828
The home inflicted upon you
outside the home

1131
01:23:41,033 --> 01:23:43,435
and the scars inflicted on you
by life itself...

1132
01:23:44,403 --> 01:23:46,438
Why is my name Duk Seon?

1133
01:23:46,872 --> 01:23:50,700
And even the pain inflicted on you
by family...

1134
01:23:50,909 --> 01:23:52,844
the people who will hold you
and stand by you until the end...

1135
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:56,700
in the end, it's family.

1136
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,200
ONE MONTH LATER

1137
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:10,700
And... no. Even so...
history repeats itself.

1138
01:24:29,114 --> 01:24:30,782
Ow, my head...

1139
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,755
Oh, my head.

1140
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:48,066
Is it the carbon monoxide
from the coal briquettes again?

1141
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:51,870
Hey, get up.

1142
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,200
Get up. Hey, No Eul!

1143
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:56,200
Hey!

1144
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:58,510
Wake up! Carbon monoxide!

1145
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,112
No Eul!

1146
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,880
You punk... come to your senses!

1147
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,082
Hey, hey, hey!

1148
01:25:04,116 --> 01:25:06,785
Bo Ra... hey!
Wake up!

1149
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,453
She's acting strange.

1150
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,522
Hey! Are you OK?

1151
01:25:10,722 --> 01:25:12,691
Oh, my... are you OK?

1152
01:25:12,891 --> 01:25:14,860
Bo Ra! Bo Ra, you OK?

1153
01:25:14,993 --> 01:25:16,027
Wait a minute.

1154
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:19,397
Oh man.

1155
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,096
Darn it!

1156
01:26:07,512 --> 01:26:11,200
NOVEMBER, 2015

1157
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:12,200
Oh.

1158
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:14,252
What was your question, again?

1159
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:16,200
Oh.

1160
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,700
When we first met?

1161
01:26:19,457 --> 01:26:20,592
I'm sorry.

1162
01:26:20,992 --> 01:26:24,229
When I was young, I inhaled
way too much carbon monoxide.

1163
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:29,367
It's been a couple decades
since we've met.

1164
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:31,436
We grew up on the same block, but...

1165
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,874
I never dreamed
that I'd end up marrying him.

1166
01:26:36,841 --> 01:26:39,700
I think I went crazy for a second,
or something.

1167
01:26:40,812 --> 01:26:42,147
Yeah, that's the only explanation.

1168
01:26:43,515 --> 01:26:49,054
Honestly, I inhaled the most
carbon monoxide in Ssangmundong.

1169
01:26:49,688 --> 01:26:51,200
It was constant.

1170
01:26:52,257 --> 01:26:54,359
I probably inhaled it
for 20 years straight.

1171
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:59,197
I think something happened to my head
for a bit because of that.

1172
01:27:00,599 --> 01:27:02,400
My husband got lucky.

1173
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:06,238
Where else would he have found
such a pretty wife?

1174
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:13,345
Mom! Duk Seon has someone she likes!

1175
01:27:13,411 --> 01:27:14,312
Darn it!

1176
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:20,986
This is new.
How does it look?

1177
01:27:21,052 --> 01:27:21,987
I'm late. Piss off.

1178
01:27:22,754 --> 01:27:24,055
We're going to eat ddukbokki!

1179
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,492
Don't you think Deok Sun
seems a bit cuter lately?

1180
01:27:27,592 --> 01:27:29,200
Yeah... a little.

1181
01:27:30,028 --> 01:27:30,795
Yeah.

1182
01:27:31,763 --> 01:27:33,700
My first love depends on this.

1183
01:27:37,535 --> 01:27:39,200
Take it off, jerk.
Take it off.

1184
01:27:42,274 --> 01:27:43,775
You're such a frustrating jerk.
