1
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,629
Where were you?

2
00:00:41,803 --> 00:00:43,503
Somewhere in the countryside.

3
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,390
Dressed like this?

4
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:47,800
Yeah... I feel like
I'm going to freeze to death!

5
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:52,072
Why? Is something up?
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:55,446
I was waiting for you.

7
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,046
For me?

8
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:01,343
Why?

9
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,994
Because I have something
to talk to you about.

10
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,032
Go ahead.

11
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:10,116
-I'm really going to say it.
-Yeah. Go ahead.

12
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:13,452
I like you, Bo Ra.

13
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,832
I said... I like you.

14
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:31,657
I like you too.

15
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:35,518
You know that I'm not joking.

16
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,453
I'm being serious.

17
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,063
I have a boyfriend.

18
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,305
I know.

19
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:47,229
And I've never thought of you
as a man. Not even once.

20
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,951
Yes, I know.

21
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,646
Why would you inconvenience me
by telling me something like this?

22
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:58,811
-Are you concerned because of me?
-No.

23
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,412
How you feel about me
is your own prerogative.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,167
But I've made my own feelings
clear to you.

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,564
Yes. Don't worry about them.

26
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,249
Of course I'm not going to! Why would I?

27
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,568
This little kid... messing with me!

28
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:16,852
Whatever. Stop it.

29
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,603
I'm tired. Bye.

30
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,776
I don't want to be tangled up with you
because of something like this.

31
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,903
Keep what happened tonight
between just the two of us... got that?

32
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:30,946
Let's take this to our graves.
Got that?

33
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:37,946
But... thanks.

34
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:14,535
Episode 7: To That Person

35
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:17,946
Seven Days Until Christmas Eve

36
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:29,973
OK. We'll now be starting our
first ever Secret Santa!

37
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,346
Wow!

38
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,132
What are we doing?

39
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,435
Secret Santa.

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,186
I'm going to draw names
for Secret Santa.

41
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,833
-What the hell?
-Why?

42
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:49,446
-Just pretend you didn't hear.
-Why are we doing this?

43
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,281
Oh, Bo Ra.

44
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:52,966
What's up?
Why did you call me over?

45
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,778
So you're here.
Well...

46
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:07,830
Jerks.

47
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,062
All right. Since we're all
gathered here...

48
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,884
We'll officially begin
the Secret Santa...

49
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,096
What the hell did you say?

50
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:16,650
Secret freaking Santa?

51
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:17,661
Bo Ra.

52
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,130
Couldn't you speak
just a bit more quietly?

53
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,138
My heart is...

54
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,616
So you called me here for this?
I'm darn busy, you know!

55
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:26,094
Jung Bong.
I have to go to the Baduk Club...

56
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,858
OK, Taek.
This will be over soon.

57
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,203
Just wait a bit longer.
How come? I think it'll be fun.

58
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,428
-Jung Bong! Let's do it!
-Thanks, No Eul.

59
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:38,640
OK... since everyone is busy,
I'll do this quickly!

60
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,251
I'd like everyone to take one each.

61
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,342
Yes, one each.

62
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,315
You will be the Secret Santa...

63
00:04:44,457 --> 00:04:46,961
...for whoever's name
is written on the paper.

64
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,517
You have exactly one week. So...

65
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:55,627
...by Christmas Eve, you have to be secretly
nice to the person whose name you have.

66
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:58,687
Of course, a present is essential.

67
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:02,046
Hey. Why does he wants
to do this all of the sudden?

68
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,160
He's collecting records.

69
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:11,904
As for the present, you have to figure
out what your person would really want...

70
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,984
...and then give it to them
on the last day.

71
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:18,778
For your reference, as for me...

72
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:20,229
...if you were to have me...

73
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:25,945
I really want the Fourth Official
MBC Campus Music Festival record.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,812
But I just have no means whatsoever
to procure it for myself...

75
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,344
...so, what to do...

76
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:33,402
He's collecting the Official MBC Campus
Music Festival records...

77
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,024
...and the fourth one
is the only one he's missing.

78
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,074
You guys are rich though!

79
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,832
My mom said that she'll kill him
if he buys one more.

80
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:43,945
He's not getting any allowance
until his test results come back.

81
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,903
He's totally broke.
All right, everyone. Let's focus!

82
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,558
You all know the rules, right?

83
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:53,424
In other words, it's like having
a "secret friend..."

84
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,731
...so you can't tell anyone
who your person is!

85
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:57,779
Kim Jung Bong

86
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:01,688
Jung Bong! I'll buy you that record.
I have you.

87
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:02,839
What?

88
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,149
What the hell? I have him, too.

89
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,631
So do I.

90
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:13,447
Kim Jung Bong

91
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,446
What the hell is this?

92
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,644
Oh, well... this is...

93
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:22,645
...give it back.

94
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,698
OK.

95
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:32,366
OK. That was just a test round.

96
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,122
The practice round is over.

97
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:38,246
I'm going to chop your hands off if
you keep messing around! Got it?

98
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,150
I'm leaving.

99
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,360
What is up with this childishness?

100
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,896
Even so, he took
the time to prepare this.

101
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,372
Just pick a name and then go.

102
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,557
Darn it.

103
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:52,946
Jerks.

104
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll head out then.
Sorry.

105
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:14,234
Yeah, let's let him go.
He's been here for a while already.

106
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:15,486
OK.

107
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,578
Bye, Taek.

108
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,913
Bye, Master Choi.

109
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,834
-Bye.
-Bye, Taek!

110
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,723
What if people pick each other?

111
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,360
Then you can just be good
to each other.

112
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,172
It's like fate.

113
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,539
Get married! Get married!

114
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,062
-Get married!
-Get married!

115
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,248
What if you pick yourself?

116
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,059
That's fate too, so...

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,945
- Get married!
- Get married!

118

[Dong Ryong]

119
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,375
No way would that happen, though.

120
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:45,508
There are so many people here.

121
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:48,479
We're done, right?
I'm leaving, too.

122
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,274
Bo Ra!
You have until Christmas Eve!

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,602
You have a week!

124
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,112
I told you, I'm not doing it!

125
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:01,887
Hey!

126
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,690
Hey... what's with you?
Hey! What's with you?

127
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,411
What are you doing?

[Bo Ra]

129
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,482
You're such a jerk!

[Sun Woo]

131
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:17,437
What are you doing?

132
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:21,346
They're doing a neighborhood
meeting at my place.

133
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,232
Let's go to Taek's.

134
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:25,814
We can have some ramyun.

135
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,293
I have something to talk to you about.

136
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,365
With me?

137
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,223
What's the point of having
a neighborhood meeting?

138
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:35,129
They talk to each other every day.

139
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,639
I know, right?
They're so earnest about it.

140
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,241
I guess they're deciding
something big.

141
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,061
Nothing?

142
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:03,607
If there's no other feedback,
then we'll do notebooks.

143
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,720
That's a good idea!
Notebooks... yeah!

144
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,372
So let's end the meeting here!

145
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,399
OK, then.

146
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,309
Then, this year, the present
for our kids this year will be...

147
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:14,240
Notebooks, notebooks, yeah!

148
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:15,312
Excuse me.

149
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:21,601
How about a notepad
instead of a notebook?

150
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,200
A notepad... ow!

151
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,740
I'm sorry. He's not well, you see.

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,657
Such nonsense...

153
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:35,085
Whether it's a notebook
or a notepad, I'll buy it for our kids!

154
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,605
All right... then, with this, our monthly
neighborhood meeting is over.

-Nobody has anything else, correct?
-No!

Next week, we'll have the meeting
at his place.

00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:46,437
All right, that's it! Finally!

Why do we need to have
a three hour long meeting?

Excuse me.

over there?

you told Jin Joo...

164
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:09,049
...that Santa doesn't exist?

165
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,740
Who was it?

166
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:16,848
Who went and blabbed to this innocent
child that there's no Santa?

167
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,240
Who do you think?

168
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:21,428
It was probably
that family's eldest daughter.

169
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:32,879
[One Year Ago]

170
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,096
Give me one.

171
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,340
Just one.

172
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:44,741
No! Santa gave these to me!

173
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:50,893
Jin Joo. Your mom bought those.

174
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:53,763
There's no such thing as Santa.

175
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:13,129
I knew it.

176
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,533
She's always had such a temper.

177
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:20,440
Well... even so, kids tend
to forget things quickly.

178
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:23,741
We'll buy Jin Joo's Christmas present
this year.

179
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,740
Um... wake the kid up, please.

180
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:29,240
Hit her or something.

181
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:32,288
Jin Joo...

182
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:37,191
Jin Joo! What do you
want for Christmas...

183
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:39,830
...from Santa this year?

184
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,990
I'll relay what you want
to Mr. Santa.

185
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,545
What do you want?

186
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:47,092
There's no such thing as Santa.

187
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,440
Want to watch a video
after we eat?

188
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:05,697
Die Hard's out now.

189
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,908
I'm going to the study room. I have to
finish  all my physics homework by today.

190
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,629
But you're the one who decided that.

191
00:13:11,743 --> 00:13:12,536
Do it tomorrow.

192
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:15,647
I'm checking over all my homework
and playing with Jin Joo in the evening...

193
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,325
Eat up.

194
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,552
At times like this,
you're such a model student.

195
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,076
Such a mysterious jerk.

196
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,090
What? Why are you starting with me again?

197
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,118
You like Bo Ra, right?

198
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:37,274
I happened to hear.

199
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,933
Oh... really?

200
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:41,802
When?

201
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,736
On the day it snowed.
Behind my front door.

202
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,829
It's a secret.

203
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:51,836
Of course, jerk.

204
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,269
I won't tell anyone.

205
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:56,072
I thought you liked Duk Seon for sure.

206
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:58,330
Why her, for sure?

207
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,196
Duk Seon is prettier.

208
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,224
What?

209
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,194
She's the prettiest
among the uglies.

210
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,274
What are you saying?

211
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,236
-Are you saying she's pretty or ugly?
-Of course I'm saying she's ugly!

212
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,078
The meeting should be over by now, right?

213
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:29,469
Kids will believe anything...

214
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,950
...as long as there's a present
next to them in the morning.

215
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:35,090
So buy Jin Joo a present
and put it next to her, OK, Mr. Sung?

216
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:38,395
Jin Joo!

217
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,979
What do you want for Christmas?

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,149
We'll buy it for you.

219
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,011
Go ahead and tell me. I'll buy it.
What do you want?

220
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:52,139
A snowman!

221
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,538
That's a piece of cake!

222
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:56,647
Oh, my Jin Joo wants a snowman?

223
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:57,948
What do we do?

224
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,723
That's something that's only possible
with Mr. Santa around.

225
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,986
Who else could buy you a snowman?

226
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:08,355
That's right!
There isn't a place that sells snowmen...

227
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,266
...and so only Mr. Santa could
bring that for you!

228
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,940
Then, Jin Joo...

229
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:19,030
I'll put a special request in
to Mr. Santa for that gift, for you! OK?

230
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:24,077
But, um... that day... Jin Joo!

231
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:28,730
Jung Bong has steamed red bean buns.

232
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:30,257
Go ask him for one.

233
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:32,047
Steamed red bean buns?

234
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:38,488
But, um... what if it
doesn't snow on that day?

235
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,934
How do we make a snowman, then?

236
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:42,941
Oh no... you're right.
I didn't think that far ahead.

237
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,940
It will snow.

238
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:50,215
It says it'll snow in the Seoul area
on the 23rd and the 24th!

239
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:52,320
We're saved, then!

240
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,931
There's nothing to worry about, then!

241
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:56,440
If it snows, making a snowman
is no big deal.

242
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,693
Yeah, that's great!

243
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,388
Let's keep things short from now on!

244
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,599
Geez, by the time our next meeting
is over, I'll be dead.

245
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,358
Hey, Mr. Choi!

246
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,369
Wake up!

247
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,734
Wow... that guy...

248
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,840
I've never seen someone fall asleep
so easily at someone else's house.

249
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:12,240
What a great fortune he has.

250
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:14,886
It's because he wakes up so early
all the time since he wants to feed Taek.

251
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:17,784
At any rate, let's meet up
on the night of Christmas Eve. OK?

252
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:21,165
Everyone should come out.
The more the merrier!

253
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:24,570
That's right. Well, since it's
vacation, all I have is time!

254
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:25,841
All right, I'll be going, then!

255
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,861
- OK!
- Goodbye!

256
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:40,140
-Does your wrist hurt again?
-Yeah.

257
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,840
I guess winter is coming.

258
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,399
It always hurts around that time.

259
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,187
Madam. Have something
to eat here before you go.

260
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,440
Want to make some
kimchi noodles?

261
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,539
Your wrist hurts, so we should do that...

262
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,354
How about some Chinese-Korean food?

263
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:55,310
I want jjamppong.

264
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:58,955
I want jjajjangmyun
with red pepper flakes!

265
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:00,730
Mr. Choi, where are you off to?

266
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,842
Oh... I have to make dinner.

267
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:06,560
You can just eat here.

268
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,208
That's right!
Have some jjajjangmyun.

269
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,514
Taek isn't here since
he went to the Baduk Club.

270
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,493
Even so... what if he doesn't eat dinner
before he comes home?

271
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,065
We can make him dinner!

272
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,144
It's OK for him to miss
just one meal!

273
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,440
If I were to be reincarnated,
I'd want to be reborn as Mr. Choi's son.

274
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,102
You're seriously the best
when it comes to taking care of your kid!

275
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:30,429
The moms here should
take a few pointers from you.

276
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,039
No, that's not true. I don't do much.

277
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:37,169
If you "don't do much,"
she does literally nothing!

278
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,779
Compared to you,
she's a good-for-nothing!

279
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:45,539
What did you just say?

280
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,640
Hurry up and beg for her forgiveness!

281
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm just saying!

282
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,393
Did I say that you
were really like that?

283
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,395
You know how I feel.

284
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,224
Hurry up and apologize!

285
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,230
Why do I need to apologize
over something like this?

286
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,823
Forget about that.
Instead of an apology...

287
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,946
I'll give you a "B" -pology.

288
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:11,753
Goddammit... stop it with
your stupid dad jokes!

289
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:15,464
What? a "B"-pology
is worth more than an "A"-pology!

290
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:17,174
"B" comes after "A," so it's worth more!

291
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,118
Shut your darn mouth!

292
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,727
Get the hell over here!

293
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm going to beat you to death!

294
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,971
OK, "C"-pology, then! "D"-pology?

295
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,982
"D" -pology my ass!

296
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,829
Yeah, Duk Seon... it's Mom.

297
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:37,401
We're going to order some jjajjangmyun.
You guys order something, too!

298
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:50,308
The house up front will pay you.

299
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,539
Will do. Enjoy your meal!

300
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:52,603
Thank you.

301
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:02,188
Dong Ryong.

302
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:03,774
How did you know to come?

303
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,460
I heard the sound of a motorcycle.

304
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:08,339
What about the others?

305
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,641
They're studying. Those jerks.

306
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:33,660
Who did you get for Secret Santa?

307
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,557
I don't know. I don't care.

308
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,010
Eat up, Jung Bong.

309
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:52,047
How did... what fate!

310
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:58,975
Wait.

311
00:19:58,986 --> 00:19:59,986
OK.

312
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:06,452
Jung Bong... are you, by chance...

313
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:09,353
You have to follow the rules.

314
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,140
You two picked each other, didn't you?

315
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,853
You two suit each other.

316
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:15,966
Get married, you two.

317
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,809
-Get married.
-Get married.

318
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,208
No Eul.

319
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,740
I don't have much money as of late.

320
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:45,029
If not for that, I would have bought you
an entire bunch of bananas!

321
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,141
Oh, no need for that!

322
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,230
Instead... can I...

323
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:53,740
Go ahead.

324
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:56,877
If it's something I can do for you,
anything is game.

325
00:20:56,936 --> 00:21:01,827
You said you're getting me
that record I want, so...

326
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:04,727
There's nothing
I wouldn't want to do for you.

327
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,199
If there's anything in this
room that you want

328
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,194
I'll give you anything.

329
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,068
Do you, by any chance,
have "Hwang Sa?"

330
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:14,640
"Hwang Sa?"

331
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,941
You mean, "An Unwelcome Visitor
on a Spring Day?"

332
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,097
In my room?

333
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:22,678
No!

334
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:25,539
You know, "A Charming Adolescence."

335
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:28,029
Oh, that novel.

336
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,206
You have it, right?

337
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:33,551
I don't have it myself,
but someone I know does.

338
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:35,363
If you want it,
I can get it for you.

339
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:45,564
Kim Jung Bong...

340
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:59,248
Jung Hwan

341
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,573
How is Lee Mi Yeon so pretty
even when she lives in the boonies?

342
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,229
Taek isn't back yet?

343
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,478
Hey, knock before barging in! Geez!

344
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,218
Knock, my ass.

345
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,166
What were you doing?

346
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:30,923
I didn't do anything.

347
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,170
What are you talking about?

348
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,004
You didn't do what?

349
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:37,041
What do you want?

350
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:38,898
Mind your own.

351
00:22:39,178 --> 00:22:40,436
Fine!

352
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:43,809
Is it raining outside?

353
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,983
Why is it raining so much?

354
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:47,716
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wait! Hey! Wait!

355
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:49,821
What are you doing?

356
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:52,317
Where do you think you're touching? Hey!

357
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:53,191
Give it!

358
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:55,508
OK, OK!
I'm giving it to you!

359
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,653
Hey!

360
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,283
What the hell is this?

361
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:24,622
Little kids don't need to know.

362
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,332
Geez... all you know is dirty stuff.

363
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:31,866
Hey. All the other kids read this too.

364
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,076
You think I'm the only one?

365
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:35,665
All the kids in my class read it too.

366
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:40,018
What?

367
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:43,799
Guys look at this kind of stuff
with their friends all the time!

368
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,587
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

369
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:49,030
How could you read a book
like this with your friends?

370
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:51,427
-Disgusting.
-Disgusting? Hey.

371
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,888
Do you think I'd read it
with my mom, then?

372
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,925
At any rate, you're such an animal.

373
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,205
Why, you little...

374
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:04,053
I'm going to go meet Taek on his
way home. Watch the house for me, OK?

375
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:05,064
Yes, sir.

376
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,548
Don't worry.

377
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,595
We'll watch over your house well.
Right?

378
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,701
-Are you going to meet Taek?
-Yes!

379
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,319
He didn't take an umbrella with him.

380
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:27,416
What a guy!

381
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:29,769
He always goes to see him
with an umbrella on rainy days...

382
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,714
...even though he doesn't even know
what time he'll be done!

383
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:34,805
I bet he'll be waiting a while
in front of the Baduk Club again.

384
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:37,186
He could just call him
and tell him to come out!

385
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,096
How frustrating!

386
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:46,054
Taxi!

387
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,173
Hello.

388
00:24:53,322 --> 00:24:55,029
Can you take me to the Korean Baduk Club?

389
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Yes.

390
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:09,832
Oh! Hello!

391
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:13,110
Shall I get Master Choi Taek for you?
He's inside.

392
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:14,770
Or you can go inside if you'd like, sir.

393
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,280
No, that's fine.

394
00:25:16,346 --> 00:25:18,734
I like watching the rain.

395
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:19,778
It's fine.

396
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:20,977
Oh, I see.

397
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:23,696
Goodbye.

398
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:11,116
Those gloves are so pretty, right?

399
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,025
Pink looks so good on me, too.

400
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,552
It's because it's Lee Mi Yeon
that it looks pretty.

401
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:17,987
Geez, you...

402
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:19,341
...did I ask you to buy them for me?

403
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,816
Did I ever say I'd buy them for you?

404
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,897
Whatever. I'm going to ask Taek.

405
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,065
Why would he?

406
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:25,209
Because he has me for Secret Santa.

407
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:26,313
He is?

408
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,551
Is it you, then?

409
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:30,552
It is you, right?

410
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:33,812
No, it isn't!

411
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,038
If it isn't you, it's Taek.

412
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:42,852
Please, let it be Taek.

413
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,601
Who knows?

414
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:55,455
Dad, when did you get here?

415
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:57,551
Not too long ago.

416
00:26:57,552 --> 00:26:58,852
Let's go. It's cold.

417
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,351
You're going to Busan tomorrow...

418
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,065
I'm worried because
it's raining so much.

419
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,011
The roads will be slippery.

420
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:38,696
It'll be fine.

421
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:45,795
The match is on Christmas Eve.

422
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,443
Your birthday...

423
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,043
I think I'll get home
really late that day.

424
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,729
I'm sorry.

425
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:58,851
I don't need to celebrate
my birthday, at this age.

426
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,814
Just worry about yourself.

427
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,072
Don't worry about me.

428
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,074
Even so... is there
anything you want?

429
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:06,131
No. Nothing.

430
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:09,317
Oh yeah...

431
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:14,061
There's the thing
with Ms. Park tomorrow, right?

432
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:18,176
Oh... you have
the filming tomorrow, right?

433
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:21,587
Sorry... it's something that Ms. Park
requested, so I couldn't refuse.

434
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:26,240
It's OK. It's Ms. Park
of all people, after all.

435
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:31,452
She's the president of your fan club,
so I should do that much.

436
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,056
If she bothers you too much,
call me at the hotel.

437
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:38,239
Since I'm close to her,
I can say something to her.

438
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,349
No, it's fine.

439
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:44,258
She's always been helping us out.
It's fine.

440
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,740
Yes... that's good.

441
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:06,451
Don't be nervous, just answer
Ms. Park's questions naturally.

442
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,532
Sir, what are you worried about?

443
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:11,603
I'll edit it well, so be at ease.

444
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:12,841
OK. Thank you.

445
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,339
I'm no good with words.

446
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,148
I'll only pick out the good parts to use.

447
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,629
Let's get started then, shall we?

448
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,160
Sir, you're ready, right?

449
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,315
Yes.

450
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:24,025
First, we'll start with
when Choi Taek, 6-dan, was young.

451
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:36,207
Look.

452
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:39,780
Kia will win this game for sure.

453
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,737
An Kyung Soo, Yoo Jae Ha,
Jung Duk Hwan!

454
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:46,272
When these three meet,
nobody compares to them.

455
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,130
I bet Samsung Electric is going to win.

456
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:50,851
Joon Ji Eun. Kim Hyun Joon. Oh Se Hoon.

457
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:52,207
They have a bunch of top notch guys.

458
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:54,256
You darn jerk, you...

459
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,574
Oh, what to do? I totally forgot.

460
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:59,730
They have a brand new player, Heo Jae!

461
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,517
Kim Hyun Joon can get
50 points on his own!

462
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:05,137
Hey, you jerk, do you think
he'll stand around and do nothing?

463
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:06,694
Look! Heo Jae got over 51 points!

464
00:30:07,427 --> 00:30:09,143
You two are exactly the same.

465
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:11,649
Bo Ra, have some oysters.
My mother sent these over.

466
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,641
I don't want any.

467
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:15,500
Don't have any.
There's not enough to go around, anyway.

468
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:19,337
You're already 20 years old
and you're still so darn picky?

469
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:21,848
Hurry up and eat!
Your grandmother sent these!

470
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:28,549
Hello?

471
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,264
Who's this? Our Taekkie!

472
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:36,655
Oh my... our Duk Seon,
getting a call from Taek?

473
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,169
I wonder what happened.

474
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,222
Duk Seon's friends are all
weak when it comes to Taek.

475
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,098
They say they have to protect him
because he's a national treasure.

476
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,241
- Hello, fans from all over the country!
- Oh, Dad.

477
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,585
It's the match between Kia and Samsung...

478
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,737
The match is starting.

479
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:49,810
Duk Seon.

480
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:51,392
I wanted to ask you something.

481
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:52,900
Sure! What?

482
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,891
Hey, lower that!
I can't hear!

483
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:03,186
It's my dad's birthday on the 24th.

484
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,469
-Yes, Taek?
-What should I bring as a gift?

485
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
A gift?

486
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:09,234
Yeah, a gift.

487
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,116
What should I buy as a gift?

488
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:13,951
Hey, how could you just ask me

489
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,017
something like that up front?

490
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,487
Oh... is that right?

491
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,539
Even so, I thought it'd be OK
if you knew.

492
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,188
No Eul, I think Taek has me!

493
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,369
My Secret Santa is Taek! Aw yes!

494
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,569
Oh, really. Wow.

495
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,969
Hey, I told you to lower it!

496
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,169
I ought to kill you...
lower the volume!

497
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,170
I can't hear him!

498
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,370
It's my first time buying a present,
so I don't know what to get.

499
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,370
What should I buy my dad?

500
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,669
I have some time before
the match tomorrow

501
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,468
so I was going to go
to the department store.

502
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:49,568
What should I buy?

503
00:31:49,648 --> 00:31:53,249
Um... gloves!

504
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,068
Gloves?

505
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:58,268
Oh... good idea.

506
00:31:58,269 --> 00:31:59,669
What kind of gloves?

507
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,369
I don't know a lot about that stuff.

508
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,969
Pink ones! Pink
gloves are so pretty!

509
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,268
Pink gloves?

510
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:07,969
Do you think that'll be OK?

511
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,768
Of course it is!

512
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,368
I don't think you know,
but pink gloves are all the rage lately.

513
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,969
Kim Hyun Joon... Shoot!

514
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,869
- Want to die?
- Get it! Get it!

515
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,969
I told you, I can't hear!

516
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,769
Darn it!

517
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,470
All right! Kim Hyun Joon!

518
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,069
My dad will like it, right?

519
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:31,094
My dad and I have never
exchanged gifts and stuff,

520
00:32:31,095 --> 00:32:35,069
so I'm not even sure how to give
him the present after I buy one.

521
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:37,369
Hello?

522
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,568
OK, Duk Seon. Thanks.

523
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:41,469
Then... I'll see you on Christmas Day.

524
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,068
What? On Christmas Day?

525
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,169
When are you getting back?

526
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,169
The match is on the 24th.

527
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,256
It's ending in Pusan,

528
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,969
so it'll probably be past 11:00 p.m.
by the time I get home.

529
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,869
Oh. I'll wait for you!

530
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,469
Don't. What for?

531
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,870
It's my choice!

532
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,268
Then... I'll drop by
to see you for a bit.

533
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,869
Don't fall asleep and wait for me.

534
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,568
OK!

535
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,969
OK. Good luck on your match!

536
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,568
OK! Be careful not to catch a cold!

537
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,069
Bye!

538
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:13,268
Dad!

539
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:15,068
I'm getting gloves!

540
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:16,069
What gloves?

541
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,269
Nothing. Taek is going to
buy them for me, that's all.

542
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,268
Wow, this kimchi soup is great.

543
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,169
Mom, give me some more soup!

544
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,670
Sure.

545
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:33,168
So he was a quiet kid
even when he was younger?

546
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,068
Yes. He was a quiet and gentle
kid ever since he was young.

547
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:41,269
He's never put up a fuss,
asking you to buy something for him?

548
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,270
That's right.

549
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,068
He matured so quickly, so...

550
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,069
I see.

551
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,068
Since Choi Taek is such a genius

552
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:50,168
his mother must have
had a unique conception dream.

553
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:53,169
What was the conception dream
that she had?

554
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:57,669
Um, well...

555
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,270
I don't quite remember.

556
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:02,568
Mom, I'm going to the study room!

557
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:03,569
Oh, hello, ma'am.

558
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,269
Oh, yes, Sun Woo.
Are you going to study?

559
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,270
Yes.

560
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:08,568
How come? It's Sunday...
just study at home!

561
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:09,869
I'll make you something yummy.

562
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,968
No, it's OK.
I'll only be there until the evening.

563
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,469
Don't do stuff like this
when your wrist is bad! Sheesh!

564
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,769
Why won't you go to
the doctor already?

565
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,769
It's OK if I turn it slowly.

566
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,769
Geez... Mom!

567
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,668
Quit your nagging, already.

568
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,869
What about Jin Joo?
Where did she go?

569
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,568
Huh? Oh... she must have gone
to play that sugar candy game again!

570
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,969
Jung Bong's dad gave her 100 won before.

571
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,168
Wow, he gave her a lot...

572
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:34,568
Can you go get her?
She won't listen to me.

573
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:35,569
OK. I'm off, then.

574
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:36,569
OK.

575
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,169
Goodbye!

576
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,470
- OK, bye.
- Yes!

577
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:44,169
Geez. You raised such a good son.

578
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,669
Look at him, opening the jar
for you because your wrist hurts.

579
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,869
You don't need to worry about Sun Woo,
even in the outside world.

580
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,268
He does everything he needs to do

581
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:57,168
and takes such good care
of his little sister.

582
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:59,668
Just how will you manage to
let another woman have him one day?

583
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:02,069
Madam! Don't say that! I'm about
to start tearing up already.

584
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,269
What's that?

585
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,270
You made rice cakes?

586
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,068
Yeah. I have way too much rice at home.

587
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,069
Let's eat!

588
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,769
OK. Wow, it looks delicious!

589
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,770
Geez!

590
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:14,069
I'll make you a yummy one, OK?

591
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,470
Hey, guys. I'm taking Jin Joo.

592
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:22,169
Jin Joo.

593
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:23,869
Is that yummy?

594
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,669
I think there's something
you promised me, though.

595
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,269
Jin Joo.

596
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,068
Only have that sugar candy
once a week.

597
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:37,569
Only on the days that
the Children's Classic Story airs, OK?

598
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,570
You promised me, right?

599
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,769
Hurry and go brush your teeth with your
Dooly Cartoon dinosaur toothbrush.

600
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,669
Then, I'll buy you ice cream
in the evening.

601
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,169
Mom, I'm really going now.

602
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,469
Why the umbrella?
Is it raining outside?

603
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,468
They said it's going to rain later
in the evening.

604
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,669
I'm bringing it just in case.

605
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,668
Goodbye!

606
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:08,068
OK!

607
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,970
Study up, my son!

608
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,168
Where else would you find
a son like him?

609
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,269
How does one have a child like him?

610
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,969
He's just like his father.

611
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,370
He did everything by the book.

612
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,869
Oh yeah. Madam.

613
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,568
Is Taek's father's interview over?

614
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,169
We should've gone to watch.

615
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,068
He barely speaks...

616
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:32,370
I'm sure he's all like,
"Uh huh huh."

617
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,470
The conception dream...

618
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,769
I don't quite remember it.

619
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,868
I see.

620
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,469
What about the Future-Grabbing Ceremony
during his first birthday?

621
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,469
Did he choose education?
Money? A long life?

622
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,969
I don't quite remember
what he grabbed then, either.

623
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,908
I'm sorry.

624
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,016
It's OK.

625
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:57,269
We want to see what his fortune
for the new year will be.

626
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,869
When's his birthday?

627
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,315
October 8th, 1971.

628
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:02,326
What about the time?

629
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,014
Was it the morning?

630
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,270
Afternoon?

631
00:37:11,706 --> 00:37:14,489
I'm not quite sure. I'm sorry.

632
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:18,525
That's fine! Dads usually don't
know these things, anyway.

633
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,514
Then about Choi Taek, 6-dan
shall we talk about his habits?

634
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:27,911
Is he the type to be a bit slow
at home, too?

635
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:33,470
We heard from his colleagues
at the Baduk Club that he's...

636
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:54,762
It's really raining!

637
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,828
It's so much better than snow!

638
00:37:56,873 --> 00:38:00,772
Rain, fall down!
Fall down, fall down!

639
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:02,501
Oh no, my sauces!

640
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,970
I left the lids open!

641
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:08,978
Oh my god, I must be out of my mind!
My laundry!

642
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,040
What do I do? Geez!

643
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:19,307
Oh, geez!

644
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,054
It seems that Choi Taek
really takes after you.

645
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:32,120
Of course, I'm sure
that was only made possible...

646
00:38:32,157 --> 00:38:34,154
...due to you having raised him
with so much love and care!

647
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,929
You're really amazing!

648
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:39,615
I'm sure raising him alone
was no easy feat.

649
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:42,068
When was the most difficult moment
in child-rearing for you?

650
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:44,070
I've never had such a moment.

651
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:49,273
My child is an extremely quiet one,
so he's never once made me upset.

652
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,569
Yes... he's quite a kind son.

653
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:57,782
And finally, any last words
to your son?

654
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:02,899
Well, I'd like for him to be healthy...
and... well...

655
00:39:03,938 --> 00:39:05,716
...having one's health
is the most important thing.

656
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:09,990
Well... I'd like to say, "Don't get sick"
and "Be healthy."

657
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:12,092
Tell him that you love him,
just once!

658
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:13,328
Oh... no.

659
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:14,790
Just once. Please?

660
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,397
No... no.

661
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,257
I'm not good at things like that... yes.

662
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,966
Mr. Choi! Please, just once!

663
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:24,065
Just once.

664
00:39:25,205 --> 00:39:28,203
Well... I don't really
say things like that, so...

665
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:29,784
I don't...
I'm not really good at that...

666
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,119
Ms. Park,
why are you doing this to me?

667
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:44,482
Wow, he must have completely forgotten!

668
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,623
He left the door wide open...
where did he go?

669
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:15,370
Excuse me, Mr. Choi.

670
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:19,621
Did something happen?

671
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,221
I didn't even realize
that you came.

672
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:46,518
-Hey. Dong Ryong.
-Yeah?

673
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,287
Go home and sleep.

674
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:49,877
You've been sleeping here for 10 hours.

675
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:52,921
I feel more at ease here.

676
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:55,748
The dean lives at my house, remember?

677
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:59,230
Go on ahead. I'm going home later.

678
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:18,820
It's raining outside, right?

679
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:20,127
Yeah.

680
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,910
I think so.

681
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:25,311
I love the sound of rain.

682
00:42:01,737 --> 00:42:03,737
I like getting hit by the rain.

683
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,716
-Lies.
-Why would I lie?

684
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,470
I really do like getting hit by the rain.

685
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:20,551
-I'll be going on ahead.
-Hey... Sun Woo!

686
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,970
Hey!

687
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,643
I'll come pick up my umbrella
tomorrow morning!

688
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:24,654
See you tomorrow!

689
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,621
You're not even that good
at holding your liquor.

690
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:51,857
What, did you misspeak
during the interview today?

691
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:54,955
What is it?

692
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:57,066
What happened that you feel so cruddy?

693
00:42:59,398 --> 00:43:00,642
Ms. Kim.

694
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:02,031
Yes?

695
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:06,659
Do you still remember the conception
dream you had when you had Sun Woo?

696
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,619
Are you kidding me? Of course.

697
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,928
I could dream the same dream
tonight if I wanted to.

698
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:14,990
A dragon was flying up
in the middle of a waterfall...

699
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,579
...but when it saw me,
it turned its head.

700
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,759
It had a jewel about this big...

701
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,969
...and it threw that onto my skirt
before disappearing up the waterfall.

702
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:31,745
What about the time
that Sun Woo was born?

703
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:35,948
- I'm sure you definitely...
- 4:57 a.m.

704
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:37,384
Around the time to feed the pigs.

705
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:40,716
I was pleading with him to be born
before 5:00 a.m.

706
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:43,025
And then, he popped out
exactly three minutes beforehand!

707
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,501
He was a filial son from the time
he was born, I tell you.

708
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:47,595
But, why do you ask?

709
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,306
Why are you asking that
out of the blue?

710
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,724
Why? Did Taek ask?

711
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,747
The reporter asked me today.

712
00:43:56,169 --> 00:44:00,270
About what his conception dream
was and what time he'd been born.

713
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,866
There's no way I'd know.

714
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,467
I couldn't remember, for the life of me.

715
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,840
And because of that, I couldn't answer.

716
00:44:09,743 --> 00:44:13,143
I wanted to crawl somewhere
and hide.

717
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,944
I feel so apologetic toward Taek.

718
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:30,014
I feel so apologetic toward my child.

719
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:40,103
Dads usually don't
really know those things!

720
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:42,592
What kind of father
would remember all that?

721
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:49,683
If only his mother were here...
she would've remembered everything.

722
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:57,203
If his mother were
alive she'd know...

723
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:03,254
...what her conception dream  was
or what time he'd been born...

724
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:08,556
...or what he'd worn on his first day
of elementary school...

725
00:45:09,057 --> 00:45:11,024
...just like you.

726
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:21,057
Dads are so useless.

727
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:30,258
If only if his mother had been
the one to live instead of me...

728
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:35,209
...Taek would've received
so much love like the other kids...

729
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,838
...and would've worn nice clothes
every season...

730
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:41,347
...and would've eaten
a lot of delicious food.

731
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,715
And when he was ill...

732
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:53,872
...his mother could've held him tight...

733
00:45:57,313 --> 00:46:02,112
Why did I have to be the one to live on?

734
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:07,613
I have nothing to say, really.

735
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,481
There's nobody else like you
on this planet, Mr. Choi.

736
00:46:11,846 --> 00:46:14,664
You make him a warm meal
every morning.

737
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:18,573
When it rains, you stand and wait
for Taek outside of the Baduk Club.

738
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:20,509
You've never even watched TV properly...

739
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:24,036
...because you were
afraid of disturbing him.

740
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:29,564
Taek is aware of
all of these things, too.

741
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:32,901
He's such a happy child in the inside
because he knows...

742
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:39,779
...how much his father
loves and cherishes him.

743
00:46:40,113 --> 00:46:41,727
He's aware of it all!

744
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:48,528
What good is it,
whether he knows or not?

745
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,479
It's because I feel so bad for my child.

746
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,717
I feel so bad for my child...

747
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:29,449
Two Days Until Christmas Eve

748
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:33,458
One Day Before the End of Secret Santa

749
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:49,107
You're going to freeze
to death like that.

750
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,196
You're wearing a jean skirt
in the middle of the winter?

751
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,691
You gave up on studying, didn't you?

752
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,066
I'm going to start
in January, all right?

753
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:58,326
- Mind your own.
- As if.

754
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,789
Duk Seon!
Hurry and come out!

755
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:02,420
Are you going to be late on
the last day before winter break, too?

756
00:48:02,431 --> 00:48:03,530
OK!

757
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,828
You're still here?

758
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:26,839
Yeah. I overslept.

759
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:29,364
Let's go.

760
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:30,885
Hey.

761
00:48:31,006 --> 00:48:32,104
Aren't you cold?

762
00:48:32,115 --> 00:48:33,654
What are you doing,
in the middle of the winter?

763
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:36,180
I'm going to Apgujung with my friends
after school today.

764
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:38,698
Since I'm going there,
I have to dress up at least this much!

765
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:42,295
What if you get sick?

766
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:45,110
And if you go to any part of Gangnam
today, you'll get trampled to death.

767
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:47,000
Why not just stay home?

768
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:51,529
Why not mind your own business, sir?

769
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:58,759
I mean... um... I'm just saying.

770
00:48:59,184 --> 00:49:03,384
What about we watch a video
with the crew tonight at Taek's?

771
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,806
No. I already promised
Man Ok and Jo Hyun.

772
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:07,422
Oh, hey!

773
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,953
You guys haven't left yet?

774
00:49:11,222 --> 00:49:12,722
Jerk.

775
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,890
Hey.

776
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:49,497
Everyone else but us is a couple.
What's with us?

777
00:49:49,515 --> 00:49:50,801
We don't even have a guy with us.

778
00:49:52,624 --> 00:49:54,136
Did we ever though?

779
00:49:54,684 --> 00:49:55,583
Hey.

780
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:57,392
Call your boyfriend or something.

781
00:49:57,449 --> 00:49:59,364
Ask him to buy us burgers or something.

782
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,992
I can't believe you!

783
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:03,384
Hey.
She says he's not her boyfriend.

784
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:04,520
Apparently he likes someone else.

785
00:50:04,593 --> 00:50:05,465
For real?

786
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:06,555
Wait, really?

787
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:15,491
Hey, then... call that other guy
who was next to him instead.

788
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:17,803
Yeah! It's so sad
with just us girls here.

789
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:19,560
Let's call him over
and play together.

790
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:20,561
Who?

791
00:50:20,572 --> 00:50:21,871
Call the Baduk Boy. Baduk Boy!

792
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:24,070
Choi Taek.
I'll only look and not touch, I promise.

793
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:26,481
He went to Pusan and he won't be back
until tomorrow night.

794
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:30,178
Should I call Dong Ryong?
You know, the one with the glasses.

795
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,234
Forget him.

796
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:32,752
Oh, yeah! Can't we call him?

797
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,045
You know, the tall skinny kid
with the narrow eyes.

798
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:36,087
Who?

799
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:38,606
The one who was next
to the Student Body President?

800
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:39,716
The scary looking one?

801
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,838
You mean Jung Hwan?
Kim Jung Hwan?

802
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,280
Even he would be fine.

803
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,890
It'd be better than us eating alone.

804
00:50:45,223 --> 00:50:48,321
He looked totally loaded, too,
so tell him to buy us some burgers.

805
00:50:48,758 --> 00:50:50,444
-He definitely won't come.
-Why not?

806
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,358
I'll just be happy if he doesn't
curse me out while I ask.

807
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,318
He has a nasty-ass temper!

808
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,982
But still... give him a call, at least!
Yeah, he might actually come!

809
00:50:57,993 --> 00:50:59,094
I thought he was your friend!

810
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:00,129
I don't want to.

811
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,925
He's going to give me
so much crap over it.

812
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
Hey.

813
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:11,043
You can't even make a phone call
for a friend?

814
00:51:11,163 --> 00:51:12,561
Is that the kind of relationship we have?

815
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,687
Mom, I'm going to the city for a bit.

816
00:51:42,698 --> 00:51:43,698
To hang out?

817
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,563
No, to buy something.

818
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:47,086
Will you be late?

819
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:49,711
I've made the crab stew
you like for dinner.

820
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:51,213
No, I'll be back soon.

821
00:51:51,596 --> 00:51:53,196
Let's eat dinner together.

822
00:51:57,504 --> 00:51:59,762
Oh my! Are you going somewhere,
Jin Joo?

823
00:52:00,128 --> 00:52:02,429
Do you have a dinner appointment
with someone today?

824
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:05,219
I'll take Jin Joo with me.

825
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:07,221
Jin Joo. Do you love me or not?

826
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:08,232
I love you!

827
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:12,085
I'll be back, Mom!

828
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,367
Oh, my children...

829
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:22,963
Hello.

830
00:52:23,064 --> 00:52:24,508
Oh, Sun Woo!

831
00:52:25,288 --> 00:52:26,686
Where are you going, Jin Joo?

832
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:28,831
Are you going on a date
with your older brother?

833
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,960
You have to answer "Yes."

834
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:31,973
Yes.

835
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:34,762
What about Jung Hwan, though?

836
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,216
Excuse me?

837
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:37,793
You're not going with Jung Hwan?

838
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:38,962
He just dressed and left too.

839
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:56,262
Hey... why are you here?

840
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,067
What?

841
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:00,775
You told me to come.

842
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:15,464
Order what you guys want.
What do you want to eat?

843
00:53:19,192 --> 00:53:23,564
I want the Filet-o-Fish,
french fries and a cola.

844
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:27,909
Me too.

845
00:53:29,682 --> 00:53:31,351
What did she order, exactly?

846
00:53:31,816 --> 00:53:33,223
It's hard to understand
what she's saying, right?

847
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:35,933
A Filet-o-Fish, french fries,
and a cola.

848
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:39,356
We can get a combo, right?

849
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:40,872
It's a bit more expensive, though...

850
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,913
Sure. Go ahead. It's fine.

851
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,163
What do you want?

852
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:53,961
I want the Double Burger and a large cola,
fries and ice cream.

853
00:53:53,972 --> 00:53:57,463
You're doing it again!

854
00:53:57,764 --> 00:54:00,362
You can't even finish it all,
and you're being so greedy.

855
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,025
Eat first, then order more.

856
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:06,988
You always think with your stomach,
not your brain.

857
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:08,672
You have no sense of
self-control.

858
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:11,642
Just get the burger and the cola.

859
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:12,656
Got it?

860
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:16,728
I'm going to the bathroom.

861
00:54:22,748 --> 00:54:24,624
-Excuse me...
-Yes?

862
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,762
You seem to be quite close
with Duk Seon.

863
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:30,035
You came here so quickly
after she called you.

864
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:31,671
It's not that...

865
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,346
I thought she was by herself.

866
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,724
-I'll go and order.
-OK.

867
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:52,663
What the heck?
I think it's for real this time!

868
00:54:52,712 --> 00:54:53,811
Totally!

869
00:54:56,394 --> 00:55:01,271
Sing it, sing it!

870
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:05,999
Hurry! Let's go!

871
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,572
-What is it?
-Hurry!

872
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:11,583
-Did something huge happen?
-Yes!

873
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:17,503
What is it, already?

874
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:19,577
The weather forecast changed.

875
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:23,255
They say it won't rain tomorrow
or the day after.

876
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:25,848
Who the hell cares?

877
00:55:26,068 --> 00:55:27,434
The snowman, remember?

878
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:28,880
What are we going to do
about the snowman?

879
00:55:28,937 --> 00:55:29,937
Oh yeah.

880
00:55:30,446 --> 00:55:32,567
Does anyone have any ideas?

881
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:35,051
We already made a promise to her
that we'd get her a snowman...

882
00:55:35,062 --> 00:55:36,615
...even though they say
it won't snow at all.

883
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:40,389
What do we do?

884
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:44,388
OK.

885
00:55:44,605 --> 00:55:45,908
Make any suggestions
that come to mind.

886
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:50,518
Even if it's kind of silly,
just say it anyway.

887
00:55:59,928 --> 00:56:01,428
Go ahead.

888
00:56:02,729 --> 00:56:04,845
OK.
How about this?

889
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:10,857
Put Jin Joo to sleep
on the night of the 24th...

890
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:16,564
...and then wake her up
on the morning of the 26th!

891
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:19,482
See, then there will be no need
to make a snowman!

892
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:22,604
Because there won't be a 25th.

893
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:23,924
Just stop.

894
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:25,844
We can tell Jin Joo

895
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:31,356
"Jin Joo... the snowman melted
while you were sleeping!"

896
00:56:31,357 --> 00:56:33,425
"Why didn't you wake up?'

897
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:36,047
I'm sorry.

898
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:41,216
I've never heard
a more idiotic idea in my life.

899
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:43,532
Jesus Christ.

900
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:50,929
Can't we just make her any kind snowman?
It doesn't have to be made with snow.

901
00:56:51,135 --> 00:56:54,345
We can make it with paper
or the stuffing from our blankets!

902
00:56:55,786 --> 00:56:58,086
Sorry for being late!

903
00:56:58,363 --> 00:56:59,521
No, it's fine!

904
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:02,022
It's not like your ice store has any
business now... why are you always late?

905
00:57:02,033 --> 00:57:04,845
-What were you doing?
-I had to make a delivery.

906
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:10,781
That's right! Ice!

907
00:57:10,939 --> 00:57:13,438
We can make it for her
with ice! Right?

908
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,073
Oh my. You're right!

909
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:17,411
We can use ice!

910
00:57:17,422 --> 00:57:19,822
Instead of that, put her to sleep
on the 24th, and...

911
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:22,843
Ice! Yes! Great idea!

912
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:25,901
We can carve it into a snowman!

913
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,298
Mr. Choi here has a lot of talent
when it comes to things like that!

914
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:29,647
It's possible, right?

915
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:34,748
Well, I've never made that before,
but I don't think it'll be difficult.

916
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:42,475
That's right! Wow! Then, can you
spare us some ice from your store?

917
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:43,892
I'm sure nobody is buying ice
in this weather, anyway.

918
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:47,352
- Or give it to us for cheap, at least.
- No, it's fine!

919
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,220
Nobody is buying much, anyway.

920
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:51,326
I'll put two containers of it
out front by tomorrow.

921
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:52,662
Yes, thank you!

922
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:55,879
OK, then.
Let's all meet here tomorrow.

923
00:57:55,928 --> 00:57:57,563
Have a good dinner, everyone.

924
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:00,372
And Merry Christmas in advance!

925
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:01,784
OK, that concludes our meeting!

926
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,481
Wow, our neighborhood
really is something!

927
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,079
Oh my!

928
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,808
What have you been thinking about?

929
00:59:19,563 --> 00:59:20,715
Did you leave something behind?

930
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,351
Why are you acting so serious?

931
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,642
Did you do something bad?

932
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:30,378
Hey, Jung Hwan.

933
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,537
What?

934
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:34,131
You...

935
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:39,321
...have me for Secret Santa,
don't you?

936
00:59:40,107 --> 00:59:42,607
How strange. Taek has me, though.

937
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:46,004
Why would I have you
for Secret Santa?

938
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,014
You only came because
you had me for Secret Santa.

939
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:49,238
Would you have come to Gangnam otherwise?

940
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:50,353
Are you out of your mind?

941
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:54,782
Even I know that much.

942
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:57,222
I don't have you for Secret Santa.

943
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,470
Stop trying to convince me otherwise.

944
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:00,782
I have Taek for Secret Santa.

945
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:03,894
Want me to show you the slip
of paper I have at home?

946
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:06,015
Why did you come today?

947
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:11,754
What?

948
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:17,793
What? Are you really out of your mind?

949
01:00:21,437 --> 01:00:26,158
Use this head of yours and give it
some serious thought about why I came.

950
01:00:28,348 --> 01:00:29,547
Got it?

951
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:41,751
What's with him? Seriously!

952
01:00:47,418 --> 01:00:48,519
What?

953
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:32,734
Hello!

954
01:01:32,745 --> 01:01:36,217
This is a festival celebrating the youth,
romance, and dreams of young people!

955
01:01:36,285 --> 01:01:38,084
This is MBC's 1988
Campus Music Festival!

956
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:41,066
Should we play a game
to see who's the winner?

957
01:01:41,178 --> 01:01:42,140
Sure.
Sounds good.

958
01:01:42,151 --> 01:01:43,888
How much should we bet?

959
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:47,430
How about 1000 won per person...

960
01:01:47,644 --> 01:01:49,566
...and the winner will take everything.

961
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:53,474
Wow. You could totally be an MC!

962
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:54,877
Jung Bong.

963
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,467
Yeah?

964
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,890
Stop giving people false hope
and just watch quietly.

965
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:18,302
Wow... I didn't know Mr. Choi
was so skilled with his hands!

966
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:20,763
It's a masterpiece!

967
01:02:20,812 --> 01:02:23,625
You could close your jewelry store
and become a sculptor!

968
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:26,572
He used to carve
people's personal seals!

969
01:02:26,598 --> 01:02:27,997
He's a real artisan!

970
01:02:28,903 --> 01:02:31,266
But he doesn't have a nose, a mouth,
or eyes. He has no character.

971
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:34,780
Should we use the black stones,
or the white stones?

972
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:36,712
-I like the black stones!
-I like the white stones.

973
01:02:37,856 --> 01:02:39,087
I guess he won't have matching eyes.

974
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:52,480
-What are you doing?
-Don't do that! It'll melt!

975
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,133
With the temperature this low?
No way. Don't worry.

976
01:02:55,144 --> 01:02:56,144
It's fine.

977
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:58,343
Wow, look at that!

978
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:02,066
My Jin Joo will be so happy
tomorrow morning!

979
01:03:02,067 --> 01:03:05,265
She'll totally believe
that Santa brought this for her!

980
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:10,765
Llook how much we went through
for a little girl!

981
01:03:10,926 --> 01:03:11,954
At any rate...

982
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:15,866
...it's cold out and it's late,
so why not have a drink?

983
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:17,495
-Yes!
-OK.

984
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:20,041
Then we'll stay at Sun Woo's
and watch some TV!

985
01:03:20,052 --> 01:03:21,837
How about we have a drink, too?

986
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:25,160
It's so cold! Let's go already
instead of stating the obvious!

987
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:27,638
Let's go!

988
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:30,466
Yes, let's go!

989
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:08,214
I'm calling Number 11!

990
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,218
Me too! I'm calling Number 11, too!

991
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:10,829
There's still five teams left.

992
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,899
It'll be 11 for sure.
He has such charisma!

993
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:16,079
I think it'll be Number Three,
Jeon Soo Kyung!

994
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:18,259
Wow... I was thinking the same thing!

995
01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:20,561
Doesn't it seem a bit boring this year?

996
01:04:20,572 --> 01:04:21,871
Nobody has left an impact on me.

997
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,231
Hey. All songs are like that
when you hear it the first time.

998
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:26,579
There's no song that wows you
on the first listen!

999
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:27,790
I think it'll be Number One.

1000
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:30,443
Are you Beethoven or something?
You actually remember their song?

1001
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:33,287
Yeah. I think she was pretty.

1002
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:47,096
Oh yeah... isn't it
your birthday today, Mr. Choi?

1003
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:49,098
Oh yeah, it really is.

1004
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:52,947
Then we have to do a special
congratulatory toast for you!

1005
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,358
Here. Cheers!

1006
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:00,356
My wife was making
seaweed soup this morning.

1007
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:04,059
It's your birthday today...
you're not having a party with your son?

1008
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:08,277
What party, at our age?

1009
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:13,394
Just looking at the number
of candles on the cake on my birthday...

1010
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:15,904
...gets me all depressed.

1011
01:05:16,304 --> 01:05:17,304
That's right.

1012
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:22,005
After I passed 40 years old, I stopped
looking forward to my birthdays.

1013
01:05:22,111 --> 01:05:24,110
I just get depressed.

1014
01:05:24,198 --> 01:05:27,858
What are we supposed to do though?
We have to watch our kids grow up.

1015
01:05:30,133 --> 01:05:34,994
You're really drinking a lot today...
is something the matter?

1016
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:36,048
No.

1017
01:05:36,822 --> 01:05:37,990
When is Taek coming home?

1018
01:05:38,156 --> 01:05:41,555
Even so, it's your birthday...
it'd be nice to have dinner together.

1019
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:43,663
He's coming back from Pusan now.

1020
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:45,562
I got a call from him
this morning.

1021
01:05:45,573 --> 01:05:50,772
Taek is such a busy kid...
he doesn't have time for that stuff.

1022
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,586
Isn't that right?

1023
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:59,253
The mere fact that he grew up so
well is enough of a present...

1024
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:00,877
isn't it?

1025
01:06:00,987 --> 01:06:01,987
Yes.

1026
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,706
I'm so thankful for even just that.

1027
01:06:05,416 --> 01:06:08,758
I was only able to give him half
the love he deserved, raising him alone.

1028
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,082
Even so, he grew up so well.

1029
01:06:11,286 --> 01:06:14,768
That's not true. You loved him
twice as much for his mom's sake.

1030
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:18,958
Don't say things like that. If Taek
were to hear that, he might cry.

1031
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:24,110
He's just being humble! Geez.

1032
01:06:24,424 --> 01:06:27,301
What good would 10 parents be?

1033
01:06:27,312 --> 01:06:30,258
They couldn't compare to Mr. Choi
when it comes to loving their child.

1034
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:32,008
He's just being darn humble.

1035
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:34,575
Here, here! Let's make a toast!

1036
01:06:34,693 --> 01:06:36,092
Pour me a glass too.

1037
01:06:38,759 --> 01:06:39,759
OK.

1038
01:06:39,966 --> 01:06:41,465
Cheers!

1039
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:53,457
What's with this mood,
when it's Christmas today?

1040
01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:55,240
I'll sing us a song!

1041
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:56,739
Don't you dare, darn you.

1042
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,670
Is Jin Joo sleeping?

1043
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:08,468
Yes.

1044
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:12,080
She was playing so much with her brother
and now she's fast asleep.

1045
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,712
Jin Joo's so lucky.

1046
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:18,386
The entire neighborhood came out
to prepare her a Christmas gift.

1047
01:07:18,717 --> 01:07:20,266
She's blessed!

1048
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,372
She'll never forget
this Christmas present, right?

1049
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:24,993
She'll forget about it
by next year.

1050
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:26,431
Kids can't remember anything.

1051
01:07:26,478 --> 01:07:27,677
Why are you being so negative?

1052
01:07:28,266 --> 01:07:34,657
When I was young, there wasn't
even such a thing as Christmas.

1053
01:07:34,813 --> 01:07:39,094
My mom spent all night before my birthday
making a doll out of scraps of cloth.

1054
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:43,194
We had no money, so she used whatever
scraps of cloth there were lying around!

1055
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,738
And I still remember the day
that I saw that doll so clearly!

1056
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:52,371
We'll just see if it ends up being
a present that Jin Joo remembers forever!

1057
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:56,483
Really? Let's drink to that, then.

1058
01:07:57,347 --> 01:07:58,448
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1059
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:01,731
It's so great
with the three of us being together.

1060
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:07,538
I still think it'll be Number 11.

1061
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:10,203
- And I still think it'll be Number 14!
- Me too!

1062
01:08:11,241 --> 01:08:13,433
I think it'll be close, but...
I think it'll be Number 7.

1063
01:08:13,544 --> 01:08:15,543
-As for me, number 15!
-Me too.

1064
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:19,098
-Don't copy me!
-I'm not!

1065
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:20,908
What will it be?

1066
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:21,999
There's only one team left.

1067
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:26,610
There is only one team left tonight.

1068
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:28,426
-The last team...
-Hey!

1069
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,636
Number 16 from Seoul,
it's Endless Orbit!

1070
01:08:32,745 --> 01:08:37,145
Endless Orbit...
you're the last performer tonight.

1071
01:08:37,257 --> 01:08:39,355
What were you thinking
while you waited?

1072
01:08:39,858 --> 01:08:41,702
I wasn't thinking about much else...

1073
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,371
...I was just thinking about how much I
wanted to go home soon and see my mother.

1074
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:48,391
OK, then presenting Number 16,
Endless Orbit, from Seoul!

1075
01:08:48,402 --> 01:08:50,102
Their song is called "To That Person!"

1076
01:09:25,392 --> 01:09:27,192
-Number 16!
-No, I'm calling Number 16!

1077
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:29,101
-No, me!
-Me, me, me!

1078
01:09:29,102 --> 01:09:31,202
-I'm calling it.
-No, I am.

1079
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:33,503
16! I'm calling 16!

1080
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:42,303
- Me! Me!
- No, me!

1081
01:11:15,402 --> 01:11:16,502
Bo Ra!

1082
01:11:16,503 --> 01:11:18,102
It's me, Sun Woo.

1083
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:20,402
Can I see you for a bit?

1084
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:31,530
What is it, already?

1085
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,192
What is this?

1086
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:41,028
-A present.
-Hey.

1087
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:43,491
I told you not
to inconvenience me any further.

1088
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:46,303
You're making me really uncomfortable,
giving me something like this.

1089
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:47,994
Bo Ra.

1090
01:11:50,257 --> 01:11:51,808
I'm your Secret Santa.

1091
01:11:55,822 --> 01:11:58,221
We're supposed to exchange presents
for that today.

1092
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:04,525
I'll be going, then.

1093
01:12:04,812 --> 01:12:05,826
Oh yeah.

1094
01:12:08,985 --> 01:12:10,784
Merry Christmas.

1095
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:28,659
Taek!

1096
01:13:28,724 --> 01:13:29,924
Taekkie!

1097
01:13:31,803 --> 01:13:34,202
Hey. There's only
30 minutes left.

1098
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:35,203
Huh?

1099
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:38,303
Today! There's only 30 minutes
until today is over!

1100
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:42,071
It really is 11:30 p.m. already?

1101
01:13:42,563 --> 01:13:44,487
Duk Seon, I'll be going ahead.

1102
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:50,100
Hey, Choi Taek!

1103
01:13:54,277 --> 01:13:55,520
What about the gloves?

1104
01:13:56,872 --> 01:13:57,990
I bought them.

1105
01:13:58,703 --> 01:14:00,524
Thanks to you,
I was able to pick good ones.

1106
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,208
I think my dad will love them.

1107
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:10,406
Really, thanks a ton.

1108
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:38,078
Dad.

1109
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:47,487
Did you drink?

1110
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:49,502
Please, go inside and sleep.

1111
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:51,401
You're home, my son?

1112
01:14:51,943 --> 01:14:53,002
What about dinner?

1113
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:56,519
I ate. It's late, after all.

1114
01:14:57,585 --> 01:14:59,401
Oh. Yeah.

1115
01:14:59,402 --> 01:15:01,002
Wash up and go to sleep.

1116
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:03,267
You've worked hard, my son.

1117
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:18,303
Dad.

1118
01:15:19,252 --> 01:15:20,752
Here.

1119
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:23,838
What's this?

1120
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:27,959
A birthday present for you.

1121
01:15:29,774 --> 01:15:31,874
Happy birthday, Dad.

1122
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,094
Open it.

1123
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:52,582
It's your birthday, but I couldn't
have dinner with you.

1124
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:55,443
I'm sorry.

1125
01:15:59,446 --> 01:16:00,486
Dad...

1126
01:16:02,606 --> 01:16:05,713
...you know that
I love you so much, right?

1127
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:18,712
Dad...

1128
01:16:21,296 --> 01:16:22,732
What's wrong?

1129
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:32,837
When did my son
grow up this much?

1130
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:44,110
You're even so considerate
of your father.

1131
01:16:44,344 --> 01:16:47,844
You've really grown up, huh?
You're all grown up now, my son!

1132
01:16:55,868 --> 01:16:58,511
My kind and smart son...

1133
01:17:01,402 --> 01:17:03,102
I, too...

1134
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:06,102
Taek...

1135
01:17:28,933 --> 01:17:32,821
I... only have you, Taek.

1136
01:18:03,157 --> 01:18:04,658
Duk Seon... what are you doing here?

1137
01:18:07,865 --> 01:18:09,424
Did you fight with Bo Ra again?

1138
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,769
No Eul.

1139
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,081
I guess nobody picked my name.

1140
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:20,337
I don't even have a Secret Santa.

1141
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,955
I guess I'm someone
who doesn't even deserve to be loved.

1142
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,828
Isn't Taek your secret Santa?
I thought he was buying you gloves.

1143
01:18:31,951 --> 01:18:33,450
They weren't for me.

1144
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:34,662
They were for his dad.

1145
01:18:38,122 --> 01:18:40,434
- Should I just kill him?
- You can't!

1146
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:43,268
He lost today. Just barely, too.

1147
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:50,401
So don't cause him too much trouble
and just let it slide.

1148
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:55,303
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even remember
that we're doing Secret Santa.

1149
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:59,102
He has no time to be worrying
about such things right now.

1150
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:55,102
Duk Seon

1151
01:20:17,753 --> 01:20:19,154
Duk Seon.

1152
01:20:20,652 --> 01:20:22,852
I'm sorry. I totally forgot.

1153
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,391
I'm really sorry.

1154
01:20:26,616 --> 01:20:28,217
About what?

1155
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:32,203
Your Secret Santa... was me.

1156
01:20:34,638 --> 01:20:37,602
Right? You are my Secret Santa, right?

1157
01:20:39,303 --> 01:20:41,303
Yeah. It's me.

1158
01:20:41,471 --> 01:20:43,302
But I totally forgot about it.

1159
01:20:43,303 --> 01:20:45,102
I'm really sorry.

1160
01:20:45,675 --> 01:20:47,151
It's Ok.

1161
01:20:47,184 --> 01:20:50,282
You have more important things
to be worrying about right now.

1162
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:53,024
Also, I didn't have much interest
in Secret Santa anyway.

1163
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:56,109
Everyone else did it, so I was just
a bit intrigued by it, is all...

1164
01:20:56,207 --> 01:20:57,231
it's Ok.

1165
01:20:59,892 --> 01:21:01,391
What do you want as a gift?

1166
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:02,906
I'll buy you anything you want.

1167
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:07,136
No, it's OK.

1168
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,352
Hurry up and tell me.

1169
01:21:09,368 --> 01:21:10,567
I'm counting to three.

1170
01:21:10,989 --> 01:21:12,101
One...

1171
01:21:12,483 --> 01:21:13,592
Gloves!

1172
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,004
Pink gloves. Made of angora.

1173
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:20,409
OK.

1174
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,246
Got it.

1175
01:21:22,429 --> 01:21:24,803
I'll buy you the same ones as my Dad's.

1176
01:21:27,864 --> 01:21:29,492
Hurry and go home. It's cold.

1177
01:21:30,024 --> 01:21:31,292
OK.

1178
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:32,502
Good night.

1179
01:21:32,932 --> 01:21:34,732
You too.

1180
01:21:59,379 --> 01:22:02,901
It's a warm Christmas morning.

1181
01:22:03,233 --> 01:22:06,652
It's two degrees Celsius in Seoul,
it's four degrees in Gwangju and Jeonju.

1182
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:09,437
Meanwhile, it's three degrees
in Southern Chungcheong.

1183
01:22:09,803 --> 01:22:11,973
Gosh... I don't feel too good.

1184
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:16,223
I knew this would happen.
You drank so much yesterday!

1185
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:17,487
Do you want to take some medicine?

1186
01:22:17,488 --> 01:22:21,180
No, it's fine.
I'll just bear it, I guess.

1187
01:22:21,863 --> 01:22:23,888
Anyway... where did the kids go?

1188
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:25,886
I let them sleep in
since it's their holiday.

1189
01:22:26,598 --> 01:22:28,703
I heard it's cold today
but it seems warm.

1190
01:22:29,562 --> 01:22:30,635
Yeah... um...

1191
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:35,832
...did you hear it raining last night,
by any chance? I thought I did.

1192
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:38,317
What rain?
I didn't hear anything.

1193
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:41,335
Last night, there was rain
in the Seoul area.

1194
01:22:41,602 --> 01:22:43,902
There was an abnormal amount
of rain despite the season...

1195
01:22:43,903 --> 01:22:46,101
Wow. You were right!

1196
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,003
You drank so much,
so how did you manage to hear that?

1197
01:22:50,554 --> 01:22:53,203
I'm good like that.

1198
01:22:55,035 --> 01:22:57,002
Still, rain is better than snow.

1199
01:22:57,003 --> 01:23:00,588
Everything cluttering the streets must
have gotten washed away, so it's great...

1200
01:23:36,218 --> 01:23:38,117
Oh dear.

1201
01:23:56,148 --> 01:23:58,475
Oh, gosh... what is this?

1202
01:23:58,597 --> 01:24:00,396
What do we do?

1203
01:24:00,478 --> 01:24:01,478
What about Jin Joo?

1204
01:24:01,518 --> 01:24:03,016
She's still sleeping.

1205
01:24:03,027 --> 01:24:06,326
She'll be so disappointed.
What do we do?

1206
01:24:07,419 --> 01:24:09,427
What else?

1207
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:12,102
We have to try to entice her
with some snacks that she likes.

1208
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:19,102
Is something the matter?

1209
01:24:19,504 --> 01:24:23,702
Oh... Jin Joo asked
for a snowman for Christmas...

1210
01:24:23,703 --> 01:24:25,601
...so we spent all night making her one.

1211
01:24:26,282 --> 01:24:28,002
But it melted.

1212
01:24:28,003 --> 01:24:30,602
It'd be difficult
to re-make it now, right?

1213
01:24:32,341 --> 01:24:35,303
Oh, geez... what do we do?
I feel so bad for her.

1214
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:40,102
She said that she wanted a snowman?

1215
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:44,845
Yeah. Your sister said
she wanted a snowman for Christmas...

1216
01:24:45,317 --> 01:24:48,303
...but it melted.
What do we do now?

1217
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,803
They sell those at Dooly Supermarket.

1218
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:56,391
They sell snowmen
at the Dooly Supermarket.

1219
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,202
What are you talking about?

1220
01:24:58,361 --> 01:25:01,271
Jin Joo calls ice cream "Snowmen."

1221
01:25:05,402 --> 01:25:06,728
Should I go buy some?

1222
01:25:06,743 --> 01:25:07,844
How many?

1223
01:25:12,102 --> 01:25:14,602
Wow, a snowman!

1224
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:24,101
It just may be because of the sons
and daughters of this world...

1225
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:28,303
...that the people of the world began
to have faith in religions...

1226
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:33,203
...due to their parents,
who wished for...

1227
01:25:33,576 --> 01:25:35,676
...their happiness and
well-being above all else.

1228
01:25:40,626 --> 01:25:44,959
God, Buddha, Allah, and Santa
must exist for the sake of...

1229
01:25:45,371 --> 01:25:50,031
...all of the mothers and fathers
in this world...

1230
01:25:50,261 --> 01:25:52,328
...as well as their children.

1231
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:08,069
Duk Seon. For you.

1232
01:26:08,503 --> 01:26:09,703
What is it?

1233
01:26:13,693 --> 01:26:14,891
A present.

1234
01:26:22,947 --> 01:26:25,247
Oh my God!

1235
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,312
When did he even buy these?

1236
01:26:30,457 --> 01:26:32,856
The department stores
are probably not even open yet!

1237
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,201
Is Taek still outside?

1238
01:26:36,902 --> 01:26:38,177
He didn't leave yet, right?

1239
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:40,183
Taek isn't the one
who gave that to me.

1240
01:26:41,744 --> 01:26:44,803
Jung Hwan did.
He says it's your Christmas present.

1241
01:26:49,181 --> 01:26:50,882
He must be out of his mind.

1242
01:27:22,058 --> 01:27:22,984
Darn it.

1243
01:27:23,153 --> 01:27:26,451
I was at the age
when I no longer believed in Santa...

1244
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:28,848
...or felt my heart flutter
because of Secret Santa.

1245
01:27:30,644 --> 01:27:32,927
I was at an age age when a present
that was secretly left behind...

1246
01:27:32,946 --> 01:27:36,845
...or secretly conveyed gentleness
wasn't enough to fulfill my expectations.

1247
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:43,340
Excitement that would probably
escape up to the back of my throat

1248
01:27:43,351 --> 01:27:45,850
...and choke me
if I were to try and suppress it.

1249
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:50,495
Embarrassment that would probably make my
heart explode if I were to admit to it.

1250
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:58,317
I was dying to make it obvious,
but didn't want to get caught.

1251
01:27:58,415 --> 01:28:00,513
That was the excitment we felt
back in 1988.

1252
01:28:00,867 --> 01:28:03,227
We were 18 years old back then.

1253
01:28:28,326 --> 01:28:29,426
You're here today, huh?

1254
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:31,889
Oh... yes.

1255
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,125
That's good.

1256
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:37,510
Ms. Park said that this is for you.

1257
01:28:40,388 --> 01:28:42,286
She said it's your Christmas present.

1258
01:28:42,287 --> 01:28:44,786
It looked like a videotape.

1259
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,387
Anyway, I'll be going now.

1260
01:28:46,388 --> 01:28:49,837
Also, sleep at home
on days like today! OK?

1261
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:52,149
Bye.

1262
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:09,030
Master Choi Taek,
this is my Christmas gift to you.

1263
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:13,103
I'm not sure if you'll like it
but I secretly edited this all night...

1264
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,012
...so please enjoy it!

1265
01:29:15,089 --> 01:29:18,888
It's a special video that doesn't exist
anywhere else in the world!

1266
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:20,492
I hope you have a
Merry Christmas...

1267
01:29:20,503 --> 01:29:23,055
...and that you have
a great record next year!

1268
01:29:23,431 --> 01:29:26,931
From Master Choi Taek's forever-fan,
Park Ji Eun.

1269
01:29:36,883 --> 01:29:38,882
Oh, no... no.

1270
01:29:39,104 --> 01:29:40,765
I'm not good at doing things like that.

1271
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:44,077
Come on. Please? Just once. Just once!

1272
01:29:45,685 --> 01:29:48,703
Well... I don't really
do things like that, so...

1273
01:29:48,714 --> 01:29:50,312
So, I'm sorry.

1274
01:29:50,446 --> 01:29:51,738
Ms. Park,
why are you doing this to me?

1275
01:29:51,763 --> 01:29:53,819
Then, I won't air this part.

1276
01:29:54,294 --> 01:29:57,250
Just consider it practice
and just say it once.

1277
01:30:00,635 --> 01:30:02,234
Without the camera... yes.

1278
01:30:02,608 --> 01:30:04,989
Geez... at times like this,
I don't like you too much, Ms. Park.

1279
01:30:05,286 --> 01:30:08,686
Why? It's because you two
always seem too stoic.

1280
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:11,049
Just say it to me once, as practice!

1281
01:30:11,249 --> 01:30:13,749
Say, "I love you" just once.
OK?

1282
01:30:14,501 --> 01:30:15,942
Well, I can say that... yeah.

1283
01:30:16,002 --> 01:30:18,907
Exactly! What's so hard about it?
Go ahead and say it. Please?

1284
01:30:20,453 --> 01:30:22,053
I love you, son.

1285
01:30:22,226 --> 01:30:24,725
Oh my! You said it so readily, too!

1286
01:30:24,743 --> 01:30:26,082
One more time.

1287
01:30:34,406 --> 01:30:36,106
Just one more time.

1288
01:30:44,344 --> 01:30:46,344
I love you, my son.

1289
01:30:52,025 --> 01:30:54,048
See, you're so good at it!

1290
01:30:54,059 --> 01:30:55,860
You should say it to him
on a regular basis.

1291
01:30:58,721 --> 01:31:02,119
I'm not that good at it,
but you kept asking me to...

1292
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,876
Time continues on.

1293
01:31:03,999 --> 01:31:06,759
That's why time eventually
creates farewells...

1294
01:31:07,154 --> 01:31:10,357
...and it always leaves people
with regrets.

1295
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:12,964
How nice would it be if
you said this to him all the time?

1296
01:31:12,975 --> 01:31:13,751
Oh geez.

1297
01:31:13,762 --> 01:31:15,360
At any rate, you were great today!

1298
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,291
Ah, yes...

1299
01:31:17,835 --> 01:31:19,512
-Oh, the camera.
-Thank you!

1300
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:22,341
If you love someone,
you have to tell them now...

1301
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:29,241
...before your fleeting days
become filled with regret.

1302
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:34,432
In some ways, the biggest present
that time leaves us with...

1303
01:31:34,595 --> 01:31:36,994
...is the memories we have
of loving others.

1304
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:40,802
That's why you have
to shove embarrassment aside...

1305
01:31:40,977 --> 01:31:45,139
...and confess your love
to the one you love...

1306
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:46,917
...before it's too late.

1307
01:31:50,449 --> 01:31:52,185
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1308
01:31:52,897 --> 01:31:53,997
It wasn't you?

1309
01:31:54,316 --> 01:31:55,990
I'm going to tell Mom everything!

1310
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:57,740
Mom...

1311
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:00,313
Fix the color of that hair
of yours first, girl!

1312
01:32:00,711 --> 01:32:03,711
It wasn't me, Mom!
It really wasn't me!

1313
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:10,170
Well... if you like Sung Bo Ra,
you're not exactly of sound mind.

1314
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:12,818
Hi, Bo Ra.

1315
01:32:13,564 --> 01:32:15,519
-That's "Hello" to you, punk.
-Hello.

1316
01:32:24,634 --> 01:32:25,467
What are you doing?

1317
01:32:26,078 --> 01:32:27,277
I'll give you all of this.

1318
01:32:27,715 --> 01:32:29,413
I don't need it anymore.

1319
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,519
If only it wasn't for that surgery...

1320
01:32:32,688 --> 01:32:34,325
Jung Bong, it's Mom.

1321
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:39,085
Mom is so strong...

1322
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,850
...but her son's body is so weak...
