1
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:38,888
December, 1994
Seoul, Dongbong-gu, Ssangmundong

2
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,091
Wow, what are you? A stalker?

3
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:00,382
Yes. You just figured that out?

4
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:02,123
Seriously, how did you know?

5
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:05,288
You said you were on your way,
so I came out... just in case.

6
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,386
This just means that I care.

7
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:10,535
Let's go.

8
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,768
What would you have done
if I wasn't here?

9
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:15,488
I probably would've run.

10
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:23,274
Your parents are doing well, right?

11
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,530
They're doing so well.

12
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:27,582
How so?

13
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:30,445
Mom, Jin Joo, and Taek's dad.

14
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:35,992
They're all doing well enough
to be completely happy, even without me.

15
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,049
Are you planning on going somewhere?

16
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,297
If I get married,
I have to leave the household.

17
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:44,958
You're getting married?

18
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:46,807
Yes. You didn't know?

19
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,543
I'm going to do it quickly,
before my girlfriend gets any older.

20
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:53,063
Hey!

21
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:56,867
What? Why are you getting upset?
Who said it was you?

22
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,157
You want to die?

23
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:01,548
I'm not going to marry you.
Stop dreaming.

24
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,768
I'm in a rush, that's why.

25
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:08,588
Once I'm an intern,
things will be so hectic.

26
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:11,538
I don't want to worry about getting
married while we're both so busy.

27
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:16,008
As long as you're OK with it,
I'd like to get married next year.

28
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:24,595
Don't worry. We won't rush.

29
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:32,658
You know that there are many
obstacles to overcome, right?

30
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:37,688
I know that
and I'll take care of them.

31
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:41,538
You stay by my side, and don't even
dare think about running away.

32
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:45,741
Just like this, OK?

33
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:02,512
Duk Seon?

34
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:04,753
What?

35
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:06,867
Did you eat too many oranges?

36
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,237
That only works
for Lee Young Ae.

37
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,921
Why are your lips orange?

38
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:14,118
I'm just trying it out!

39
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,283
Just once, you can't keep
your opinion to yourself?

40
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:18,684
Please, please, stop
copying celebrities on TV.

41
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,057
Be remotely sensible.

42
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,407
But I was told it looked pretty...

43
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:27,392
Bring him here. Bring him here.
I have to know, which lunatic said that?

44
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:29,232
It's pretty.

45
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:32,578
Are they really OK?
This is Lee Young Ae's lipstick.

46
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,949
You look prettier than Lee Young Ae.

47
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,058
Do you even know who Lee Young Ae is?

48
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,792
You're still really pretty.

49
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:43,731
You remember that we have
a movie date tomorrow?

50
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:44,922
You can't bail.

51
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,054
You're the one who shouldn't bail,
like you did last time.

52
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,402
OK.

53
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:58,232
Hi, Jin Joo!
Are you coming back from school?

54
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,968
Hi, Duk Seon.

55
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:03,451
What are you doing here with Taek?

56
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:04,697
What do you mean?

57
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,232
We're just talking.

58
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:10,752
I'll tell you everything later, Jin Joo.

59
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:13,082
What's there to tell her?

60
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:15,992
Woah! What's wrong with your lips?

61
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:19,432
That color is super weird.

62
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:32,642
It's not weird.

63
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,863
Sung Duk Seon, you're home early.

64
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,138
-Yeah.
-Bo Ra, is it raining out?

65
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:42,216
Yeah.

66
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,488
Where did you get that umbrella?
You're lucky you had that.

67
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,811
What is that?
Wipe that off your lips.

68
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:53,122
It's really weird.

69
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,289
Where are Mom and Dad?

70
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,597
Upstairs.

71
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,610
Why? Are they having another meeting?

72
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:12,348
Yes, it's a very important meeting.

73
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:13,703
About what?

74
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,838
They're deciding, together,
where we should move.

75
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:18,697
They're moving too?

76
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,448
Yeah, they are.

77
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:24,990
Really? I guess they would get bored,
if we all split up.

78
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:27,343
Where are we moving, anyway?

79
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:28,619
I don't know.

80
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,939
Dad is making the decision.

81
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:35,035
That retirement money
is just a one-time payment.

82
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:38,851
It would be smart to spend
that money on a good house.

83
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,741
Gangnam! I say Gangnam.

84
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,908
Before I die,
I want to live in Gangnam.

85
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,577
Fine! I say Gangnam too!
We're going to Gangnam!

86
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:48,991
Il Hwa, start packing our things.

87
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,264
You can't go to Gangnam!

88
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,780
Why is that?

89
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,571
200 million won will barely get you
a 20 pyeong apartment in Gangnam.

90
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,878
Not even a new apartment.
An old, raggedy one.

91
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,239
And we won't even have 200 million won.

92
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,743
If we want money to marry off
Bo Ra and Duk Seon...

93
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,551
...we'll need to set aside some money too.

94
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:14,346
If we only have about 150 million won
left over, Gangnam won't be an option.

95
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,761
Then go with us.

96
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,996
Yeah, we should go there together!

97
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:23,139
We can't live alone. It'll be lonely.

98
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,328
The same way we do now, we
can rely on each other.

99
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,074
It'll be so nice and cozy.

100
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,146
Where was that again?

101
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,146
I heard it mentioned,
but I forgot again.

102
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:35,342
Even if it's
one million won per square meter...

103
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,317
It's too far. If you want to go to Seoul,
it'd be better to leave from Daejeon.

104
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:44,899
Oh, Bo Ra's dad, what reason would
we have to be busy at this age, huh?

105
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,129
We can buy 100 pyeong of land and have
a bit of grass to enjoy for ourselves.

106
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:52,172
We can barbecue, and stuff like that.

107
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,116
Let's relax and live our lives.

108
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,690
This is my last opportunity
to change my life for the better!

109
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:01,651
Grass and barbecue are not
entering my brain!

110
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,409
This is something I'm going
to have to think about.

111
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:08,026
How can you change your life
with 150 million won?

112
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,766
Maybe you could've tried
that in the 1980's.

113
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:12,865
Move somewhere quiet
and let's all just live in peace.

114
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:18,286
I want to be somewhere where my wife
can enjoy nice mountains, and the water.

115
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:21,036
But, you never know.
It could be a good investment.

116
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,927
Let's go. Let's go together, Bo Ra's dad.

117
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,978
All right, but I keep asking you!
Where is this place?

118
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:31,687
Oh, well, you have to take
the express bus.

119
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,289
And when you come up from Busan,
you know that place you always see?

120
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,670
Just before the toll gate.

121
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:39,719
Bangyo.

122
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,316
Bangyo.

123
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,488
Think about it. You still have time.

124
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,174
You were always a careful man.

125
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:53,488
I made my decision right away,
you know, in a manly way.

126
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,717
But everybody is different.

127
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,358
I've made my decision.

128
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,152
What is it? I'm in.
Do you feel the same way?

129
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:05,351
That's right. I've made my decision.

130
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:22,152
Episode 20. Goodbye, My Youth.
Goodbye, Ssangmundong.

131
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,054
One, two, three.

132
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:17,482
I took the bus, and we hit
traffic right before I got here.

133
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,984
Have you been waiting a long time?

134
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:22,267
You should have taken your time.
I just got here too.

135
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,076
It didn't start yet, did it?

136
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,602
It probably just started.

137
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:30,113
Why didn't you say so? Let's go in.

138
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,100
Hey...

139
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,750
Man Ok, you haven't forgotten about
the late night snacks for tonight, right?

140
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,606
How good is this kimbap,
that you're making such a big deal?

141
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,831
They sell it on the streets.

142
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,001
But it tastes as good as food
in a premium hotel.

143
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:56,161
OK, then I'll meet you in front
of the subway station entrance.

144
00:10:56,831 --> 00:11:00,819
Man Ok, we might not
be able to find each other.

145
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,010
So, let's meet
at Shinsegae Department Store.

146
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,621
OK, then I'll see you there.

147
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,821
Yes, see you.

148
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:19,396
Dad, where's Mom?

149
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,736
She's not back yet.

150
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,464
She knew you were coming home, so she
went grocery shopping. She's not back.

151
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,675
She's probably buying lots of stuff.

152
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:28,866
Jung Hwan, grab me some fruit punch.

153
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:36,526
Son, that thing that's floating
in the fruit punch...

154
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,746
...is that, "self-confidence"?

155
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:46,302
Oh! Is this the book
you're reading these days?

156
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:51,365
Jung Hwan... Jung Hwan, where did you go?

157
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,082
Jung Hwan! Jung Hwan!

158
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,296
I still have "uneasiness"...

159
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,514
.."truthfulness" and "are you going
to open up the tummy?"

160
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,675
I haven't even done that joke yet!

161
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:02,418
Jung Hwan!

162
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,851
Sun Woo, what are you doing?

163
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,612
Oh, I'm going to meet Bo Ra for a bit.

164
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,260
I'll see you later tonight.

165
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:16,086
Wow, Bo Ra.
I still can't get used to that.

166
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,562
I'll see you later, at Taek's. Loyalty.

167
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:21,604
It's victory, you punk! Victory!

168
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:28,024
Where do they meet, anyway?
Their mothers flock all over the place.

169
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:32,906
Whatever, they take care of themselves.
I don't care about it.

170
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,620
Jung Hwan is here?

171
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,208
Yeah, we're going to meet
for drinks in Taek's room.

172
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,469
-Come with me.
-Forget it.

173
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:42,206
Sung Duk Seon will be there too.

174
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,996
Of course, Duk Seon is my friend.

175
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,273
Sung Duk Seon is holding back very well.

176
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,960
She hasn't said anything to me at all.

177
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,796
Duk Seon can be full of surprises.

178
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,243
She can be clumsy,
but she's such a nice person.

179
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:01,282
Why do you know more
about my sister than I do?

180
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:07,446
Get a move on it. We'll run into some
parents, if we keep testing our luck.

181
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:25,962
Thank you.

182
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,380
You heard?

183
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,583
I heard.

184
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,270
Why...

185
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:45,418
Why, and how, did it end up
being Sung Sun Woo?

186
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:26,516
Those two?

187
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,153
I'm so surprised too.

188
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:34,832
They are just going crazy
inside of that household.

189
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:38,476
It's not like they're asking
to get married yet.

190
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,760
And plus, lately, isn't marrying someone
with the same last name OK?

191
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,976
Even your cousin did it.

192
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,271
They got married too.

193
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:48,612
Their last name is Kim!

194
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:51,412
If you throw rocks at random people,
two out of three would be a Kim.

195
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:55,260
But both their last names are Sung.

196
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:58,952
Count the degrees of separation in their
relationship. They're like strangers!

197
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,429
I guess.

198
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:06,373
What a mess! And between people
who see each other all the time?

199
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,630
You should have been careful.

200
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,765
How is Bo Ra doing?

201
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,553
Tell her to come here.

202
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:21,166
She'll say that
she isn't leaving her room.

203
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,985
If I were here, I would have
run away to my friend's place.

204
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:27,324
Sun Woo told her to come out
but she chose to stay home.

205
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,495
Sung Bo Ra is strong.

206
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:34,074
You guys got caught?

207
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,034
Why is the mood so stern in here?

208
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,170
Wasn't everyone going to find out
eventually, anyway?

209
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,212
They just found out what they
would've had to know later.

210
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,771
Yeah, Dong Ryong is right.

211
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,796
You would have told them anyway.

212
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:49,013
You can tell both sets of parents
and date each other officially.

213
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,374
It's not like you're in high school.

214
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,669
Lots of people with the same
last name get married.

215
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,170
They're saying the laws
are going to change too.

216
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,841
Duk Seon, how do you feel about
having Sun Woo be your brother-in-law?

217
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:01,911
Hey, are you going to marry Sung Bo Ra?

218
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:06,864
-Oh, wow! Sung Sun Woo.
-Wow...

219
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,213
Sun Woo, that charisma.

220
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,479
How are you going to convince your mom?

221
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,160
You've never rebelled against your mom.

222
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,330
Yeah, I'm more worried about you
than I am about Sung Bo Ra.

223
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,350
Yeah, our Sun Woo must
have a lot of worries.

224
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:23,567
He'll do just fine.

225
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,404
I'll take care of my
life just fine...

226
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,561
...so you guys take care of yours.

227
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:30,852
-Oh!
-Oh!

228
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:32,581
Do you really have the confidence?

229
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,015
Be strong.

230
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,108
Don't turn around. I'm embarrassed.

231
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:33,544
Jung Hwan, is your brother still out?

232
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,295
He just called to say
that he would be here.

233
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:39,256
-Don't worry.
-OK.

234
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,111
Do you know your brother?

235
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,255
Has he completely given up
on his entrance exams for law school?

236
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,960
Yes.

237
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,943
OK, thanks for giving me
an honest answer.

238
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,967
-Go inside, sleep.
-OK.

239
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,133
Mom.

240
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:05,041
Yeah, what?

241
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:06,936
Are you OK?

242
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,724
Of course.

243
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,331
Why is Jung Bong going out
for snacks this late at night?

244
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:30,708
Thank you for this.
I'm sure it took a long time to make.

245
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:35,223
I was happy during that time,
so it's OK.

246
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,938
But are kimbap restaurants
open at this hour?

247
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,415
They open at night,
and close early in the morning.

248
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:44,183
It's where these food vendors
and restaurant owners eat.

249
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:47,146
It's ark shell kimbap, this big,
served with soup!

250
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:49,047
It's the perfect combination!

251
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,868
Man Ok, you live in such a big house.

252
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,954
I never thought you would
like places like this.

253
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:00,480
Oh, no! I totally like places like this.

254
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,261
I grew up eating vendor food at markets.

255
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,797
I'll tell you all about it later.

256
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:09,941
OK.

257
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:40,290
Oh. this. Lots of people ask
me about this one...

258
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:42,027
I'll take this one, OK?

259
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:45,642
-Do you need anything else?
-No, I need four...

260
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:55,289
Sir, you,  know about Burberry, right?

261
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:57,783
Mi Ran.

262
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:02,131
Should we take a walk
around the neighborhood?

263
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:08,758
Let's get some air.

264
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:18,965
Ah, it's really nice
to get some air, isn't it?

265
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:22,984
Honey.

266
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:27,291
Jung Bong, gave up on
his law entrance exams.

267
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:32,288
I never had any expectations,
to begin with.

268
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,584
The fact that he got into college,
whether on this seventh try or not...

269
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,893
I have no greed for that
anymore, not at all.

270
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,827
Jung Bong is just a bit
slower than others.

271
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:51,239
I think that Jung Bong will find his
own path to making a living.

272
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:54,393
I think so too.

273
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,503
He's just so much slower!

274
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,441
Oh, boy...

275
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,240
But our kids, they sure are good kids.

276
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,563
Do you happen to remember this?

277
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,304
You know, when you used to deliver
black bean noodles?

278
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:21,645
You saw Jung Bong and Jung Hwan
playing in the street with friends.

279
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,767
You tried to run away, just in case
the kids were embarrassed of you.

280
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:29,547
But Jung Bong grabbed Jung Hwan's
hand, shouted "Dad!" and hugged you.

281
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:32,503
Yeah, I remember that.

282
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:38,456
You came home that night,
crying and laughing.

283
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:41,287
You had tears and a runny nose.

284
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:42,881
And you told me about it all night.

285
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,030
Were you that happy?

286
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:54,073
Yes. My throat gets dry,
even when I think about it now.

287
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:59,981
I expected them to be ashamed to see
their dad holding black bean noodles.

288
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:05,740
They said "Dad!" and ran over to hug me.

289
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,070
How could I not be happy?

290
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:12,676
That was my happiest day ever.

291
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,617
What child could be
ashamed of their parents?

292
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,005
That's not a proper child.

293
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:21,326
Right?

294
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:25,111
But, I noticed, in life,
that isn't always the case.

295
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,894
We've just been very blessed.

296
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:32,191
We lived in that one bedroom shoe box
next to Teacher Yoo's house.

297
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:36,731
Jung Bong used to cry all night,
yelling that he was in pain.

298
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:39,215
Our next day's rice would run out.

299
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:46,812
Occasionally, I would wonder if we should
light the stove up and die from the gas.

300
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:50,243
I had a lot of terrible thoughts.

301
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:57,895
But, I endured every day by looking
at the faces of our great kids.

302
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:02,482
I think I survived because of our kids.

303
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:08,003
I didn't raise the kids.
I think they raised me.

304
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:11,357
I raised you.

305
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,431
I raised you!

306
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,022
Then, we raised each other.

307
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,452
Good. We did good.

308
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,229
We did good.

309
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,537
Good, good. We did good.

310
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,898
That's why you're my husband.

311
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:39,031
-You can come back in an hour.
-Yes, all right.

312
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,601
-Bye, now!
-OK.

313
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:46,917
Dad.

314
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,407
Your daughter is here.

315
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,849
Is my bad daughter here?

316
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,920
What bad daughter...

317
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,109
Dad, this is my boyfriend.

318
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:16,836
Oh.

319
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:22,200
My dad built all of this from scratch
with no help at all.

320
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,791
He has two more stores in Dongdaemun.

321
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:30,779
When he first came to Seoul,
he had 30,000 won.

322
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:34,912
But now, they say Seoul's textile
market couldn't run without my dad.

323
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:37,509
Wow, you're amazing.

324
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:40,997
In my eyes, you're like
the Bill Gates of Korea.

325
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:44,310
You have truly built yourself
from the ground up, on your own.

326
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,318
You are really very cool.

327
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,876
I'm a bit better than Bill Gates.

328
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,173
Bill Gates can speak English.

329
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:59,561
I didn't learn English, Japanese,
or Chinese but look at me now.

330
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:02,491
I sell to the Americans
and to the Japanese.

331
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:04,665
So, I am better.

332
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:09,706
Did Bill Gates only graduate
from elementary school, like me?

333
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:11,666
He went to Harvard.

334
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,470
He's a smart man.

335
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:17,205
That's why, you are better!

336
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:19,145
You are really, the best!

337
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:20,225
Yeah.

338
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:23,164
Yeah, it's cold!

339
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:26,465
I'll get you something yummy.
There's great kimbap at Namdaemun.

340
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:27,923
Their soup is great too.

341
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:29,794
-Thank you, Sir.
-Hold on.

342
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:34,223
Your voice sounds familiar.

343
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,757
Have we spoken on the phone before?

344
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,129
Is this the guy you dated in high school?

345
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,525
I'm certain that this is the voice
from the phone.

346
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,727
Dad, it's cold. Let go inside.

347
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,968
-Right? Let's hurry up.
-We'll go in now.

348
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,335
-Wow, it's cold.
-I'm right.

349
00:27:57,697 --> 00:28:00,607
It's you, isn't it? Come here!

350
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,432
What are you doing?
You're taking a part-time job?

351
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:17,488
Yes.

352
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:22,185
What about your exams?
You're giving up on them?

353
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,919
I don't think that's the path for me.

354
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,875
It's important that you find
something that you want to do.

355
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:34,987
I approve.

356
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:44,361
I want to work, and build experience.

357
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,480
I've been taking allowance
from you, at this age.

358
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,805
From now on,
I want to take care of myself.

359
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:55,432
There is something
that I really want to do.

360
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:59,198
Once I have things organized,
I'll tell you about it.

361
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,426
He's giving up on the entrance exams?

362
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:08,844
Yes.

363
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,948
He's already given
up, completely.

364
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,300
He's working at the pub near us.

365
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:20,423
Geez! What a waste of the time
he already spent studying for them.

366
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:26,828
Even if it took some extra time,
I had faith Jung Bong would get it done.

367
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,989
He sticks with things.
He's very persistent.

368
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:34,254
Well, it's not something that
just any person can pass.

369
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:37,385
Bo Ra was special.

370
00:29:41,753 --> 00:29:43,847
How about we play Go-Stop?
It's been a while.

371
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:45,991
Yes, why not?

372
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,207
I'm too tired to make dinner.

373
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,297
Let's ask Jung Bong to make
kimchi stir-fry rice.

374
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,888
Why don't the three of us
warm up our hands?

375
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,680
Come on, lady.

376
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:03,837
I can't play Go-Stop
with Sun Young right now.

377
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:08,121
-Oh, man...
-Oh...

378
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,013
Bo Ra's mom.

379
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,264
The same last name thing...
it's really nothing!

380
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:17,773
What do you call it? It's one of those
rules that doesn't get enforced.

381
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,170
And either way,
the law is going to be changed.

382
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:24,696
But you can't register the marriage.

383
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,151
And if a baby is born,
the birth can't be registered.

384
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:28,892
I just don't like it at all.

385
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,957
I told you! The law will be changed!

386
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,476
Do you dislike Sun Woo, by chance?

387
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:39,734
Oh, no! Where can you find a boy
like Sun Woo?

388
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:42,481
Then just give the "OK"!

389
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,202
It's very uncomfortable to be living
on the same street through this.

390
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,026
I was going to relieve the pain from my
menopause with Go-stop. This is annoying.

391
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:53,307
Everyone else thinks it's OK!

392
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,803
Even my aunt, who is over 70,
thinks it's OK.

393
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,997
Why are you no better than
a grandma who is 70 years old?

394
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:00,627
So frustrating...

395
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,313
Take more medicine.
Quit being a problem.

396
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,120
What about dinner?

397
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,031
With who?

398
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,299
She's the friend who introduced
you to Trash, right?

399
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:20,703
Tell her that next time, I'll treat her.

400
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:23,659
If you think about it,
I should be most thankful to her.

401
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:27,671
Yeah...

402
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,180
I'm going to talk to them today.

403
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:35,525
You can't... run away again.

404
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,890
I'll take care of everything,
so trust me and follow my lead.

405
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:42,765
I'll talk to your parents too, OK?

406
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:45,084
Just take care of yourself.

407
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:47,213
I'll take care of my house.

408
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:51,415
I'll talk to my parents
and I'll convince them.

409
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,199
Just worry about yourself.

410
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:21,542
Taek is going to be late today, right?

411
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:25,991
Yes, he has a competition today,
tomorrow and the day after that.

412
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,990
I'm home.

413
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:34,041
Sun Woo, what brings you here today?

414
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:37,308
I wanted to talk to you guys.

415
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:54,663
Mom, please give me your permission.

416
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:58,455
I want to marry Bo Ra.

417
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:00,428
Give us your blessing.

418
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:14,736
Sun Woo.

419
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:20,434
Let's not be too rash.

420
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,104
I'm not completely saying no, either.

421
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:29,908
But, you're not finished
with your studies.

422
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:31,735
You have to graduate.

423
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,320
You still have lots of things left to do.

424
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,240
And regarding you and Bo Ra right now...

425
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,760
You two make like each other so much,
that you aren't seeing straight.

426
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:47,592
You don't know what will happen later.

427
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:52,964
So, take it slowly, OK? Slowly...

428
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,550
Let's take our time, thinking about this.

429
00:33:57,189 --> 00:33:58,209
Mom.

430
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,319
I've been seeing Bo Ra for six years.

431
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,653
It's not a passing feeling.

432
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:20,975
And I'm not coming to talk to you
because I want to get married right now.

433
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:26,675
I want to date Bo Ra with marriage
in our future plans.

434
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:31,140
I want your permission first, so that
we can officially date.

435
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:33,303
Mom.

436
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:38,423
Until now, I've never done something
you've told me not to do.

437
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,028
Even with college and my major...

438
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,233
I did everything you wanted me to do.

439
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,672
I don't regret any of it!

440
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,790
But, with my marriage, at least...

441
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:53,583
I want it to be with the person I love.

442
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,320
Mom, can you let go
of the way you feel, just this once?

443
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,242
I'm going back to the hospital.

444
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:47,536
I'm leaving. No need to come out.

445
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:49,812
Jung Hwan, Jung Hwan.

446
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,213
What about your car keys?

447
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:53,578
Be careful, driving out there.

448
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,642
If you get sleepy, make sure
to pull over at a rest stop, OK?

449
00:35:57,653 --> 00:35:59,787
Geez, you do this every time I'm here.

450
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,133
I'm here all the time.

451
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,718
Am I a guest, or something?

452
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,428
Children all become guests
as they get grown up.

453
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:07,375
Is the car OK?

454
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:08,536
You have gas?

455
00:36:09,423 --> 00:36:12,483
The car is just fine
and I have a full tank of gas.

456
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:16,384
Your guest will be leaving now,
so please take care of your health.

457
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:18,950
Don't worry about your mom
and take care of yourself.

458
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,953
You'll get there late, at this rate.
Get going, get going!

459
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:24,774
Bye.

460
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:33,236
-Hurry up! You'll be late!
-Go back inside.

461
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,724
Wait, your car...
You have to drive to Sacheon.

462
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,303
My car is broken. I'm taking the bus.

463
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:40,008
I'll sleep on the way.

464
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:44,271
Sun Young.

465
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:51,183
I'm not saying this lightly
because he isn't my birth son.

466
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:54,821
Don't take it the wrong way,
and just listen.

467
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:01,419
Taek... when Taek first said
he wanted to play baduk...

468
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:05,940
...do you remember how much I opposed it?

469
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,630
Yes, I remember.

470
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:17,069
Bo Ra's dad went to the baduk club
and he wanted to take Duk Seon.

471
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:24,163
But, Duk Seon, that girl would run after
the sterilizing trucks all the time.

472
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:28,407
So, Taek ended up tagging along.

473
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:33,609
If you think about it...

474
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,002
life sure works out in strange ways.

475
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,240
It sure does.

476
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,515
Bo Ra's dad...

477
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:46,677
...tried to convince me to turn Taek
into the second Cho Hoon Hyun.

478
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,004
So, I let him do it, just for a month.

479
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,660
But, my goodness...

480
00:39:51,874 --> 00:39:55,522
It felt like he was going to live
his life glued to the baduk board.

481
00:39:56,629 --> 00:40:02,829
So, that day, I threw out
the board and all of the stones.

482
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,317
But...

483
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:11,227
Maybe it was the next day,
I thought he was sleeping.

484
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,341
So, I opened the door.

485
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:17,243
He was in his room,
looking at the board, secretly.

486
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:20,927
I did throw it away.

487
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:24,689
He managed to sneak it back in.

488
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:27,734
He was so terrified that
he was going to get in trouble.

489
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:30,596
His eyes were riddled with shock.

490
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,710
Even at that moment, still, he fought
so hard to not lose that board.

491
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:39,367
How could I win with a child like that?

492
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:43,795
That day, I forced myself
to close my eyes.

493
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,748
I let him play baduk.

494
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:52,481
I didn't have enough confidence in him
to support him on my own, with baduk.

495
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:58,721
And I wanted my child
to be somewhat normal.

496
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,485
But that was all my greed.

497
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:06,635
Children don't do
what we want them to do.

498
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:15,144
Do you think you can win over Sun Woo?

499
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:22,213
And even if you do win,
will it be a real victory?

500
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:25,464
Parents can't win over their children.

501
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:30,513
He didn't say a single thing wrong.

502
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:31,681
Not a single thing.

503
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:45,835
Mom, I'm home.

504
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,710
Why are you here so late?

505
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:04,841
Mom.

506
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:07,763
Dad.

507
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:15,893
I... want to marry Sun Woo.

508
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:21,103
I'm hoping for your blessing.

509
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:27,839
You can't.

510
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,959
You two have the same last name.

511
00:42:33,014 --> 00:42:36,952
If you get married,
you won't be registered as married!

512
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:39,448
It will say "Cohabitant"!
That's what it will say!

513
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:43,722
If your grandmother was alive,
she would faint right here and now!

514
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:45,886
It can never happen.

515
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:50,323
Dad?

516
00:42:50,855 --> 00:42:52,274
How about you, Dad?
Do you feel that way too?

517
00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:00,470
It's not because you
don't like Sun Woo, is it?

518
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:04,854
Sun Woo is not the problem.
Who said that he was the problem?

519
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:07,661
Then, is it because
he's younger than me?

520
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:13,635
Your mom and dad
are not that conservative.

521
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:16,732
Then, it's just because of the law?

522
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:24,550
Then, if there are no legal issues,
you would give us your blessings?

523
00:43:29,249 --> 00:43:33,816
Next year, they're going to temporarily
allow same last name marriages.

524
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:37,066
Congress is preparing the bill now.

525
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,239
Then, are you going
to live with him for a year?

526
00:43:44,493 --> 00:43:46,948
What happens if you have a baby? Huh?

527
00:43:47,135 --> 00:43:48,919
You can't even register
the birth of the baby.

528
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:50,822
What will you do then?

529
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:54,130
Next year, they will temporarily
allow these marriages.

530
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:59,843
And there's discussion of making
that change permanent.

531
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:02,647
It's a certainty.

532
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,741
That law will no longer exist.

533
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,401
Sun Woo and I can't get married
right away anyway.

534
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:21,762
Next year, when I'm done
with my training...

535
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:25,045
...and Sun Woo finishes his fourth year...

536
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,670
...we'll get married then.

537
00:44:29,495 --> 00:44:31,705
There won't be any legal issues then.

538
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:35,818
Have I ever disappointed you guys?

539
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:39,332
I can live happily with Sun Woo.

540
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:42,731
Mom.

541
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:46,374
Dad.

542
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:50,741
Trust me... this time too.

543
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,399
Oh, my...

544
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:23,863
I wonder whose daughter that is.

545
00:45:24,563 --> 00:45:26,563
She sure is smart.

546
00:45:45,093 --> 00:45:47,911
Lady, it's the middle of Winter!

547
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:49,832
Why is the door wide open?

548
00:45:50,177 --> 00:45:52,457
My insides feel like
the middle of Summer.

549
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,095
Wow, that looks so tasty!

550
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:58,006
Where's your husband?

551
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,510
That's so good.

552
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:02,248
He'll be here.

553
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:05,055
Lady, where's the kimchi?

554
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:07,756
Kimchi? You can use the seasoning.

555
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,285
Still, noodles need sliced up kimchi
to make them even tastier!

556
00:46:13,296 --> 00:46:16,406
Oh, wow, it smells so good!

557
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,310
-You're here?
-Yes.

558
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,185
How did you know to bring the kimchi?

559
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:27,616
You need it to make good noodles.

560
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:32,868
Geez.

561
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:43,829
What are you doing?
Dig into the noodles.

562
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:56,342
I'm sleepy again.

563
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:05,778
Are Cha In Pyo
and Shin Ae Ra getting married?

564
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:07,374
Didn't Cha In Pyo go to the army?

565
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:11,576
They're getting married once
In Pyo "Oppa" comes out.

566
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:15,684
I've known that they had something
going on since "Star in My Heart".

567
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:18,121
That look in their eyes,
that wasn't acting.

568
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,814
Why is he your "Oppa" again?

569
00:47:22,912 --> 00:47:24,892
Because he's good-looking.

570
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:31,065
Should I put a lot of kimchi in yours?

571
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,310
Yes, lots on mine.

572
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:37,819
That's good. Too much.

573
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:43,526
Geez, why aren't these boys coming?

574
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:45,032
Boys?

575
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:46,539
You know.

576
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,308
The watch store boy,
the Hanil Bank boy.

577
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,729
President Kim boy.

578
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,300
I was wondering who you
were referring to.

579
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:05,069
Those big men...
They really don't listen.

580
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:07,819
I told him to come.
He should hurry up!

581
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,125
Sun Young, do you want lots of peppers?

582
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:12,976
Not in mine. Put lots in Moo Sung's.

583
00:48:13,546 --> 00:48:18,266
Don't give him that much! Why?
Does he not have strength?

584
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:20,148
Why are you giving him so many peppers?

585
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,857
Her husband eats a lot!

586
00:48:21,868 --> 00:48:23,767
It's good for men.

587
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:27,138
How do you know what's good for men?

588
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,360
You're going to tire him out!

589
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,251
More, please!

590
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,165
Where is Moo Sung's?

591
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:41,805
The neighborhood is quiet.

592
00:48:42,097 --> 00:48:44,867
Yeah, all the kids have grown up,
and now they're all gone.

593
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:47,282
Where's Jin Joo?

594
00:48:47,502 --> 00:48:48,837
She's at school.

595
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:54,112
If Jin Joo weren't around,
this place would be a nursing home.

596
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:59,445
By the way, I haven't seen Taek
yesterday or today.

597
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:00,771
Does he have a big match?

598
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:02,591
He started a new competition.

599
00:49:03,268 --> 00:49:04,738
This?

600
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:07,499
That's right.

601
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:11,010
You should eat lots, grow up,
and win something too.

602
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:16,834
When I saw Taek,
his face looked very tired.

603
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:22,635
Yes, so why did you have to get
him all excited about this?

604
00:49:22,786 --> 00:49:25,678
Oh? What are you talking about?

605
00:49:25,985 --> 00:49:27,649
Bo Ra's dad, do you have menopause too?

606
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,170
You're losing memories.

607
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,398
Mom! Dad!

608
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:34,279
Taek has a dating scandal!

609
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:36,764
This is one side of the picture.

610
00:49:38,094 --> 00:49:39,089
With who?

611
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,660
Is it an actress?

612
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,297
Don't be surprised.

613
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:50,377
Amazing, right? Shocking, isn't it?

614
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:54,287
-Hey...
-Come on, that's a mistake.

615
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,861
You're overreacting.

616
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:58,483
They do hold hands often.

617
00:49:58,494 --> 00:50:01,129
Yeah but Duk Seon looks good
in this photo.

618
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:02,844
They watch movies together often too.

619
00:50:02,855 --> 00:50:06,005
My daughter looks so cute. So pretty.

620
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,143
They used to take baths together
when they were younger.

621
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:11,664
That's something new, isn't it?
What's that writer going to do?

622
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:17,991
Look at our Duk Seon.

623
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,322
Who's that? Duk Seon!

624
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,130
Hello.

625
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:40,069
Master Choi is done. He'll be out soon.

626
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:42,087
It took 13 hours today.

627
00:50:42,346 --> 00:50:43,716
13 hours?

628
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,321
He's nearly dead right now.

629
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:48,523
I feel sorry for him.

630
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:51,861
He still won though.

631
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:53,900
He beat him, in the end.

632
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,798
He suffered, but it was all worth it.

633
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:02,120
What?

634
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:04,380
His girlfriend came to wait for him.

635
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:10,354
He told Director Yoo and I about you.

636
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:15,297
Thank you.

637
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:18,437
For what, Sir?

638
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:22,993
Just because... thank you.

639
00:51:24,453 --> 00:51:28,713
But... you two should have been careful.

640
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,880
What will you do about today's scandal?

641
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:33,555
Does Taek know too?

642
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:36,317
He heard right away after the match
from the reporters.

643
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:39,321
You know Choi Taek's personality, right?

644
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,651
Just acknowledge it to everyone.

645
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,047
It is the truth.

646
00:51:44,106 --> 00:51:47,522
Anyway, you're here, Duk Seon...

647
00:51:47,923 --> 00:51:51,861
I'm going to go home now.

648
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,101
Take him home safely.

649
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,803
OK, bye.

650
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,753
This isn't a dream, is it?

651
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:25,719
What kind of baduk match takes 13 hours?

652
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,239
I know.

653
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:31,004
You worked hard.

654
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,579
Yeah, you too.

655
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:49,364
Do as I say, OK?

656
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:55,113
Both sides are having a hard enough time
with Sun Woo and Bo Ra.

657
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,200
If they find out about us too...

658
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,220
...they'll be traumatized.

659
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:14,295
So, tell them that the scandal
from today's paper is not true, OK?

660
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:19,559
No. I won't lie.

661
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,834
I kept it in for six years.

662
00:53:25,377 --> 00:53:26,610
I don't want to anymore.

663
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:34,674
Once some time passes...

664
00:53:36,276 --> 00:53:39,006
we can take a look at the situation
and then we can tell them.

665
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:43,092
Both your parents and mine.

666
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:46,538
They're people who would
be more than willing to listen to us.

667
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:49,535
But, right now...

668
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,091
...it's not the time.

669
00:54:05,427 --> 00:54:07,627
I'm confident my feelings won't change.

670
00:54:12,057 --> 00:54:13,267
Aren't you?

671
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:19,976
When is Taek coming back?

672
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:21,782
He should be here soon.

673
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:23,957
You should ask him, at least.

674
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:28,159
But it just can't be.
That wouldn't happen.

675
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,949
I'm telling you, it's true.
There's something funny about those two.

676
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,510
Hey, you punk!

677
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,239
Stop spouting nonsense!

678
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:38,423
Do you want to see your mother faint?

679
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:40,021
Shut your mouth already.

680
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:42,786
It's enough to be dealing
with the same last name issue.

681
00:54:44,112 --> 00:54:47,022
I can't have complications
with two in-laws from one family.

682
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:52,469
If you're ready to organize your mother's
funeral, then you can keep on yapping.

683
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:55,481
Il Hwa... Il--

684
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,730
Geez, I know I'm right.

685
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:03,123
-Bye, now.
-Yes, all right.

686
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:06,379
It's not true, so don't worry!

687
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:14,901
Look, look.
Something feels different about them.

688
00:55:15,303 --> 00:55:17,173
Why are you two coming in together?

689
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:23,368
You two, about that article...

690
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:25,968
...it's not true, is it?

691
00:55:27,975 --> 00:55:30,875
Taek, is it true? It's not, right?

692
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,512
The article is wrong, right?

693
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:34,908
You're not dating, are you?

694
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,620
Taek, is that article true?

695
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,069
It's not true.

696
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:59,247
You know our relationship.

697
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:02,296
-See, see.
-Oh my goodness!

698
00:56:03,842 --> 00:56:06,141
Does our relationship seem
like one that would change?

699
00:56:06,183 --> 00:56:10,013
Right, right. You two have known
each other for ages.

700
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:14,638
Taek.

701
00:56:15,988 --> 00:56:17,508
I trust you.

702
00:56:18,138 --> 00:56:20,918
Does our relationship seem
like it's going to change easily?

703
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,091
I won't change.

704
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:33,538
So, let's take our time in telling them.

705
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,139
OK? Understand?

706
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:46,328
I'll give you a present for doing this.

707
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:53,951
I love you.

708
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:38,915
Back then, two in-laws with one family
was worse than a same last name marriage.

709
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,451
I was maturing so fast.

710
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,835
But, he only played baduk.

711
00:57:44,947 --> 00:57:48,544
I had to talk him out of it,
and convince him not to announce it.

712
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:51,571
We dated for about two years
and then we got married.

713
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,735
I was busy. He was too.

714
00:57:56,697 --> 00:58:00,727
I think, for about two months,
our meetings were so brief.

715
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:04,555
As for dates...

716
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,514
It was all on neighborhood streets.

717
00:58:24,955 --> 00:58:28,047
I'll walk you to the big street.

718
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:33,608
Why don't you open your eyes
and wake up first?

719
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,540
Yeah... you just got here?

720
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:43,793
Why didn't you call?

721
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:48,823
OK.

722
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,566
You should have gone to bed.

723
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:04,034
Let's walk around
the neighborhood, just once.

724
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:15,692
We didn't do anything
special on our dates.

725
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:19,361
We were like any other couple.

726
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:22,359
We stole some scenes
from movies and TV shows, you could say.

727
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:01,291
Hey, hey, Taek.

728
01:00:01,409 --> 01:00:04,624
If I drink and party again,
I'm no longer Sung Duk Seon.

729
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,986
I'll be your daughter.

730
01:00:05,997 --> 01:00:08,017
Are you doing this on purpose
to make me angry?

731
01:00:08,553 --> 01:00:09,960
I told you, I don't like it.

732
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:14,047
Seriously?

733
01:00:15,969 --> 01:00:17,459
Taek!

734
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:21,566
Taek, just this once.
It's a work party.

735
01:00:21,645 --> 01:00:24,225
It's for work, Taek. Come on, Taek...

736
01:00:36,484 --> 01:00:37,734
How much was it?

737
01:00:41,214 --> 01:00:42,434
Do you want to die?

738
01:00:43,922 --> 01:00:46,011
Do you think 30 million won is a joke?

739
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:48,701
You just let someone
borrow 30 million won?

740
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:52,143
That's enough.

741
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:54,591
Who was it? Give me a name.

742
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,733
It's just someone.
A colleague who trains with me.

743
01:00:56,935 --> 01:00:59,840
- You don't know him.
- So give me a name! What's his name?

744
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,680
He will pay me back, right away.

745
01:01:01,854 --> 01:01:03,644
I want a name!

746
01:01:10,678 --> 01:01:12,948
1994 Duk Seon

747
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:23,474
1988, Sung Duk Seon's Diary

748
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,050
I sent a post card confessing my
feelings for Sun Woo...

749
01:02:15,188 --> 01:02:17,418
Man, I was crazy.

750
01:02:21,874 --> 01:02:23,895
Hey, give it back.

751
01:02:23,915 --> 01:02:25,753
Give it back. Hey!

752
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,750
Give it, give it. Hey...

753
01:02:31,575 --> 01:02:32,466
Did you read it?

754
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:33,867
No, I couldn't.

755
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,861
Go inside now.

756
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:56,800
Long time, no see.

757
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,050
That hurt. Why did you do that?

758
01:03:00,463 --> 01:03:01,993
Because I'm so happy to see you.

759
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:06,901
What the heck was that?

760
01:03:12,398 --> 01:03:14,668
We dated and got married.

761
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:17,341
What was the best part?

762
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:20,396
Quitting my sleeping pills.

763
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:22,600
I quit my sleeping pills
once we started dating.

764
01:03:27,457 --> 01:03:28,997
When did I start liking her?

765
01:03:32,895 --> 01:03:34,225
I don't remember that.

766
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,641
She says 1989?

767
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:41,420
Wow, she still doesn't know me.

768
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:44,787
Is she really my wife?

769
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:56,845
Fall, 1978

770
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:33,340
Fall, 1979

771
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:04,306
Taek, drink the milk and grow tall!

772
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:06,808
You have to grow up quickly
and marry me, right?

773
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,850
Should we go see a movie?

774
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:22,659
Let's see a movie.

775
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:27,029
Duk Seon!

776
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:35,634
I like Duk Seon.

777
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:41,631
Not as a friend but as a girl.

778
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,250
I don't think I can make it tomorrow.

779
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,450
Plans have come up
with the people at baduk club.

780
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,330
But now...

781
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:38,487
What is this?

782
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,240
A turtle.

783
01:06:46,815 --> 01:06:48,255
What does it mean?

784
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:52,039
Eternal love.

785
01:06:52,844 --> 01:06:54,304
You said you'd be proposing.

786
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,498
Is this the end?

787
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:58,705
No.

788
01:07:05,944 --> 01:07:07,124
Duk Seon.

789
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:12,201
I love you.

790
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:29,762
Fall, 1995:
Sung Bo Ra, Sung Sun Woo's Wedding D-7]

791
01:07:56,825 --> 01:07:59,705
-Mom.
-Oh, you're here.

792
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,982
Why are you cooking already?

793
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:08,692
If I get married and go on my honeymoon,
that's more than half of a month away.

794
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,695
I should do it in advance.

795
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:12,884
I have ten more to do.

796
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:21,589
No, no! Don't do it.
You'll be doing more than enough later.

797
01:08:21,675 --> 01:08:22,890
It's OK.

798
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:26,640
My goodness, give that to me.

799
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:29,990
Go on inside. Get some rest.

800
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,400
-Go on.
-Seriously?

801
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,730
OK.

802
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,240
OK, now.

803
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,831
Dad, what are you doing?

804
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,431
Oh, Bo Ra, I was meaning to tell you...

805
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:18,480
Thank you for the new shoes
you bought for me.

806
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,105
They fit me perfectly.

807
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,609
Bo Ra, you bought shoes for Dad?

808
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:31,091
Yes, she bought them for me
to wear at the wedding.

809
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,959
She bought me a pair of shoes.

810
01:09:34,157 --> 01:09:36,161
They're cheap. Just wear them
however you please.

811
01:09:37,597 --> 01:09:40,151
OK, you must be tired. Go to bed.

812
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,261
It's not even 9 p.m. yet.

813
01:09:44,678 --> 01:09:49,151
Hey you! Lower the volume
or turn off the TV!

814
01:09:49,237 --> 01:09:51,826
How else is your sister
supposed to sleep?

815
01:09:52,363 --> 01:09:53,553
OK.

816
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:29,098
We didn't forget to send
the invitations to anyone, did we?

817
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:35,261
Mom, Sun Woo's wedding
is the day after tomorrow.

818
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,961
Even if we did,
it's too late now anyway.

819
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:44,251
Why is there nothing
that our Jin Joo doesn't know?

820
01:10:46,646 --> 01:10:50,121
Where's Sun Woo? Where's the groom?

821
01:10:50,444 --> 01:10:52,351
He's probably with Bo Ra.

822
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:55,827
They've been dating for years,
but he must still like her?

823
01:10:56,176 --> 01:10:57,876
I guess so.

824
01:11:14,299 --> 01:11:15,609
Hello.

825
01:11:16,737 --> 01:11:19,747
Sun Woo, what brings you here?

826
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:22,379
I wanted to speak to you.

827
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:24,296
Have you eaten yet?

828
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:26,041
Yes, I've eaten.

829
01:11:29,366 --> 01:11:30,630
Aren't you busy?

830
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,941
You must have so much to do
to prepare for the wedding.

831
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:34,401
I've prepared everything.

832
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:36,111
You know how
detail-oriented I am.

833
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:41,185
If you're like that once you're married...

834
01:11:41,545 --> 01:11:43,163
Bo Ra will go crazy on you.

835
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:49,211
You need to go
with the flow a little bit.

836
01:11:49,965 --> 01:11:52,371
That will make
your household comfortable.

837
01:11:52,578 --> 01:11:54,113
-All right?
-Yes.

838
01:11:55,574 --> 01:11:58,832
Also, Bo Ra will be working too.

839
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:02,251
Do your laundry
and take care of your own meals.

840
01:12:03,212 --> 01:12:05,060
Yes, I'll do a good job.

841
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:08,564
I might not do as well as you.

842
01:12:09,064 --> 01:12:13,501
But for the past eight years,
I have watched, and learned from you.

843
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:16,981
I'll try my best
to be half the person that you are.

844
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,606
What did I do?

845
01:12:22,363 --> 01:12:24,676
Oh my, Sun Woo...

846
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:27,901
When did you grow up like this?
And now you're getting married?

847
01:12:30,631 --> 01:12:35,521
Your mother and I,
we're not sad at all.

848
01:12:36,445 --> 01:12:39,652
I don't know about the others
but I trust you.

849
01:12:41,082 --> 01:12:42,940
Live well Sun Woo, OK?

850
01:12:52,685 --> 01:12:54,311
Sir, here.

851
01:12:56,717 --> 01:12:58,937
-What's this?
-An invitation.

852
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:00,981
Why are you giving me an invitation?

853
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:04,211
This isn't the one that I sent
to the elders and my other relatives.

854
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:09,581
I sent this one
to the people closest to me.

855
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:13,271
Sir.

856
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:17,801
This is my real invitation.

857
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:34,661
Sung Sun Woo, son of Kim Sun Young
and Choi Moo Sung...

858
01:13:47,682 --> 01:13:53,161
You'll be sitting next to my mom
at my wedding, right?

859
01:13:58,138 --> 01:14:01,571
Make sure my mom isn't lonely.

860
01:14:04,242 --> 01:14:05,842
And sit next to her.

861
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,404
They say you grow up
when you get married.

862
01:14:16,689 --> 01:14:18,409
I must finally be growing up.

863
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:35,841
Thank you, Sir...

864
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:40,191
...for not letting my mom be lonely.

865
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:52,007
Choi Moo Sung

866
01:15:09,466 --> 01:15:13,216
My goodness... this is pretty.

867
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:20,121
Oh, I'm so out of it.

868
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,158
I almost forgot to get you a kettle.

869
01:15:22,169 --> 01:15:23,229
Where are you going, Mom?

870
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:24,541
I'll be at the store.

871
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:27,148
It's OK. I don't need a kettle.
Don't buy it.

872
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:29,429
No, you'll need it, for sure!

873
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,980
What are you doing? Go in and sleep.

874
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:35,261
-I'll be back.
-Bye, now.

875
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:41,811
I'm going to meet my friends for a bit.

876
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:45,501
Come home early!
Your sister is getting married tomorrow.

877
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:47,915
OK. I'll be back soon.

878
01:15:47,928 --> 01:15:49,168
OK.

879
01:16:05,798 --> 01:16:08,288
Yeah, I'm fine.

880
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,311
Are you OK?

881
01:16:10,637 --> 01:16:12,116
What do you mean?

882
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:14,301
What would not be OK?

883
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,410
Is the mood in your house OK?

884
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:22,241
The mood in my house has been
strange for about a week.

885
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,990
How?

886
01:16:27,098 --> 01:16:30,058
I feel like...

887
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:34,267
Like I've become a guest.

888
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:37,041
Your family is being too good
to you, aren't they?

889
01:16:38,062 --> 01:16:39,302
It's the same thing here.

890
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:43,100
Your parents are doing that
because they feel sad.

891
01:16:43,442 --> 01:16:45,891
Geez, I feel bad for no reason.

892
01:16:47,197 --> 01:16:50,147
Whenever they see me,
they insist I sleep, or rest.

893
01:16:51,452 --> 01:16:55,410
Sun Woo, I must really be a stranger now.

894
01:16:55,588 --> 01:16:57,440
Why don't you change the mood then?

895
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,301
Or why don't you guys
all try talking about the past?

896
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:01,775
Use this chance.

897
01:17:03,054 --> 01:17:05,264
You don't know what you're saying.

898
01:17:05,964 --> 01:17:09,221
If my family starts doing that,
we'll drown in a sea of tears right away.

899
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:11,801
Oh, yeah?

900
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:13,901
I won't ask to see you today!

901
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,333
Spend this last day
with your family.

902
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:17,739
This time, I'll give in.

903
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:22,961
I want to do that too
but everyone's busy.

904
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:27,711
Mom went to the store
and No Eul is meeting friends.

905
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:30,161
Duk Seon is on a flight.

906
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:33,721
Dad and I are the only people home.

907
01:17:33,935 --> 01:17:36,865
Then talk to your dad for once!

908
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:41,241
Geez, you two are both just
so not good at conversation.

909
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:45,478
Or you could just come out
quickly for lunch.

910
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,389
Hey, is it already time for lunch?

911
01:17:49,978 --> 01:17:50,860
Let's hang up.

912
01:17:50,974 --> 01:17:52,409
My dad's probably hungry.

913
01:17:52,995 --> 01:17:54,675
Dad, are you hungry?

914
01:18:03,685 --> 01:18:09,441
Well, I made some
of the fried rice that you like.

915
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:34,689
Well, uh...

916
01:18:35,805 --> 01:18:37,798
Is everything ready?

917
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,096
Yes.

918
01:18:50,568 --> 01:18:53,128
Should I bring you some soup,
to help the rice go down easier?

919
01:18:54,437 --> 01:18:56,579
I'm fine. You should eat.

920
01:18:56,787 --> 01:18:57,728
Yeah.

921
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:16,741
Do the shoes fit OK?

922
01:19:17,748 --> 01:19:21,210
Yeah, they really fit me just right.

923
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:24,991
How did you know my shoe size?

924
01:19:50,838 --> 01:19:52,808
You should eat a lot.

925
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,021
Congratulations On Your Wedding!

926
01:20:19,911 --> 01:20:23,241
Sung Sun Woo, Sung Bo Ra

927
01:21:06,973 --> 01:21:10,215
Hi, the ceremony will be starting soon.

928
01:21:10,469 --> 01:21:14,051
- All guests please take a seat.
- Oh, Dong Ryong's mom!

929
01:21:14,051 --> 01:21:16,991
In order for the ceremony to start...

930
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,071
Mrs. Cheetah from Ssangmundong!

931
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:25,970
If Mrs. Cheetah from Ssangmundong
will be quiet, we can get started.

932
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:28,941
I will repeat myself.
The ceremony will begin soon.

933
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:31,622
Those of you standing outside.
Your legs must be hurting.

934
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:34,551
Please come inside and take your seats.

935
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,294
And let's get started.

936
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:38,039
Oh, Lieutenant Kim!

937
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:40,932
Jung Pal, get here
on time, will you?

938
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:43,520
I'll kill you.

939
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:45,657
-He's my friend.
-Son, son.

940
01:21:45,668 --> 01:21:47,058
Yes!

941
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:51,862
Son, you look good.

942
01:21:56,439 --> 01:21:58,211
Hey, I said I'd be the emcee.

943
01:21:58,361 --> 01:22:00,545
You barely made it here from Sacheon.

944
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,447
Dong Ryong is fine. Don't worry.

945
01:22:04,869 --> 01:22:06,637
Did you see Sun Woo?

946
01:22:06,637 --> 01:22:08,040
He looks crazy.

947
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:10,180
He can't control his facial expressions.

948
01:22:10,237 --> 01:22:14,973
Next, we'll have our groom
make his entrance.

949
01:22:15,315 --> 01:22:17,620
Groom! Enter!

950
01:22:37,473 --> 01:22:40,021
He's smiling ear to ear.

951
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:43,071
-That crazy punk.
-Sun Woo!

952
01:22:59,915 --> 01:23:01,385
-Is it OK?
-Yes.

953
01:23:05,089 --> 01:23:06,759
Dad, are you nervous?

954
01:23:07,493 --> 01:23:09,993
Walk in properly. Don't fall.

955
01:23:18,252 --> 01:23:20,821
Dad, aren't your shoes too big?

956
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,541
What if they slip off?

957
01:23:22,692 --> 01:23:25,435
It's fine. They fit just fine.

958
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:58,367
Thank you.

959
01:23:59,045 --> 01:24:00,155
Go sit down.

960
01:24:13,954 --> 01:24:17,000
Everyone, this is the highlight
of the ceremony.

961
01:24:17,076 --> 01:24:20,701
In a moment, please turn around.

962
01:24:33,744 --> 01:24:38,837
We will have the entrance of the bride,
more beautiful and graceful than ever.

963
01:24:38,851 --> 01:24:40,891
Please, let's hear your applause!

964
01:24:40,971 --> 01:24:42,671
Bride! Enter!

965
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,654
Hey, Bo Ra is beautiful.

966
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:43,986
Next, onto this blessed day...

967
01:25:44,031 --> 01:25:48,871
...we will now give thanks to the parents
who raised them with love.

968
01:25:48,993 --> 01:25:54,735
First, they will greet the parents
on the bride's side.

969
01:26:04,934 --> 01:26:09,630
With thankful hearts,
for raising us with love and care...

970
01:26:09,737 --> 01:26:12,241
...the bride and groom
will now provide a greeting.

971
01:26:12,344 --> 01:26:15,084
Bride and groom, please bow.

972
01:26:22,297 --> 01:26:27,101
Yes, it's a very
beautiful and touching scene before us.

973
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,341
Yes, it is very heartwarming. Yes.

974
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,145
Don't cry.

975
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:13,101
Next, we have to take photos
with all of the relatives.

976
01:27:13,101 --> 01:27:18,471
First, we ask that all the relatives,
on both sides, come up to the stage.

977
01:27:18,717 --> 01:27:19,957
Please come up.

978
01:27:20,627 --> 01:27:23,201
OK, is everyone up here?
There's no one else?

979
01:27:23,259 --> 01:27:24,768
Wait, wait, wait!

980
01:27:25,379 --> 01:27:27,910
What are you doing? Get up here!

981
01:27:28,127 --> 01:27:31,120
-Me?
-You, and everyone!

982
01:27:31,233 --> 01:27:33,171
Should we go too?

983
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:34,401
Hurry up!

984
01:27:35,165 --> 01:27:38,045
One... two... three!

985
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:46,841
Before we finish up the photos...

986
01:27:46,841 --> 01:27:50,461
...we will have a segment of,
"Sun Woo, let's take a picture together!"

987
01:27:50,461 --> 01:27:52,671
"Sun Woo, let's take a picture together!"

988
01:27:55,464 --> 01:27:58,281
Everyone, come on up. What are you doing?
Duk Seon, where are you?

989
01:28:04,759 --> 01:28:06,745
Duk Seon, what's wrong with your eyes?
Are you a pawak?

990
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,521
-Shut up.
-OK.

991
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:13,204
Sir, please take a good one.

992
01:28:14,086 --> 01:28:15,241
Friends?

993
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,351
Yes, they're my neighborhood friends.
Please take a good one!

994
01:28:18,947 --> 01:28:21,261
I wonder if that's why
you all look alike.

995
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:33,331
OK, I'm taking it now.

996
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:38,820
When I count "one, two, three",
smile brightly for me!

997
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:43,031
OK! One... two... three!

998
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:51,404
Bye!

999
01:28:52,358 --> 01:28:53,443
Hey, hey, hey.

1000
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,408
Your sister didn't leave yet, did she?

1001
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,999
Of course, not without you there.
Hurry, she's out front.

1002
01:28:58,156 --> 01:29:00,361
I'm going to the bathroom.
Dad, take this.

1003
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,601
This is Bo Ra's bag for her honeymoon.
Be careful.

1004
01:29:02,601 --> 01:29:05,621
Oh... she didn't even take this yet.

1005
01:29:16,675 --> 01:29:19,581
Geez, I really hate these things.

1006
01:29:21,081 --> 01:29:22,981
You should all get going.

1007
01:29:26,391 --> 01:29:29,421
-I'll be back.
-OK, OK.

1008
01:29:30,995 --> 01:29:32,535
You should all go inside.

1009
01:29:36,563 --> 01:29:39,479
Mom, am I going far away?

1010
01:29:39,892 --> 01:29:42,691
The in-law's are right here too.
Why are you crying?

1011
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:50,937
I love you, Mom.

1012
01:29:51,643 --> 01:29:52,964
I'll live well.

1013
01:29:55,754 --> 01:29:57,774
Thank you for raising me.

1014
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,211
Lady, everything will work out well.

1015
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,159
Don't worry.

1016
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:53,290
We should go home now too.

1017
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:56,321
Why don't we,
neighborhood people, have a drink?

1018
01:30:57,138 --> 01:30:59,358
Yes, let's do that.

1019
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:05,960
Oh? Where's your dad?
He was just here a moment ago.

1020
01:31:06,897 --> 01:31:10,391
Oh, you're right. He was just here.

1021
01:31:23,599 --> 01:31:27,601
I didn't realize that my Bo Ra
had so many tears in there.

1022
01:31:28,576 --> 01:31:32,446
Yeah, I didn't know either.

1023
01:31:41,411 --> 01:31:43,431
To my loving daughter

1024
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:07,252
To my loving dad.

1025
01:32:08,384 --> 01:32:10,944
I didn't think I could say it in words,
so I'm writing a letter.

1026
01:32:11,928 --> 01:32:14,078
Why can't I ever say it in words?

1027
01:32:15,222 --> 01:32:17,892
I guess I'm just a lot like you, right?

1028
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:27,451
Dad, I don't know
everything that you're feeling.

1029
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:32,981
I knew when you called my name, "Bo Ra",
you were just asking me to look at you.

1030
01:32:33,806 --> 01:32:36,463
And when you put side dishes
on top of my rice...

1031
01:32:36,648 --> 01:32:38,557
...I knew it meant you loved me.

1032
01:32:39,733 --> 01:32:41,712
Why did I pretend not to notice?

1033
01:32:41,841 --> 01:32:43,011
Darn it.

1034
01:32:44,696 --> 01:32:46,976
That's what pains my heart
the most, and I'm sorry.

1035
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:51,162
Dad...

1036
01:32:51,803 --> 01:32:56,239
I wanted to look you in the face
and tell you something before my wedding.

1037
01:32:57,345 --> 01:32:59,605
But I ended up
telling you in this letter.

1038
01:33:01,003 --> 01:33:03,550
I'm a bad daughter who has
a lot for which to be sorry.

1039
01:33:03,887 --> 01:33:06,921
It's because I feel like crying,
just when I hear or see the word, "Dad".

1040
01:33:09,274 --> 01:33:13,231
Dad, I love you and I thank you.

1041
01:33:14,571 --> 01:33:18,491
I'll live well with Sun Woo,
so that you and Mom don't worry.

1042
01:33:21,231 --> 01:33:23,513
Though it was a
half-basement house...

1043
01:33:23,905 --> 01:33:25,820
...I received so much love.

1044
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:29,121
If I'm ever reborn,
I want to be reborn as your daughter.

1045
01:33:31,447 --> 01:33:36,371
Dad, I'm sorry and I love you.

1046
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,130
Thank you.

1047
01:33:39,735 --> 01:33:41,461
You grew up well, my daughter.

1048
01:34:07,868 --> 01:34:09,088
Bo Ra.

1049
01:34:10,028 --> 01:34:13,271
It must have been this time of year
about 27 years ago.

1050
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:19,278
I heard your mother shout,
and soon after, I heard a light cry.

1051
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:22,891
Your dad can still hear it in his ears.

1052
01:34:23,765 --> 01:34:25,897
When did a small
thing like you...

1053
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:28,724
...grow up so fast and get married?

1054
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:31,571
Bo Ra...

1055
01:34:32,248 --> 01:34:36,100
Since you were born
and every moment between then and now...

1056
01:34:36,476 --> 01:34:40,291
Don't forget that you have always been
my most precious jewel.

1057
01:34:41,824 --> 01:34:44,671
I love you, my daughter.

1058
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:50,501
Thank you for being born as my daughter.

1059
01:35:18,606 --> 01:35:22,144
Can't we fix this,
with Photoshop or something?

1060
01:35:22,155 --> 01:35:24,495
What's wrong with it?
It's part of all of our memories.

1061
01:35:24,798 --> 01:35:28,531
Who told you to cry
so much at my wedding?

1062
01:35:30,781 --> 01:35:32,254
Look who's talking.

1063
01:35:32,656 --> 01:35:34,901
I didn't cry as much as you did.

1064
01:35:39,868 --> 01:35:41,698
Stalker

1065
01:35:43,596 --> 01:35:44,534
Yes, honey?

1066
01:35:44,788 --> 01:35:45,861
Where are you?

1067
01:35:46,202 --> 01:35:48,311
- Duk Seon's place.
- Again?

1068
01:35:48,557 --> 01:35:50,047
What do you mean, again?

1069
01:35:50,443 --> 01:35:52,011
I came for coffee.

1070
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,131
Your dad's birthday is soon.

1071
01:35:54,192 --> 01:35:55,801
Did you decide on a present?

1072
01:35:56,648 --> 01:35:59,661
Not yet. I'll pick one out on my own.

1073
01:35:59,968 --> 01:36:01,341
Aren't you busy?

1074
01:36:01,486 --> 01:36:03,391
I'm busy. Bye.

1075
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,861
That team's been bothering you a lot,
haven't they?

1076
01:36:06,993 --> 01:36:07,931
No.

1077
01:36:08,008 --> 01:36:10,208
They said it would only be one interview.

1078
01:36:19,777 --> 01:36:21,101
Yes, honey?

1079
01:36:21,101 --> 01:36:24,521
What do you think about running shoes?
He looks good in sportswear.

1080
01:36:24,605 --> 01:36:26,385
Yes, that's a good idea.

1081
01:36:26,457 --> 01:36:30,900
But honey, I'll buy it. Go back to work.

1082
01:36:31,062 --> 01:36:32,222
OK.

1083
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:35,645
What is their theme?

1084
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:37,572
Oh, right...

1085
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,451
Youth? I think it's youth.

1086
01:36:53,004 --> 01:36:55,124
-Hello?
-Honey, should we buy him slippers?

1087
01:36:55,371 --> 01:36:56,632
What do you think?
Not bad, right?

1088
01:36:57,222 --> 01:36:58,301
Is it too much?

1089
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:02,181
When you buy them,
buy shoes that are wide.

1090
01:37:02,276 --> 01:37:04,546
I said I'll take care of it!

1091
01:37:05,089 --> 01:37:08,681
Hey! How many times a day
do you call me?

1092
01:37:08,734 --> 01:37:10,750
We can talk about it at home.

1093
01:37:10,959 --> 01:37:14,841
If you call one more time,
I'll just... got it?

1094
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,350
Yes, OK. I'll hang up now.

1095
01:37:21,345 --> 01:37:22,945
What were we talking about?

1096
01:37:24,316 --> 01:37:26,546
We weren't talking at all.

1097
01:37:27,839 --> 01:37:31,389
I think running shoes
would be good for Dad's birthday.

1098
01:37:31,725 --> 01:37:34,791
Should I buy them?
Dad's shoe size is 270, right?

1099
01:37:34,887 --> 01:37:37,481
Running shoes are 275
and dress shoes are 270.

1100
01:37:37,562 --> 01:37:40,950
But, it's different,
depending on the brand.

1101
01:37:40,968 --> 01:37:42,778
I'll buy them.

1102
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:52,551
Are you mad? Sorry!
When are you coming home?

1103
01:37:52,551 --> 01:37:53,781
This guy...

1104
01:37:54,794 --> 01:37:57,310
He's dead!

1105
01:37:57,479 --> 01:37:59,369
Duk Seon, I'm going.

1106
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:02,810
Your friend is going to die today!

1107
01:38:06,688 --> 01:38:08,348
People don't change.

1108
01:38:09,632 --> 01:38:14,371
He's not our street's
biggest star anymore.

1109
01:38:14,962 --> 01:38:17,287
-Kim Jung Bong, right?
-Yeah.

1110
01:38:17,539 --> 01:38:19,189
Jung Bong became totally big.

1111
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,914
These days, you know,
Home Cooking Chef Bong...

1112
01:38:21,925 --> 01:38:23,955
You know that show, Chef Bong, right?
I watch that.

1113
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,325
But I watched him cooking,
and he's the same as he used to be.

1114
01:38:28,341 --> 01:38:29,601
Yeah.

1115
01:38:29,643 --> 01:38:31,940
He really loved sugar back then too.

1116
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:33,581
Yes, he did.

1117
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:39,011
Jung Bong's ramen is still my favorite.

1118
01:38:40,505 --> 01:38:41,959
Man Ok must be happy, right?

1119
01:38:41,985 --> 01:38:43,717
Her husband is a good cook.

1120
01:38:43,915 --> 01:38:47,035
I'll make you that ramen later tonight.

1121
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,690
Don't bother.

1122
01:38:53,995 --> 01:38:55,671
No need to thank us.

1123
01:38:55,825 --> 01:38:58,101
We're more thankful to you.

1124
01:38:58,101 --> 01:39:00,641
We got to talk about the past.
We enjoyed it a lot, actually.

1125
01:39:01,661 --> 01:39:06,981
After talking about it, I realized,
we really had fun in Ssangmundong.

1126
01:39:07,059 --> 01:39:10,824
Right? Why didn't we know that then?

1127
01:39:10,835 --> 01:39:12,855
If we knew that back then,
we'd be adults.

1128
01:39:13,638 --> 01:39:16,811
Do you remember when each family
started to move out of the neighborhood?

1129
01:39:16,906 --> 01:39:19,016
Your house moved away first.

1130
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:22,901
My mom was crying all over
the neighborhood.

1131
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,530
I think she cried more that day,
than when Grandma died.

1132
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:29,560
Yeah.

1133
01:39:34,991 --> 01:39:37,611
OK, this too.

1134
01:39:39,965 --> 01:39:42,115
It's all in. You should get on.

1135
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,721
Yes, we'll be right there!

1136
01:40:02,171 --> 01:40:03,451
You should get on.

1137
01:40:03,462 --> 01:40:05,939
I need to talk to the ladies first.

1138
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,274
Oh, for goodness' sake.

1139
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:30,111
What? We're not going
to see each other anymore?

1140
01:40:33,237 --> 01:40:36,001
Am I going to the States or something?

1141
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:40,054
What, what, what?

1142
01:40:47,771 --> 01:40:49,881
I'll call often.

1143
01:40:59,401 --> 01:41:01,081
Geez, now.

1144
01:41:03,072 --> 01:41:05,732
Get going now. Don't cry.

1145
01:41:07,939 --> 01:41:12,341
OK and stay well, ladies.

1146
01:41:15,493 --> 01:41:18,583
You were truly good people.

1147
01:41:19,674 --> 01:41:22,674
I had, only good times here.

1148
01:41:28,143 --> 01:41:32,571
The first people to leave Ssangmundong
were Taek and Sun Woo.

1149
01:41:33,707 --> 01:41:39,811
Moo Sung wanted Sun Young to live in
a new apartment before she got any older.

1150
01:41:40,015 --> 01:41:42,481
They left this neighborhood first.

1151
01:41:43,646 --> 01:41:46,461
Next, was Dong Ryong's family.

1152
01:41:48,064 --> 01:41:53,511
And next, Ssangmundong's eternal Cheetah
left the neighborhood.

1153
01:42:30,473 --> 01:42:34,971
The last family to leave was my family.

1154
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:39,001
Duk Seon, what are you doing? Hurry up.

1155
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:45,624
With our family's move,
the street of Ssangmundong 10-2...

1156
01:42:46,005 --> 01:42:47,841
...became an empty one.

1157
01:43:08,979 --> 01:43:10,629
Hurry up, Sis!

1158
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,496
OK.

1159
01:43:19,716 --> 01:43:21,596
Where are you moving again?

1160
01:43:22,886 --> 01:43:26,036
It's a bit far from here.

1161
01:43:27,602 --> 01:43:29,477
Bangyo. Go to Bangyo.

1162
01:43:29,612 --> 01:43:33,242
Oh, OK. You sure are going far.

1163
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:35,431
You must be farming.

1164
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:38,901
-What?
-There's nothing there.

1165
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:55,530
Do I want to go back to that time?

1166
01:43:57,451 --> 01:44:01,091
I don't want to go back.

1167
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:04,681
I like it now.
I was so sensitive back then.

1168
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:08,551
These days, I think I like sunshine.

1169
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:10,132
And I can hear the raindrops.

1170
01:44:10,854 --> 01:44:12,269
I like it better now.

1171
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:18,461
But if we were to go back,
there's one thing I'd want to do.

1172
01:44:18,816 --> 01:44:20,316
-What?
-Spend all night in my room...

1173
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:21,309
...with the gang.

1174
01:44:23,574 --> 01:44:27,044
Play Blue Marble,
make ramen, watch movies.

1175
01:44:28,453 --> 01:44:33,121
Unless it's to hang out with the guys,
I don't want to go back.

1176
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:37,901
I want to go back.

1177
01:44:38,068 --> 01:44:39,088
Why?

1178
01:44:40,377 --> 01:44:44,241
There's a person I want to meet
when I go back.

1179
01:44:45,573 --> 01:44:46,743
Who?

1180
01:44:48,585 --> 01:44:53,111
My parents, when they were young
and seemed as big as mountains.

1181
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:01,671
Parents who were young
and as big as mountains.

1182
01:45:01,846 --> 01:45:03,276
I want to see them.

1183
01:45:08,716 --> 01:45:10,806
They aged so much, didn't they?

1184
01:45:12,696 --> 01:45:14,896
What can you do about passing time?

1185
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:24,631
You know the song "Youth",
by Kim Chang Wan?

1186
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:29,295
It didn't really touch my heart
when I heard it first, in the past.

1187
01:45:29,306 --> 01:45:31,756
-But now you get it?
-Yeah.

1188
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:35,090
It feels like it's about me.

1189
01:45:36,644 --> 01:45:38,791
I guess a day like this comes for me too.

1190
01:45:38,837 --> 01:45:41,442
Are you old now? Huh?

1191
01:45:41,675 --> 01:45:42,785
Yes.

1192
01:45:44,472 --> 01:45:45,641
Wow.

1193
01:45:46,432 --> 01:45:49,471
Should we go to Ssangmundong
over the weekend?

1194
01:45:50,086 --> 01:45:54,730
No, that place has completely changed.

1195
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:57,259
There are high-rise apartments.

1196
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,621
Could it have changed that much?

1197
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:02,062
Oh... you'll be traumatized if you go.

1198
01:46:02,799 --> 01:46:05,053
I went there about
ten years ago.

1199
01:46:05,064 --> 01:46:06,871
It was even different back then.

1200
01:46:08,178 --> 01:46:11,053
-Wow.
-It's best not to go.

1201
01:46:12,006 --> 01:46:13,016
Wow.

1202
01:46:18,434 --> 01:46:21,731
When I went back,
in search of our neighborhood street...

1203
01:46:22,049 --> 01:46:24,297
...the street had aged so much.

1204
01:46:24,432 --> 01:46:26,851
You could feel that the time had passed.

1205
01:46:28,217 --> 01:46:33,690
I can't go back to my youth
or to this street.

1206
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,511
They are both the same.

1207
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,733
Time will always flow.

1208
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,931
Everything will pass by.

1209
01:46:46,329 --> 01:46:48,509
Everything will age.

1210
01:46:50,348 --> 01:46:55,491
That might be why youth is beautiful.

1211
01:46:56,736 --> 01:47:00,621
It shines, blindingly bright,
for just an instant.

1212
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:04,241
But, to it, you can never go back.

1213
01:47:17,542 --> 01:47:19,971
A time when many tears were shed.

1214
01:47:21,182 --> 01:47:26,561
The time of my youth
was like that as well.

1215
01:47:30,509 --> 01:47:32,631
Hey, last place.
Why are you always late?

1216
01:47:33,425 --> 01:47:34,581
You're here?

1217
01:47:34,736 --> 01:47:36,300
Why are you just getting here,
Duk Seon?

1218
01:47:36,461 --> 01:47:38,001
Hurry up, Duk Seon.

1219
01:47:47,855 --> 01:47:49,751
Why are you guys here?

1220
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,327
What do you mean?

1221
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:52,908
Were we supposed
to be somewhere?

1222
01:47:53,549 --> 01:47:55,909
Hurry up! We rented a movie.

1223
01:47:58,087 --> 01:47:59,424
Duk Seon, what's wrong?

1224
01:47:59,819 --> 01:48:01,488
Did Bo Ra hit you again?

1225
01:48:05,275 --> 01:48:06,575
We're starting the video.

1226
01:48:07,234 --> 01:48:08,434
Come sit down.

1227
01:48:21,876 --> 01:48:25,621
My daughter is very pretty.
She has my eyes.

1228
01:48:25,621 --> 01:48:28,361
You can see her for yourself.

1229
01:48:53,412 --> 01:48:55,032
Hey, wait!

1230
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:57,182
You farted, didn't you?

1231
01:48:57,897 --> 01:49:01,435
Fart, fart. When would I have farted?

1232
01:49:01,462 --> 01:49:04,672
Sun Woo, do you think
I would just fart in front of--

1233
01:49:04,683 --> 01:49:06,363
Hey!

1234
01:49:06,374 --> 01:49:08,354
Stop it!

1235
01:49:08,411 --> 01:49:11,507
Give it a rest!

1236
01:49:11,535 --> 01:49:13,085
Seriously.

1237
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,370
Oh my God!

1238
01:49:19,453 --> 01:49:20,963
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

1239
01:49:21,264 --> 01:49:22,661
Isn't that my mom's voice?

1240
01:49:22,716 --> 01:49:26,196
Kim Jung Hwan, come eat!

1241
01:49:33,451 --> 01:49:38,141
Kim Jung Hwan, come eat!

1242
01:49:45,256 --> 01:49:48,116
Sun Woo, it's time to eat!

1243
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:55,760
Duk Seon, come eat!

1244
01:50:00,034 --> 01:50:01,204
I have to go.

1245
01:50:03,435 --> 01:50:04,815
Me too.

1246
01:50:05,985 --> 01:50:07,305
I'm going too.

1247
01:50:17,456 --> 01:50:20,366
Son, let's eat too.

1248
01:50:30,869 --> 01:50:35,141
1988. This is the end
of our Ssangmundong story.

1249
01:50:37,327 --> 01:50:41,391
Longing for that time
and longing for that street...

1250
01:50:42,086 --> 01:50:45,401
...is not because
I miss a younger version of myself.

1251
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:50,581
That's the place of my father's youth,
of my mother's youth...

1252
01:50:51,586 --> 01:50:53,336
...of my friends' youth...

1253
01:50:54,477 --> 01:50:58,011
It's the place that holds
the youth of everything that I love.

1254
01:51:00,309 --> 01:51:04,441
In that landscape, where we won't be
able to gather like that again...

1255
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:08,601
I regret being unable
to say my final farewell.

1256
01:51:10,306 --> 01:51:13,365
To, the things that are already gone...

1257
01:51:13,976 --> 01:51:16,287
To a time that has
already passed...

1258
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:18,762
...I want to say a belated farewell.

1259
01:51:20,483 --> 01:51:23,289
Goodbye, my youth.

1260
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:26,338
Goodbye, Ssangmundong.

1261
01:52:30,268 --> 01:52:32,302
A time so warm and pure...

1262
01:52:32,656 --> 01:52:34,942
...that it was painful.

1263
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:37,750
Can you hear me?

1264
01:52:37,967 --> 01:52:40,057
If you can hear me, answer me.

1265
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:44,800
My 1988, the days of my youth.
