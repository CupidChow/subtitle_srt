1
00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:00,432
Hey... she's pretty.
She's so pretty.

2
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:03,537
It switched again?
It's Won Joon Hee noonim now?

3
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,632
Joey noona will be disappointed.

4
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,911
I think I have indigestion. Hold on.

5
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,033
Are you OK?

6
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:31,529
Well...

7
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:00,885
Thanks.

8
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,389
-Are you OK?
-A bit.

9
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,576
Taek. What medicine don't you have?

10
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,118
What do you have there?

11
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,675
Headache medicine,
sleeping pills, sleep aids...

12
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,019
...cold medicine, fatigue medicine,
digestive medicine, and so on.

13
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,113
I have a lot.

14
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,534
It's OK. I've cut down
on the medicine lately.

15
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:37,914
-Deok Sun.
-Yeah?

16
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,089
What are you doing next Saturday?

17
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,314
Me? Why?

18
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,512
What? What did he book?

19
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,967
Movie tickets.
Taek went to Jongro and bought them.

20
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,660
Of course, it took him forever.

21
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:57,385
Getting a kid who doesn't know how to get
to Jongro to go buy movie tickets there...

22
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:58,949
Deok Sun made him do it again,
didn't she?

23
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,059
He wants to see a movie
with Deok Sun.

24
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,129
He says that he'll confess to her
after the movie. Finally.

25
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,632
That, is Choi Taek, 6 dan,
finally making his winning move?

26
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:16,236
Why Saturday? Don't you have
a match the day before that?

27
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,619
If you win this time,
you win the tournament, right?

28
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,655
Whether you win or lose,
you should take a day off when it's over.

29
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,539
What's the point of coming home early?
You'll just be playing Baduk.

30
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,049
I can come back and hang out with you.

31
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,578
I have to study.
I don't have time to hang out with you.

32
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:34,541
You study. I'll play by
myself, by your side.

33
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,098
As if!

34
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:44,002
Regardless, keep Saturday free.
I'll call you after my match.

35
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:46,061
Got it?

36
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:55,262
Everyone else from the Baduk Club is
taking a day off and coming back Sunday

37
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:58,264
but Taek is coming back by himself
on Saturday to see Deok Sun.

38
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,973
What if he loses?

39
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:02,951
Obviously, he's confident.

40
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,747
What time, and where again?
I'll go and sell flowers there.

41
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:06,966
Should we?

42
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:09,701
Saturday, at 7 p.m. at Jongro Picadilly.

43
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,185
Jung Pal, shall we go?

44
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:16,412
-Are you out of your mind?
-I'm just joking, punk!

45
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:20,448
I'm joking too, punk!

46
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:32,281
Episode 16: Life is Ironic

47
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:40,933
I thought "the beggars came last year,
who don't die and come again this year."

48
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,754
This is back too.

49
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,509
National Singing Competition
Dobong-gu Edition

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,620
-National!
-Singing Competition!

51
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,285
Missus! Should we compete this time, too?

52
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:55,327
No! It's way too embarrassing!

53
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:59,212
They would've forgotton everything! No one
remembers who failed at the preliminaries!

54
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:00,778
How could they remember that?

55
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,425
-Yeah, right?
-Of course!

56
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:06,689
Ghosh... that has already
been four or five years ago.

57
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:11,148
Back then, I think we weren't all there.

58
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:16,343
Seriously... why did I do that then?

59
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:24,966
Well... we're not the ones at fault.

60
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:27,325
If anything to blame,
it's "that thing's" fault.

61
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,969
National Singing Competition
Dobong-gu Edition, 1984, Preliminaries

62
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:49,045
Five Years Ago, 1984

63
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,068
National Singing Competition

64
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:08,247
Number 242!
Number 242, please come in!

65
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:12,792
Hey, wait, you have to take this!

66
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:20,594
Hey, Sun Woo, I'm so nervous.
Give me a shot of that.

67
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:27,665
That's good. Look at my hands shaking.
What do I do?

68
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,049
Aren't you nervous?

69
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,828
-Hey, you must not be nervous.
-OK, that's much better.

70
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:37,844
Here, have a shot of this, Missus.

71
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,959
She's not nervous.

72
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:45,751
-Hey, when did you bring that?
-Hey...

73
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:48,086
-Wait, wait, pour it here!
-Be careful!

74
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:49,249
Why you acting like this?

75
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:51,088
Can I have some of that too?

76
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:56,065
Number 245!
Number 245, please come in!

77
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:06,233
Number 247! Number 247!

78
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,215
I finished a bottle.

79
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:35,025
Number 257!
Number 257, please come inside!

80
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,936
"Perilla Seeds" singing
"Butterfly Maiden"?

81
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:43,843
"Perilla Seeds"? You're not here?

82
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:49,038
Over here! Here! I'm here!

83
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,208
I'm... I'm here. Get up, let's go.

84
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,437
Over here! Here... over here!

85
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:29,657
Ghosh...

86
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,309
Ghosh...

87
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,873
Come by the hospital later.
The kids' dad is doing well.

88
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:40,610
Back surgery is still a big deal...
It's a relief, really.

89
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:41,967
What do you mean, a "relief"?

90
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,773
Why did he have to hurt
his back, of all places?

91
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,856
Grab some soju on your way.

92
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:51,549
OK.

93
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:55,690
Missus, cheer up!

94
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:59,716
Something good is bound to happen soon!

95
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:01,750
Sure...

96
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:20,656
and Lucky's stocks have
risen to 1,000 won per share.

97
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,445
The only companies whose shares
have not risen exponentially...

98
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:27,246
...are companies dealing
with nonmetallic minerals.

99
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:32,401
The stock prices are crazy these days.
They've gone up so much!

100
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,657
Can I have some senbei crackers?

101
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,944
Well, I suppose
your diet isn't restricted.

102
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:42,516
Yes. This back thing is really
inconvenient for walking...

103
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,015
...but my mouth is perfectly fine.

104
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,410
But shouldn't we all
buy some stocks?

105
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:55,325
Assistant Manager Sung, should I buy
some stocks? What do you think?

106
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,644
I was actually thinking
about asking you.

107
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,605
I was thinking of
investing some money...

108
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:06,492
Yes, good idea! Please, do it!

109
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,575
It's not like you're going to be
buried with all that money of yours.

110
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,694
Please invest.
Like, seriously.

111
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,606
Have you been possessed by a ghost
that's fixated on putting money away?

112
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:19,917
Will buying stocks be OK, though?
I'm a bit scared, you see...

113
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:21,850
Of course it's OK!

114
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,272
My friend pointed out
three good ones for me.

115
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,682
If we keep them
for thirty years...

116
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,010
...we can have our kids'
weddings at a hotel...

117
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,877
...and we can even send our
grandchildren overseas to study!

118
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,282
So, which ones are they?

119
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,254
-Yeah, well...
-No, no.

120
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,448
That's not right.

121
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:45,139
The time to buy stocks is over right now.

122
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:48,707
The prices of shares have
gone up way too much.

123
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:54,570
The fact that it's more than
1,000 won now makes no sense!

124
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,217
That means that you're buying
them at shoulder price...

125
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:59,704
...only to sell them later
at knee level amounts!

126
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,236
So you're saying stocks are like...

127
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,973
Heads, shoulders,
knees and toes,

128
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:10,364
Heads, shoulders, knees and toes,
knees and toes...

129
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:11,828
Right?

130
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:15,619
Hey... why didn't they take
advantage of this opportunity...

131
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,214
...to operate on that brain of yours,
while they were at it?

132
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,674
But I feel like all people with
some money, seem to have stocks.

133
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,756
Hwangdang Hwangdang, Bonghwangdang...
just invest your money elsewhere

134
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:29,226
Just trust me.

135
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:31,746
Even so, my friend told me that

136
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:37,028
Samsung Electronics,
Hanmi Pharmaceuticals...

137
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:40,707
...and Amore Pacific are three companies
in which to definitely buy stock.

138
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,725
How much is a share
at each of those?

139
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:47,448
I saw in the newspaper that one
was about 20,000 to 30,000 won.

140
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,391
Thats... that's so expensive!

141
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,997
They've gone up a lot.

142
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:55,929
Exactly.
Prices have risen way too much!

143
00:11:56,024 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm telling you, they're done for.
They can't possibly go up any more!

144
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:06,765
So... just put your money in the bank.

145
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:11,175
If you do, I'll get you an account
with a 17 percent interest rate.

146
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,931
Just listen to what I'm telling you.

147
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:15,092
Got it?
Put it in the bank.

148
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:18,795
OK.
Thank you.

149
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,449
-Where are we putting our money?
-The bank.

150
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,414
-Where?
-The bank. Yes.

151
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,321
Hurry and go home. I'll get an earful
if my dad sees us out here.

152
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,299
I'll call you.

153
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:44,163
You remember, right?
If it rings twice and hangs up, it's me.

154
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:46,137
-Twice...
-Yes.

155
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:52,632
Then, I'll see you next
Monday, on your birthday.

156
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:56,684
I know you don't have school  because
it's anniversary of your school opening.

157
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,623
How did you know my birthday?

158
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,308
Through the powers of
my interest in you.

159
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:03,908
Excuse me?

160
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:09,738
One day, I developed this strange power
that lets me read people's minds.

161
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:14,773
I guess when you're really in love,
you can develop supernatural powers!

162
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:23,235
You can smile wide.

163
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:31,092
You look more beautiful
with a big smile on your face.

164
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,260
Miss Man Ok, do you like cornet bread?

165
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:55,698
-What is that?
-I've baked you one. Here.

166
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:57,994
Would you like another one?

167
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:02,460
I've been practicing. Cornet bread!

168
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,533
You can take them, if you'd like.

169
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,600
I really want to take them...

170
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,238
You can take them all!

171
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,419
-Doesn't it hurt?
-Not at all.

172
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,431
It looks like really uncomfortable...

173
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,403
Her favorite color is yellow.
Favorite season is winter.

174
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,110
Favorite food is fried white bread.

175
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:28,132
Favorite subject is....
she doesn't have one.

176
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:29,950
-Deok Sun, slow down a bit.
-OK.

177
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,086
Her birthday is April 3rd.

178
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:34,350
Now that I think about
it, it's coming up soon.

179
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:38,100
What do you think she'd like?

180
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,675
Don't give her anything tangible.
There's nothing that she doesn't own.

181
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:45,322
Give her something from the heart.

182
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:47,301
Girls go crazy for that kind of stuff.

183
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,628
A present from the heart...

184
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,523
Hyung, today, I'm going to the hospital...

185
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,052
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

186
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:35,192
Whatever. I already know that
you're dating Deok Sun's friend.

187
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:37,927
Did Dong Ryong tell you?

188
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,096
No, he doesn't know who
I'm seeing exactly.

189
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,720
I heard it from Deok Sun.

190
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:53,037
Salamander knows too?

191
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:55,398
It just happened that way.

192
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:56,723
I'm going to go crazy.

193
00:15:58,508 --> 00:15:59,964
What's up with all that
paper crane, though?

194
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:01,243
What are you going to do with it?

195
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,612
Do you know the legend of
the paper cranes, my younger brother?

196
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,008
Is that something I should know?

197
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,341
No. But I want to tell you about it.

198
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:17,396
If you fold 1,000 of these
tiny paper cranes

199
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:19,486
they become real cranes, and fly away.

200
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,347
Also, they grant the wish
of the one who folded them.

201
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:25,408
OK...

202
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,885
Miss Man Ok's birthday is in a week.

203
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:30,656
Miss... Miss Man Ok?

204
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,573
What do you mean, "Miss"?
Just speak informally with her.

205
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:38,833
It's too soon for that. I want to
start speaking informally slowly.

206
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,005
I'm going to fold her
1,000 paper cranes for her birthday.

207
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:50,242
And then, I'll ask her what her wish is,
and grant it, no matter what.

208
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,773
What if it's a weird wish?

209
00:16:51,964 --> 00:16:55,256
Even so, if it's her wish, I will
grant it, no matter what it is.

210
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,608
Well... you really are a romantic.

211
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,684
Give that to me.
I'll help you out.

212
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,208
You call that a crane, younger brother?

213
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:19,803
The only things I know
how to fold are planes.

214
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,616
Who's that? Me?

215
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:44,609
It's you and me.

216
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,280
You said you wanted to
become a pilot, right?

217
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,984
When you become a pilot,
I'm going to be the first one to ride it.

218
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:58,263
I'll be the first ever
passenger on your flight.

219
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,246
It's a fighter jet.

220
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,806
My dream is to become a fighter pilot.

221
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:15,695
Since... since when?

222
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,108
Korea University Hospital

223
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:28,004
-That hurts! Be more gentle!
-Thats, you're such a wuss...

224
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:33,160
Honey. Mi Ran.

225
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:37,124
I heard the National Singing Competition
auditions are back in our town.

226
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:39,700
How did you know?

227
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:43,361
Yesterday, the dean...
I mean, Teacher Ryu, came by.

228
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,134
Apparently, a lot of students
are auditioning too.

229
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,260
I have no luck.

230
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:55,612
My lone wish is to partake
in that competition, just once.

231
00:18:56,752 --> 00:19:02,512
Even if I don't make it to the finals,
I want to show everything that I got.

232
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,758
Why did I have to break
my back at this timing?

233
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:12,384
Yeah. You practiced before, and said
you'd compete as a team with Deok Sun.

234
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:14,888
Mi Ran.

235
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,389
I have one wish.

236
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,908
We're not giving Jung
Hwan a younger sibling.

237
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:22,903
Not that one.
Something easier than that.

238
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:24,706
What is it?

239
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:26,645
Aren't you a pretty decent dancer?

240
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,372
How about you compete in my place?

241
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,175
You practiced so much five years ago...

242
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:35,998
...but you suddenly came down with
food poisoning and couldn't compete!

243
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,313
We don't know when they
will be back in Dobong-gu.

244
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:41,917
Go and compete, no matter what.

245
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,070
It's my wish!

246
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:48,400
With your skills, you can make it through
the preliminaries without a problem!

247
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:54,620
Forget it.
And you're sick, too.

248
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,988
When would I prepare for that?
Forget it!

249
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:59,761
You have a long list of song repertoire.

250
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,564
You don't need to prepare anything!

251
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:04,137
You'll get through
the preliminaries, for sure!

252
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:05,512
Go and register for an audition.

253
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,996
Should I do Yoon Soo Il?
"A Thrilling Confession"?

254
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:15,204
Sounds good! You'll make it
with that, without question!

255
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,078
Here's a little extra service for you.

256
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,848
You're starting to study already?
And you're going to a cram school too?

257
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:29,365
I'm late start so I have to get started
quickly and catch up as quickly as I can.

258
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,900
But still, let's see each
other on Friday night.

259
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:33,933
See you at 11 p.m., at the stairs.

260
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:35,470
It's OK noona.

261
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:40,186
You have a lot to prepare...
We can see each other whenever.

262
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:44,526
Whatever. I'll leave the library
to meet you at that time.

263
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,823
OK.
Good night.

264
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:50,023
OK. You hurry up
and go to bed too.

265
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:52,962
OK.
Sleep tight.

266
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,213
What? Sung Bo Ra is? Really?

267
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,352
Big noona... so you're going
to become a judge, then?

268
00:21:15,988 --> 00:21:21,207
She can become a judge,
or a prosecutor, or a lawyer!

269
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:23,820
That's her dream, after all.

270
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,536
Great...

271
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,476
Is she going to a Buddhist
temple, then, to study?

272
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:28,785
Why, I ought to...

273
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:31,105
It's not like she's going off
to live in seclusion as a monk!

274
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,698
It's not the '70s anymore. There are some
really great hostels these days.

275
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,901
She's going to live in one,
starting next month.

276
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,278
Really? What will we do?
I'm going to miss you.

277
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,434
So, does this mean
that room is all mine now?

278
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,418
Yes! Yes!

279
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:50,944
I'm coming home on
the weekends, all right?

280
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:53,160
Just you watch...

281
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:58,882
you'll be crying every night
about how much you miss her.

282
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,999
What? What terrible thing to say, Dad!

283
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,584
There's no way that'll happen.

284
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,921
Dad, don't you have
other button down shirts?

285
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,908
Why did you buy yourself
such a small one?

286
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:13,293
-The buttons like going to pop off!
-What are you saying?

287
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:15,279
This is my exact size...

288
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:16,654
-What!
-What!

289
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:17,884
The button popped off.

290
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:21,528
A slim fit is in style these days!

291
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:24,138
-I'm going to wash up.
-OK.

292
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:30,113
-You little...
-Where did the button fly off to?

293
00:22:30,293 --> 00:22:32,583
-Did it go far?
-This one's about to pop off too.

294
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,719
Mom, starting in April,
I'm going to go to the study room.

295
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,976
Mom, can I go to cram school?
All the other kids go.

296
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:47,742
Deok Sun... how about
May, instead of April?

297
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:51,156
We have lots of expenses in April...
Bo Ra's hostel, her moving fees.

298
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,728
But all the other kids were enrolled...

299
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:58,920
By the way, No Eul,
I'm getting a bonus next month...

300
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,464
...so in May, I'll send you
to any cram school you want.

301
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,165
Just wait it out for this month, OK?

302
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,210
-Thank you for the meal.
-Yeah.

303
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:19,824
You couldn't sleep last night, right?

304
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:22,477
You look terrible.

305
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:25,488
No, Dad. I can sleep
in the afternoon.

306
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,047
But... you made all this, Dad?

307
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:32,043
No. Sun Woo's mom
brought all of this over.

308
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,870
All I did was set the table.

309
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:38,891
She's really going out of her way.
Is it OK for us to keep mooching?

310
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:43,945
That's why I always thank her.

311
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,148
Just with your words?

312
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,565
Thats... Taek.

313
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:57,244
That is...

314
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:02,487
Nothing.
Hurry up and eat. Yeah.

315
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:06,428
What did you want to say?
Tell me, Dad.

316
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:09,972
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
I'll tell you next time.

317
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,908
You better eat all of that.

318
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:20,158
Ssangmun High School

319
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,730
Did you guys submit your form listing
your college and major aspirations?

320
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,459
The teacher said that
those are due by today.

321
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,328
I'm aiming for Seoul
University's Law department.

322
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:35,816
Crazy jerk.

323
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,994
They're "aspirations," aren't they?
I can write whatever I want.

324
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,328
Do whatever you want.
Your dad will be reading it anyway.

325
00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:46,874
This guy is the type who loves
to go and earn himself beatings.

326
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:49,114
Yeah. I feel more sorry
for teachers nowadays.

327
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,298
Hey. We're all down for tonight, right?

328
00:24:57,755 --> 00:24:58,927
We're only doing this
for you today.

329
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,188
-You're going somewhere?
-Daeko's dance off.

330
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:05,244
Daeko? You mean,
at the Tower Hotel?

331
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:06,999
Is there a dance off today?

332
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:10,417
-Do you know what the first place prize is?
-What?

333
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,363
A Hyundai Excel!

334
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:14,978
-Thats...
-Thats! That's a whole different level!

335
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:17,169
I guess national competitions
really are different?

336
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,631
Yeah, well you know,
I'm not a bad dancer, myself.

337
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:35,634
What kind of a sorry excuse
for a dance is that?

338
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:39,415
Hey. Who breakdances nowadays, anyway?

339
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:45,350
That's why I've changed a bit lately.
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

340
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:53,987
Whats... dancing a dance from
"back when tiger smoked".

341
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,337
You don't know anything
about the latest dance trends

342
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:59,141
because you're too crazy
about motorcycles!

343
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:00,894
Nowadays...

344
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,832
Hip hop is the way to go.

345
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,735
Don't waste all your energy now!

346
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:23,572
Wait a minute. You're number 13?
That'll be a while, then.

347
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:26,531
But hey... I heard that all of
the big shots are coming today.

348
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,033
Daeko is the Yeouido kids' turf.

349
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:32,917
But there's a girl named Kim Song
Yi from Yeouido Girls' High School...

350
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:34,530
...and she's really good at dancing.

351
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:38,111
Hey, you're pretty good yourself.
You'll get third place, at least.

352
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:40,753
Won't it be hard? The kids from
Gangnam and Itaewon are all here today.

353
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:44,697
Are you kidding?
I'm Ssangmundong's Park Nam Jung.

354
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:49,305
Yeah.. Hey, Yeouido and Itaewon are bigger
than Ssangmundong, you know.

355
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:53,699
My friends. Do you know what
I'm most worried about?

356
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,024
What?

357
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:57,919
How I'll make use of the
Hyundai Excel when I get it.

358
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:02,531
I stole my older brother's ID.
I'll in big trouble if I get first place.

359
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:07,897
-Hey, it's starting.
-I'm hungry though.

360
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:11,021
Let's watch the first round
and go get some ramen quickly.

361
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,521
I'm sure they're all the same.
All right, I'm off!

362
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,116
OK...

363
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:24,313
Daeko Nightclub's National Dance off

364
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,088
I don't think it'll work.

365
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:40,568
Hey, if he had gone earlier,
he would've been totally humiliated!

366
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:44,531
Hey... what was the name
of the first contestant, again?

367
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,704
-Hyun Jin Young.
-I thought an American was dancing.

368
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,994
The second guy's name
was Jin Young too.

369
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,331
-Yeah. Park Jin Young.
-Yeah! Yeah. Park Jin Young.

370
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,941
He totally danced like
an American, too!

371
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:02,731
Did you memorize all of their names?
Congratulations on being so freaking smart.

372
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,451
-Where are you going?
-To Taek's.

373
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:07,548
Let's just go watch Dirty Dancing!

374
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:11,870
What is he saying?
Wait up!

375
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,300
Ssangmun Girls' High

376
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:31,970
Future Aspirations Form:
Colleges and Majors

377
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,506
Joey.

378
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,120
Joey Wong.

379
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,345
Yeah?

380
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,090
What is your dream?

381
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,330
Me? A hairdresser.

382
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,274
Me. Your perm came out so nicely.

383
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:58,369
My... unnie!
Your perm came out so nicely!

384
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:01,310
Unnie!
Hey, Namgoong Slowpoke!

385
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,820
Hey, get up!
Your perm came out so nicely!

386
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:05,507
Get up and look at it, already!

387
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:17,431
Unnie. The teacher wants to see you.

388
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:20,388
She wants you to pay 4 million won
for using the school as a hotel.

389
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,039
I should just pull all your hair out.

390
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,696
What about you?
What do you want to be?

391
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:31,740
It's not asking about that.

392
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:34,037
It's asking you to write
about college related stuff.

393
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:37,329
I know that!
I'm just asking.

394
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:41,421
Also... I have literally
no college that I can write down.

395
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,632
Are you leaving tomorrow?

396
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:24,392
Should we go watch
this somewhere else?

397
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:27,275
It's OK. I'll take a short break.

398
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:33,164
Hey... I told you guys
to wait for me.

399
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,867
Jung Pal. If you watched Dirty Dancing
last year instead of Top Gun...

400
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,938
...we could have been walking
down the same path.

401
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:59,126
Wouldn't you want to become a dancer
after seeing Patrick Hyungnim's skills?

402
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:01,710
I didn't decide I wanted
to become a fighter pilot.

403
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:04,005
What do these punks take me for?

404
00:31:04,723 --> 00:31:06,003
I saw you as you!

405
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:11,867
This punk said he wanted to be a soccer player
like Maradona since elementary school...

406
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,494
...and in middle school,
he idolized Michael Jordan...

407
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,373
...so he said he wanted to become
a basketball player.

408
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:17,716
Did I?

409
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,287
How are there no secrets
in this neighborhood?

410
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,341
It's only because you saw Top Gun.

411
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:27,855
If you'd seen "Come Come Come Upward" you
would've shaven your head and become a monk.

412
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,312
That's why you have to have
big dreams, like me.

413
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:35,076
So that you can appear in the newspaper?
With huge headlines?

414
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:38,580
Of course. I'll become so much
more famous than this punk, Taek.

415
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:41,848
Have you decided?

416
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:46,470
Yeah.
I want to go to medical school.

417
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,568
Why? Are you following Michael there?

418
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:52,169
It's my mom's wish.

419
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,482
I don't exactly hate the idea.

420
00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:00,293
And I have nothing else
I'm passionate about.

421
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:03,284
Jerk.

422
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:06,593
You're going to medical school because
you have nothing you want to do?

423
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:10,478
Crazy jerk. Why do I hang out
with crazy jerks like you?

424
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,199
Speaking of which, I want to see
Deok Sun, all of the sudden.

425
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:14,722
Deok Sun, where are you?
Can you hear my voice?

426
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:17,691
Baseball fans,
you've been waiting a long time.

427
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,855
The 1989 professional baseball season
will start on April 8th...

428
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:23,730
...kicking off the 420 games
to be played this season.

429
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,570
Opening day will have three matches,
include Haitai, Binggrae, and Gwanju.

430
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,326
Haitai, last year's champion, still has.

431
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,876
Sun Dong Yol, Kim Sung Hwan,
and Lee Soon Chul.

432
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,968
They've also recruited Jo Gye Hyun
and Lee Kang Chul...

433
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,955
...and are expected to be the team
to beat once again this season.

434
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:42,441
The Pacific Dolphins, who finished
last season's campaign...

435
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:45,230
...have hired famous coach,
Kim Sung Geun...

436
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,658
...and have proclaimed that they
will not finish last this year...

437
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:48,936
We have to bet this year too.

438
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:50,388
You know, our annual bet.

439
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:54,528
Hey... why is the patient drinking?

440
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,681
We're going to drink it
all, so don't worry!

441
00:32:57,784 --> 00:33:01,414
Hey... it's fine. I'm
wearing a urine bag.

442
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:04,083
Uttering the most
disgusting things again...

443
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:08,121
Yeah. We have our
50,000 won pool again.

444
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:12,028
Jung Bong's dad won that last
year after betting on Haitai.

445
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,933
You sure don't know how to appreciate
the beauty of competition.

446
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:16,975
I mean...

447
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:21,777
...how could they not win with Sun Dong
Yol, Lee Soon Chul, and Kim Sung Hwan?

448
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:25,942
These three players will
succeed even in MLB.

449
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:30,526
Seriously... anyway, let's leave
Haitai out of our bets this time...

450
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:33,575
Leave them out, and bet on the rest.
How about that?

451
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:39,693
I think that the Pacific Dolphins
are going to stir up baseball this year.

452
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:41,372
Last year they finished last.

453
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:44,683
But they have Coach Kim Sung Geun
on board with them this year!

454
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,828
Starting this year, the top four teams
will make it to the playoffs.

455
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,545
They'll make it to the playoffs,
at the very least.

456
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:52,170
Hey, President Kim.

457
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:59,309
Did you get back surgery or brain surgery?
How did you turn romantic all of a sudden?

458
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:04,466
How could the Pacific Dolphins
make it to the top four?

459
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:07,794
No, I'm right.

460
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,674
I have a good feeling about them.

461
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,703
All right, let's bet on that then!

462
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:16,016
We'll bet on whether or not
they'll make it to the playoffs.

463
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:17,027
How about it?

464
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,327
-I'll bet that they will make it.
-Me too.

465
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:21,337
Then, I'll bet that they won't.

466
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,569
If I win, I get the entire pot.

467
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,200
-Yes.
-All right. Let's bet on it.

468
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:43,436
Yes, just like that, and pop! And pop!

469
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:49,624
All right!

470
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:55,024
Yes... that's amazing!
You'll get first place like this!

471
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,939
That's right!

472
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:01,300
Hey, my... for sure!

473
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:11,540
Hey, what's the point of dancing so well
when you can't sing along to the song?

474
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:16,832
Yeah, she's right! Get the instrumental!

475
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:19,318
Then you can start practice singing too!

476
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,843
Thats...
don't talk if you don't know.

477
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:26,527
At the preliminaries, it comes down
to being unique, or dancing.

478
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,757
Why are you acting like such amateurs?

479
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:32,730
Also, Teach Ryu said he would
find me an instrumental.

480
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,621
I have to practice singing with that.

481
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:39,896
But doesn't it seem like this tape
is a bit stretched out?

482
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,440
I think you've listened to it
way too many times!

483
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:43,811
Right?

484
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,479
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

485
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:48,118
-Yes!
-Yes!

486
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:53,941
What?
What do you need?

487
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:04,557
Jung Bong... that's not food.

488
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:12,994
Mother. If you take this out
after fifteen minutes...

489
00:36:13,026 --> 00:36:15,306
...you can enjoy it again,
as if it were brand new.

490
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:23,933
Thats... you're so smart, Jung Bong!

491
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:28,155
-Seriously.
-I'll be on my way. Thanks.

492
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:33,246
There's nothing that
he doesn't know!

493
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,295
And yet, he is now on his
seventh attempt at college.

494
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:38,758
I don't care if
he knows things like that...

495
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,024
I wish he knew how to
answer exam questions.

496
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:43,812
Here, have a shot.

497
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:32,269
-Hey, I can't see!
-Move over, already!

498
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:33,626
Hey, it's 11 p.m.

499
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,114
Night classes are over.
Time to go home. Bye, guys.

500
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,013
-I'm going, too.
-Me three.

501
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,036
-Bye.
-Bye!

502
00:37:56,011 --> 00:37:58,741
Hey! Why are you guys
coming out from there?

503
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,812
You didn't go to night class?
You cut class, didn't you?

504
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:03,332
-Mom...
-Hey!

505
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:07,177
Hey! Are you a dog or a human?
Or a dog?

506
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:11,379
You son of...
Why would you bite someone?

507
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,676
Bye.

508
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,519
Me too.
See you tomorrow.

509
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,334
What are you holding?

510
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:20,415
Goldfish bread. A nice plump one.
See you tomorrow, Special Forces!

511
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:22,098
Who are you calling "Special Forces"?

512
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,220
Yeah, come in.

513
00:38:31,515 --> 00:38:33,022
Hey. I brought you
some goldfish bread.

514
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:34,884
Thanks.

515
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:40,031
You guys watched a video together?

516
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:41,437
You watched something erotic again?

517
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:43,319
No. We watched Dirty Dancing.

518
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,168
We couldn't even watch the whole thing.

519
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:47,688
I'm being honest.

520
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:52,998
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

521
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:54,802
I'm taking an evening flight.

522
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,254
OK. Have a safe trip.

523
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,110
Yeah. You said Saturday, right?

524
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,797
Don't you forget again.

525
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,532
I'll call you after
my match ends on Friday.

526
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,724
Manager Lee and Assistant Manager Yoo
are going too, right?

527
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:10,144
Yeah, they're all coming.

528
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:11,859
Don't worry.

529
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,446
Why would I worry about you?

530
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:17,252
Deok Sun.

531
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:25,618
Can you give this to Jung Hwan?
He left it behind.

532
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:28,224
And he's the one always reprimanding me!

533
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:29,376
Thats...

534
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,886
Well, I'm off, Master Choi! Bye!

535
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:33,826
-OK. Bye!
-OK!

536
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:40,270
Hey, Dog Jung Pal! Your wallet!
You left it at Taek's!

537
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:44,208
Yeah... thanks.

538
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,823
The old chopstick pattern?

539
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:27,871
Darn it...

540
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:34,556
She's not dead, is she?

541
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:36,677
Yeah. She's breathing.

542
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:38,343
What's all this?

543
00:40:40,296 --> 00:40:41,591
This is a...

544
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:47,460
...nutritional supplement,
and this is a vitamin...

545
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:49,549
...and this is good for your eyes.

546
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:51,582
You guys can have these.
I have a lot at home.

547
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:54,380
Are you guys running a pharmacy?
Is your dad a pharmacist?

548
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:58,200
No. He bought these for me.

549
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,170
He said I need to be healthy,
since I'm a third year now.

550
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,618
He said if I'm malnourished,
I won't be able to study.

551
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,365
Hey... aren't you overnourished?

552
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:07,798
You eat fried bread ten times a day.

553
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,484
You'll really be in trouble
if you don't get into college.

554
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:12,556
Aren't all of your older
brothers in college, too?

555
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:13,964
What will we do about you?

556
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,251
Didn't you place 1,300th place this time?

557
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:18,054
Hey, what do you take me for?

558
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:20,034
I haven't hit the bottom yet, you know.

559
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:22,797
I'm in 1,280th place.

560
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:29,053
My dad told me to look forward to
my birthday morning, for my gift.

561
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:32,023
But I feel like a fleet of tutors
are going to come over that day.

562
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,455
I don't think tutoring
will help that much.

563
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:35,614
Hey.

564
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:40,392
OK.
I'm sorry.

565
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:44,490
-Bye.
-OK.

566
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,253
So uselessly strong!

567
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:56,669
Yes! Music!

568
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:04,631
Teacher!
It's not time for Korean Language.

569
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:05,766
It's time for Music.

570
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:13,226
Self-Study

571
00:42:16,227 --> 00:42:17,227
Quiet.

572
00:42:18,632 --> 00:42:21,461
Starting today, Music, French,
Home Economics, and Physical Education...

573
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,975
...will be self study periods.

574
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:28,352
You're all seniors now.
You have to study.

575
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:30,351
Open your books up
and get to studying.

576
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,587
Seriously!

577
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:33,734
Kids!

578
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:39,711
Even though it's hard now,
you'll look back on these times...

579
00:42:40,343 --> 00:42:43,611
...with fond memories,
when you get older and have kids. OK?

580
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:46,372
-No way!
-No way!

581
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:53,467
Yeah. You probably don't
understand what I mean, at your age.

582
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:57,242
You don't realize what a great
time in your life this is actually.

583
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:00,594
How would you guys know that now?

584
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:05,084
Study!

585
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:08,977
-Man...
-Man...

586
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:22,405
Hey! Be quiet!
Let's study, all right?

587
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:27,131
What is this? Did we learn this?

588
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,484
What is that you're solving?

589
00:45:31,655 --> 00:45:33,355
I think it's the first time
that I'm seeing this...

590
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:35,927
Or is that just a doodle?

591
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:41,391
What kind of doodle is that?

592
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,119
We were supposed to bring
recorders today, right?

593
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:10,224
Hey... I didn't bring mine!

594
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,845
I brought mine.

595
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:20,511
You really practiced hard, Nam Hyuk?

596
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:23,928
I'll just take the corporal punishment.

597
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,299
OK. Next.

598
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:45,403
Darn it...

599
00:46:48,023 --> 00:46:50,146
Hey... hitting you guys
is wearing me out.

600
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:55,715
Hey, just sing a song
and take a seat.

601
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:56,848
Excuse me?

602
00:46:58,798 --> 00:47:00,100
What are you waiting for?

603
00:47:00,746 --> 00:47:03,080
Teacher, please,
just hit me instead.

604
00:47:04,398 --> 00:47:07,552
My arm hurts!
Hurry up and sing something.

605
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:09,621
Should I go borrow a rod
from the class next door?

606
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:14,155
-Sing!
-Sing!

607
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:17,637
Hey, we're not expecting much,
so hurry up and sing.

608
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:18,994
OK, applaud!

609
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:57,367
Taek hasn't left yet, right?

610
00:47:57,525 --> 00:47:59,525
No, he hasn't.
He's studying in his room.

611
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:03,113
What's this?

612
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,844
I made some abalone rice porridge.

613
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:07,743
I got my paycheck yesterday.

614
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:10,891
So when I went to the market,
I bought some fresh abalone.

615
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:16,144
Give that to him before he leaves,
and you can just microwave the leftovers.

616
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,471
Give it to him,
while it's still nice and warm.

617
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:22,053
Hey... thanks.

618
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:27,059
Taek skipped breakfast and lunch,
and he was going to skip dinner

619
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,799
so I was wondering
what I should feed him.

620
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:31,499
This is great. Yeah.

621
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,251
Why don't you eat with us?

622
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:37,658
And bring Jin Joo, too.

623
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,042
No, that's OK, that's OK.
I'll get going then.

624
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:05,918
Thats... Taek.

625
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:11,820
I have something that I want to tell you.

626
00:49:15,114 --> 00:49:20,504
Dad. I'm not a kid.
It's OK. Just tell me.

627
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:22,451
OK.

628
00:49:27,351 --> 00:49:28,530
I wish...

629
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:33,462
I had a good friend by my side,
like the ones that you have.

630
00:49:38,054 --> 00:49:39,937
I haven't decided on anything yet, but...

631
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:42,365
I...

632
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,891
...with Sun Woo's mom...
as good friends...

633
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:54,793
...as someone to talk to...

634
00:49:57,545 --> 00:50:01,047
I'd like to spend the remainder
of my life with her.

635
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:07,751
But Taek...

636
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:12,746
If you don't like the idea...

637
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,700
I won't become friends with her.

638
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:19,065
Thats...

639
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:21,924
What I would hate most...

640
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,862
...would be you feeling uncomfortable.

641
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:34,415
Also, this is... well...

642
00:50:34,947 --> 00:50:38,531
It's something that I've thought about,
without speaking to anyone.

643
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:43,329
Nothing has been decided
yet, or anything like that.

644
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:46,825
It's just that...

645
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:53,271
I... wanted to talk to you about it first
to get your permission.

646
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:56,344
That's why I'm putting this out there.

647
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,506
I won't...

648
00:51:03,899 --> 00:51:05,907
...ever do anything you're against.

649
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:19,258
Dad...

650
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,000
I want you...

651
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:28,678
...to have a warm meal, even
when I'm not here with you.

652
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,796
It's your life, Dad.

653
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:43,389
I want you to be happy.

654
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:49,039
If it will make you happy,
then I'm fine with it all.

655
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,546
Finish your food.

656
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:00,510
OK.

657
00:52:13,646 --> 00:52:15,971
Mom! What time is it?

658
00:52:16,562 --> 00:52:19,897
Let's see...
It's seven fifty...

659
00:52:35,328 --> 00:52:37,787
Hey, you're late!

660
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:39,655
Can you even think about
joking around right now?

661
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,610
Grow up, already!

662
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,811
Don't you yell at me,
when you're late too!

663
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,397
Hey.

664
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:02,299
Thank you.

665
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:08,773
Hey. Let me have a bite.

666
00:53:10,049 --> 00:53:11,049
What's your blood type?

667
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:12,698
Never mind.

668
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:17,015
Here.

669
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:23,813
Well... I'm sure our Taek
is in China by now.

670
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,318
-Deok Sun, what are you doing tomorrow?
-Tomorrow? Saturday?

671
00:53:28,978 --> 00:53:30,248
I might be meeting Taek.

672
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:36,477
Our Taek has to win today,
for sure. Right, Deok Sun?

673
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:40,657
What are you talking about?
And also, stop doing that to Taek.

674
00:53:40,878 --> 00:53:43,054
How can he win every day?
He can lose sometimes too.

675
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:45,820
Heedong will win today, for sure.

676
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:52,517
-Here, hand me your bag.
-Thank you.

677
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:58,515
You think Taek is good at Baduk
because he's smart, right?

678
00:53:59,258 --> 00:54:00,609
That may be true.

679
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,982
But there's another reason
behind his victories.

680
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:05,858
What?

681
00:54:06,404 --> 00:54:07,404
His competitiveness.

682
00:54:09,198 --> 00:54:10,601
It's incredible, really.

683
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:13,303
There are two fiercely competitive
people in our neighborhood.

684
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:16,592
Jung Bong oppa. He's the type
to fight to the finish, also.

685
00:54:17,662 --> 00:54:20,897
Kim Jung Bong and Choi Taek.
Something famous links these two.

686
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:22,793
Galaga.

687
00:54:23,658 --> 00:54:25,569
Before Jung Bong hyung became
crazy about Bubble Bobble...

688
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:27,698
...there was once a time,
he was crazy about Galaga.

689
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:29,884
He went to the arcade
every day back then.

690
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:32,005
He was having mini turf wars
with elementary schoolers.

691
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:35,206
Thats, how humiliating. I didn't see him
for a while because of that.

692
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:39,617
But even so, he managed to get his name
on the top of the high score scoreboard.

693
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:42,976
Galaga - 50 won for one round

694
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:55,824
Two people may not play
the same game at the same time!

695
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:14,414
Here, give me your bag.

696
00:55:15,307 --> 00:55:16,749
Thank you.

697
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,482
Then, one day...

698
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:27,365
...he went to the arcade, and
someone had beaten his high score.

699
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:31,894
And Jung Bong hyung had clearly been
in first place the day before that.

700
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:34,698
So, he went early
the next morning, and...

701
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:01,754
Daekwang Computer Game Room

702
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:38,567
When Taek has free time,
he has a lot of free time.

703
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,220
He must have had a lot of free time then.

704
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:46,678
That was the day of the
Guksu Competition.

705
00:56:47,493 --> 00:56:48,653
Crazy jerk.

706
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,980
Me?

707
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:53,781
-You're not talking about me, right?
-I'm talking about Choi Taek.

708
00:56:54,112 --> 00:56:57,555
He really is! He can't settle
for second place, no matter what.

709
00:56:57,727 --> 00:56:59,105
Thats... that nasty jerk.

710
00:56:59,422 --> 00:57:01,838
What's so nasty about that?
That's just simple immaturity.

711
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:05,316
Regardless, he'll win today, for sure.

712
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,064
He has a goal that he's working for.

713
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:12,058
Since he has something to work for,
he'll win today, for sure.

714
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:13,948
You watch.

715
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:28,875
Hai Lun Hotel, Shanghai, China.
ING Cup, Final Match

716
00:57:54,636 --> 00:57:56,024
Did Taek win?

717
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,762
Did he win?

718
00:57:58,228 --> 00:57:59,228
What is this?

719
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:00,966
You weren't listening to the news?

720
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,958
It's not time for the news yet.
The match probably isn't even over yet.

721
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:07,547
-Salamander is competing, too?
-Yeah. He's singing a pop song.

722
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:14,902
Don't worry. This competition
is all about dance skills.

723
00:58:14,957 --> 00:58:18,547
Pop song, my ass...
Don't you worry.

724
00:58:18,747 --> 00:58:19,849
You'll beat Salamander, for sure.

725
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,192
I'm playing it.

726
00:58:48,244 --> 00:58:50,411
You missed it again!

727
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:52,614
You can't miss the beat there!

728
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:54,703
-I basically have it!
-No!

729
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,417
You have to stay on beat,
no matter what.

730
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:02,212
Mi Ran.
I have to pee, I have to pee!

731
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:09,499
-Does it come out?
-Yeah! It's going to come out!

732
00:59:15,355 --> 00:59:16,371
It's coming out!

733
00:59:37,497 --> 00:59:38,561
Hey, you're here?

734
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:41,376
Oppa, it's OK.
Give her to me. I got it.

735
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,130
It's OK. Let's go.
I'll tuck her in.

736
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:12,928
Did you hear from Taek?

737
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,002
Not yet.
I'm sure I will, though.

738
01:00:15,898 --> 01:00:17,838
-It's cold. Go inside.
-You too.

739
01:00:18,163 --> 01:00:19,219
OK.

740
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:25,169
Hey... Thats. Sun Young.

741
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:27,242
Yes? What is it?

742
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,629
Nothing.
Never mind.

743
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,776
I'll get going then.

744
01:01:04,763 --> 01:01:07,556
Mi Ran!
My teeth!

745
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:27,771
I think your tape stretched out.

746
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:29,854
How many times happen?

747
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:32,392
What do we do?
Isn't tomorrow the preliminaries?

748
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:33,921
Where will we get a new one?

749
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,909
-Just wait.
-OK...

750
01:01:55,108 --> 01:01:56,854
Thats...

751
01:01:57,636 --> 01:01:59,087
That's nothing, really.

752
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:01,914
Thats... I really do live with a genius.

753
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:04,083
Hurry, go inside.
I changed your blankets.

754
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:07,539
No, it's OK. I'm going to watch
the late news before I go to bed.

755
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,290
Isn't today Taek's final round
of the ING Cup?

756
01:02:58,725 --> 01:02:59,725
Hello?

757
01:03:00,231 --> 01:03:01,622
It's me, Man Ok.

758
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:03,711
Yes, I know.

759
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:07,429
Did your late
self study session end well?

760
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:10,496
Yes. Deok Sun is home now too, right?

761
01:03:11,145 --> 01:03:13,349
I don't know.
I'm sure she is though.

762
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:15,043
I don't care.

763
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:17,781
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

764
01:03:18,696 --> 01:03:22,096
Did... is your father sleeping?
Is it OK for you to talk?

765
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:24,153
Yes, he just went to work.

766
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:28,085
OK... I mean, he
went to see someone.

767
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:32,711
I'm sure you haven't
forgotten about Monday.

768
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:33,592
No.

769
01:03:33,695 --> 01:03:38,763
I'll happily wait at the bus stop
outside your house at 2 p.m.!

770
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:43,515
I do have to eat breakfast and spend time
with my family since it's my birthday...

771
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:44,997
...so I might be a bit late...

772
01:03:45,008 --> 01:03:46,438
Hello? Who are you, jerk?

773
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:48,241
Dad!

774
01:04:06,945 --> 01:04:08,504
I'm back from school!

775
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:10,399
-Mom, I'm home!
-I'm home.

776
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,593
I'm back from school,
and so is the dean.

777
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:15,118
Shut it, you rascal!
I'm not a dean anymore, you rascal!

778
01:04:15,613 --> 01:04:16,898
Yes, Sir.

779
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:27,822
OK...

780
01:04:29,938 --> 01:04:33,538
Hey, it's already April.

781
01:04:35,391 --> 01:04:37,871
Yeah... Bo Ra isn't home yet?

782
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:41,846
She studies at the library
until past midnight these days.

783
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:48,344
Boy. This will be the last
day she comes home late.

784
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:53,573
Yeah. Honey, come straight home
after you're done with work.

785
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,116
You have to see her off, at least.

786
01:04:57,562 --> 01:05:03,675
Hey, it's not like she's immigrating.
She's staying at a hostel.

787
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:08,430
There's no need to have a goodbye
party for her or anything. So tacky!

788
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:11,734
Also, I'll be busy at the bank tomorrow.
I might not be able to make it.

789
01:05:11,853 --> 01:05:12,894
So just know that.

790
01:05:13,135 --> 01:05:14,135
It's not even a big deal...

791
01:05:14,975 --> 01:05:16,485
Mom, you bought new blankets too?

792
01:05:16,691 --> 01:05:20,624
Yeah... she's moving out.
I can't give her old blankets.

793
01:05:22,238 --> 01:05:28,148
I want to eat out with her and
get her some herbal medicine, but...

794
01:05:31,835 --> 01:05:35,593
Darn it... did he win or lose?
Why isn't he calling?

795
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,822
It's over. You may come in.

796
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:52,754
Who's the winner?
Choi Taek? Or Chang Hao?

797
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,744
Congratulations.
Korea won this time too.

798
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,280
Choi Taek, 6 dan, won.

799
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,547
Yes! We won, right? Right?

800
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:08,167
-Yeah!
-Yes!

801
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:09,223
Thank you.

802
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:13,935
In the second round...

803
01:06:14,658 --> 01:06:17,098
It was very competitive...

804
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:20,442
Choi Taek has finally won the ING Cup.

805
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:24,605
During the final match,
in Shanghai, China.

806
01:06:24,835 --> 01:06:28,197
Korea's Choi Taek, 6 dan played
against Chang Hao, 9 dan, of China...

807
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:32,209
...built three more areas than
his opponent, and prevailed victorious.

808
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:35,975
These two players had a tight match
from the beginning.

809
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,945
At first, it seemed that Choi Taek
was at a disadvantage. However...

810
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:13,946
Hello?
Is this Deok Sun?

811
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,125
Yeah, it's me, Taek.

812
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:22,113
Deok Sun.

813
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:42,437
Noona. It's OK!
Why did you run like that?

814
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:44,811
I'm really fine.

815
01:08:49,336 --> 01:08:50,722
I'm really fine.

816
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:15,147
Honey... Mi Ran!

817
01:09:24,084 --> 01:09:25,475
Should I tag along?

818
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:27,691
Where would you go?
With your back like this?

819
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:30,233
Just stay at home for a bit.
I'll be back soon.

820
01:09:31,115 --> 01:09:35,295
Honey... even if you get cut, you can't
run away out of humiliation, OK?

821
01:09:35,706 --> 01:09:37,366
OK? Come straight home!

822
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:41,275
I have to poop. I have to eat...

823
01:09:41,993 --> 01:09:44,557
I can't live without you.

824
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,433
All right, all right.

825
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:52,335
Missus! Isn't it time for you to go?
Let's go together!

826
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:53,755
OK, come in!

827
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:58,707
Sorry... Jung Bong's father.
Missus, let's go!

828
01:09:58,913 --> 01:10:00,343
I'll be your manager today.

829
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,277
We still have some time.
And I have to put on some makeup.

830
01:10:03,556 --> 01:10:06,136
-OK.
-The eggs are here!

831
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:09,681
The egg man is here!
I have to go buy some. Just a moment.

832
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:11,134
Wait for me!

833
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:18,848
-We have eggs too.
-Here you go. Your change. Thank you.

834
01:10:19,054 --> 01:10:22,010
Your makeup looks flawless today!

835
01:10:22,909 --> 01:10:24,353
I'll come back tomorrow!

836
01:10:26,686 --> 01:10:29,055
-Mister!
-Yes, hello!

837
01:10:30,536 --> 01:10:32,235
Give us one tray of eggs too.

838
01:10:32,426 --> 01:10:34,954
And three bags, please.

839
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:36,716
Thank you for the beverage!

840
01:10:37,193 --> 01:10:38,988
Are you going to share them with us?

841
01:10:42,215 --> 01:10:44,152
Let's see here.

842
01:10:44,629 --> 01:10:46,790
Hey, Mister.

843
01:10:46,801 --> 01:10:49,079
You should change the tape.
You make a lot of money as it is.

844
01:10:49,193 --> 01:10:51,248
It's totally stretched out!

845
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:54,203
I do have a lot of money,
but not a lot of time.

846
01:10:54,214 --> 01:10:56,404
When would I have the time
to re-record this?

847
01:10:56,474 --> 01:10:58,437
You don't need to re-record that.

848
01:10:59,138 --> 01:11:01,067
Give it to me.
I'll take care of it for you.

849
01:11:01,169 --> 01:11:02,309
Thats.

850
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:12,681
Just wait for 15 minutes.

851
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:17,734
Then, the tape will sound
as fresh as your eggs.

852
01:11:17,896 --> 01:11:21,295
Thats, really?
That's so fascinating!

853
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:23,349
I just found out recently, myself.

854
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,639
Mister, you've saved money!

855
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:32,791
Then I'll be selling some eggs
while the tape is freezing.

856
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:34,369
-OK.
-Go ahead.

857
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:41,556
Hurry up and get ready!
You're going to be late!

858
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:43,346
Thats already late...

859
01:11:43,793 --> 01:11:45,505
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

860
01:11:45,523 --> 01:11:48,795
-I feel like I'll look old.
-This one looks chic.

861
01:11:49,108 --> 01:11:50,693
This one makes you look too young!

862
01:11:50,704 --> 01:11:52,964
-But I am young!
-Yes.

863
01:11:53,037 --> 01:11:56,662
Just wear whatever!
You look pretty no matter what you wear.

864
01:11:56,773 --> 01:11:57,916
what.

865
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:07,824
Here's a tray of eggs, on me!

866
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:11,955
You don't have to do that!
One tray is so expensive!

867
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,006
No, it's OK!
I have so many of them anyway!

868
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:19,186
Ahjussi! You have to take the tape!

869
01:12:19,575 --> 01:12:22,315
Yeah... My brain is all over the place.

870
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:35,915
Thank you!
Ladies, may you be blessed!

871
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,037
-See you again!
-Goodbye!

872
01:12:39,325 --> 01:12:41,708
This one is for younger people!

873
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:44,567
National Singing Contest Preliminaries

874
01:12:52,394 --> 01:12:53,505
Over here.

875
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,903
Over here! Here, here!

876
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:06,444
Who are you waving at?

877
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:08,804
Salamander!
He's right before us.

878
01:13:09,512 --> 01:13:12,371
It's... it's hard for me
to even recognize him.

879
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:16,782
-Hello!
-Hi.

880
01:13:44,517 --> 01:13:47,435
Next up is... let's see, here.

881
01:13:50,065 --> 01:13:54,519
Numbers 81 to 90!
Those ten people, please come in.

882
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:59,618
I'm only saying this once!
Numbers 81 to 90!

883
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:00,726
All right?

884
01:14:03,675 --> 01:14:05,968
-My God, I'm so nervous.
-Hey, what about your instrumental track?

885
01:14:06,615 --> 01:14:07,691
Where is it?

886
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:09,416
They have a pianist.

887
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,013
That's not very exciting, though!

888
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:16,487
Why isn't the person before you here?
Number 92, right?

889
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:19,038
I wonder that too.
Maybe they gave up?

890
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:25,251
My dad, the dean....

891
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:31,329
...and my mom, the
Insurance Queen, yeah!

892
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:38,375
You're so good! You'll go to the next
round, You really sing like a Westerner.

893
01:14:38,764 --> 01:14:43,761
It's not too late...
If you'll come back to my side...

894
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,992
I'll love you...

895
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,145
...forever!

896
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:01,556
You don't need to come out, Mom.
I told you, don't.

897
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:05,197
Still, I still need to see you off.

898
01:15:05,555 --> 01:15:07,089
It's cold though!

899
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:08,622
I can do what I want.

900
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:11,743
Hurry up and go inside. It's not like
I'm doing something amazing.

901
01:15:12,102 --> 01:15:13,375
I'm going to speed away, all right?

902
01:15:13,589 --> 01:15:14,695
All right, all right. Hurry, go.

903
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:18,895
Yeah... Also, your dad has
a lot of work at the bank today, so...

904
01:15:19,054 --> 01:15:22,463
-So he called me to tell me that before.
-It's fine! Dad doesn't need to come!

905
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:24,259
I'm off.

906
01:15:25,235 --> 01:15:26,348
I'll call often.

907
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:27,905
Sure you will!

908
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:33,920
OK. We can't call you,
so make sure you do call us.

909
01:15:34,517 --> 01:15:39,267
You don't have to call every day,
but call at least once a week.

910
01:15:39,362 --> 01:15:40,365
OK?

911
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,491
OK.
I'll be going now.

912
01:15:41,522 --> 01:15:43,760
-OK. Take care of yourself!
-OK!

913
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:22,535
Hey... Mom.

914
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:26,804
She's not going far.
Why are you acting like this?

915
01:16:32,249 --> 01:16:35,140
What about Dad? He said he'd be late,
even though it's Saturday?

916
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:42,084
He seemed to be really busy at work.

917
01:16:42,505 --> 01:16:45,778
It would have been nice if he could have
come home early on a day like today.

918
01:17:20,162 --> 01:17:21,551
What are you doing here?

919
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:25,063
No, no... no need to get out.

920
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,563
Here, take this.

921
01:17:38,706 --> 01:17:40,024
For when your head hurts

922
01:17:43,781 --> 01:17:45,465
For when you get body aches
and you're fatigued

923
01:17:50,036 --> 01:17:54,125
When you have a bad cold

924
01:18:01,108 --> 01:18:02,755
They sell medicine over there too!

925
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:05,392
There's a pharmacy in Sillim dong too!

926
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:11,590
Also, here. Take this.

927
01:18:23,102 --> 01:18:25,269
Buy and eat meat for
yourself once in a while.

928
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,175
It's not much.

929
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:35,105
Don't buy crappy 500 won meals.
Have some meat every so often.

930
01:18:44,268 --> 01:18:47,680
Hurry and go. A car may come behind you.

931
01:18:50,578 --> 01:18:52,478
Dad, you go first.

932
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:56,657
Hurry up and go!

933
01:19:08,929 --> 01:19:10,489
Hurry up and go.

934
01:19:16,014 --> 01:19:17,249
Bye!

935
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,702
If something happens, call us!

936
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:12,962
OK... next, numbers 91 to 100. Come in!

937
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,026
That's us. Let's go.

938
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,056
Let's go.

939
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:41,286
Next up is you!
Good luck, Salamander!

940
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,027
I guess number 92 really isn't here.

941
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:48,133
I guess they ran off. Even us,
professionals, get butterflies after all.

942
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,317
How could they compete?

943
01:20:49,962 --> 01:20:51,238
Yes, good work.

944
01:20:54,346 --> 01:20:57,564
OK... next, number 92.
Please step forward.

945
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:02,576
Number 92?
You're not here?

946
01:21:02,788 --> 01:21:04,108
They're not here.
They ran off!

947
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:07,230
Over here.
I'm here!

948
01:21:16,702 --> 01:21:20,285
He... looks like
he's amazing at singing.

949
01:21:21,345 --> 01:21:22,749
I wonder what song he'll sing.

950
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:25,251
A trot song, probably.
It has to be a trot song.

951
01:21:25,584 --> 01:21:29,115
Please tell us your name,
and the song you'll be singing.

952
01:21:29,855 --> 01:21:36,830
I teach English
at a cram school in Banghakdong.

953
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:38,394
I'm Stevie Greg.

954
01:21:39,115 --> 01:21:44,115
And I'll be singing Stevie Wonder's
"I Just Called to Say I Love You."

955
01:22:07,944 --> 01:22:08,982
Please, go ahead.

956
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:20,030
No New Year's Day...

957
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:22,262
Yes, thank you.

958
01:22:24,535 --> 01:22:25,535
May you be healthy.

959
01:22:32,768 --> 01:22:34,349
Come back in.

960
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:42,181
Excuse me!

961
01:22:43,862 --> 01:22:45,439
Ahjumonni, are you here?

962
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:49,633
The door is open! Come in!

963
01:22:52,525 --> 01:22:53,655
Hey boy...

964
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:58,119
-Ahjummoni isn't here?
-No. What's the matter?

965
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:02,655
Well, you see...
we swapped tapes by accident.

966
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:04,681
What?

967
01:23:12,644 --> 01:23:13,746
Hello.

968
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,391
I'm Jung Bong's mom
from Ssangmundong...

969
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:20,102
...the Singing Cheetah... Ra Mi Ran.

970
01:23:20,511 --> 01:23:21,596
You're ready, right?

971
01:23:22,022 --> 01:23:24,280
Yes. I'll begin.

972
01:23:47,187 --> 01:23:50,088
The eggs are here!

973
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:56,037
Large and fresh eggs are here!

974
01:23:57,228 --> 01:24:00,507
We even have... eggs.

975
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:06,174
Large and fresh eggs are here!

976
01:24:07,324 --> 01:24:09,441
The eggs are here!

977
01:24:10,441 --> 01:24:14,134
We even have... eggs!

978
01:24:16,295 --> 01:24:18,003
Good work. Next.

979
01:24:18,082 --> 01:24:20,641
Wait, wait!
I haven't done anything yet...

980
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:25,072
Thats... how are you planning
on performing without background music?

981
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:30,142
You're doing Yoon Soo Il's
"A Thrilling Confession."

982
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:33,391
I can do it!

983
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:50,607
Good work.

984
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:55,239
The streets burning with neon lights...

985
01:24:56,053 --> 01:25:01,162
You and I, who met
under the streetlights...

986
01:25:03,904 --> 01:25:05,858
-I'm lost in thought...
-Thank you.

987
01:25:06,661 --> 01:25:09,020
-Wondering what you're doing now...
-Sorry.

988
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:10,308
-Thank you!
-I absentmindedly...

989
01:25:10,507 --> 01:25:13,144
...start missing that day!

990
01:25:14,933 --> 01:25:21,597
Eyes on fire,
those thirsty lips!

991

["Don't Sleep!" Study Room]
The stars fall asleep!

992
01:25:39,744 --> 01:25:43,422
Hey. Forget about it.
You're not the only one who failed.

993
01:26:07,347 --> 01:26:08,707
Hey. Let's go.

994
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:11,397
-Where?
-Let's go play soccer.

995
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,864
Right now?
The field is closed.

996
01:26:15,192 --> 01:26:17,144
I know a back entrance.

997
01:26:17,499 --> 01:26:18,739
Hurry up. Let's go.

998
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:24,068
Hey! Come with us. Hurry up!

Folk Remedies Self-Treatments
for Hemorrhoids and Constipation

1000
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:40,925
Honey. Did everyone from
our neighborhood fail, then?

1001
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:48,174
You failed, and Salamander failed...
everyone failed!

1002
01:26:50,295 --> 01:26:51,764
One person made it.

1003
01:26:52,525 --> 01:26:54,765
Who?
Who made it?

1004
01:26:55,289 --> 01:26:58,761
Thats... you can never know
when it comes to people.

1005
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,558
I didn't know they had talent.

1006
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:04,881
No Eul.

1007
01:27:05,284 --> 01:27:06,284
What?

1008
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:11,109
No Eul made it.
And with a ballad at that.

1009
01:27:12,635 --> 01:27:14,351
No Eul sings?

1010
01:27:15,742 --> 01:27:18,228
That shy kid? Right?

1011
01:27:19,158 --> 01:27:20,245
I know, right?

1012
01:27:27,695 --> 01:27:29,445
We have just one person left, right?

1013
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,982
Yes... one last person.

1014
01:27:33,364 --> 01:27:35,388
He didn't register beforehand...

1015
01:27:35,499 --> 01:27:38,471
...but there weren't many ballads
today, so I told him that it's fine.

1016
01:27:38,743 --> 01:27:40,123
And he seems a bit older, too.

1017
01:27:41,109 --> 01:27:43,124
-I'll tell him to come in.
-OK.

1019
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:50,404
Hello.

1020
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:19,234
As I watch that figure going...

1021
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:24,025
...farther and farther away...

1022
01:28:25,716 --> 01:28:28,053
I still...

1023
01:28:28,568 --> 01:28:31,741
...won't call...

1024
01:28:32,209 --> 01:28:37,518
...this moment a goodbye.

1025
01:28:38,424 --> 01:28:41,309
-Sing!
-Sing!

1026
01:28:41,384 --> 01:28:44,741
Hey, hey. We're not expecting much,
so just sing. OK, applaud!

1027
01:28:59,397 --> 01:29:05,236
As I watch that figure going...

1028
01:29:05,522 --> 01:29:11,466
...farther and farther away...

1029
01:29:13,072 --> 01:29:15,692
The two hearts...

1030
01:29:16,263 --> 01:29:19,960
...drenched in
numerous memories...

1031
01:29:20,043 --> 01:29:27,012
How shall we forget?

1032
01:29:27,641 --> 01:29:33,487
You will come back...

1033
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:40,215
...you can't stand loneliness.

1034
01:29:41,711 --> 01:29:46,804
You will come back...

1035
01:29:47,089 --> 01:29:52,881
...to my side.

1036
01:29:53,303 --> 01:29:56,790
But when that time comes...

1037
01:29:56,996 --> 01:30:00,056
...when I meet you again...

1038
01:30:00,206 --> 01:30:05,625
Could we love again?

1039
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:12,440
During that passing time.

1040
01:30:12,665 --> 01:30:14,859
How much...

1041
01:30:14,906 --> 01:30:19,831
...tears would I shed?

1042
01:30:34,019 --> 01:30:35,139
Why are you here?

1043
01:30:35,643 --> 01:30:36,810
Why did you come to the study room?

1044
01:30:37,254 --> 01:30:39,366
-Why are you here?
-What is this? Why the study room?

1045
01:30:39,437 --> 01:30:41,993
Hey. Can't I study a little bit?

1046
01:30:42,138 --> 01:30:43,273
I can't come here?

1047
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,761
No, I mean... didn't
you meet up with Taek?

1048
01:30:46,142 --> 01:30:47,424
You two were supposed to see a movie.

1049
01:30:47,946 --> 01:30:49,233
Taek said that he couldn't come.

1050
01:30:49,504 --> 01:30:51,388
He has something important to do,

1051
01:30:53,467 --> 01:30:54,527
I'll be going now.

1052
01:30:57,184 --> 01:31:00,157
Nothing's working out for me these days.

1053
01:31:04,438 --> 01:31:06,298
Taek isn't the type to do that.
I wonder what's up.

1054
01:31:07,314 --> 01:31:08,395
I don't know...

1055
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:25,136
Hello? Is this Deok Sun?

1056
01:31:27,075 --> 01:31:28,513
Yeah, it's me, Taek.

1057
01:31:32,315 --> 01:31:33,315
Deok Sun.

1058
01:31:34,059 --> 01:31:35,554
Yeah, are you OK?

1059
01:31:35,927 --> 01:31:37,188
You've worked hard.

1060
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,637
I don't think I'll be able
to come tomorrow.

1061
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:44,054
There's something that came up
at the Baduk Club.

1062
01:31:44,603 --> 01:31:48,342
Really... really?
I see...

1063
01:31:49,851 --> 01:31:51,251
Is it something important?

1064
01:31:51,764 --> 01:31:54,643
Yeah. I have to go.

1065
01:31:57,193 --> 01:32:00,498
Then... OK. I'm sure it really
is important, if you say so.

1066
01:32:00,864 --> 01:32:03,244
It's OK.
I can just see you next time.

1067
01:32:04,202 --> 01:32:05,938
Hurry up and go to sleep.

1068
01:32:06,055 --> 01:32:08,284
-OK?
-OK.

1069
01:32:09,955 --> 01:32:10,955
Deok Sun...

1070
01:32:12,264 --> 01:32:13,264
I'm sorry.

1071
01:32:13,537 --> 01:32:16,968
It's fine. Go to sleep, already.

1072
01:32:17,716 --> 01:32:18,891
Good night!

1073
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,778
Yeah, come in.

1074
01:34:03,801 --> 01:34:05,655
I'll be going then, Master Choi! Bye!

1075
01:34:05,715 --> 01:34:07,515
-OK. Bye.
-OK!

1076
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:28,053
Master Choi!
I'll wake you up tomorrow.

1077
01:34:28,474 --> 01:34:29,654
What time is your morning call?

1078
01:34:34,028 --> 01:34:38,435
Manager Lee. Can I get my plane
ticket for tomorrow changed?

1079
01:34:38,942 --> 01:34:42,421
What? Yeah, it should be fine. Why?

1080
01:34:42,829 --> 01:34:44,013
You're going home with us tomorrow?

1081
01:34:44,824 --> 01:34:47,412
Yes. I'll come home on Sunday, too.

1082
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:49,350
All right.

1083
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:56,978
Also... I'm sorry... but please
don't wake me up tomorrow.

1084
01:34:57,629 --> 01:34:58,924
I want to rest in my room.

1085
01:35:00,132 --> 01:35:03,785
OK. It's not like this is
our first gig. Go on and rest.

1086
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:05,914
You've worked hard, Choi Taek!

1087
01:35:08,856 --> 01:35:10,584
Yes.
