1
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:37,925
February 1989
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong

2
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,627
Dad.

3
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:20,523
Can't we move?

4
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:22,523
What's this sudden talk of moving?

5
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:25,164
It's too cold!
I feel like I'll freeze to death!

6
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:28,995
If you're cold, you can just
layer up like I did!

7
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:33,256
I've been doing that
since November, OK?

8
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:37,726
Look at how cold Sung Bo Ra's
hand is! It's like ice!

9
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:38,817
Darn it!

10
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,081
She usually has cold limbs.

11
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,602
I'm sorry. Just bear it for a bit longer.

12
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,666
We're almost done paying off our debts.

13
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:56,730
I have nothing to say.

14
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:57,906
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:05,923
Yeah... Where did your mom go,
so early in the morning?

16
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,314
She just put this on the stove and left.

17
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,902
Let's eat.

18
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,692
Did Mother go somewhere?

19
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:27,910
I don't know. She put on a bunch of
makeup and headed out this morning.

20
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:36,954
Say "Ah!"

21
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,449
Where did Mom go?

22
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,137
I don't know. She didn't tell me either.

23
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,329
Say "Ah."

24
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:58,784
What is it that you're curious about?

25
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:09,979
Our three kids are all the same age.
They're all going to be seniors...

26
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,323
and my son is a decent student...

27
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:16,922
will he be able to get into
Seoul University?

28
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,480
And what about my son?
Will he be able to get in, too?

29
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,112
I have a daughter... will she be able
to make it into any college in Seoul?

30
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,018
Ask one at a time.

31
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:29,703
Then, I'll go first.

32
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,685
My son is pretty good at studying

33
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:38,058
but luck plays a big part
in taking exams, so...

34
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,344
He'll be able to get into
Seoul University, right?

35
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:44,965
You'll have great fortune.

36
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,420
What?

37
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:51,059
This year, your eldest son
will have great fortune.

38
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:52,783
Excuse me?

39
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,947
My... how strange!

40
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,521
How did she know that
you had an older son?

41
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,924
My eldest son?

42
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:06,957
Yeah... the younger one
will do fine on his own

43
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:11,629
and your older son... you know, the one
who always causes you grief...

44
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:16,444
By "Great fortune,"
what do you mean, exactly?

45
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,327
Do I need to tell you all that?

46
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:20,744
No... no, no, no.

47
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:25,858
Ma'am... by "this year," do you mean the
Lunar calendar or the Gregorian calendar?

48
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:29,441
Foolish girl. Of course I mean
the Lunar calendar.

49
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:33,668
There isn't much time left
in the year, then!

50
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,220
-It'll be the Lunar New Year soon!
-Yeah.

51
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,839
There isn't even a week left
in the Lunar year.

52
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:42,915
My god... what if he wins
the lottery again?

53
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,009
Is there something that
comes to mind?

54
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:49,661
-What is it?
-What?

55
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,350
The announcement for the wait listed
candidates will be announced soon!

56
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,621
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

57
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,158
Your suffering is over now!
Congratulations!

58
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,835
My god... there was something
that important coming up!

59
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,773
It must be that!

60
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:07,768
If you're all going to chatter among
yourselves, go to a coffee shop!

61
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:12,174
Next.

62
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:16,267
What about my son? Will he be able
to make it into Seoul University?

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,957
I see a greater happiness than that...
in your fate.

64
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:32,174
Excuse me?

65
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,675
In my fate? Mine?

66
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,241
What is it, exactly?

67
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,938
Fortune Teller

68
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,361
What?

69
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:52,394
Stop laughing. Life is
full of twists and turns.

70
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:57,474
Also, doesn't it seem like
I'm getting prettier lately?

71
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,593
No, you haven't gotten
any prettier.

72
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:02,991
Next.

73
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:04,603
Yes.

74
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,656
I have a daughter.

75
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:13,359
-But she...
-Really sucks at studying, right?

76
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,108
-Yes!
-She's so on-point!

77
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,435
She really couldn't study
to save her life.

78
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:20,803
I'm not even hoping for her
to get into a college in Seoul

79
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,387
and I'd be satisfied if she got into
any sort of college whatsoever

80
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,464
but will my Deok Sun
be able to make it into college?

81
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,808
-Change it.
-Change what, ma'am?

82
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,563
Her name is the problem.
Her name is Deok Sun?

83
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:37,758
Yes... yes, it is. Sung Deok Sun.

84
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,519
Her name is the problem.

85
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,932
Because of her name,
she's doing poorly in school.

86
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:50,002
Change her name and don't call her
Deok Sun until she goes to college.

87
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,853
Don't even use that name anymore. Got it?

88
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:56,508
Also, just be aware that
the rank of the college she'll go to

89
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,876
will get lower and lower every time
you call her Deok Sun. Got that?

90
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,556
Yes. I'll never call her Deok Sun...
I mean, I won't call her that ever again.

91
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:08,163
Then, ma'am, what should
I call my daughter?

92
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:15,172
Soo Yeon!

93
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,935
Soo Yeon!

94
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:22,259
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?
I told you to take the stew.

95
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:26,923
OK.... here we go.

96
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:30,724
Mom, who's Soo Yeon?
Is someone coming over?

97
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,092
You're Soo Yeon starting today, OK?

98
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,452
How is she Soo Yeon?

99
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:39,485
They said that we have to call her
Soo Yeon for her to get into college.

100
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:41,724
Freaking nonsense...

101
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,855
Don't you dare call Deok Sun,
Deok Sun from now on. Call her Soo Yeon.

102
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:48,013
They said that call her Deok Sun the rank
of the college she'll go to will drop.

103
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,110
Got that?

104
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,078
Can the rank drop any lower?

105
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:57,386
What a load of bull. Why are we
changing her perfectly fine name?

106
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,597
What's wrong with Deok Sun?
It's a nice name!

107
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon!

108
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:05,093
What the hell are you saying?

109
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:07,016
They said that, if you call her Deok Sun

110
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:09,836
you have to say "Soo Yeon" right away
to nullify the bad luck.

111
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,132
You think I'd be doing this
if there were no other option?

112
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:15,327
I like it!

113
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,956
What good will it do if it's only
us that calls her Soo Yeon?

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,721
Everyone else will
still call her Deok Sun.

115
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:21,808
Soo Yeon.

116
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:26,289
I've told everyone in town.
They'll all call her Soo Yeon.

117
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,150
Way to freaking go.

118
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:30,200
You think that's something
you can decide to do overnight?

119
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:33,622
You're the problem! You just have
to call her by the proper name.

120
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:34,562
Got that?

121
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:37,508
Why can't I say my own daughter's
name as I please?

122
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,751
Deok Sun is a great name!

123
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,711
Deok Sun! Deok Sun! Deok Sun!
Freaking Deok Sun! Deok Sun!

124
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:44,691
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon!
Freaking Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon!

125
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,790
Eat up, Soo Yeon!

126
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,724
Noona... you'll really
have to study hard.

127
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:03,361
Why are you pushing the table toward me?
If you have an issue, just spit it out!

128
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:05,586
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything!

129
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:10,343
Dad. The table always leans toward
the stomach of whoever sits there.

130
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,926
What the hell are you saying?

131
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:17,447
It keeps leaning toward me
because you're pushing it!

132
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,917
I told you, I didn't!

133
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:22,134
Then did it move by itself? Or did
the floor become slanted? Geez...

134
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,764
-So frustrating.
-That's my line!

135
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,543
What? Here, look!

136
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:28,987
The floor is fine!

137
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:34,443
Look, if I drop it, it'll sit still;
if it rolls, the floor is slanted!

138
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:35,734
Look!

139
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,505
Look, see? It rolled!

140
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:41,969
Wait... that's weird.

141
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:45,202
Look! If I drop it,
it should sit still!

142
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,766
Just watch!

143
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,382
Dad.

144
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:33,666
Where do we sleep now?

145
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,950
Where do you mean?
We'll have to sleep at the owner's place!

146
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,119
What... that'll be inconvenient, though.

147
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,452
Why? It'll be awesome!

148
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,304
It's a hundred times better
than our place.

149
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:47,269
-OK. Bo Ra and Deok Sun...
-Soo Yeon.

150
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:52,092
Even if it's a bit inconvenient,
bear it for a bit.

151
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:54,586
They said that the construction
will be over before the Lunar New Year.

152
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,679
It's not inconvenient
at all, Dad.

153
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,234
I love that house.

154
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:06,686
Episode 11: Three Prophecies

155
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,220
"Don't Sleep!" Study Room

156
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,272
Should I go on the blind date?

157
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,044
Well, should I?

158
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:28,703
Don't go.

159
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,260
Don't go on the blind date.

160
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,177
I got dumped.

161
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,150
How come?

162
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:46,914
Did you confess, by any chance?

163
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,176
-Are you crazy?
- She must be.

164
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:54,707
Hey. Our love is over the day we confess.
Don't you know that?

165
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:59,004
You sure have some nerve!
How could you confess?

166
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,468
We just have to be satisfied
with unrequited love!

167
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,302
If we confess, we'd get
rejected immediately!

168
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:06,273
What's with you? Seriously... it's not
like this is a new occurrence for us.

169
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,401
So naive...

170
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,156
Even so, just in case...

171
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:15,453
Deok Sun.

172
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:16,464
It's Soo Yeon.

173
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,706
Yeah... Soo Yeon.
What happened with you?

174
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,311
Did you ask him?

175
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,606
He told her not to
go on the blind date!

176
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,905
Hey, see? I told you
I was certain this time.

177
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:36,186
Even so, you can't confess first,
no matter what.

178
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:39,117
Wait until he confesses.

179
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,087
Crying made me hungry.
Let's go to Brazil Ddukbokki.

180
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:47,047
OK.

181
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:48,954
You two go. I have to go home.

182
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:51,926
What the hell? You go crazy for ddukbokki.

183
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,980
I like Deok Sun.

184
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,690
Not as a friend, but as a woman.

185
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:19,138
Jung Hwan! Come out and have dinner!

186
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,519
OK!

187
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:43,689
Hyung!

188
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,086
Come over here. Here.

189
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:50,961
What are you doing?
It's still not done?

190
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:53,365
It's almost done! Just wait a bit longer!

191
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:54,762
What's for dinner tonight?

192
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:55,970
What's Mom doing?

193
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,756
She's making Western food
having dinner together

194
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,399
for the first time in a while.

195
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:01,553
-What, exactly?
-Hamburg steak.

196
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:07,696
You know, I've only ever seen photos
of Hamburg steak... I've never had it.

197
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,064
Mi Ran, give it to us already!
We'll starve to death!

198
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,480
All right, already!

199
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,726
So this is Hamburg steak?

200
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,054
It looks kind of like
grilled short rib patties.

201
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,279
There's not much to it, really.

202
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:36,112
What about Bo Ra's dad? Isn't it about
time for him to have come home?

203
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:38,913
He's working a late shift today.
Is there anything I can help you with?

204
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,304
Ladle the soup into bowls.

205
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:44,499
-The soup?
-OK.

206
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:01,470
Hello!

207
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:04,645
Hay, is that you, Sun Woo?
What about your mom?

208
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:07,442
She went to go get Mr. Gildong.
She'll be here soon.

209
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,050
Sit.

210
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:14,451
Hello.

211
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:30,784
You're here?

212
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,407
Mi Ran, did you go all the way
to the US to buy steak, or...

213
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:53,998
Be careful.
Here.

214
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,606
Let's have some of this
soup thing first.

215
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:02,515
It's hot. Be careful.

216
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,392
Mom, what is this?

217
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:06,536
Is it pumpkin porridge?

218
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,475
It's just because she gave us so much...
but it is soup alright. Looks great.

219
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:12,622
I bet I could take a bath in this
for three days straight.

220
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:17,460
Mi Ran! What about the steak?
Hurry up with...

221
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,362
Steak's here!

222
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:33,342
I put a lot of work into this.

223
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:38,809
This looks different than how it
looks like at the restaurant.

224
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:41,685
What's with this kimchi on the side?
It doesn't fit here.

225
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:43,885
It was really oily
when we had it at the restaurant.

226
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:47,721
So I made some special fusion cuisine.
Eat up.

227
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,432
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food!

228
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,111
It's delicious, Mother.

229
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:08,189
After tasting the steak and the
radish kimchi together...

230
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,129
it feels like Eastern and Western
culture are coming together

231
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:16,359
...it almost feels as if I'm
experiencing hellenism.

232
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,760
Is it not "Hellenism?"

233
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:25,283
It is.

234
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:28,996
But... where's Deok Sun?
Why isn't Deok Sun coming?

235
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:29,886
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon.

236
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:31,561
Yes... I mean Soo Yeon.

237
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:34,362
She went to the study room. She said
she'd be back for dinner though...

238
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:39,161
We're here!

239
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:40,480
-Hello.
-Welcome!

240
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:44,253
"We're" here.  Looks good.

241
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:51,332
It's too crowded here.
Let's have the adults eat at the table.

242
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,348
Honey, get up.

243
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:54,036
-OK.
-Here we go.

244
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:57,746
What about Taek?
You should have brought him over, too.

245
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,233
The day after tomorrow
is his title match.

246
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:03,862
So he's studying his brains out
and won't even come out of his room.

247
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:08,408
Yeah... the title match? So it's
to protect his current title, right?

248
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,666
Yes, but... his opponent this time
is his mentor, so...

249
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,337
I guess he feels a lot of burden.

250
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:21,517
Missus. Why did you squish the
short ribs and make them so flat?

251
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:24,123
Geez, you country hick...
this isn't short ribs.

252
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,784
It's "Skate."

253
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,061
It's steak.

254
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:28,714
It's... "Skaekuh?"

255
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,010
"Steak."

256
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:32,591
It's "Hamburg Skaeki!"

257
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,784
It's something that Westerners eat.

258
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,901
And what's this? Is this snot soup?
It's so gooey.

259
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,414
Sun Young, can you
give me more water?

260
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,407
Even so, we should go give some to Taek.
He's not even eating.

261
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,033
I'm here!

262
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:00,291
-Deok Sun!
-Deok Sun! Welcome!

263
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:01,305
Soo Yeon!

264
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:02,694
Soo... Yeon.

265
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,229
-Hi, Soo Yeon.
-Hi, Soo Yeon.

266
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,481
Mom, I want short ribs too!

267
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,164
Soo Yeon, can you go
drop this off at Taek's?

268
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:36,874
He didn't come?

269
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,727
He will have a match on the day after tomorrow
so he won't budge from his room.

270
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,723
Even if he doesn't eat the short ribs,
make sure he has some soup, OK?

271
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,196
OK.

272
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,642
Hey, eat it before it cools.

273
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:06,547
OK.

274
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:10,574
It won't taste good if it cools.

275
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,329
-Deok Sun.
-It's Soo Yeon.

276
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,543
Who's Soo Yeon?

277
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:42,466
Me. I'm Soo Yeon.
Call me Soo Yeon from now on.

278
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,373
That's the only way
I'll be able to get into college.

279
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,125
Are you... laughing at me?

280
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:49,998
No. Are you crazy?

281
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:53,805
Hey, don't you mess with me. I've been
letting you off the hook a lot lately.

282
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,416
OK.

283
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:57,761
But, Deok Sun...

284
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,527
It's Soo Yeon, you idiot!

285
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,320
Yeah... Soo Yeon.

286
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:02,894
Can you make me some coffee?

287
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:05,300
And mix milk into it, like before.

288
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:10,551
OK.

289
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:13,151
Focus on what you're doing.

290
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:16,262
OK?

291
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:21,703
Soo Yeon!

292
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:24,618
Can I have some water?

293
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,469
Soo Yeon!

294
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,263
I heard that Taek's receiving
fan letters lately.

295
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:47,648
If there's a decent girl you can take
one of them as your daughter in law!

296
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,642
He's not the type to choose
someone so readily.

297
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:52,512
It's not he's type to show
it if he likes someone.

298
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:54,258
I'll bet he'll be silent
and not say a word.

299
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,663
Taek shows it if he likes someone.

300
00:22:56,214 --> 00:22:59,501
How? How does he show it?

301
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:04,062
Sun Young, can you get me
some more sauce for this?

302
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,540
Sure. Sauce, sauce...

303
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:10,386
It's not like he'd act all cutesy, right?

304
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,830
Of course not.

305
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:14,382
He's like me in he doesn't
know how to act cute.

306
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:16,798
Sun Young, can you pass me more tissues?

307
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:18,854
Here.

308
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:24,019
How does Taek show it that he likes someone?
How he acts in front of person he likes?

309
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:26,991
-He's a bit clingy.
-What?

310
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:29,589
If he has someone he likes,
he acts clingy toward them.

311
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:32,488
He asks them to do a lot of things too.

312
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:36,628
But he acts really polite toward
people that he doesn't like.

313
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:41,325
Sun Young, can you
get me a smaller bowl?

314
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:42,518
-Sure.
-Thanks.

315
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:45,240
Enough... stop asking Sun Young
to do everything.

316
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:47,337
I did?

317
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:52,143
Sun Young, no need for the bowl.

318
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,810
I want warm water.

319
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,430
You little... why, I ought to!
Hey! You go get it!

320
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,934
I've let you off the hook too much.
Am I your slave? Am I your servant?

321
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:13,777
-Huh...
-It hurts...

322
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,961
You have a kettle right there!
Do it yourself!

323
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:22,468
OK! You hit so hard.

324
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:38,345
-Hey.
-Yeah?

325
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:39,869
The plug.

326
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:54,909
No... hey, give it here.

327
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,006
It's fine. I can do it.

328
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:58,084
No...

329
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,734
Your nose is bleeding.

330
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:29,997
Hey... Deok Sun.

331
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:31,176
Soo Yeon.

332
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:34,767
Yeah... Soo Yeon...

333
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,322
Get some sleep.

334
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,535
I'll... be working.

335
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:10,375
Why isn't second noona back yet?

336
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:12,184
It's been a while since she left.

337
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:14,418
I guess she's eating with Taek.

338
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,118
They're on about the same level.

339
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,558
Noona. Meet me in the alleyway
in ten minutes.

340
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,077
Get away from me.

341
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,216
What are you two doing?

342
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:27,716
I don't know what it is, but
can you let me in on it, too?

343
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,713
-Let's do it together!
-Me too!

344
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,611
No... it's nothing.
I just have to ask her something.

345
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,996
When did you say the wait listed
acceptances were announced, again?

346
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,854
What... you're so mean.

347
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,922
Hyung, I'll be going.
No Eul, I'm off to the study room.

348
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:49,438
See you later.

349
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,484
Mom, I'm going to the study room!

350
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:19,981
Jin Joo, your older brother's gone, right?

351
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:22,386
Right?

352
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,825
Honey. I'm going to make a delivery.

353
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:32,079
At this time of night?

354
00:27:32,142 --> 00:27:34,311
There's one delivery I forgot to make.
I'll be back soon.

355
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,206
He sure is diligent.

356
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,875
He's only diligent when it comes to his
job not in this room at all.

357
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,500
I shouldn't have said that.
Never mind.

358
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:48,601
Yeah. Did your travel
document come out?

359
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,501
You mean my "Passport?"

360
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,974
Let me have a look at it!

361
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:04,795
You look so pretty! You must be so happy!
You even get to go abroad.

362
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:07,546
It's only Japan. It'll be short.
There isn't even a time difference.

363
00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:09,671
When are you leaving?

364
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:11,873
The day before Lunar New Year.
So there's three days left.

365
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,282
I can't believe I'm spending
the New Year in Tokyo.

366
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,981
What about the kids? Are you
sending them to your mother's place?

367
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:20,937
Yeah, I told them to spend the
New Years at Go-han.

368
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:25,014
Where's Sun Young, though?
We have to get started, already.

369
00:28:25,443 --> 00:28:26,824
-Missus!
-Hey!

370
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,462
Hi, you!

371
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:35,141
Missus. Can you watch Jin
Joo for a little bit?

372
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,224
Where are you going?
We have to play Go Stop.

373
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:40,783
Starting today, I'm working as a
cleaner at Uksoo Bathhouse.

374
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,024
-What?
-What?

375
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:45,582
I have to work there from
8:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

376
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,623
I have to earn some money.

377
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,860
If Sun Woo finds out, he'll be angry.

378
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,830
It's not like he'll find out! He's busy
going to the study room nowadays.

379
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,721
He comes home for dinner, but
doesn't come back until late after that.

380
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:02,085
He works just like his father!
He never comes home before 1:00 a.m.

381
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:04,293
But why are you working
all of the sudden?

382
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:05,844
Are you short on money?

383
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:09,421
No, it's not like that! No need to borrow
money when my limbs work fine.

384
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,481
Also, it's not because
I'm really strapped for cash.

385
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:16,736
I have to save more money
for Sun Woo's college tuition.

386
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:20,561
Thankfully, being a cleaner
at a bathhouse is an easy job.

387
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,829
It's not like I need to know
any specialized skills.

388
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,704
Won't Jin Joo ask for you?

389
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:28,246
Don't you worry about that!
Just this will take care of it.

390
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:53,377
I feel like she's going to get caught...

391
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:57,611
Well, this won't do.
Go Stop isn't fun with just two people.

392
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,395
What's the problem?

393
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,703
There's one person who's lounging
about because it's winter break.

394
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:15,054
Noona!

395
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:19,945
What took you so long?
It's been 15 minutes.

396
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:22,437
Are you advertising to the whole
world that we're dating?

397
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:24,704
Who's watching?
There isn't anyone here.

398
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:29,502
Hey. How can you eat that
so late at night?

399
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,687
-Sun Woo hyung!
-Hey.

400
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:34,981
What are you two doing?

401
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:37,400
It's because I have something
to talk about with Noona.

402
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,341
At this time of night?

403
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:42,556
Just the two of you?

404
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:46,321
What are you talking about, exactly?
You can just talk at home.

405
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:48,156
No... it's nothing much.

406
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,255
I had something I was curious
about while studying...

407
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:53,218
-...and I run into her on the street...
-Hey.

408
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:54,855
Piss off.

409
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,865
What's it to you
what we're doing?

410
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:00,765
Don't try to pry into adult matters
and piss off.

411
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,561
OK.

412
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,781
Bo Ra.

413
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,066
Do you have any coins, by any chance?

414
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:11,981
Thanks.

415
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,065
Let's go.

416
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:23,465
There's definitely something going on
between the two of them!

417
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,287
Jung Bong hyung. Doesn't it
seem like the two of them...

418
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:30,726
What.

419
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:36,037
You lose! Try again next time!

420
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:37,581
Darn it, I lost again!

421
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,480
It's OK.

422
00:31:41,562 --> 00:31:44,343
If you have a couple more, you will
get the "Free bag" coupon for sure!

423
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:46,847
Don't get so upset
over something like that.

424
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:56,714
Just how many bags did you eat?

425
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,521
Two whole boxes' worth.

426
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:05,731
I always lose. I've never gotten
the "Free bag" coupon once.

427
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:12,547
-Jung Bong.
-Yes?

428
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:15,457
-Watch Jin Joo.
-OK. Are you going somewhere?

429
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:16,965
To go earn some money.

430
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:26,126
All right... let's see just how
skilled our dean is!

431
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:27,794
Missus, you deal.

432
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:31,141
It's fine. We're all friends here.

433
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,560
I heard that you're
quite a skilled player.

434
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:38,750
No, no. I've only played with the
teachers at school a couple of times.

435
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,751
I'm a total newbie.

436
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,181
Then, shall I try to win some money
from Ssangmun High's dean?

437
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:52,280
Yes, let's! Shall we?

438
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,861
OK... let's start.

439
00:32:56,852 --> 00:33:00,010
-Here we go.
-Boy!

440
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,528
But... what's Joo So Ya Dae?

441
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:08,872
My god... we're playing with a person who
doesn't even know what Joo So Ya Dae is!

442
00:33:09,515 --> 00:33:11,499
I feel so bad!

443
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,560
You learn through practice.

444
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,458
Then I'll just choose anything!

445
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,251
That's a good one!

446
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:26,848
Then I'll... No, I'm last!

447
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:30,377
OK, let's go!

448
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:42,524
Hey, high school senior.
Hurry up and go study.

449
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:44,700
You have to become
a notable figure one day.

450
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,148
I don't need to go to
the study room today though.

451
00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:49,081
I just left the house
for no reason.

452
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:51,765
Noona do you want to go see a movie?

453
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:56,751
No. I'm busy.
I have a lot of things to study for.

454
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,470
Why would you be busy?
It's winter break.

455
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,595
There's something I'm preparing for.
You don't need to know about it.

456
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,589
Then, when will we go on a date?

457
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:07,718
We did, just now.

458
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,119
I'm cold. Bye.

459
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:14,225
Are you out of your mind?
Want to die?

460
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:19,375
Do I have to be prepared to lose
my life if I want to hold your hand?

461
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,488
Yeah. So do it if you have
a death wish. Got it?

462
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:27,786
I'm off.

463
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:31,467
I'll go in front of your house later!
See you later!

464
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,494
I'm going to be sleeping.
See you tomorrow.

465
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:49,380
It's so cold.... Sun Woo,
pass me some blankets.

466
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:51,761
Hey...

467
00:34:58,344 --> 00:34:59,439
Thanks.

468
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:01,208
To Mr. Jung Bong.

469
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,120
To Mr. Jung Bong.

470
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,923
Jung Bong. Hello.

471
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,675
What am I supposed to write? Jung Bong
oppa? What am I supposed to write?

472
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,638
Here we go! Yeah!

473
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,839
One each... One Go!

474
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:32,583
Here we go... Two Go!

475
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,972
OK... Three Go!

476
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:36,736
OK... there...

477
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,007
I feel so bad.

478
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,198
Wait, what? You played with Mr. Yoo?

479
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:13,520
What... He isn't even human!
You shouldn't even associate with him!

480
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:16,961
You have to be really alert
when you're playing against him.

481
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:18,328
What are you talking about?

482
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:20,575
Speaking of which,
how much did you lose?

483
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:21,886
120 won!

484
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:28,519
What... that guy. Don't worry.
I'll win you ten times what you lost.

485
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:30,558
So make sure you have him
over again this evening.

486
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:31,702
Just wait for me.

487
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,990
Mr. Sung over here is known as
"The Mr. Yoo Killer!"

488
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:37,968
I'll close the store early today
and come home earlier.

489
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,598
It's the end of the lunar year,
so I won't have many customers anyway.

490
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:48,624
When are they announcing
the wait listed candidates?

491
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:53,612
It'll probably be hard for him
to get in this time, right?

492
00:37:56,792 --> 00:38:00,143
It's tomorrow.
He really has to get in this time.

493
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:04,661
We're having a hard time,
so imagine how much harder it is for him.

494
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,690
It's because he hasn't said anything,
but I'm sure he's taking it hard too.

495
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,442
I'm sure it's hard
for the whole household.

496
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:29,541
Yes, hello?

497
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:33,780
Sun Woo? OK, I'll put
Jung Hwan on. Just a minute.

498
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,872
I'm going to take a shower.

499
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:48,597
Hey. What the hell are you looking at?

500
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,588
Hey. Why are you calling again?

501
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,580
Wait a bit before going in.

502
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,123
It's foggy in there,
so it'll be hard to see.

503
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,646
That's fine.

504
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:18,476
OK.

505
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:27,446
No Eul. Have you taken a bath there yet?

506
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:30,638
Noona... Who says "Bath" anymore?
So uncouth.

507
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,014
It's a "Shower."

508
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,129
It's so nice and warm! Not cold at all!

509
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,218
Right? And we don't
even need to wear shoes!

510
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:41,460
I wish we could live here forever.

511
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,375
With Jung Bong hyung!

512
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,149
Yeah, Jung Bong.
Have the wait list results come out yet?

513
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,229
Or is that tomorrow?

514
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:02,784
You're so mean... seriously.

515
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:05,055
What did I do?

516
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,180
Let's not be like this
to each other... seriously.

517
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,083
Soo Yeon. Give me your laundry.
I'm doing laundry now.

518
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,238
You too, No Eul.

519
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,389
I don't have any.

520
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:21,207
Me neither. I just washed my own
clothes while I was showering.

521
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:54,810
Don't you dare buy anything on the
way home... I'll lock you out. Got it?

522
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:56,493
OK, already!

523
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,283
And you, honey... please, buy something
on the way home... please.

524
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,151
I have been buying
a lot of things lately.

525
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,879
Should I buy a steamed bun on
the way home? You love those.

526
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,496
Buy a whole pack, not just one, Darn it!

527
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:11,230
One pack, OK!
Stop yelling. Please.

528
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:14,268
Anyway, you two have to come home
early so we can get revenge, OK?

529
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:16,944
OK, OK. I'm leaving
before the bank closes.

530
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:18,661
I'll close the store early
and come home earlier.

531
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,042
What...

532
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:37,664
Honey! I'm home!

533
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:42,835
Mi Ran! I bough an entire pack!
This flowerpot...

534
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,949
Those earrings aren't heavy, Jin Joo?

535
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:55,913
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Jin Joo?

536
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,994
Magical Princess Minky!

537
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,230
Minky?

538
00:42:00,522 --> 00:42:03,589
When you're done eating,
I'll buy you a magic wand.

539
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:04,668
Really?

540
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,057
Sun Woo, isn't it time
for you to go study?

541
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:19,359
It's already 8:00 p.m. Mom, I'm off!
Bye, Jin Joo!

542
00:42:19,755 --> 00:42:23,540
-OK! Study hard!
-OK!

543
00:42:27,234 --> 00:42:30,704
Jin Joo, don't eat that.
Let's go.

544
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:33,572
You Lose! Try again next time!

545
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:41,963
Jung Bong. I'll leave her to you.

546
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,955
May the odds be in your favor, Mother!

547
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:09,246
He's totally booked
for all of February.

548
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:11,636
There are always the most
competitions in the wintertime.

549
00:43:11,816 --> 00:43:13,638
You're his friend
and you don't know that?

550
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:17,703
But I think that tomorrow's match
will be the the toughest on him.

551
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:19,358
He's spending the night
at the Baduk Club tonight.

552
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,428
-Jung Pal.
-Yeah?

553
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,906
Did the dean leave your house yet?
Take a look.

554
00:44:05,148 --> 00:44:07,434
What took you so long?
You're five minutes late.

555
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:11,327
I bet I'm the only girl who drops her
boyfriend off to the study room.

556
00:44:12,592 --> 00:44:14,514
It's because we don't have time
to go on dates.

557
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:16,040
Did you have a late dinner?

558
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:18,176
I only get to see you for a
bit after dinner.

559
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:20,424
Then, let's eat dinner together.

560
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:22,228
I don't have to have dinner at home.

561
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,525
I have to eat dinner at home.

562
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:25,836
How come?

563
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,608
If I don't, Jin Joo and Mom will have
dinner by themselves.

564
00:44:31,024 --> 00:44:33,479
Even though it's winter break,
I want to have dinner with them.

565
00:44:35,657 --> 00:44:37,014
You're such a good kid.

566
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:42,376
I like you because you're so good.

567
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:48,667
-Is that all?
-Yeah. Just that one trait.

568
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,328
-I have a lot, though.
-A lot of what?

569
00:44:51,465 --> 00:44:52,855
Reasons why I like you, I mean.

570
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:55,059
Whatever. Shut it. I don't want
to hear them.

571
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:56,615
Don't say anything!

572
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:59,315
But, you know...
I liked your old glasses more.

573
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:04,694
You know, the round ones.
The ones that look like Lee Sun Hee's.

574
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,084
They were a lot prettier.

575
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:11,017
It's my face, so I'll do as I please.
Don't try to tell me what to do.

576
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:14,586
Also, you only wear pants when
you come to see me!

577
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,211
Hurry it up!

578
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:30,886
You guys are going, right?

579
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:34,320
No thanks. I don't want to go
to a man's concert.

580
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:35,905
What about you, Jung Hwan?

581
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:39,895
He'll probably go.
He's a fan of Lee Moon Sae.

582
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:41,189
You're going, right?

583
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:42,802
No. I can't.

584
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:48,117
I wonder if Taek will go?
His schedule is really packed this month.

585
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,333
How come?
Did something happen?

586
00:45:51,573 --> 00:45:54,591
He doesn't go anywhere during
competition time, so he won't budge...

587
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:58,603
But then again, if Deok Sun says she'll
go, I bet he'd follow her there.

588
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:04,133
Wait, no. To the Almighty Master Choi,
Baduk is more important than a woman.

589
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:05,476
Some woman...

590
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:06,646
You really can't go?

591
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,321
No, I can't.

592
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,384
I'm going to the bathroom.

593
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:19,984
Then, who else is there?
Taek, Jung Hwan... Sun Woo...

594
00:46:19,995 --> 00:46:22,567
There's Sun Woo.
Go with him. He likes music.

595
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,560
Sure, he may love Lee Sun Hee,
but he likes Lee Moon Sae just as much.

596
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:28,557
Not liking Lee Moon Sae at our age
is pretty difficult...

597
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:31,276
Shut it, already.

598
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
Lee Moon Sae...

599
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:52,696
-Want a steamed bun?
-No, that's OK.

600
00:46:57,087 --> 00:46:58,807
Mister, you're not playing
Go Stop with the others?

601
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:01,325
I don't know how to play.

602
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:08,502
And all the folks over there are pros
so the stakes are quite high.

603
00:47:09,582 --> 00:47:11,428
What? Really?

604
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:14,846
OK, here we go...

605
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:20,047
OK... five, six... seven points!

606
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:22,395
And since I shook it, 14 points.

607
00:47:22,743 --> 00:47:24,912
And since Ms. Cheetah has no
defensive maneuvers, 28 points.

608
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:28,819
Ms. Cheetah, 280 won.
Mr. Sung, 140 won! Thank you!

609
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:32,469
You're so good.
How much did you say it was?

610
00:47:32,652 --> 00:47:34,241
280 won.

611
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:38,250
At 10 won per point, the stake
is too high. Lower the bid.

612
00:47:38,912 --> 00:47:41,850
The first round barely matters anyway.

613
00:47:42,624 --> 00:47:46,877
Anyway, Mr. Yoo,
deal me some good cards, OK?

614
00:47:46,888 --> 00:47:47,930
OK.

615
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:52,527
OK. Shall we play
for real now?

616
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:58,949
What? They're playing Go Stop
with my dad?

617
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:00,656
Yeah. They said they played
yesterday, too.

618
00:48:00,865 --> 00:48:02,185
Why? Is there a reason they can't?

619
00:48:02,496 --> 00:48:04,629
I bet there will be a huge fight tonight.

620
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:09,399
What... he's so humiliating!
Darn it...

621
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:16,266
Do you know what my father's nickname
was, when he was a bachelor?

622
00:48:35,668 --> 00:48:38,472
What... I'll have to pace myself
during this round.

623
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:42,422
My god... what do I... Darn it...

624
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,464
What the hell are you doing?

625
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:51,659
Let's stop playing games here.

626
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:56,188
Put the Heuksal cards
back where they were.

627
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,242
They're mine, though.

628
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:02,382
They're yours?

629
00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:07,303
Those have been there since before...
so what are you saying?

630
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:11,179
How could a teacher
be such a con artist?

631
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:14,986
If you do that again,
I'm going to smash your fingers.

632
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:19,221
Let's play properly, all right?
I'm not falling for it anymore.

633
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:25,624
"Nampodong's Con Artist."

634
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:31,222
They call him that because he cheats
all the time while playing Go-Stop!

635
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:35,189
What a terrible nickname...
So embarrassing!

636
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:41,666
But it won't work against my dad.
You know where my dad works, right?

637
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,048
Hanil Bank.

638
00:49:45,002 --> 00:49:46,002
But why?

639
00:49:47,248 --> 00:49:49,045
Do you know what he does there?

640
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:04,972
Two points with the Chungdan...
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 points.

641
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,202
What...

642
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,005
You have a death wish?

643
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:21,604
I'll be aiming for the back
of your hand next time.

644
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:27,542
He works in the Inspection Department.

645
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,699
And what does that department do?

646
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:31,443
Fraud detection.

647
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,937
He catches people who try to
embezzle company funds or scam others.

648
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:52,137
Four points. And I have a Chungdan,
so seven, eight, nine points.

649
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:54,449
You have a Pibak. 18 points. 180 won.

650
00:50:54,908 --> 00:50:56,315
And Mr. Con Artist Teacher over here...

651
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:59,351
Pibak and Gwangbak,
so 36 points. 360 won.

652
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:00,605
Give it here.

653
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,891
Please be a good role model
to the students, all right?

654
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:09,678
My husband's so good!

655
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:15,661
I'm going to take all the money here
and buy you a mink coat.

656
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:20,402
Sseul.

657
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:23,863
Jo.

658
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:27,358
Ohgwang.

659
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:29,116
Chodan.

660
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:31,010
Hongdan.

661
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:33,802
Chungdan.

662
00:51:42,713 --> 00:51:43,713
Godori.

663
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:49,530
You think my mom is just sitting around
while your dad plays Go-Stop?

664
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:55,664
My mom's Ra Mi Ran, all right?

665
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:03,873
Big trouble. Looks like
he's going to win big time!

666
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:17,841
Yeah!

667
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:21,321
My god...
I got Sseul, again!

668
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:27,421
Now let's see here, Ms. Cheetah...
Gwangbak, Pibak...

669
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:30,462
I'm going to get a glass of water.

670
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,625
Hey, stop right there!

671
00:52:33,272 --> 00:52:34,674
We're in the middle of
something important!

672
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,304
Don't you move. Stay here.

673
00:52:36,568 --> 00:52:38,062
Don't move anything.
Hurry up and go.

674
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:40,015
Excume me...

675
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:43,932
If you get Go this time,
you'll have Five Go, right?

676
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,990
Five Go! We have it in the bag!

677
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:54,740
Honey, I think you'll have to
visit the hospital a lot this winter.

678
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:55,922
Why the hospital?

679
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,577
Hey... if you wear the mink coat
and you get heat rashes...

680
00:52:58,588 --> 00:53:00,183
...you'll have to get it treated,
won't you?

681
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,198
Who cares about heat rashes when it
looks like I'm getting myself a fur coat?

682
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:06,992
This is great!

683
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:13,264
She may not be as skilled when it
comes to game play but this is...

684
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:17,916
What's her IQ?

685
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,865
It's not related to IQ.

686
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:22,920
It's tricks.

687
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,036
Jin Joo, you have to scratch it
with the utmost prudence.

688
00:53:29,198 --> 00:53:31,798
Jin Joo... Let's go!
One more bag! Let's go!

689
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:34,369
You lose! Try again next time!

690
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:38,709
Jin Joo, you have no luck either, do you?

691
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:44,080
Jin Joo. Want to play with me?

692
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:55,592
-Hey.
-Hey! Our Jin Joo's here!

693
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:56,711
Come over here!

694
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:57,724
Hi Jin Joo.

695
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:00,010
Hey... a player should
hurry and come back!

696
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,311
What took you so long?

697
00:54:02,943 --> 00:54:07,247
OK, I'll say it one more time.

698
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:10,424
OK, Five Go!

699
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,442
My god... really!

700
00:54:57,587 --> 00:55:01,552
It looks like I'm going to
get myself a really big one!

701
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:07,287
Let me say this one more time.

702
00:55:08,178 --> 00:55:10,099
Five Go!

703
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:15,071
Looks like I'll be wearing
a fur coat now!

704
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,824
Hey... Jin Joo!

705
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:22,479
-Hey...
-Hey!

706
00:55:23,012 --> 00:55:26,482
Stay still for a bit!
What do we do?

707
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,425
It's all ruined!
It's all ruined!

708
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,222
What do we do?

709
00:55:43,377 --> 00:55:45,520
Jin Joo!

710
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,239
Why?

711
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:02,355
Why?

712
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,972
What the day...

713
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:07,754
Good morning!

714
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:11,232
You're leaving a bit late today.

715
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:12,305
Yes...

716
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:14,744
-Mr. Yoo.
-Yes?

717
00:56:14,991 --> 00:56:17,722
It's not over till it's over,
all right?

718
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:18,817
Excuse me?

719
00:56:18,872 --> 00:56:22,415
We have to have a proper
round two tonight.

720
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:26,254
But the thing is...
I'm going to Pusan tonight.

721
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:28,327
It's the Lunar New Year, after all!

722
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:30,825
Have a good new year.

723
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:33,693
A happy new year!

724
00:56:34,582 --> 00:56:40,633
The land of dreams and magic
flew away into space...

725
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:44,623
I wonder what kind of dream
is in store for us today?

726
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:57,272
As according to the new freedom of travel
regulation that has been passed...

727
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:01,059
...people will now be able to receive
traveler's passports without limitation...

728
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:04,516
...regardless of age or
frequency of travel.

729
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:10,107
Therefore, the number of people
traveling abroad has increased...

730
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:11,333
You're leaving tomorrow, right?

731
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:12,739
Yeah.

732
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:14,584
I'm so envious.

733
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:20,454
Hey... I wonder when I'll ever be
able to take an airplane...

734
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:23,647
What are you jealous about?
You have two daughters.

735
00:57:23,784 --> 00:57:25,784
I'm sure you have chance to
take an airplane in the future.

736
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:28,949
I guess passports are
issued relatively quickly nowadays.

737
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:31,367
I heard that you had to have at
least 2 million won in the bank...

738
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:32,444
...and it was such a hassle.

739
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:34,471
It's simple nowadays.

740
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:37,399
All you need to submit is an application,
your social security number...

741
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:39,587
...and an identification card.

742
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:40,984
And it's valid for three years.

743
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:44,136
Three years? That's so long!

744
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:46,075
The system's gotten a lot better!

745
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,826
What does it matter if the
system's gotten better?

746
00:57:51,979 --> 00:57:53,013
It's not like I have any money.

747
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:58,127
I'm so jealous of you.
You don't have a care in the world!

748
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:01,539
Why wouldn't I?
I have that one thing.

749
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:05,779
You mean Jung Bong?

750
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:08,060
They're announcing the results
at 2:00 p.m. today.

751
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:13,128
Really... if Jung Bong got into college,
I wouldn't want anything else!

752
00:58:13,287 --> 00:58:15,479
He will. Don't worry.

753
00:58:15,822 --> 00:58:19,019
Hey... didn't the medium tell you
that he had huge luck coming his way?

754
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:22,919
He'll for sure get accepted this year.

755
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:26,379
I'm going to put my faith
in a medium, just this once.

756
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,844
That way, Soo Yeon will be
able to go to college, too.

757
00:58:32,898 --> 00:58:36,731
Then what about Sun Young?
Is she going to "Get into trouble" again?

758
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:40,568
What do you mean, "Trouble?"
For her, it'd be a blessing!

759
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:41,999
She's still young, after all.

760
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:47,519
But if she does, she'll have to hurry up
and meet a man and "Cause some trouble."

761
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:49,117
When will she meet a man
to "Cause trouble" with?

762
00:58:49,223 --> 00:58:50,223
There isn't much time left.

763
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,487
It doesn't take much time
for it to happen, you know.

764
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:54,307
No need to worry about time.

765
00:58:56,937 --> 00:59:01,352
Between... Where did you meet
your husband?

766
00:59:02,003 --> 00:59:05,493
Yeah! You said you met him
at Go han, right?

767
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:12,103
Yep, I met him at Go han.

768
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:20,453
Want me to tell you my story?

769
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:25,531
You even listen
to songs like these?

770
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,579
You're so high class.

771
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:30,812
That's... It's only Vivaldi.

772
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:39,451
Even when we were all broke together,
you had a different air about you.

773
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,700
I thought to myself, "She's so smart,
so why did she come to Ssangmundong?"

774
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,022
Because of love.

775
00:59:51,939 --> 00:59:54,939
I used to work in the
financial sector.

776
00:59:56,671 --> 01:00:01,296
I think I was the best at that at Go han.

777
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,546
I was a good worker.

778
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:06,939
And then, I met Jung Bong's dad.

779
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:11,849
And I liked him a bit more
than he liked me.

780
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:13,595
So sweet...

781
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:16,122
He was quite handsome
back in the day.

782
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:17,965
Why? He's good looking now, too.

783
01:00:17,976 --> 01:00:20,810
No. He's a mess now.
All shriveled up.

784
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,987
Anyway... I went to the terminal
because of an errand I had to do...

785
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:26,805
...and I saw him standing
there at the gate.

786
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:30,979
He looked like Buddha himself.

787
01:00:31,718 --> 01:00:34,468
He was enveloped in light...
from head to toe!

788
01:00:39,442 --> 01:00:40,871
Jung Hwan...

789
01:00:50,335 --> 01:00:52,544
You're really not going
to the concert?

790
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:55,705
The Lee Moon Sae concert.

791
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:58,763
I have plans with my friends.

792
01:00:59,795 --> 01:01:00,795
What plans?

793
01:01:01,168 --> 01:01:02,784
I'm going to Seoul Land
with my friends.

794
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,040
Which friends?

795
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,875
Just some friends.
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

796
01:01:08,894 --> 01:01:10,494
You have friends that I don't know about?

797
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,125
Yeah, I do.

798
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:15,828
Sorry. Let's go together next time.

799
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,155
I have to change.

800
01:01:28,123 --> 01:01:29,205
OK.

801
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:57,626
It's time. It's time.

802
01:02:04,102 --> 01:02:05,581
Hey yes, hello.

803
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:09,974
Yes, the Law School.

804
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:14,320
His number is... 863757.

805
01:02:14,604 --> 01:02:16,463
-Just a moment.
-OK.

806
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:20,925
-Hello?
-Yes?

807
01:02:21,532 --> 01:02:23,558
I'm sorry, but he didn't make it.

808
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:46,663
Were the results announced?
How did it go?

809
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:52,058
Honey, where are you going?

810
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:53,648
To see that fortune teller
and argue with her.

811
01:02:53,783 --> 01:02:56,929
Forget it. Forget it!
What good would that do?

812
01:02:58,784 --> 01:03:02,144
Big fortune?
Big fortune, my ass.

813
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:04,145
More like big misfortune!

814
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:05,596
I won't stand for it.

815
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:08,789
Come on, don't be like that.
What good will that do?

816
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,464
There's nothing we can do about it now.

817
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:15,247
If she had said he would fail,
I wouldn't have had any expectations.

818
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,487
She's made a fool of me!

819
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,306
I'm going to give her
a piece of my mind.

820
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:20,725
-No.
-Don't do it!

821
01:03:21,138 --> 01:03:22,726
-Let go of me!
-Honey!

822
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:23,834
-Missus...
-Darn it!

823
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:26,725
-Calm down!
-Let go! Let go!

824
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,232
- I'm going to..
- Honey.

825
01:03:28,243 --> 01:03:29,905
-Please, just...
-Let go!

826
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:33,305
-Honey! Calm down.
-Please! Calm down.

827
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:34,992
I bet the mood over there
is so grim right now.

828
01:03:35,621 --> 01:03:38,599
What... I knew it from the moment
that she started saying strange things.

829
01:03:40,908 --> 01:03:42,644
Yes. I'm about to have lunch now.

830
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,202
It's about time for Sun Woo to
come back from the study room.

831
01:03:45,974 --> 01:03:49,491
Then... send Jung Hwan, Bo Ra
and Soo Yeon... no, it's Deok Sun now.

832
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:54,689
Deok Sun and No Eul,
send them all here.

833
01:03:55,275 --> 01:03:57,684
They won't be able to
have a meal over there.

834
01:03:58,161 --> 01:04:01,068
I'll whip up some kimchi
fried rice for them.

835
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:03,885
Yes.

836
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:09,220
That's.... really.

837
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:14,812
I thought I'd maybe fix up my fate
this year, but I guess not.

838
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:21,177
I'll make the kimchi fried rice
really delicious this time.

839
01:04:27,703 --> 01:04:29,552
What about Jung Hwan?
Where did he go?

840
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,909
Jung Hwan hyung went on
an errand for his mother.

841
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,630
He said he was going
to the travel agency.

842
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:36,424
What about Bo Ra?
Where did she go?

843
01:04:36,718 --> 01:04:39,798
I don't know.
She left right after eating breakfast.

844
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:41,525
And when I asked her
where she was going

845
01:04:41,605 --> 01:04:43,699
I got acquainted with her fist.

846
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:45,962
What... She hits you, too?

847
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,538
-I thought she did that to Deok Sun...
-I'm Soo Yeon.

848
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:51,438
You're Deok Sun again.

849
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:53,045
What?

850
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:55,345
There's just something
that came up, OK?

851
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:59,312
I thought she only hit Deok Sun...
she's really something!

852
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:03,751
What unfortunate guy will take
her as his bride? It worries me.

853
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,678
But... when did she say
she'd be back?

854
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:11,667
I don't know. I'd have to be prepared to
lose my life to ask something like that.

855
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,700
That's... our poor No Eul.

856
01:05:14,972 --> 01:05:16,838
No Eul, want to live
at my place instead?

857
01:05:17,299 --> 01:05:20,700
I'd be happy anywhere
as long as it's not our house.

858
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:24,227
Is that right?

859
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:41,461
Get up. Jung Bong is hungry.

860
01:05:41,913 --> 01:05:43,669
You have to feed him, at least!

861
01:05:44,012 --> 01:05:45,202
Why should I?

862
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:47,077
There you go again!

863
01:05:47,663 --> 01:05:49,905
You sure are greedy, Honey.

864
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,057
We weren't even thinking that he'd make
it off the wait list in the first place.

865
01:05:53,462 --> 01:05:56,222
Don't displace your anger on our child
over what some medium said.

866
01:06:02,843 --> 01:06:06,176
Hey, our Mi Ran is so sweet.
My wife is the best!

867
01:06:06,475 --> 01:06:07,707
Shut it!

868
01:06:08,955 --> 01:06:10,720
Jung Bong, let's have some...

869
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:17,627
Bong. It's OK.

870
01:06:18,778 --> 01:06:20,878
It's not like we'd expected you
to get it in the first place.

871
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:24,209
A man shouldn't have
his shoulders slumped.

872
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:26,399
You're making my heart hurt!

873
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,066
Hurry. Come out here and have lunch.
I'm hungry, too.

874
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:32,092
Bong.

875
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,281
I'll be waiting for you then, OK?
Hurry and come out.

876
01:07:21,763 --> 01:07:23,173
But... where did Jung Hwan go?

877
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,811
I sent him to the travel agency
to make a payment for me.

878
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:28,476
You still didn't pay?
We're leaving tomorrow!

879
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,161
The due date is today. It's fine.

880
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:34,420
Hurry and eat,
and go to the bathhouse.

881
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:37,221
Bath? I don't want to.

882
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,670
We're going abroad, and you're not
even taking a bath before you go?

883
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,931
Go with Jung Bong.

884
01:07:43,115 --> 01:07:44,755
I'm fine though.

885
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:48,703
-Go.
-Yes.

886
01:07:52,393 --> 01:07:54,821
"Don't Sleep!" Study Room

887
01:07:59,135 --> 01:08:02,773
Where did she go?
I didn't even see her all day.

888
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:14,286
Hello! Pleased to make your acquaintance.

889
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:18,711
Thst's... you speak Japanese?

890
01:08:19,548 --> 01:08:22,429
Not really. I'm just rehearsing
a few phrases before I go.

891
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:25,205
It's such a shame, letting you
just stay at home all the time.

892
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,040
I'll bet that you'd be living in an even
bigger house if you were working.

893
01:08:31,195 --> 01:08:33,257
I don't even deserve
this house.

894
01:08:34,102 --> 01:08:36,687
Tomorrow's the first day of the Lunar New
Year holiday. You're not going home?

895
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:40,608
I bought a train ticket.
I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

896
01:08:41,277 --> 01:08:43,175
It's not like my Mother in Law
is there...

897
01:08:43,304 --> 01:08:45,084
...so we're just going to visit
her grave.

898
01:08:46,059 --> 01:08:47,779
What about you?
Are you done packing?

899
01:08:48,035 --> 01:08:49,529
Aren't you leaving
tomorrow morning?

900
01:08:50,101 --> 01:08:52,376
Yeah, I did.
I packed everything a month ago.

901
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:58,364
Hello?

902
01:08:58,644 --> 01:09:00,413
-It's me, Mom.
-Yeah, Jung Hwan?

903
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:02,210
Did you make the payment
to the agency?

904
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,839
Yes, but can you get your passport?

905
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,865
What? My passport? Just a moment.

906
01:09:12,174 --> 01:09:13,434
Why my passport?

907
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,659
They said that your hotel changed...

908
01:09:16,228 --> 01:09:19,030
...so they need your name in English. Can
you spell out your name in English, for me?

909
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:25,940
The spelling of my name
in English is... let's see here.

910
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:28,451
Hurry. There are people waiting behind me.

911
01:09:29,495 --> 01:09:33,429
Jung Hwan. Can you call me back?
I have soup boiling in the kitchen.

912
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,480
OK? Talk to you later!

913
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,740
Mom!

914
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:39,550
What happened?
Did something happen with Jung Hwan?

915
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:44,182
That... my hotel was changed. I'm going
to go check on the soup in the kitchen.

916
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,796
Did you pack everything
for Japan?

917
01:09:49,591 --> 01:09:51,626
Your mom packed it all a month ago.

918
01:09:52,891 --> 01:09:55,536
Will you be OK if you don't know
any Japanese?

919
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,507
I hear that people abroad try to scam
Koreans by overcharging them.

920
01:09:59,753 --> 01:10:02,683
You think your mom
is the type to fall for that?

921
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:04,321
Don't worry.

922
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,818
Also, your mom knows a bit of Japanese.

923
01:10:12,478 --> 01:10:14,126
That's...

924
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:19,720
Hello?

925
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:22,305
Jung Hwan?
Your mom? Hold on.

926
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:24,233
Missus, Jung Hwan's on the phone.

927
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,267
Thanks, OK.

928
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,394
Yeah.

929
01:10:31,405 --> 01:10:33,756
Mom, hurry up and spell it out for me!
I'm in a hurry!

930
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,005
Why did you hang up?

931
01:10:35,388 --> 01:10:36,483
You have your passport, right?

932
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:43,934
My passport... is...
let's see... where was it, again?

933
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,795
My passport...

934
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:49,514
Mom! I told you, there are
people waiting behind me!

935
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:51,498
Just spell it out for me, already!

936
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:56,041
Jung Hwan... water, water, water!
I'm boiling water!

937
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,727
-Talk to you later!
-Mom! Mom!

938
01:10:57,738 --> 01:10:59,983
Missus, I'm going to
Dooly Supermarket for a bit.

939
01:11:00,163 --> 01:11:01,163
OK.

940
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:13,616
But Father... which college
did Mother attend?

941
01:11:14,682 --> 01:11:17,940
I heard that she used to work
at a bank before...

942
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:20,632
...but I don't know what
college she attended.

943
01:11:36,938 --> 01:11:37,954
Hello?

944
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:40,504
Mom! Really!

945
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:43,268
What the hell are you doing?

946
01:11:44,046 --> 01:11:46,734
What's so hard about spelling
your name in English for me?

947
01:11:47,623 --> 01:11:48,821
Hurry up and look at your passport.

948
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:52,671
Yeah...

949
01:11:57,123 --> 01:11:59,309
You have your passport
in your hand, right?

950
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:01,179
Yeah.

951
01:12:01,311 --> 01:12:03,028
And you see your photo
on the first page there.

952
01:12:03,464 --> 01:12:05,855
Your name in English is next to that.
Hurry up and spell it out for me.

953
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,234
Jung Hwan.

954
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:13,316
Yes? Hurry!

955
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:16,687
Jung Hwan...

956
01:12:18,404 --> 01:12:20,333
I don't know English.

957
01:12:23,836 --> 01:12:26,512
I don't know how to read English.

958
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,310
Sorry, Son.

959
01:12:45,131 --> 01:12:46,611
Your mom didn't go to college.

960
01:12:48,024 --> 01:12:49,735
And what's this job at a bank
you're talking about?

961
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:52,738
She said she worked
in the financial sector...

962
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:56,042
She lent money and collected
it in daily installments!

963
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:59,166
Your mom was the biggest lender at Go-han.

964
01:12:59,603 --> 01:13:01,027
And since she was 15 years old, at that.

965
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:04,731
She was quite sharp.

966
01:13:07,266 --> 01:13:09,786
She even worked under
a Japanese person later.

967
01:13:11,014 --> 01:13:16,423
She sold dollars and yen, too,
because she was so smart.

968
01:13:20,538 --> 01:13:23,178
Like me, your mom only graduated
from elementary school.

969
01:13:24,777 --> 01:13:29,053
But what's so important about that?
It doesn't matter a single bit in life.

970
01:13:29,953 --> 01:13:34,013
In my opinion, your mom
is the smartest person in the world.

971
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:40,605
You don't need to go to college or get
a fancy title. These are all not needed.

972
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:44,529
What do you need that piece of paper for?

973
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:49,433
As long as you don't wrong others and can
provide for yourself, that's good enough.

974
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:58,474
I'm fine with it even if you
don't get into college.

975
01:14:00,032 --> 01:14:03,661
Just look at your mom. She's so well off
even though she didn't go to college.

976
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:09,399
Jung Bong...

977
01:14:11,897 --> 01:14:15,613
I'd like it if you
took after your mom

978
01:14:16,806 --> 01:14:18,425
instead of me.

979
01:14:19,282 --> 01:14:21,610
Isn't your mom such an amazing person?

980
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,977
Let's go home.
Cheetah Lady will be waiting.

981
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:31,114
OK.

982
01:14:41,897 --> 01:14:44,770
Should I walk like this
for the rest of the day?

983
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,766
Like this.

984
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:53,677
Honey! Mi Ran, I'm home!

985
01:14:53,971 --> 01:14:55,288
Why did you come back so late?

986
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:56,908
You two ate something
on the way, didn't you?

987
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,837
No, we didn't!

988
01:14:59,072 --> 01:15:01,302
Why don't you take the red bean off
your mouth before you say that?

989
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:06,005
Nothing gets past your mom!
Seriously!

990
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:13,552
Sun Young, your bowls.

991
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,201
I told you I'd come
to get them!

992
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:21,593
It's OK. It's nice to
get some exercise, too.

993
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,968
What do you mean, exercise?
It's barely 10 steps to your house.

994
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:26,836
What about Sun Woo?

995
01:15:27,471 --> 01:15:29,171
He ate dinner
and went to the study room.

996
01:15:29,475 --> 01:15:30,808
He won't be back until after 1:00 a.m.

997
01:15:33,073 --> 01:15:35,782
Jin Joo, aren't you going to say hi?

998
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:42,106
I guess she's scared of me.

999
01:15:42,314 --> 01:15:44,666
Well, you don't exactly
have a cute face.

1000
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:50,646
You're not going home, right?
Your mother is going abroad, right?

1001
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,832
Yeah. I decided
to be a filial son this year.

1002
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:58,036
But... you're going to work
today, too?

1003
01:15:58,324 --> 01:16:02,644
Of course! Tomorrow is Lunar New Year
so I have to earn as much as I can.

1004
01:16:02,836 --> 01:16:04,685
And you're going to leave Jin Joo
at Jung Hwan's?

1005
01:16:04,696 --> 01:16:06,003
Yeah. She plays well on her own.

1006
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:08,943
Why, are you going to watch her?

1007
01:16:09,126 --> 01:16:12,916
Thats... you know that
I'm no good with kids.

1008
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,605
Don't worry,
I'd never leave her with you!

1009
01:16:18,088 --> 01:16:20,960
I bet you'd pass out with another
brain hemorrhage if I did.

1010
01:16:51,108 --> 01:16:52,618
Did you talk to the travel agency?

1011
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,376
Yes.

1012
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,100
Here.

1013
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,074
They were selling them out front,
so I bought some.

1014
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,283
I didn't make any dinner tonight!

1015
01:17:41,427 --> 01:17:42,878
-What? Why?
-What?

1016
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:44,427
We're eating out!

1017
01:17:44,438 --> 01:17:47,819
-Yeah!
-Eating out!

1018
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,884
-Eating out! Eating out!
-Nice!

1019
01:17:55,353 --> 01:17:57,082
Jin Joo!

1020
01:17:59,256 --> 01:18:02,446
-Eating out! Eating out!
-Eating out! Eating out!

1021
01:18:02,457 --> 01:18:05,113
-Dad, we're eating out.
-What?

1022
01:18:05,562 --> 01:18:07,681
We're eating out!
Eating out! Eating out!

1023
01:18:07,692 --> 01:18:13,908
-What are we eating?
-Meat! Eating out! Meat! Eating out!

1024
01:18:13,919 --> 01:18:17,256
Who keeps doing this?

1025
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:21,035
Hey, there must be a dog
in the neighborhood...

1026
01:18:25,037 --> 01:18:27,077
Hey... who did this, again?

1027
01:18:34,734 --> 01:18:38,434
No, where did they all go?

1028
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,217
Thats...

1029
01:18:52,015 --> 01:18:55,407
Oppa. Just this once.

1030
01:19:05,502 --> 01:19:06,671
I don't know.

1031
01:19:09,163 --> 01:19:10,327
Sun Young!

1032
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:13,726
What a great meal.

1033
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:20,208
Back home! Back home!

1034
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:04,814
Hyung, call me when the Saturday
night movie is on.

1035
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:06,122
OK.

1036
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,286
Jung Hwan.

1037
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:13,804
Go sleep in your older brother's
room tonight.

1038
01:20:14,595 --> 01:20:17,189
We can't have girls sleep out here
when it's so cold!

1039
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:19,365
-Bo Ra and Deok Sun...
-Soo Yeon.

1040
01:20:20,594 --> 01:20:21,878
What, you're not done with that?

1041
01:20:23,366 --> 01:20:27,144
Even so, I want to try and
believe her until the very end.

1042
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:30,490
It's not over till it's over,
as they say.

1043
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:32,766
Well, anyway...

1044
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:36,680
...then Bo Ra and Soo Yeon,
sleep in Jung Hwan's room tonight.

1045
01:20:37,037 --> 01:20:38,137
Yes!

1046
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:53,875
Yeah, it's a bed!

1047
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,394
I love it so much!

1048
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:04,663
It's pretty clean in here.

1049
01:21:09,262 --> 01:21:10,751
Good night.

1050
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:11,946
Hey, Kim Jung Hwan.

1051
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:15,534
Good night.

1052
01:21:21,354 --> 01:21:22,755
You two have gotten
really close.

1053
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,796
We were always close.

1054
01:21:25,865 --> 01:21:27,592
But... where did you go
this afternoon?

1055
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:29,157
Mind your own.

1056
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:31,105
I'm not interested, OK?

1057
01:21:32,745 --> 01:21:35,045
Hey, Sung Deok Sun. Do you
notice anything different about me?

1058
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:40,344
You got even uglier!

1059
01:21:41,726 --> 01:21:43,272
What the hell?

1060
01:21:44,089 --> 01:21:47,002
You got uglier so I said so!
What should I say, then?

1061
01:21:47,014 --> 01:21:50,966
You really don't notice
anything different about me?

1062
01:21:51,237 --> 01:21:52,287
Quiet!

1063
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:55,774
We're at someone else's house.
Don't you two dare fight again.

1064
01:21:56,322 --> 01:21:58,349
I'm going to strip both of you
and kick you out... got that?

1065
01:21:58,777 --> 01:21:59,777
Yeah...

1066
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:07,785
OK... here.

1067
01:22:13,532 --> 01:22:15,032
OK... here.

1068
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:18,091
Have a great trip to Japan, OK?

1069
01:22:18,102 --> 01:22:19,441
Let's drink to that!

1070
01:22:19,452 --> 01:22:22,530
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1071
01:22:25,743 --> 01:22:29,039
Thats... I'm so jealous of you two.

1072
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:33,106
You live in this great house
and you're going abroad, to boot.

1073
01:22:33,195 --> 01:22:36,332
One of you must be so blessed for
this to have all happened.

1074
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,668
I'm so jealous, really.

1075
01:22:38,455 --> 01:22:41,099
If only Jung Bong
had gotten into a college...

1076
01:22:41,893 --> 01:22:43,061
Stop that.

1077
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:48,418
Yes. He can just take it again next year.

1078
01:22:48,545 --> 01:22:50,926
It'll be his seventh time!

1079
01:22:51,148 --> 01:22:53,969
If he'd gone to college seven years ago,
he already would've graduated by now!

1080
01:22:54,017 --> 01:22:57,162
Yeah. And if he'd gone to the army,
he'd be a Sergeant Major by now.

1081
01:22:58,528 --> 01:23:00,488
We shouldn't have gone
to get our fortunes told.

1082
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:04,155
If she hadn't brought up that
"Great fortune" talk...

1083
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,301
...we didn't expect anything.

1084
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,696
Why? Did she say that he'd have
great fortune, or something?

1085
01:23:08,714 --> 01:23:14,614
Yes, she did. So we thought he'd
get into college this time for sure!

1086
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:17,561
Well, you never know... he
might have been lucky in some other way.

1087
01:23:18,571 --> 01:23:20,254
-Some other way?
-Well, yeah.

1088
01:23:20,658 --> 01:23:21,851
What do you mean by that?

1089
01:23:22,103 --> 01:23:25,932
Hell if I know!
I'm not a fortune teller!

1090
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:30,955
What could be greater fortune
in life than this?

1091
01:23:51,905 --> 01:23:54,631
One Free Bag

1092
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:19,281
She told Deok Sun
to change her name,

1093
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:21,633
and she said that Jung
Bong would be lucky.

1094
01:24:21,855 --> 01:24:24,700
So, what did she tell
Sun Woo's mom, then?

1095
01:24:27,156 --> 01:24:29,412
It's so embarrassing that
I can't bring myself to tell you.

1096
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:32,160
Nothing you need to know about.

1097
01:24:32,311 --> 01:24:35,086
You're making me so curious.

1098
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:39,731
Maybe she said that she'd meet a nice man
and get married or something.

1099
01:24:39,896 --> 01:24:41,550
Thats. Mind your own business.

1100
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:46,462
Yeah. Jin Joo.
What do we do about her?

1101
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:49,303
Oh no. We forgot about that.

1102
01:24:50,259 --> 01:24:51,878
I wonder where she left her?

1103
01:25:06,243 --> 01:25:07,991
Oppa. Sorry I'm so late!

1104
01:25:13,326 --> 01:25:14,458
Oppa?

1105
01:25:23,948 --> 01:25:25,033
You're back?

1106
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,466
Are... you OK?

1107
01:25:30,717 --> 01:25:31,717
I'm dying.

1108
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:36,674
She's definitely your daughter alright.

1109
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:40,740
She is very peculiar!

1110
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,870
Hi, Jin Joo.

1111
01:25:54,286 --> 01:25:56,096
Mister, what's this?

1112
01:25:58,559 --> 01:25:59,872
Be gentle. It hurts.

1113
01:26:07,347 --> 01:26:09,689
Funny.

1114
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:40,474
Jung Hwan.

1115
01:29:41,271 --> 01:29:42,508
Yeah?

1116
01:29:44,691 --> 01:29:46,194
Let's go to the concert together.

1117
01:29:49,464 --> 01:29:50,508
OK?

1118
01:30:00,398 --> 01:30:01,631
Let's go together.

1119
01:30:06,756 --> 01:30:07,895
You'll go, right?

1120
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,700
Yeah.

1121
01:30:15,638 --> 01:30:16,638
I'll go.

1122
01:31:26,729 --> 01:31:28,395
Where were you all day today?

1123
01:31:30,034 --> 01:31:33,321
I just had something to do.
You don't need to know.

1124
01:31:37,823 --> 01:31:39,010
But... noona.

1125
01:31:41,487 --> 01:31:43,093
Were you waiting for me?

1126
01:31:44,429 --> 01:31:46,667
Who else would I be waiting for,
then, at this hour?

1127
01:31:48,927 --> 01:31:53,708
Thats, dating a high schooler sure is
difficult.

1128
01:32:08,511 --> 01:32:10,743
You got new glasses.

1129
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:18,646
You look pretty.

1130
01:32:34,008 --> 01:32:35,008
Noona.

1131
01:32:43,331 --> 01:32:44,762
Can I kiss you?

1132
01:34:27,702 --> 01:34:30,195
Pack your things quickly and go, OK?
Your grandmother is waiting.

1133
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:32,355
-Yes, Mother.
-Don't worry and have a safe trip.

1134
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,149
We're off, then!

1135
01:34:34,212 --> 01:34:35,212
OK.

1136
01:34:42,799 --> 01:34:45,026
-Mister. Gimpo Airport, please.
-Sure.

1137
01:34:55,495 --> 01:35:00,805
Thats, I wonder if they'll be OK.
They're so immature.

1138
01:35:02,099 --> 01:35:04,619
Don't worry.
Whose children are they, after all?

1139
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,566
Whose?

1140
01:35:06,643 --> 01:35:08,432
Yours, of course!

1141
01:35:09,299 --> 01:35:11,403
They're all grown now.
Don't worry.

1142
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:14,988
What do you mean, they're all grown?
They still have a way to go.

1143
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:18,336
You packed the passports, right?

1144
01:35:19,448 --> 01:35:20,755
Darn it! The passports!

1145
01:35:25,476 --> 01:35:27,921
-They're right here!
-Really...

1146
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:31,673
Shall we take a look
at your photo?

1147
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:33,641
Why? I look like Miss Korea anyway.

1148
01:35:34,421 --> 01:35:37,161
What's this?
Did you write this?

1149
01:35:37,351 --> 01:35:38,383
What?

1150
01:35:38,597 --> 01:35:41,284
This. This.
Did you write this?

1151
01:35:42,924 --> 01:35:45,884
Em, Ai, Ar, Ay, An, Ar, Ay

1152
01:35:48,855 --> 01:35:53,916
Em, Ai, Ar, Ay, An, Ar, Ay

1153
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,347
Jung Hwan wrote it.
I can tell just by looking.

1154
01:36:20,549 --> 01:36:22,270
Really?

1155
01:36:23,675 --> 01:36:26,335
Thats... Jung Hwan even knows how to
do these kind of considerate things?

1156
01:36:27,421 --> 01:36:29,907
I was going to ask the kids

1157
01:36:30,106 --> 01:36:31,956
but I couldn't, because
it's a bit embarrassing.

1158
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:35,481
Our Jung Hwan knows
how to be so considerate like this.

1159
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,022
He's all grown.

1160
01:36:47,078 --> 01:36:49,626
Yeah... he is.

1161
01:36:52,921 --> 01:36:54,942
My child's all grown.

1162
01:36:59,415 --> 01:37:03,522
Did your mother leave already?
I couldn't even say goodbye. Really...

1163
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,691
We're late for the train!
Hurry it up!

1164
01:37:05,702 --> 01:37:06,702
I'm coming!

1165
01:37:07,983 --> 01:37:09,723
Have a great New Year!

1166
01:37:09,773 --> 01:37:10,773
OK!

1167
01:37:11,572 --> 01:37:12,660
Bye.

1168
01:37:15,306 --> 01:37:16,826
Hurry up, already!

1169
01:37:19,962 --> 01:37:20,962
Hello.

1170
01:37:21,605 --> 01:37:24,032
-Are you leaving now?
-Yeah!

1171
01:37:24,043 --> 01:37:26,083
-The bus will be quite crowded!
-We're taking the train!

1172
01:37:26,094 --> 01:37:27,499
Watch over the block for us!

1173
01:37:27,686 --> 01:37:29,556
-Have a safe trip!
-OK!

1174
01:37:33,746 --> 01:37:36,006
Oppa! Jung Bong oppa!
Wait!

1175
01:37:39,172 --> 01:37:40,172
Here.

1176
01:37:44,044 --> 01:37:46,411
I totally forgot about it. My friend
Man Ok wanted me to give it to you.

1177
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:50,428
You know Man Ok, right?
I heard you two met before.

1178
01:37:51,123 --> 01:37:52,123
Yeah.

1179
01:37:52,383 --> 01:37:54,423
Wow... What a coincidence!

1180
01:37:56,325 --> 01:38:00,545
You got really lucky this year! A love
letter to Kim Jung Bong, of all people?

1181
01:38:05,202 --> 01:38:06,302
I'm really going this time!

1182
01:38:14,767 --> 01:38:16,452
-Lil bro.
-Yeah?

1183
01:38:16,856 --> 01:38:18,918
This Lunar year isn't over yet, right?

1184
01:38:19,762 --> 01:38:20,800
What are you talking about?

1185
01:38:21,015 --> 01:38:22,308
No need to worry about it.

1186
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:49,045
Iit's so quiet because of
the Lunar New Year.

1187
01:38:49,172 --> 01:38:50,522
Everyone went back hometowns.

1188
01:38:50,779 --> 01:38:51,998
So cold... so cold.

1189
01:39:06,457 --> 01:39:07,846
There's so many... right, Jin Joo?

1190
01:39:07,857 --> 01:39:10,652
Sun Woo! Give them a call one more time
and tell them to hurry over!

1191
01:39:10,763 --> 01:39:12,533
-OK.
-I'm here.

1192
01:39:12,616 --> 01:39:14,957
No need to call.

1193
01:39:15,361 --> 01:39:16,361
Hello.

1194
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:18,602
Hi, Sun Woo.
It's been a while.

1195
01:39:18,905 --> 01:39:21,011
You should have hurried over!
The food will get all bloated!

1196
01:39:21,126 --> 01:39:22,187
Is it rice cake soup?

1197
01:39:22,401 --> 01:39:24,387
It's the Lunar New Year, after all.
You know that, right?

1198
01:39:24,442 --> 01:39:25,442
I know.

1199
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:27,626
-What about Taek?
-He's coming.

1200
01:39:27,907 --> 01:39:29,056
I'll go get him.

1201
01:39:29,067 --> 01:39:31,823
No, it's OK. Eat.
He'll probably be be here soon.

1202
01:39:32,108 --> 01:39:34,550
He totally loses himself when he
plays Baduk. I'll go get him.

1203
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:37,870
OK, hurry over, then.

1204
01:39:42,034 --> 01:39:43,276
You went to get
your fortune told?

1205
01:39:44,188 --> 01:39:45,793
So... what did they say?

1206
01:39:47,254 --> 01:39:52,179
Don't even bring it up. The ladies were
about to pass out because of my fortune.

1207
01:39:52,957 --> 01:39:56,422
Really? Why?
What did she say?

1208
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:00,489
I'm only telling you
because it's you oppa.

1209
01:40:16,025 --> 01:40:20,137
I see a greater happiness
than that... in your fate.

1210
01:40:20,234 --> 01:40:21,234
What?

1211
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:24,050
Me? In my fate?

1212
01:40:24,821 --> 01:40:26,111
What is it?

1213
01:40:27,517 --> 01:40:29,130
You're getting another son.

1214
01:40:29,937 --> 01:40:30,937
What?

1215
01:40:31,515 --> 01:40:32,610
My God.

1216
01:40:33,418 --> 01:40:34,532
What the hell?

1217
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:37,416
You have quite a blessing
ahead of you, indeed. Right?

1218
01:40:40,739 --> 01:40:42,685
You can still get pregnant, right?

1219
01:40:42,955 --> 01:40:44,965
Thats, it's so great to be young!

1220
01:40:52,655 --> 01:40:53,873
Isn't it funny to you too?

1221
01:40:53,946 --> 01:40:57,645
Really... I'm not at a
child bearing age anymore!

1222
01:40:57,757 --> 01:41:00,727
I can't believe what she said to me.

1223
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:03,476
It was just a waste of money!

1224
01:41:03,914 --> 01:41:06,750
Well, you never know...
You're still young!

1225
01:41:07,476 --> 01:41:08,476
What?

1226
01:41:08,737 --> 01:41:13,812
You must be out of your mind.
I'm in my mid forties!

1227
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:19,603
Well, unless some child
fell out of the sky...

1228
01:41:23,163 --> 01:41:24,292
Right, Sun Woo?

1229
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:25,927
What? What do you mean?

1230
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:31,204
Hello.

1231
01:41:36,403 --> 01:41:38,226
Happy New Year, Ma'am.

1232
01:41:39,186 --> 01:41:40,186
Hi, Jin Joo.

1233
01:41:40,308 --> 01:41:41,308
Eat.

1234
01:41:42,466 --> 01:41:43,533
Did you stay up all night again?

1235
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,980
I'm fine.

1236
01:41:45,839 --> 01:41:46,944
Is your big match over?

1237
01:41:47,446 --> 01:41:48,446
Yeah.

1238
01:41:48,899 --> 01:41:50,829
Tell them to stop scheduling
matches for you already.

1239
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:53,219
The biggest match
is over now, so it's fine.

1240
01:41:53,418 --> 01:41:54,904
I can rest today and tomorrow.

1241
01:41:59,877 --> 01:42:01,577
How do I even eat this?

1242
01:42:01,809 --> 01:42:03,285
Just eat it, you punk!

1243
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:04,851
Here, say "Ah!"

1244
01:42:13,852 --> 01:42:14,932
Hi Deok Sun.

1245
01:42:16,683 --> 01:42:18,288
You really like her as a woman?

1246
01:42:20,463 --> 01:42:21,648
She's cute.

1247
01:42:22,257 --> 01:42:23,403
What are you two doing?

1248
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:26,429
I'm leaving.

1249
01:42:26,586 --> 01:42:30,354
Jin Joo... Let's play together
later, OK?

1250
01:42:30,459 --> 01:42:31,895
Sun Woo doesn't know yet, right?

1251
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:34,549
I'm nervous that he'll find out.

1252
01:42:34,668 --> 01:42:35,875
Sun Woo doesn't know yet?

1253
01:42:35,929 --> 01:42:37,407
No, of course not!
I'd be in big trouble!

1254
01:42:37,555 --> 01:42:39,397
It's not that your mother
has something else going on...

1255
01:42:39,446 --> 01:42:41,381
Why do you know something
that even I don't know?

1256
01:42:41,636 --> 01:42:43,424
Why do you know something
that even her son...

1257
01:42:46,805 --> 01:42:47,825
-What?
-What?

1258
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,048
Crazy jerk.

1259
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:51,393
Noona!

1260
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:53,010
See you tomorrow!

1261
01:42:54,058 --> 01:42:56,429
When are we going then?
Should we go during the weekend?

1262
01:43:00,978 --> 01:43:02,102
Are you done crying?

1263
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:04,390
Taek's sure got game.
