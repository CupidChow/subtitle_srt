1
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,057
My ghosh, look at the time.

2
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,598
It's time for Room Relay.

3
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:24,783
-Have dinner, Moo Sung.
-OK.

4
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,707
Don't wobble around trying to do dishes.
Just leave them off to the side.

5
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,359
I'll come by later tonight
to take care of it.

6
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm off.

7
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:35,490
OK.

8
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:53,399
You guys like you
could just crawl right in!

9
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:56,712
Crawl into the TV,
why don't you?

10
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,639
She's so pretty.

11
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:16,088
You both have short hair, and yet...

12
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:38,325
Lee Sun Hee

13
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,830
My God!

14
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,989
By Kim Ji Ae.

15
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:24,329
You've just left
your love behind and left?

16
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:28,159
You despicable person...

17
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,117
What are you doing, so late at night?

18
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm making fried rice for
the kids tomorrow morning.

19
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,358
I'm prepping in advance.

20
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:42,196
But... where did the ham go?

21
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,668
I bought some today
and put it here, for sure...

22
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,161
What ham?
I'm sure it's in the fridge.

23
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,398
There's a different kind of ham
that Americans eat.

24
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,876
It's expensive, so I only buy it
occasionally...

25
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:55,696
Did you eat it?

26
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:57,959
I'd have to know what it was
to eat it, wouldn't I?

27
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,464
You're not going home?

28
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:14,586
The dean knows that I'm here,
and my mom is out for a company dinner.

29
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:16,453
Did Jung Bong leave the temple?

30
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:17,850
Yeah. He came home today.

31
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,202
That's amazing.

32
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,555
How could he last there for ten days?

33
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,374
And he probably likes meat more than
anyone else in the world too.

34
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:27,759
He likes the food they serve
at Buddhist temples.

35
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,363
I mean, even so, ten days...

36
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,361
If you're not going home, sleep over.

37
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,966
I can't. I have to
wake up early tomorrow.

38
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,093
I'm sleeping at home.

39
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,605
Isn't tomorrow your birthday?

40
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:19,638
Yeah. My mom said she's making me
breakfast tomorrow, herself.

41
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,802
Really? Your mom is going to cook?

42
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,193
Yeah. She said she's making me beef
and seaweed soup for my birthday.

43
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,935
It's been a few months since I've had
her cooking. Does that make any sense?

44
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:32,802
Good... congratulations.

45
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:34,185
Thanks.

46
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,088
Dong Ryong.

47
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,201
I have some urgent business
to take care of at work.

48
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,616
I'm heading out early.

49
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,293
Buy something delicious
to eat with your friends!

50
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:01,461
I love you! From Mom.

51
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:27,121
Episode 10: Memory

52
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,600
January 1989

53
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:30,777
Let's go inside.

54
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:32,110
Hey. Nobody's home, right?

55
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,148
My mom and dad went to a relative's
wedding and No Eul went with them.

56
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:37,679
My older sister is heading out soon.

57
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,026
-Your older sister?
-She's home?

58
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:39,955
-No, thanks.
-No, thanks.

59
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,106
It's fine!
She won't bite!

60
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,547
I want to stay here.
I'll come inside when she leaves.

61
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,201
I'm telling you, it's fine.

62
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:48,939
And we'll be in the living
room the whole time.

63
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,948
If we bump into her,
just give her a proper greeting.

64
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,412
A 90-degree bow. Got it?

65
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:53,977
It's cold.

66
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,422
Wait.

67
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:56,947
That's Duckie's house, right?

68
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,163
Duckie?
Who's that?

69
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:03,200
It's not Duckie.
It's Taek.

70
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,046
That's the place.
It's the jewelry store.

71
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,849
That's his house, right?

72
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:09,510
Hey, can you ask him to come out?

73
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:10,787
I want to see what he looks like.

74
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:14,291
Yeah, we see him often enough on TV...
let's get a glimpse of the real thing!

75
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,526
No. Never.

76
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,565
-Why not?
-Why not?

77
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:18,780
You can't mess with him.

78
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:21,676
You can mess with anyone else,
but not our Taek.

79
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,149
If he meets people like you,
he'll become corrupted.

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,124
Taek is our block's greatest treasure!
We have to protect him.

81
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:30,005
And he's at the Baduk Club now,
so he's not home.

82
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,738
It's cold. Let's go inside.

83
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,256
Hey!

84
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:36,571
Hi.

85
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,945
-Hello.
-Hello.

86
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,422
You guys are hanging out
at Duk Seon's?

87
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,386
Hey, let's go with him instead.
Can't we hang out together?

88
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,199
-Duk Seon. Is your sister...
-No! She went out early this morning!

89
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,315
Hey, this is your place?

90
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:07,435
It's huge!

91
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,326
It's almost as big as Man Ok's place!

92
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,304
It's like the Global Village at Everland!

93
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,753
My place is... down here.

94
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,473
It's embarrassing. I didn't
want to bring you guys over...

95
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:23,189
But we're friends.
There shouldn't be secrets among us.

96
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,165
Hey. I'm being real generous here.

97
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,727
It's not a crime to be poor...
being ugly is a crime though.

98
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:36,451
And you're pretty.

99
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,970
Let's go. I'll make
some ramen on the stove.

100
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,381
Hey, you still eat
gas stove ramen?

101
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:48,661
You don't know the everyday lives
of us normal folk, Man Ok!

102
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,330
It's awesome!
It boils so quickly too!

103
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,396
-I can't stand rich girls like you.
-I'm sorry!

104
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,890
I'm off then, Bo Ra!

105
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,613
-Hello.
-Hello.

106
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:01,940
Hello.

107
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:03,973
Why are you coming out of my house?

108
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:10,463
I... I had something
to talk to you about.

109
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,704
With me?

110
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:13,824
Yeah.

111
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,478
Let's talk for a second.

112
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,596
-Hello.
-Hello.

113
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,120
What are you doing? Sit.

114
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,453
-OK.
-OK.

115
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,155
Hurry up and leave!

116
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:04,014
Hey.

117
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,604
Don't you dare turn the house
into a mess. Play quietly.

118
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,949
Why don't you say that after you've
cleaned at least once in your lifetime?

119
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,704
What the hell did you just say?

120
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:17,082
All right... we'll play quietly.

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,272
Mom. It's Dad's birthday tomorrow.

122
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:41,234
Yeah. Jung Hwan,
let's go outside together.

123
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:42,546
To where?

124
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:44,333
We got a new car.

125
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:45,609
What?

126
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:48,518
I gave your dad his birthday present
in advance. 20 million won.

127
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:49,878
20 million won?

128
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:55,597
Yeah. I finally caught that woman who
owes me money and got my 20 million back.

129
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,403
OK... that 20 million won?

130
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,968
Your dad always gets gloomy
around his birthday...

131
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,751
...so I splurged on him
a bit this time around.

132
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,658
I told him to buy that car
he wants.

133
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,715
He parked it right out front,
and told us to come see it.

134
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,218
What did he get?

135
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:11,768
No way... a Grendizer?

136
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,003
You think your dad, the scrooge,
would buy such a thing?

137
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,591
I'm not even hoping
for anything extravagant.

138
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:20,493
Probably a Sonata,
or a Capital, or a Stella.

139
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:23,479
Even so, that's better than
driving his work car around.

140
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,133
No way. Even so,
you gave him 20 million won.

141
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:27,358
Right?

142
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,232
I wonder if he bought a Grendizer...

143
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,746
Surprise! Our new car is here!

144
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,147
What the hell is this?

145
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:49,521
What do you mean?
A man's pride!

146
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,504
I got us a Pride! How is it? It
looks like a new one, right?

147
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:57,076
Thats... on top of that,
it's a used car...

148
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,322
Hurry up, get in.
I'll take us around the neighborhood.

149
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,585
You have fun yourself.

150
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,944
A group blind date?
With whom?

151
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:31,119
With the guys at Sun Deok High.

152
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,646
One of them is my classmate from
elementary school.

153
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:37,390
He's really good looking. And he'll bring
a friend, so there will be two guys.

154
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:38,777
Next week, in Donamdong.

155
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:40,453
Do they care a lot about looks?

156
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:41,498
-They said they don't.
-Yes!

157
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,722
-You two will come, right?
-I'm not going.

158
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,304
Why not? Who knows?

159
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,114
You might meet the man
you're destined to be with!

160
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,496
Destiny, my ass.

161
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,048
There's no such thing in this world.

162
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,573
Hey, you could
fall in love at first sight.

163
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:58,459
Yeah. You don't  know that you will run
to the man you're supposed to end up with?

164
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,296
Hey... you two need to stop
reading your romance novels.

165
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,243
Things like that
don't happen in real life.

166
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,229
Whatever. Then I'll go by myself.

167
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,681
Let's make it a one on one
blind date then.

168
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:10,366
OK, then. We'll do that.

169
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:12,885
You better treat me nice
if it goes well, Sung Duk Seon.

170
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,237
If it does go well, that is.

171
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,962
Hey, but what did he talk
to you about earlier?

172
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,145
When?

173
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:21,108
You know, the scary looking guy.

174
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:23,721
Yes, Jung Hwan? He asked me
to go see a movie with him.

175
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,923
He wanted to see
a movie this weekend.

176
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,954
It's nothing like that!
He's really just a friend!

177
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,210
Friend, my ass.
I'm telling you, he really likes you!

178
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:37,237
Want to bet on it?

179
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:39,979
Hey. I could tell just by
the look in his eyes before.

180
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:42,393
Duk Seon. We're telling you,
it's for real this time!

181
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:43,886
What?

182
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:47,390
All you have to do is confirm it.

183
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,723
How?

184
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:53,342
Tell him that you're going
on a blind date.

185
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:55,080
What?

186
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,426
If he says, "OK, go ahead..."

187
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,802
...then he really just
thinks of you as a friend.

188
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:08,734
But if he says, "Don't do it," or asks,
"Are you crazy?" or "Do you want to die?"

189
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,443
Then he definitely likes you.

190
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,207
Hey. What about "Have you gone mad?"
That one doesn't count?

191
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:15,851
Of course it does!
That's not what's important!

192
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,258
His objection to her going on
a date is the key element here!

193
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,374
But... what if he really does
object to me going on the date?

194
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:25,225
What do you mean?
Go out with him.

195
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:26,925
Is the blind date so important right now?

196
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,570
When there's a chance he might like you?

197
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:33,115
No, that's not it.
What do I do if he really likes me?

198
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:37,786
Why are you asking us that?

199
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:39,669
That's up to you.

200
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,824
-What?
-Do you like him?

201
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:49,960
I don't know.

202
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,463
Then date him.
Date him first, then decide later.

203
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:57,641
Doing things like that would make
me uncomfortable.

204
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,467
Live with us forever, if you want
to always take the easy route, then.

205
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:03,125
First, confirm his feelings.

206
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,363
Don't mess around.
Ask him in a serious way.

207
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:06,818
-Got it?
-Hey.

208
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,525
I'm 100 percent sure.
Have I ever steered you wrong?

209
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:19,625
The Student Council President
at Ssangmun High...

210
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:22,326
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:24,693
I really thought he did...

212
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:29,507
Hey, but... who's the person he likes?
Is it someone we know?

213
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,151
No! It's some wretch
you don't know, OK?

214
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:33,583
Well... no need to yell.

215
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,022
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,455
"Don't Sleep" Study Room

217
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,832
Men's Section

218
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:32,225
Darn it!

219
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:41,258
Can't go. Go with the others.
Sung Bo Ra.

220
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:03,839
What are you looking at?

221
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,562
Just looking.

222
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:11,155
I'm going to the study room.

223
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:14,055
Want me to drop you off
in our new car?

224
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:15,866
No, thank you.
It's nearby, anyway.

225
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:20,196
But... I haven't seen Jung Bong all day.
Do you know where he is?

226
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,426
What's he obsessed with this time?

227
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,321
-The arcade.
-Again?

228
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:36,158
If you're a man, you have to go
to places like arcades and whatnot.

229
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:37,424
Which game?

230
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:43,283
This one? This one?
This one? This one?

231
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,419
No. Boggle Boggle.

232
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,473
Boggle Boggle 50 won per game

233
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,151
Eating clock to extend time will result
in you being kicked out. No exceptions.

234
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:09,673
Darn it... darn it!

235
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:16,980
All right!
Nice.

236
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:33,703
What the hell?
Why are you so surprised?

237
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:35,547
What?

238
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:39,220
No... I'm not.

239
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,730
-Are you going somewhere?
-To the study room.

240
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:47,720
Why there, of all places?
You always study at home.

241
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,228
Sun Woo let me take his seat.

242
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,001
He's going to see a concert tonight

243
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,717
so he's studying at home
in the afternoon.

244
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:54,949
Like that...

245
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:03,808
What? Do you have something
to say to me?

246
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:05,881
No.

247
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,584
What concert is Sun Woo going to?
The Lee Sun Hee Concert?

248
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,848
Yeah. He was really
excited for it before.

249
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:17,293
You sure nothing to say with me?

250
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:20,087
Yeah.
Bye.

251
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,071
What the hell?
Why is she going back inside?

252
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:57,524
Why are you here?

253
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:00,622
That... I came here
to see Duk Seon, and then...

254
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,934
I thought I'd look around
to see what it's like in here.

255
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,190
Can't go. Go with the others.
From : Sung Bo Ra

256
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:08,782
But... are you alone?

257
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,071
What about Dong Ryong
and Sun Woo?

258
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,534
Sun Woo didn't come here today.

259
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:18,093
He left early to see
the Lee Sun Hee concert.

260
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:21,263
But, wasn't he planning to go with...

261
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,822
Bo Ra!
Bo Ra!

262
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:31,114
Darn it... so annoying!

263
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:42,676
Lee Sun Hee, Live in Concert '89

264
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,277
Moo Sung!
Have some dinner.

265
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,433
I made some fish for you.
It's good for lowering cholesterol.

266
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,071
Also, Taek said that he'll eat later.
I set the table with dinner for him.

267
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:16,788
All you need to do
is reheat the soup.

268
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:22,373
-OK. Why don't you...
-Can you even hear that? Raise the volume!

269
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,954
Taek won't hear it from his room.

270
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,369
I can hear it fine.
It's OK.

271
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:30,804
Taek has headphones on.
You can raise the volume.

272
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:32,021
Really?

273
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:36,262
-I'll be going then.
-After you're done eating, don't...

274
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,566
Don't clear the table.
Just put it off to the side.

275
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,159
-Bye.
-OK. Bye.

276
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,398
She's so great at singing...

277
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:57,304
Lee Sun Hee, Live in Concert '89

278
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,371
The concert will start soon!
Please come inside!

279
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:04,462
Excuse me.
You have to come inside now.

280
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:06,671
Yes, just a second.

281
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:13,686
Hey!

282
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:18,948
Here.

283
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,598
Hey, why didn't you go to
the study room today?

284
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:26,214
I left the ticket on your desk...

285
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:29,744
...to tell you that I couldn't make it
for you to go with your friends.

286
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,443
I even left you a note!

287
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,820
So what I'm saying is...
the reason I came here is...

288
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,062
...not because I wanted to come...

289
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,970
...but because I wanted
to give this back to you!

290
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,652
I left this at the study room.
But you didn't see it, so...

291
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:53,974
You really inconvenience
other people, you know that?

292
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:59,910
Don't get the wrong idea.
Seriously. Got it?

293
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,636
If you're here,
that's good enough for me.

294
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:05,566
What?

295
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,481
If you're here, that's good enough.

296
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:11,534
-Let's go.
-Hey... wait! Wait!

297
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,099
Wait... darn it!

298
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:32,803
What are you doing here?

299
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,844
Thats... I had something to ask you.

300
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:40,976
-Hey, you know...
-Let's go to my room and talk. It's cold.

301
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:02,900
-Go ahead.
-OK.

302
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:08,559
What is it?

303
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,248
I'm going on a blind date this week.

304
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:20,292
He's a junior from Sun Deok High.
His name is Choi Jae Young.

305
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,269
He's Ja Hyun's classmate
from her elementary school.

306
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,985
Should I go on the blind date?

307
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:37,501
Well, should I?

308
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,351
Good night.

309
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:24,914
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you!

310
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:31,835
Happy birthday, dear Dad...
happy birthday to you!

311
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,292
-Hurry, blow out the candles.
-OK.

312
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:45,606
-Father. This is a gift for you.
-Thanks.

313
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:48,497
Well, look at this...
Since when do you two give us gifts?

314
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:51,143
-What is it?
-A themed tea set.

315
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:53,900
Oh, I see... nice.

316
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,315
Duk Seon picked it out, right?

317
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,388
Yes. Do you think we know
to buy something like this?

318
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:00,296
Hurry up and open it.
I want to take a look.

319
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,474
Later.
I'll open it later.

320
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,476
Let's eat.

321
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,449
Yes.

322
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:29,778
Thanks for the meal.

323
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:39,090
Hey, President Kim!

324
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:48,377
Hey, President Sung!

325
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:55,725
-It's so great to see you!
-It's so great to see you!

326
00:28:57,634 --> 00:28:59,430
Happy birthday, Mister!

327
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,931
Yes. Thank you.

328
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,406
It's strange.

329
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:42,673
Every year on my birthday,
I feel so depressed.

330
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:46,805
Did you ever get the crap beaten
out of you on your birthday?

331
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:48,687
No.

332
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:52,592
This didn't happen a lot in the past,
but it's been happening a lot lately.

333
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,663
Yeah... That is.

334
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:01,129
Is it because you miss
your deceased mother?

335
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,452
No. It's been more than ten years
since she passed away.

336
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,788
I don't even remember
what she looks like anymore.

337
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:13,001
Then... have you ever broken up
with a woman on your birthday?

338
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,590
Why, if I said yes,
would you bring her here?

339
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:21,396
Yeah. If it would make you happy,
I would do that. And more, if I had to.

340
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,622
I'd let you two spend
some time alone together.

341
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,603
In my life, there are
no women besides you.

342
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,193
Can you get me some blankets?

343
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,792
Throw this crap out already!

344
00:30:43,254 --> 00:30:45,580
Everything in there will eventually
have a useful purpose.

345
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,782
Leave it.

346
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:01,342
Don't you throw away a single thing,
got it? I won't allow it.

347
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,778
You're not eating the cream?
Give it to me then.

348
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:30,842
No.

349
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:33,323
I love cream.

350
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:37,893
I'm going to collect it all...
and eat it in one shot, like this.

351
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:49,260
Then, can you eat a slice
in one mouthful?

352
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:14,915
OK. This time, try to eat it without
getting any cream on your mouth.

353
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,339
Hey, hey, hey!

354
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,963
How old are you, that you're
still playing with your food?

355
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:24,680
Follow me.
I have something to give you.

356
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:29,224
- You're not going to the arcade today?
- What?

357
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:31,643
I thought you said you were
going to play Boggle Boggle.

358
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:33,787
You play Boggle Boggle?

359
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:36,494
I have the highest score at the arcade.

360
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,271
Jung Bong can't go to the arcades
in this neighborhood anymore.

361
00:32:44,306 --> 00:32:46,187
He got into a turf war with
some elementary school kids.

362
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,020
-You go to Banghakdong now, right?
-Yeah.

363
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:56,617
Banghakdong? My friend lives there.

364
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:58,215
Her name is Maggie.
Maggie Cheung.

365
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,217
She's the richest person in Banghakdong.

366
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,592
Maggie Cheung, my ass...

367
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:03,586
How could you even
think to call her that?

368
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:05,117
In my eyes she's Maggie Cheung, OK?

369
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,033
Then, in my eyes,
Dong Ryong is Jang Kook Young.

370
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:13,328
Hey, friend! Happy birthday!

371
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,649
-Hello.
-Where's your father?

372
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,375
-You're here?
-Yes.

373
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,065
Hello.

374
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:26,022
I guess the party is over. I made some
of these. I know how much he likes them.

375
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,537
He's feeling a bit down today.

376
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:35,605
Why? But it's his birthday! How strange...
he's so jolly every other day of the year.

377
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:39,969
Hello?

378
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:41,622
Hey, Dong Ryong.

379
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:46,085
For some strange reason,
he's always gloomy on his birthday.

380
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,343
I don't know why either.

381
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:50,392
What? You ran away from home?

382
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:53,809
So where are you now, then?

383
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,753
You crazy jerk!

384
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:07,649
Yeah. Yeah.

385
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:11,058
OK. Don't go anywhere. Stay there.

386
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,655
I said OK, already!

387
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,537
OK, I won't tell anyone.

388
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,248
Don't go anywhere else.
Stay put. I'm leaving now.

389
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,157
Dong Ryong ran away from home?

390
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,461
Yeah. He said he left
yesterday morning.

391
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:29,999
He's at Daecheon Beach right now.

392
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:32,308
-Daecheon?
-Where is that?

393
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:34,147
-Near the southern shore.
-Right?

394
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:36,760
He said that he ran out of money,
and that he wants me to come alone.

395
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:40,525
And he said not to tell his mom
or dad, no matter what.

396
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:43,415
He said that if his parents come,
he'll just run away.

397
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:46,428
My god. Why would such
a good child do this?

398
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,015
He's really not that type of kid.

399
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,782
Yeah. I'd expect one of my kids
to do that more than him.

400
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,993
What can we do about
another family's issues?

401
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:59,415
Why don't you go and convince
him to come home?

402
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,215
We'll just pretend that we don't know
anything until you get back.

403
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:05,068
OK. I'll go with everyone else.

404
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:08,626
Even so, you have to
take an adult with you!

405
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:29,584
Hey, you're coming too?
You don't have a match today?

406
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,438
Lower your head!
I can't see anything!

407
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:38,895
-Why are you speaking to Taek like that?
-Don't do that to Taek.

408
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,126
Darn it... you all treasure him so much.

409
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:44,209
His Japan match got canceled. This
is his first break in quite a while.

410
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,417
Let's go. What if he runs
off somewhere else?

411
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:49,317
Darn it...

412
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:52,677
When I catch that jerk,
I'll rip him apart, limb from limb!

413
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:54,645
Darn it...

414
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,339
Let's go catch Dong Ryong!

415
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,026
You brought some tapes, right?

416
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:03,290
Music... get ready... and start!

417
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:05,751
Let's music!

418
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,684
Hey, it's not "Let's mu..."

419
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,891
Whatever.

420
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,558
That, good choice, Sun Woo.

421
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,465
You know this song, right, Taek?

422
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,284
Of course. It's by Lee Moon Sae. Right?

423
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,742
-Great!
-Good! How did you know?

424
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,313
What about the title?
Do you know the title?

425
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,591
The title?

426
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:30,309
That... sky... sunset?

427
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:32,805
-Hey! What the hell?
-What the hell is that?

428
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,521
Hey! Shut it!

429
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:50,449
I love you!
You're all I have in this world.

430
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:53,984
I cry out your name
over and over again...

431
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:58,715
-But I see is that silent, fiery sunset.
-Shut it!

432
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,325
Jung Hwan. Where is Dong Ryong now?

433
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:17,384
-He says he's with Yun Fat.
-What? Who?

434
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:23,786
You know, Chow Yun Fat... Whatever.
He just keeps talking nonsense.

435
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:24,829
Welcome to Daecheon Beach

436
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,920
I love you, Milkis!

437
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:19,157
Is 1,000 won even enough?
Take 10,000 won.

438
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:33,551
I love you, Mother!

439
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,870
Now you're acting out,
because your father isn't?

440
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,284
What a wretched fate...

441
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,359
What do you mean, I don't act out?

442
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,337
I'm good at this too.

443
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:58,610
I love you, sweet potato!

444
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,418
I guess he feels a bit better now.

445
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:09,255
No... I feel sad again,
now that I've done that.

446
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:14,228
My life seems so grim...

447
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:22,231
What are you going
to do with that money?

448
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,937
Are you going to the arcade again?

449
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:42,362
Watch yourselves!
Here we go!

450
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:55,869
Yeah, volleyball!Yeah, a ball!

451
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,189
My leg.

452
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:09,207
Iit seems that some soju
just fell into the sand.

453
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:16,677
Mister! Please, let me live!
I'm so hungry... Mister!

454
00:40:16,688 --> 00:40:25,410
Wait! Please, let me live! No!

455
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:29,866
Hey! Hey, open the door!

456
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:32,486
Hey... please... open the door!

457
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,299
- Please...
-Darn it.

458
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:40,017
-Open the door!
-Hey! Shut your darn mouth!

459
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:44,625
So many people are suffering
right now because of you, darn it!

460
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:48,009
It's not like you did anything right.
What right do you have to be picky?

461
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:50,618
Shut your darn mouth
and keep it that way.

462
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:53,405
-Sorry.
-If you ever cause trouble again, I'll...

463
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,017
You guys aren't coming home?

464
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:02,126
-What do we do?
-What?

465
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:05,181
-There's six of us.
-I don't think we'll all fit.

466
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,501
So why did you all
decide to freaking come?

467
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:13,062
-We'll just have to drop one.
-What?

468
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:14,849
Are you guys children?

469
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,202
One of you should just
take the bus back.

470
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:21,048
Sounds good. But how about
two people, instead of just one?

471
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,128
Who should we leave behind?

472
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,909
That kid over there having snacks...

473
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,136
...and the kid stealing that kid's snacks.

474
00:41:49,836 --> 00:41:50,870
Want one?

475
00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:59,525
OK, fine. Here.

476
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,812
What did you say
Taek's IQ was again?

477
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:11,385
139.

478
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:13,712
Isn't it 99?

479
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:15,937
That's Duk Seon's IQ.

480
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:40,630
Don't do it.

481
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:45,668
Bring it back inside,
exactly the way it was.

482
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:17,104
Unbelievable...

483
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:24,159
He even has Jung Bong's announcement
slips from elementary school?

484
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,997
He has the pacifier that Jung Hwan
used when he was a year old.

485
00:43:29,903 --> 00:43:34,231
-He's such a hoarder!
-I guess old habits die hard.

486
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:38,339
I thought so too, but that's not even it.
It's just a part of his personality.

487
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:42,449
Speaking of which, isn't it his birthday?
Aren't you eating out today?

488
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,227
Are you going to a fancy place today?

489
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:48,089
Fancy, my ass.
He's not in the mood for that today.

490
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:52,578
How strange. Why not?

491
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,940
I don't know.

492
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:55,882
I don't know, he doesn't know,
nobody knows.

493
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:59,538
He's such a happy, lucky
and practical joker most of the time.

494
00:43:59,665 --> 00:44:05,917
Why is he as quiet as
a clam on his birthday?

495
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,997
Maybe his birthday
reminds him of someone?

496
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:15,912
Like his first love, or something?

497
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,391
If that's what it was, I would
bring her over immediately.

498
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:21,370
I've had him claimed for long enough
anyway. I should learn how to share.

499
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,257
But, is Mr. Choi OK?

500
00:44:25,392 --> 00:44:27,234
Yes, he's gotten a lot better!

501
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,118
But even so, they said he should
watch what he eats more closely.

502
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:34,926
All I can make him is rice
and soup that isn't too salty.

503
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:38,095
My, it must be nice having a hometown
friend taking care of you.

504
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:40,317
You take such good care of him.

505
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:42,400
Why don't you take this chance
to get together with him?

506
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,083
What?

507
00:44:44,746 --> 00:44:46,177
What's the issue?

508
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,083
Both of your kids are grown up.
And understand each other well.

509
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,943
Yeah. Where's Jin Joo?

510
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:56,320
Gimhae.

511
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:59,657
Why does she keep getting shipped off
to relatives, left and right?

512
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:03,481
-Just get together.
-Don't say things like that!

513
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:09,064
I'm embarrassed about what the neighbors might think
of me going to his house all the time!

514
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:12,982
-I can't face Sun Woo, either.
-Why? The important thing is you!

515
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,334
Cannot say like that.

516
00:45:14,391 --> 00:45:16,478
Well, look at her. She really
does have feelings for him.

517
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:17,897
Really... really...

518
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,896
Whatever.

519
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:22,641
Here, open another beer.

520
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:24,395
Come on, really...

521
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:28,800
I'm going to eat and then
throw out all that garbage.

522
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,085
Give me your wallet.

523
00:46:04,744 --> 00:46:06,997
Want to eat some grilled meat? Sirloin.

524
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,657
I'll buy!

525
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:38,506
It's fine.
You can eat it.

526
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:43,089
Just eat it now,
instead of burning it.

527
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:06,097
Then, I can block you like this.

528
00:47:08,187 --> 00:47:10,293
Then I'll block you off here.

529
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:14,519
OK, here!

530
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:17,157
Then I'll place mine here.

531
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:21,447
He really is something, isn't he?

532
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:23,990
I'm all out of options.

533
00:47:24,828 --> 00:47:27,772
I'm sorry, Sir.
I'm sorry.

534
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:31,108
Get over here.
I'm sorry.

535
00:47:39,344 --> 00:47:40,610
The match isn't over yet, though.

536
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,161
Hey. Is it fair for you
to play against them?

537
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:47,291
-Even so, they asked me to...
-Shut it!

538
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:49,610
Hurry up.

539
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:52,346
Milk: 150 won

540
00:47:54,394 --> 00:47:55,890
Regular Coffee: 120 won

541
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:10,855
Here.

542
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:20,079
My god! Hey!
Are you OK?

543
00:48:20,757 --> 00:48:22,504
You...

544
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:31,243
This tastes good.

545
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:33,230
I made it myself.

546
00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:36,186
-Really?
-No, you idiot.

547
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:41,397
Hey. This is a huge issue.

548
00:48:42,193 --> 00:48:44,671
How are you going to survive in
this cruel, harsh world like this?

549
00:48:46,595 --> 00:48:49,199
The world isn't such
a simple place, you know.

550
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:52,592
You have to be clear when you say "no,"
when you need to.

551
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:55,547
Do you know how many scammers
there are out there?

552
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:57,890
You're a pushover.

553
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,473
A guy like you can get scammed
ten times in one day.

554
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:03,421
Don't laugh!

555
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,113
Are we leaving already?

556
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:08,625
We still have some time
before the bus gets here.

557
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:11,508
We came all the way here,
so we can't just leave like this.

558
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:24,824
-It's cold!
-It's not cold! Take yours off too.

559
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:26,444
I don't want to. It's cold.

560
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:29,179
It's not cold!
Hurry up and take them off!

561
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:33,801
Hey... and you call
yourself a man?

562
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:35,923
Duk Seon!

563
00:49:38,563 --> 00:49:41,668
I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry.

564
00:49:41,754 --> 00:49:45,799
I've had a bit too much to drink,
so... I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

565
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:49,017
Well. You're a man after all.

566
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,107
Hey. Of course I'm a man.
Do I look like a woman?

567
00:49:54,547 --> 00:49:55,571
Take them off then.

568
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:01,912
Wait, hey... wait!
Duk Seon!

569
00:50:01,923 --> 00:50:04,286
-Duk Seon! Wait!
-Get over here!

570
00:50:04,297 --> 00:50:06,197
OK, OK, let go.

571
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:09,076
Hey!

572
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,923
-It's cold!
-OK, get up!

573
00:50:13,934 --> 00:50:19,548
Duk Seon! OK! OK!
Come on!

574
00:50:28,034 --> 00:50:29,334
What is this?

575
00:51:08,276 --> 00:51:11,745
Want to go out for dinner?
The kids are probably coming home late.

576
00:51:13,856 --> 00:51:16,235
Let's just eat at home.
I'm feeling lazy.

577
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,550
Do you want sujebi?
I think it'll rain.

578
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:30,322
Sounds good.

579
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:34,028
But... is it the time for Jung Bong
to come home now?

580
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,028
I know Jung Hwan will be a bit late.

581
00:51:36,236 --> 00:51:39,134
You think he'd come home early?
He's crazy for those arcade games.

582
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,644
I'll go make the dough.

583
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:57,393
Awesome.

584
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:00,672
I got the high score!

585
00:52:02,102 --> 00:52:05,525
As expected, diligence,
does not betray you!

586
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,183
Let's play again from the beginning...

587
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,526
Hey... play in moderation, will you?

588
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:31,768
What the hell...

589
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,620
Stop right there!

590
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:48,801
Hey, go that way.
You, come with me.

591
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:54,053
Hey. I think I'll be a bit late.

592
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:56,515
Hey, I just met the man of my dreams!

593
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:58,688
The moment I saw him,
sparks ran through my body!

594
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:00,069
And he's younger than me, too!

595
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:02,489
Destiny, my ass.

596
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:06,049
Either way, just wait for ten minutes.
I'll be right there.

597
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:29,596
Destiny, my ass.
I hate younger guys even more.

598
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:33,281
-Darn it!
-Where did that jerk go?

599
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,572
Where the hell did he go?

600
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:03,250
We've met before, right?

601
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:05,339
Excuse me?

602
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:08,461
Jungui Girls' High?

603
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,741
No.

604
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,791
Yeonggwang Girls' High?

605
00:54:14,005 --> 00:54:15,746
No. Ssangmun Girls' High.

606
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:18,725
I know someone who goes there!

607
00:54:20,066 --> 00:54:23,557
A girl named Sung Duk Seon
who lives downstairs from us...

608
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:26,655
Do you know her?

609
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:29,396
She's my best friend.

610
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:32,560
So you know her?

611
00:54:36,454 --> 00:54:37,890
Thats... what a coincidence...

612
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,405
No, is this...

613
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:44,587
...destiny?

614
00:55:14,842 --> 00:55:15,962
The rain stopped.

615
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,544
Hey, Jung Hwan. Make sure you
see that he gets into his house.

616
00:55:26,607 --> 00:55:27,679
Yes.

617
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:30,826
But... why did you run away
in the first place?

618
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:34,387
Isn't a bit too soon
to be asking me that?

619
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:36,054
Why did you run away from home?

620
00:55:36,455 --> 00:55:37,523
Was it because of the dean?

621
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,057
Did he hit you again?

622
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:40,861
No, it's because of Section Chief Jo.

623
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:43,474
Your mom?

624
00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:47,621
Your mother, Queen of Daehan
Insurance for five years running?

625
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:48,845
Seven years.

626
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,014
What did your mom do?

627
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:52,706
My mom cares about
nothing except for money.

628
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,170
She doesn't consider her child
to be precious at all.

629
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,634
How immature... it's not like
you weren't aware of this.

630
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,058
It was my birthday yesterday...

631
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:03,472
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

632
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:05,052
No need.

633
00:56:05,305 --> 00:56:07,912
-She promised to make me breakfast.
-Yeah, I know.

634
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:09,644
But she just left me money.

635
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:12,337
That's awesome.
You should totally thank her.

636
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:14,521
You don't know anything.
Shut it, jerk.

637
00:56:15,895 --> 00:56:20,137
My mom considers her guests to be
more important than her child.

638
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,230
Do you know what my one wish is?

639
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:27,154
What?

640
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,792
My mom has one thing
she's really good at making.

641
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,102
Instant jjajjangmyun?

642
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:36,499
Can she... cook, at all?

643
00:56:39,512 --> 00:56:41,229
What is it?
The thing she's good at making?

644
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:44,479
Seaweed soup.

645
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:47,878
As you guys know...

646
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:51,215
...both Chief Jo and the dean
have been working since I was young.

647
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:55,330
In the meantime,
I've had to buy my meals...

648
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,349
...or go to your houses to eat.

649
00:57:00,554 --> 00:57:04,696
But, in situations like her feeling bad
on my birthday for neglecting me...

650
00:57:05,353 --> 00:57:08,992
...she'd make me seaweed soup
with huge chunks of beef.

651
00:57:14,854 --> 00:57:17,144
But I haven't had her seaweed soup
in a couple of years...

652
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:19,763
...since she became the
Queen of Insurance or whatever.

653
00:57:24,854 --> 00:57:29,224
Hey... even so, I thought I'd be getting
seaweed soup this year, at least.

654
00:57:30,898 --> 00:57:32,396
What a wretched fate.

655
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:35,589
Hey, Jung Hwan.

656
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:38,139
Can I sleep over at your house?

657
00:57:38,784 --> 00:57:40,231
I really don't want to go home.

658
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:43,185
You should still go home though.
They'll be worried.

659
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:47,768
Yeah. I'm sure your mom and dad probably
couldn't get any sleep last night.

660
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:48,849
You think so?

661
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:51,017
Yeah. Hurry up and go home.

662
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:54,013
Are you at an age that you
need your parents right now?

663
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:56,379
Why the hell are you complaining?

664
00:57:57,634 --> 00:57:59,184
What brand of shoes
are you wearing right now?

665
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:01,949
LA Gear, right?

666
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,445
Hey.

667
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:07,327
Sung Duk Seon has been wearing
Artis shoes for three years in a row now.

668
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:42,373
And your coat is from Sergio Valente.

669
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:45,129
And your jeans are from Jordache.

670
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:52,203
At your age, parents with money are
better than parents who are present.

671
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:53,449
Do you understand that?

672
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:59,233
So stop messing around
and go home, already.

673
00:59:00,932 --> 00:59:05,099
If you're discontent with something,
don't run away from home. Just get angry.

674
00:59:05,536 --> 00:59:06,568
Why are you holding it in?

675
00:59:06,862 --> 00:59:08,155
They don't know unless you tell them.

676
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,443
How are they supposed to know
when you haven't told them?

677
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:11,996
Hey...

678
00:59:12,085 --> 00:59:15,732
Your mom and dad are busy. How you expect
them to take care of your mental too?

679
00:59:18,882 --> 00:59:21,393
First, go home and say
that you're sorry.

680
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,370
If the mood doesn't get better,
run away from home again.

681
00:59:27,883 --> 00:59:29,408
Run... away... again?

682
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:34,985
It's raining again!
Hurry up and go home! I'm going home!

683
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,638
Run away from home again?

684
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:46,624
Hurry up and go in!

685
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:51,916
Jung Hwan. Won't I get
hit less if I go in with you?

686
00:59:52,307 --> 00:59:54,958
Yeah, I'll get half the beating that
you were supposed to get. Go in.

687
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:01,155
Jung Hwan.

688
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,858
From this point on,
I'm walking alone.

689
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:32,554
-Mom... I'm sorry...
-Come home earlier!

690
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:33,912
What time is it now?

691
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:38,290
Director!

692
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,881
How could you decide
without even telling me?

693
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:45,161
No, it's not that...

694
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:47,847
Never mind!
I'll talk to you at work tomorrow!

695
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:51,605
Hey.

696
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:54,783
Why didn't you come home last night?

697
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,684
If you like sleeping at your friends'
houses that much, go and live there!

698
01:00:59,638 --> 01:01:00,686
Got that?

699
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:02,656
Dong Ryong.

700
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:06,136
That's enough, already.

701
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:13,875
Darn it...

702
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:22,694
Don't you say a word.

703
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:30,424
Bo Ra, I'm going to eat dinner and
then go back to the study room.

704
01:01:33,033 --> 01:01:35,678
And I'll study there
until about 1 a.m.

705
01:01:36,185 --> 01:01:38,258
So it'll be about 1:15 a.m.
when I get home.

706
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,674
What does that have to do with me?

707
01:01:42,654 --> 01:01:43,716
I'm just saying.

708
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,681
Even so, I'll wait in front of
your house for ten minutes.

709
01:01:57,852 --> 01:02:00,513
Are you crazy?
Why would you wait for me?

710
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,068
I can do what I want.

711
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:06,059
No need for you to worry about it.

712
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:08,362
Ghosh...

713
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:40,976
Hey!

714
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:43,701
Come to my place.
Let's have dinner.

715
01:02:43,966 --> 01:02:45,002
Dinner?

716
01:02:45,272 --> 01:02:47,268
My mom ordered chicken
since it's my dad's birthday.

717
01:02:47,393 --> 01:02:49,540
Have dinner at my place.
We told your mom about it too.

718
01:02:49,928 --> 01:02:50,944
What about Taek?

719
01:02:52,345 --> 01:02:54,070
He got back a while ago.

720
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,151
Does Bo Ra keep a turtle
in her car or something?

721
01:02:57,257 --> 01:02:58,286
Hey.

722
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,078
Why are you here?
You didn't go home?

723
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:05,993
-He ran away from home again.
-What?

724
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,050
There's no food in the house.

725
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:10,354
I'm just going to eat
this and go back home.

726
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:13,699
In retrospect, they don't
even know that I ran away.

727
01:03:13,996 --> 01:03:15,201
So why should I run away again?

728
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:17,298
Is it good?

729
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:19,523
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

730
01:03:19,832 --> 01:03:21,048
Have some too, Ma'am.

731
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:25,133
We ordered ten and sent to all neighbors.
I'm sure everyone is eating chicken now.

732
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:26,554
-So nice.
-So nice.

733
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,111
My dad, too?

734
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:31,757
Of course. Gil Dong...
I mean, Mr. Jeweler...

735
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:34,617
Yeah. Your dad is having some, too.

736
01:03:34,748 --> 01:03:36,215
Sun Woo's mom is taking care of him.

737
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,804
Please tell Mr. Kim
I said, happy birthday.

738
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:41,149
I will. Eat up!

739
01:03:41,313 --> 01:03:42,413
-Yes!
-Yes!

740
01:03:55,025 --> 01:03:56,803
Will chicken be OK,
even though it's your birthday?

741
01:03:58,054 --> 01:04:00,177
I wish my birthday would be
over and done with already!

742
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:05,558
I guess it's  I'm having fried
food for the first time...

743
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,393
Jung Bong. Take this.

744
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:26,721
Excuse me?

745
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:33,253
What!

746
01:04:36,047 --> 01:04:41,165
A person should know how to throw
things out too, right? Jung Bong...

747
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,953
Don't you dare take back
to your father.

748
01:04:43,899 --> 01:04:45,296
What... look at this.

749
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:47,497
Jung Bong, nine years old
Jung Hwan, three years old

750
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,737
Mother, what's this?

751
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,630
So this is where this was.

752
01:04:56,387 --> 01:04:58,096
-What?
-Are you out of your mind?

753
01:04:58,224 --> 01:04:59,740
You threw Taek into the ocean?

754
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:02,703
Hey... no, I didn't!
I just wet his feet a bit.

755
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:04,863
You shouldn't do that to Taek.

756
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,620
You're the one who did this
to his forehead, too.

757
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:07,890
I did?

758
01:05:07,952 --> 01:05:09,550
Look at her, playing dumb.

759
01:05:10,195 --> 01:05:13,208
-Were we eight years old? Or nine?
-Nine.

760
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:17,632
Yeah, nine. You pinned him onto the
cement and said you wanted to wrestle!

761
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:19,650
I did? No way.

762
01:05:19,808 --> 01:05:21,271
Yaeh, that's some sass.

763
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,234
Hey, Taek... didn't you
get four stitches from that?

764
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:27,643
That's attempted murder, you know!

765
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:30,329
He was perfectly normal, and
then he became weird after that!

766
01:05:30,964 --> 01:05:32,354
What are you talking about?

767
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:34,975
His brain works better now.
Thanks to me, he's a Baduk genius.

768
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:37,074
-It's all thanks to me.
-"Thanks to me," my ass.

769
01:05:37,193 --> 01:05:39,099
He was good at Baduk
when he was eight.

770
01:05:39,218 --> 01:05:41,164
If not for you, he could
have gone pro way faster.

771
01:05:41,658 --> 01:05:43,016
Yeah. Take responsibility.

772
01:05:43,074 --> 01:05:44,778
Take responsibility for his
rest of your life.

773
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:47,616
OK. I will.
I'd be happy to.

774
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:49,205
How lucky I am.

775
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:51,303
Are you crazy?
What did Taek ever do wrong?

776
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:53,773
See, look at this jerk smiling!

777
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,374
-You like Duk Seon, don't you?
-No.

778
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,499
Speaking of which, you two suit
each other. Give it your best shot.

779
01:06:01,586 --> 01:06:03,689
What's with you guys?
Are you all crazy?

780
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,328
Hey, Taek. This kind of girl
is better for you.

781
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:08,210
You have to struggle
a bit in life to grow.

782
01:06:08,754 --> 01:06:09,893
Hey.

783
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,327
I'm going to the bathroom.

784
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,440
Yeah, you totally
stuffing your face.

785
01:06:15,534 --> 01:06:16,534
Are you going to poop?

786
01:06:17,882 --> 01:06:18,902
Is it already coming out?

787
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:21,445
Hey, tell us how you really feel
about Duk Seon.

788
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:25,617
She's not bad, right?
Right, Taek?

789
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:29,462
Hey, it's not like Taek is crazy.
There are so many girls who like him.

790
01:06:29,943 --> 01:06:31,051
I like her.

791
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:38,574
Duk Seon...
You... like women?

792
01:06:40,154 --> 01:06:41,904
-For real?
-Yeah.

793
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:47,289
I like Duk Seon.

794
01:06:55,896 --> 01:06:59,772
I like her, not as a friend,
but as a woman.

795
01:07:05,224 --> 01:07:07,377
-My God!
-Seriously?

796
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:08,663
Wait, really?

797
01:07:08,674 --> 01:07:10,686
-What are you saying?
-What?

798
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:12,169
Did you get seriously
injured at the beach?

799
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:13,812
-Seriously?
-For real?

800
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:14,922
Really?

801
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:17,436
What's this, all of the sudden?

802
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,090
You consider Duk Seon a woman?

803
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,084
What... wait, really?

804
01:07:25,189 --> 01:07:27,501
Hey, you're not messing
around are you? Right?

805
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,957
What is this?

806
01:07:29,052 --> 01:07:30,952
I can't believe that you
consider Duk Seon a woman...

807
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:33,156
What are you saying?

808
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:35,011
I can't believe that you
consider Duk Seon a woman...

809
01:07:37,856 --> 01:07:39,815
I can't believe that you
consider Duk Seon a woman!

810
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:59,554
Our Jung Bong did such a great job!
You're so good!

811
01:07:59,749 --> 01:08:01,447
Jung Bong could become a singer, right?

812
01:08:02,442 --> 01:08:04,726
-Yeah...
-My child! You're so good!

813
01:08:04,737 --> 01:08:06,601
He'll save our household in the future!

814
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:07,691
You don't remember this, right?

815
01:08:08,836 --> 01:08:11,337
I do remember.
I was nine years old, after all.

816
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:15,771
Next, our Jung Hwan!
Why not try, Jung Hwan?

817
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,464
Jung Hwan, give it a try!

818
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:19,227
Jung Hwan was three years old then.

819
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,201
OK, Jung Hwan! Start!

820
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:27,813
Life is a traveler's road...

821
01:08:27,824 --> 01:08:33,653
...traveling this way and that...

822
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:36,541
Our Jung Hwan is so good!

823
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:39,352
My child is so adorable!

824
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,400
Jung Hwan was so cute then.

825
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,057
What the hell happened to him?

826
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:47,946
Isn't that right, honey?

827
01:08:52,555 --> 01:08:53,764
What's wrong, honey?

828
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,366
You feel like crying
from the nostalgia, right?

829
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:03,716
-You're amazing! How can you be so good?
- Mom's voice.

830
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:11,766
-It's my mom's voice.
-Let's have a listen.

831
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,549
-Kyun.
-What?

832
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,786
Sing a song.
Mom wants to hear.

833
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:20,934
No, Mom! I'm so old already!

834
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:26,908
Yeah. This was probably about
a year before she passed away.

835
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:31,717
No matter how old you get,
you'll always be a kid to me.

836
01:09:32,171 --> 01:09:36,984
Also, it's your birthday!
Sing a song, OK?

837
01:09:37,168 --> 01:09:39,874
-No thanks, Mom.
-Hey... stop it. Come on.

838
01:09:39,977 --> 01:09:42,982
What? If it's my birthday, Mom should
sing me a song. Why should I sing one?

839
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:45,881
-Mom, you sing me one.
-Quit your acting.

840
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:50,172
Hey, you know how hard
I worked to get you out?

841
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:53,859
You can't even sing a song
for your hardworking mom?

842
01:09:54,002 --> 01:09:55,459
Come on.
Sing a song!

843
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:58,028
-Come on, just do it!
-No!

844
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,024
You know, it was hard for me too,
being born and all.

845
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:02,104
-What.
-You sing one, Mom.

846
01:10:02,192 --> 01:10:04,192
It's been a really long time
since I've heard you sing.

847
01:10:06,596 --> 01:10:08,503
You sing, honey.

848
01:10:08,868 --> 01:10:11,688
Come on. Just sing one.
Stop complaining.

849
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:14,562
What... what's with you today?

850
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:15,654
No more!
The end!

851
01:10:15,717 --> 01:10:18,789
Mother in law,
please sing us a song, then.

852
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:22,411
It's been so long since I've sung...

853
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,716
-I'll bet you're great.
-No!

854
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:34,211
The cassette is still recording,
so hurry up and sing something!

855
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,412
Come on, please?

856
01:10:36,594 --> 01:10:38,337
-What...
-Come on, Kyun!

857
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:40,979
OK, lady, you'll go crazy at this rate!

858
01:10:43,838 --> 01:10:50,306
Life is a traveler's road...

859
01:10:50,317 --> 01:10:56,830
...traveling this way and that.

860
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:13,361
On the road that
is traveled upon...

861
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:21,058
...just as the clouds roll on by...

862
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:27,049
...let's not get too attached...

863
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:33,531
...or have unsolved feelings.

864
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:40,094
Life is a traveler's road...

865
01:11:42,764 --> 01:11:47,720
Just as the clouds roll on by...

866
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:57,372
...it goes by without
a destination.

867
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:18,442
I'm sorry. The beef bone
soup took a while.

868
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:20,301
You're hungry, right, Moo Sung?

869
01:12:24,138 --> 01:12:25,781
Eat up. I'm off.

870
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,989
Eat before you go.

871
01:12:28,713 --> 01:12:30,255
Have dinner before you go.

872
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:36,364
No... it's OK.
I have to make dinner for Sun Woo.

873
01:12:36,556 --> 01:12:41,091
Hey. Don't lie to me. All the kids are
over at Jung Hwan's, having chicken.

874
01:12:44,008 --> 01:12:45,580
Have dinner before you go.

875
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:53,581
I'm sick of eating alone.

876
01:12:57,009 --> 01:12:58,435
Hurry up and sit!

877
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:01,081
It'll all get cold.

878
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,148
Let's eat.

879
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:44,619
-Mi Ran.
-Yeah?

880
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:48,838
I think I know the reason now.

881
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:55,487
The reason why I always get
depressed around my birthday...

882
01:13:57,585 --> 01:13:59,435
I think I know that reason now.

883
01:14:04,121 --> 01:14:05,531
It's because of your mom, right?

884
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,581
Yeah.

885
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,862
I guess I was always
reminded of my mom.

886
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:19,037
I thought that wasn't it...

887
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:23,756
...but I guess it was because I was
thinking about my mom, after all.

888
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,803
I wish I could give
her a call, at least...

889
01:14:33,998 --> 01:14:40,097
I want to call her,
since it's my birthday...

890
01:14:43,205 --> 01:14:44,699
But there's no place that I can call.

891
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:49,902
Mi Ran.

892
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:52,418
Yeah?

893
01:14:55,311 --> 01:14:57,179
I miss my mom so much.

894
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:03,666
I want to see my mom...

895
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,643
...so much.

896
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:35,975
Who did you meet?

897
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:38,088
Mr. Kim Jung Bong?

898
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:40,765
He said that he lived
in the house above yours.

899
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:41,838
Yeah, that's true.

900
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:44,524
But how did you meet him?

901
01:15:44,762 --> 01:15:46,200
I saw him outside of my house today.

902
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,636
Like fate.

903
01:15:48,008 --> 01:15:49,008
What?

904
01:15:49,019 --> 01:15:51,897
Duk Seon. I fell for him at first sight.

905
01:15:53,102 --> 01:15:56,290
I've decided to believe in
things like destiny from now on.

906
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:58,956
You're talking about
the Jung Bong I know, right?

907
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:01,183
He's fat and has a chubby face...

908
01:16:01,232 --> 01:16:04,068
Yeah. He's a bit chubby,
and has a cute face.

909
01:16:06,048 --> 01:16:08,032
Yeah. Did you tell him?

910
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:10,638
-What did he say?
-What?

911
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:14,970
Did he tell you not go the blind date?
He said not to, right?

912
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:20,173
I don't know. It's a secret.

913
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:26,021
What is it?

914
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:30,001
I'm going on a blind date this week.

915
01:16:32,687 --> 01:16:35,150
He's a junior from Sun Deok High.
His name is Choi Jae Young.

916
01:16:35,335 --> 01:16:37,016
He's Ja Hyun's elementary
school classmate.

917
01:16:43,469 --> 01:16:44,810
Should I go on the blind date?

918
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,477
Well, should I?

919
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,138
Don't go.

920
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:09,057
Don't go... on the blind date.

921
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:43,395
Lee Moon Sae
New Year's Eve Live Concert

922
01:18:44,097 --> 01:18:47,130
Were you waiting for me, Noona?

923
01:18:47,427 --> 01:18:48,527
Yeah.

924
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,395
I have something to tell you.

925
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,317
How about... next time. It's a bit late.

926
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,138
No. I'm going to tell you now.

927
01:19:03,694 --> 01:19:04,725
Listen carefully.

928
01:19:07,304 --> 01:19:10,818
You really know how
to inconvenience someone.

929
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:16,414
You keep appearing in front of me
and I keep getting tangled up with you.

930
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:26,750
But... you doing that...

931
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,093
...is because of me, I think.

932
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,668
I think I did something
to give you hope.

933
01:19:43,977 --> 01:19:45,610
OK. Let's date.

934
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:52,809
I like you too.

935
01:19:57,338 --> 01:19:59,068
Don't you dare tell your mom.

936
01:19:59,938 --> 01:20:03,525
And if you tell your friends,
we're done for! Got that?

937
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,232
Noona.

938
01:20:19,338 --> 01:20:20,360
What?

939
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:22,800
Can I kiss you?

940
01:20:26,316 --> 01:20:27,440
No!

941
01:20:31,675 --> 01:20:32,993
Good night, Noona!

942
01:20:33,812 --> 01:20:35,178
You're so loud!
Shut it!

943
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:36,790
Good night!

944
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:08,348
-You're here, Soo Hyun?
-Soo Hyun, you're here?

945
01:21:09,226 --> 01:21:11,415
Soo Hyun. Give me any laundry you have.

946
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:12,994
Soo Hyun.

947
01:21:13,336 --> 01:21:14,575
Who's Soo Hyun?

948
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:19,264
I heard that you're quite good,
Mr. Yoo.

949
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:20,891
You played with Mr. Yoo?

950
01:21:20,972 --> 01:21:22,671
You have to stay alert.

951
01:21:22,902 --> 01:21:24,295
I bet there will be a huge fight tonight.

952
01:21:24,306 --> 01:21:25,914
I won't stand for this!

953
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:27,337
-Stop it!
-Honey, stop!

954
01:21:27,338 --> 01:21:29,050
Let go!

955
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:31,774
It's not over until it's over, right?

956
01:21:31,923 --> 01:21:32,992
Excuse me?

957
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:35,280
Excuse me?

958
01:21:37,147 --> 01:21:38,975
If Sun Woo finds out,
it'll be big trouble.

959
01:21:38,986 --> 01:21:41,047
Hey, please!
How will he ever find out?

960
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:43,394
Do I have to tell you that much?

961
01:21:43,894 --> 01:21:46,879
-I guess that was it!
-I guess so!

962
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:53,737
I was hoping that I'd be able to
fix my wretched life this year...

963
01:21:53,801 --> 01:21:54,810
Figures.

964
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:56,302
We shouldn't have
gotten our fortunes told.

965
01:21:56,435 --> 01:21:59,282
If only the fortune teller hadn't told
her that she'd have a lot of good luck

966
01:21:59,361 --> 01:22:00,863
she wouldn't have been
expecting anything.

967
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:03,517
Why isn't Duk Seon coming?

968
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,574
I guess she's eating with Taek.

969
01:22:09,306 --> 01:22:10,388
What about you, Jung Hwan?

970
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,875
You're going, right?

971
01:22:13,372 --> 01:22:14,391
I can't.

972
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,506
Noona.

973
01:22:19,788 --> 01:22:21,121
Can I kiss you?

974
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:23,441
Jung Hwan.
