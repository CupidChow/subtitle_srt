1
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,260
Duk Seon! Isn't it time for
your father to be home?

2
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,720
-What time is it now?
-It's going to be a while.

3
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,590
-You want me to trim more of these, Mom?
-Yeah!

4
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,150
Duk Seon, I think Dad's going
to be late today.

5
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,800
It's a mess over there in Jongro.

6
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,910
-Abolish the government!
-Abolish it!

7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,260
-Abolish the government!
-Abolish it!

8
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,870
-Abolish the government!
-Abolish it!

9
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,760
Geez!

10
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
Geez, really... You can't ever go around
doing things like that... OK, punk?

11
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,110
-Just study hard, OK?
-OK. Yeah.

12
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,750
Thank you so much, sir.

13
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,320
Student. Come over here.

14
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,200
Take this and buy yourself
something delicious.

15
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,970
What are you doing?
Hurry up and take it.

16
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,710
OK... go home. Make sure you wash
up before you go home, though.

17
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,680
Go home.

18
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,060
Duk Seon, set the table!
I'm bringing the food over!

19
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,160
OK!

20
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,340
-Oh no! Mom, are you OK?
-Let me see your foot.

21
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,060
Oh my! Oh God... It's bleeding!

22
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,710
-Ouch!
-Get a band-aid!

23
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,750
I'm fine. It's nothing,
so go ahead and eat.

24
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,120
You're hungry, right, honey?

25
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,020
So why do you always
transfer at Jonggak Station?

26
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,490
Students are always protesting
over there.

27
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,390
What am I supposed to do then?
Other places are even worse off!

28
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,470
Between here and Jongro,
protesters are everywhere!

29
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,070
At any rate, it'll be difficult to
get the tear gas out of my suit...

30
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,170
Even my eyes are stinging.

31
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,190
Oh yeah. Where's Bo Ra?
She's not home yet?

32
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,850
Bo Ra is quite
a busy individual nowadays.

33
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,690
Yes... that's right.

34
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,080
I guess she's really preoccupied
with studying nowadays.

35
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,290
Well, it's only to be expected,
since she's a college student.

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,860
You two... get your head in the game
and study hard like her, OK?

37
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,500
-I'm home.
-Bo Ra, you're home?

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,370
Come and eat. You haven't
eaten yet, right?

39
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,870
-Come on in!
-What's this smell?

40
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,380
Hey! Are you a protester?

41
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,050
Stop right there! Come over here.

42
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,090
Oh my... This little brat
is going around protesting!

43
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,460
Have you lost your mind?

44
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,330
You want to see me foam
at the mouth and die?

45
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,950
What's with you?
It's none of your business!

46
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,190
What... what did you say?
Of course it's my business, punk!

47
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,540
How dare an Education major
go around protesting?

48
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,190
Have you completely lost it?

49
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,550
You think I worked my fingers to the bone
so that you could go around protesting?

50
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,080
Bo Ra, hurry up and say you're sorry!

51
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,190
Are you crazy? Why should I?
What did I do wrong?

52
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,960
What? Look at this girl,
mouthing off at me!

53
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Bo Ra... say that you
won't do it again! Now!

54
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,730
Geez! What do you know, Dad?

55
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,500
Bo Ra.... what about dinner?

56
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,440
Eat something before you
go to sleep at least!

57
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,280
I'll make the fried egg
that you like so much.

58
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,980
Fried egg, my ass! Are you crazy?

59
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,280
Crazy wretch. I won't even waste a single
grain of rice on that impudent girl!

60
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,520
How dare an Education major
go around protesting?

61
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,190
Oh my, oh my! Mother, Father!

62
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,690
It seems that this daughter of mine
is going to ruin our entire family!

63
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,100
You've really raised her well!
Way to go!

64
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,670
I ought to kill her!

65
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,560
What? Bo Ra did? Bo Ra, that girl...
what if she gets taken away?

66
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,160
Geez... I don't know who she takes after
to be doing things like that.

67
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,770
It's fine! There isn't a college
student that doesn't protest nowadays.

68
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,670
All of them do it.

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,570
As long as she's not the ones
standing in front, she's good.

70
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,870
She's right. You know, the ones
who go like this at the front.

71
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,240
As long as she's not one of them,
she's fine. Don't worry too much.

72
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,580
She's the type to make me worry.

73
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,650
Even though her father is
getting so worked up over it

74
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,220
she won't even think of apologizing.

75
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,920
Instead, she glared at him and
talked back to him. Geez.

76
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,820
Seeing that, Bo Ra isn't close
with her dad.

77
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,290
Isn't the eldest daughter usually
close to her dad?

78
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,960
No, they are close!

79
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,270
It just seems that way,
but that's not the case.

80
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,740
That girl, Bo Ra, is the problem!
Her father isn't the issue!

81
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,470
It's not like Bo Ra is the gentle type
or has any cute traits about her.

82
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,380
I much prefer Duk Seon, even though
she's often dead last in school.

83
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,010
Bo Ra, that girl... she's scary!

84
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,580
Even so, just watch.

85
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,250
Bo Ra is going to become
really successful one day.

86
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,620
She's not an average kid.

87
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,120
You can say that again.
She's really not a normal kid.

88
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,530
I don't want much. I'll just be satisfied
if she didn't get kicked out of school.

89
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,880
That young man seems to be
quite popular lately.

90
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,430
He's so handsome.

91
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,070
He's tall and has a great body.

92
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,380
-Who is he?
-That guy.

93
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,510
I bet a bunch of kids
are going to try imitating him.

94
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,710
I bet someone's going to
end up breaking something.

95
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,540
Nebok.

96
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,210
Three... two... one... start!

97
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,080
Hey, Sun Woo. Can you
do it one more time?

98
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,290
Hey, where are you going?

99
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,790
Yes, he just arrived.

100
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,790
Get out of the way!

101
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,670
Jin Joo, I'm fine.
It doesn't hurt at all.

102
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,570
Jin Joo. Give me a kiss.

103
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,470
I think I'll get better soon
if you do that.

104
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,790
Jin Joo, "Run, Honey"
is on TV now.

105
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,180
Oh, yeah!

106
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,910
You leave too, Mom.

107
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,880
I just stretched a ligament. I'm fine.
Go do what you need to do.

108
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,990
Is there anything you want to eat?

109
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,490
Am I a kid? No, there isn't.

110
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,860
-I'm making beef bone soup.
-What?

111
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,590
-Beef bone soup.
-Geez... Mom!

112
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,060
Isn't there anything
else you want to eat?

113
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,430
-I'll buy you anything.
-I'm fine.

114
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,530
I don't need anything.

115
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,040
Can I have 300 won
worth of bean sprouts

116
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,150
and one square of tofu?

117
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,100
That's 700 won all together.

118
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,470
Why not buy a banana?

119
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,840
I heard that Sun Woo got hurt.

120
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,570
-How much is one?
-2000 won.

121
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,850
Geez... you should splurge a little
when your child is sick!

122
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,350
When will you ever buy it again?

123
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,990
Jin Joo! Mommy bought some bananas!

124
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,050
Really?

125
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,300
Can I have a sip?

126
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,300
It's that good?

127
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,870
What about your older brother?
Did you give him one?

128
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,670
-Yeah.
-Good girl.

129
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,660
Duk Seon... Go home for today.
It's late.

130
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,960
You're worried about me,
even in this state?

131
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,430
He's not worrying about you.
He's worrying about himself.

132
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,200
You need to leave if he's going
to get any sleep.

133
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,050
Aren't you going home?

134
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,400
What are you two going to do
when I leave?

135
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,550
How's that any of your business?

136
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,550
Hey. Stop fighting, and leave...
both of you.

137
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,370
I don't even have any money, though...

138
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,550
Do I need to borrow from
Jung Bong's mom, again?

139
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,150
They say that when it rains, it pours...

140
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,760
When will the day come when I have
a thousand of these in the storage shed?

141
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,810
Who ordered the charcoal briquettes?

142
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,050
-Me!
-Yes!

143
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,520
Yes! Me, me! We ordered them!

144
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

145
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,020
Please come in!

146
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,550
We're coming!

147
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,550
Yes!

148
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,660
Yes, over here!

149
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,550
Over here!

150
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,050
Closer!

151
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,050
Yes!
Here!

152
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,050
Yes, here!

153
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll go get some drinks for you all!

154
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,690
I can't believe that
such a day has come...

155
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,340
Madam! Today's the day of the
charcoal briquette delivery?

156
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,050
Yeah.

157
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,550
-Wow! How many is that?
-A thousand.

158
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,810
Oh my! You really seem
like a rich woman now!

159
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,380
How much did that cost?

160
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,950
I wonder if there will ever come a day
that I can have tons of these stacked up.

161
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,260
What are you saying? Up until
three years ago, I had to use firewood.

162
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,550
That's right.

163
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,790
Wow... you did have a time when
you were once poor, didn't you?

164
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,830
It hasn't been long,
but I forgot already.

165
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,050
-Oh yeah. Don't make dinner tonight.
-Why not?

166
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,270
I made abalone porridge. I heard
that Sun Woo hurt his leg.

167
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,370
Why did you go through the trouble
of making that?

168
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,210
Then, can I just have a little bit?
I'm expecting a guest tonight.

169
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,850
-Who?
-The kids' grandmother.

170
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,420
What? Why is that nasty wretch coming?

171
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,750
How much is she planning
to upset you this time?

172
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,790
It's not like she's coming to see me.
She's coming to see the kids.

173
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,120
It doesn't even affect me anymore.

174
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,620
She treated you so badly after
her son died!

175
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,400
She said that you devoured
her precious son alive!

176
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,050
She didn't watch any of her words
and said so many crude things to you!

177
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,270
Is she nobility or something?

178
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,550
It's not like you owe her money
or something. Geez.

179
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,980
Geez... when I think of that day,
I get so angry.

180
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,480
Is she the only one
who ever lost her son?

181
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,488
She has no consideration...

182
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:11,360
...for her daughter-in-law who
became a widow at a young age!

183
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,950
She's the one who cut ties with you,
calling you an unlucky wretch.

184
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,360
So why the hell is she coming
to see you, now? Pisses me off.

185
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,760
It's fine! Why are you
getting so worked up?

186
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,200
It's frustrating to me as a bystander!

187
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,230
Geez... and you can't even say
a single thing to her, like an idiot.

188
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,700
Geez! So frustrating!

189
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,940
What good would it do
if I did say something?

190
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,810
It will just wear my jaw out.
It doesn't affect me anymore.

191
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,670
I'm going to think of her as a stranger.

192
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,180
But... is this what
you're going to wear?

193
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,850
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

194
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,550
You don't have any new clothes?

195
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,050
It's fine! Appearances
aren't important.

196
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,520
I don't feel embarrassed at all,
even looking like this.

197
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,620
I'm really not going to care anymore.

198
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,190
-Put this on.
-Can I?

199
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,050
Oh, how nice.

200
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,050
-Wait, it doesn't suit you.
-Stop it! I'm wearing it!

201
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,260
All right, then.

202
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Sun Woo. If there's anything
you need, call me right away.

203
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,050
-OK?
-Yes. Goodbye.

204
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,770
-You're out of rice?
-I'm going to buy some today.

205
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,180
-You should have...
-I'll take care of it.

206
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,050
Why is Sun Woo so skinny?

207
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,720
Compared to last time,
he's skin and bones.

208
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,020
You don't care about your children?

209
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,630
Also, you... you only have
those clothes to wear?

210
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,550
Look at you. So grim. Pathetic.

211
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,550
I'm sure any incoming luck would go
running at the sight of you. Geez.

212
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,110
And why is it so chilly in here? You
don't have any charcoal briquettes?

213
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,480
What if the kids catch a cold?

214
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,110
Geez! What exactly do you
do around the house?

215
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,250
Do you bring any money home,
or go to work?

216
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,050
After swallowing my son whole...

217
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,550
you receive my son's pension
and live in my house

218
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,630
and you can't even raise the kids right?

219
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,360
We're getting along just fine.

220
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,930
And I'm raising my son
just fine, too.

221
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,330
Don't worry about it.

222
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,740
How could I not,
when you're living in this state?

223
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,770
Are you doing this to spite me?

224
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,910
You want to show me just how much
of an unlucky wretch you are?

225
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,210
What did he ever see in you?

226
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,050
What a terrible fate.

227
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,330
What crime did I commit in my past life
to be associated with you?

228
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,050
Geez.

229
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,200
Why do you have to say things like that?

230
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,900
You know...

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,770
I'm my mother's precious daughter, too.

232
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,610
If my mother knew I was subjected
to this kind of talk from someone

233
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm sure she'd cry tears of blood.

234
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,150
At the very least,
for my mother's sake...

235
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
I won't sit by and listen to you
talk to me like that anymore.

236
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,050
Mother-in-Law.

237
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,330
Don't ever come here again.

238
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:51,700
Even if I have to shave my head, I'll do
whatever it takes to raise my kids well.

239
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,070
Even if I can't buy them
brand-name shoes.

240
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,050
I won't let them starve
and will buy them pretty clothes

241
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,420
and will live a life that
nobody would consider shameful.

242
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:13,050
So... Mother-in-Law... Don't
ever come back here again!

243
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,890
Don't ever come back here

244
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,630
so that the three
of us can live in peace!

245
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,770
I won't ever agree to see you again.

246
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,670
Even if you come to see us,
I won't open the door!

247
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,810
You got that?

248
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,160
Buy the kids some clothes with this.

249
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,550
It's fine.

250
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,300
Did anyone say that this is for you?

251
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,900
I'm giving it to my little ones.

252
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,070
How dare she... geez!

253
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,940
I don't need it.

254
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,150
I'll clothe my own kids.
Goodbye.

255
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,550
I feel so much better.

256
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,100
What a load off my chest.

257
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,770
Sun Woo! Eat this
before you go to sleep.

258
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,090
Jung Hwan's mother
made abalone porridge for you...

259
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,620
Geez. Stop sweeping
the street, already!

260
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,060
-Is it because you're lonely?
-Hello.

261
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,090
Oh yeah. Is Taek home?
Did he come back yesterday?

262
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,930
Yes. He came home yesterday.

263
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,050
-Dad, the hot water doesn't work.
-What?

264
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,500
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

265
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,010
Taek. You haven't had
breakfast yet, right?

266
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,010
No.

267
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,680
I made some abalone porridge,
so come and take some.

268
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,650
-I've put some aside for you.
-Thank you.

269
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,360
-You have a microwave at home, right?
-Yes.

270
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,230
Just keep it in the refrigerator.
Put some in a separate container

271
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,550
when you want to eat it and
heat it up with the microwave.

272
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,130
You have small bowls at home, right?
Not glass ones, but ceramic.

273
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,050
Put about two ladle’s worth
in a soup bowl, and...

274
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,680
It's fine. I'll call your dad.

275
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,280
-Go ahead.
-Yes. Goodbye.

276
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,550
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

277
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,420
-Did you get home last night?
-Yeah.

278
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,220
-You didn't go to school today?
-Hey, today's Sunday.

279
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,550
-Oh.
-Geez... I'm so jealous of you, jerk.

280
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,330
Jung Hwan. Go buy one square of tofu.

281
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,560
OK. Let's go.

282
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,730
-Thank you!
-OK!

283
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,680
-Open your eyes, Special Unit.
-Oh... it's Taek. Hi, Taek.

284
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,420
Oh, hi. Did you not get any sleep?

285
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,450
Yeah.

286
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,590
Duk Seon!

287
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,130
-When did you get back, Taek?
-Last night.

288
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,270
What brings you here,
when you've hurt your leg?

289
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,370
Oh... Duk Seon, can I borrow
your Korean-English dictionary?

290
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,940
Mine? You came to borrow mine?
With that leg?

291
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,380
You don't have
a Korean-English dictionary?

292
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,680
Yeah... I don't.

293
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,420
Is that right? Well, yeah.

294
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,850
Hers is completely new.

295
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,190
It's better to borrow it from her
instead of spending money on a new one.

296
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,550
Shut it.

297
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,760
Is your leg OK?

298
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,360
I just stretched a ligament. I'm fine.

299
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,930
Wait here, Sun Woo. I'll bring it.

300
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,800
No, it's fine. I can walk that much.

301
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,200
-Hey, hey.
-Geez!

302
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm fine!

303
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,840
I'm fine.

304
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,910
No, no... other side. Yeah.

305
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm fine. I'm fine.

306
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,950
I'm fine! Hey, watch the stairs.

307
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:02,910
Mother.

308
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,310
The room is cold...
did the briquettes go out?

309
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,450
Your father put it out
early this morning.

310
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,320
I re-ignited it not too long ago so just
wait a bit. Jung Bong, pass me a dish.

311
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,050
Go back to your room.

312
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,050
Honey. The toilet's
clogged again.

313
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,170
Set the table.

314
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,550
OK.

315
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,580
-Lower the volume!
-OK. Mom, did you see the newspaper?

316
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,750
Geez... ow! Mother!

317
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,050
What? I'm bleeding!

318
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,850
Where?

319
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,960
Where?

320
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,930
Honey, the steamed egg is overflowing.
Come quickly!

321
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,140
Turn off the flame then!

322
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,900
-Mom, this is yesterday's paper.
-I turned the flame off!

323
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,670
-Ow!
-It's still overflowing!

324
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,980
Hurry over here! Quick!

325
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,950
Mom, what about today's paper?
Where's today's paper?

326
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,020
The egg is exploding! Hurry over!

327
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,650
You're not going to die!

328
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,050
Why do you only ever treat me this way?

329
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,050
Geez... I ought to...

330
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,570
Oh my. Did the sun rise
from the west today?

331
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,170
What are you talking about?

332
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,050
It's the first time I've seen

333
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,280
Duk Seon awake early enough to
eat breakfast on a Sunday!

334
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,280
Dad. I go to the
study room nowadays.

335
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,850
I have to head straight there
after breakfast.

336
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,690
Wow. I guess this daughter of
mine is studying now, after all!

337
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,490
How long have you been going there?
You never even told me!

338
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,060
Today's her first day. She
hasn't even gone once yet.

339
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,700
Don't you know that getting started
is half the battle?

340
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,050
Thank you for the meal! I'm
going to hurry over there now.

341
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,550
Dad. You didn't know that Duk Seon
has a chronic illness, right?

342
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,450
A chronic illness? What
do you mean by that?

343
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,550
What kind of chronic illness
does Duk Seon have?

344
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,720
A chronic illness?

345
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,560
What are you talking about?

346
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,420
What chronic illness does our
Duk Seon have?

347
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,030
"Falling-asleep-after-eating-itis."

348
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,630
It's been a while since
she's suffering from it.

349
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,890
Speaking of which... has Bo Ra
been sleeping this whole time?

350
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,920
Where is she?

351
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,920
She went to school. She has finals
starting tomorrow.

352
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,550
She said that she wants to get a good
spot in the library, and left early.

353
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,430
What if she went out early
to go to another protest?

354
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,930
No! Why can't you trust people?

355
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,140
It's true. She took a bunch
of books with her.

356
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,540
Oh my!

357
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,840
That girl is so popular lately!

358
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,179
What's her name, again?

359
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:32,781
Lee Mi Yeon.

360
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:34,249
Wow.

361
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,550
How great would it be if
Lee Mi Yeon was my older sister?

362
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:46,305
How is she so different from Duk Seon,
when they're the same age?

363
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:49,550
Hey. That girl is the
same age as Duk Seon?

364
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:52,945
Yeah. She's 18, just like Duk Seon.

365
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,883
Someone looks like that
while others...

366
00:30:56,883 --> 00:31:00,080
Hey, you jerk.
What's wrong with our Deok-seon?

367
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,480
In my eyes, Deok-seon is so much prettier!

368
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,840
Yeah. I agree.

369
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,880
Father, it's time
for the Cosby Show to be on.

370
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,600
I'm flipping back to this channel
when Little House on the Prairie is on.

371
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,120
What is it?

372
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,391
Kim Jung Bong. Stop spilling
crumbs everywhere! Clean them up!

373
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,828
Honey, take your
feet off the TV!

374
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,197
It'll get dirty! Or put
socks on, at least!

375
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:07,569
Geez! What a bunch of animals.
I can't believe you lot. Move your foot!

376
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:14,175
Hello? Hi, Mi Sook.

377
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,080
Why did she go up to
the mountains again?

378
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:21,450
It's not like chestnuts
are even worth much.

379
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:26,254
OK. I'll come. Why isn't she going
to the hospital?

380
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:30,450
Just wait. I'll take her.
OK... bye.

381
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,932
-Your grandmother sprained her ankle.
-Is she badly hurt?

382
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:42,337
I don't know. She won't go to the
hospital, so I have to go see her.

383
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,940
Let's go together. It's been a while
since I've seen my in-laws.

384
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:48,810
Stay here, honey. Are you going
to let the kids starve to death?

385
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,684
OK. I'm going to be away
for two days.

386
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,288
If you want to live, heed my words.
Got it?

387
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,450
Underwear goes here. Undershirts
go here. Socks go here. Got it?

388
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:20,341
Here.

389
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:23,011
-The briquette has gone out.
-What do you do?

390
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,582
-Use a mini-briquette.
-Correct!

391
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:31,786
Look here.

392
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,755
What do you do when
the briquettes are stuck together?

393
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,858
-Kitchen knife.
-That's right!

394
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,950
This is beef. You just have to
saute this in the frying pan.

395
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:58,313
These greens are going to go bad,
so have them for lunch and dinner.

396
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,748
As for the salad and the black beans,
put them in smaller bowls.

397
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:01,516
Got it?

398
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:06,221
I have a question.
Can't we just order in?

399
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,457
Cook, darn you! I even made all
of the side dishes already!

400
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,599
Make sure you check the gas.

401
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:20,168
Make sure the water in the toilet
goes down all the way, or it'll clog.

402
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:22,403
And you have to eat the greens
by today, OK?

403
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,271
Also, Jung Hwan.

404
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,640
Use your hand to figure out how much
water to use when you're making rice.

405
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,774
-Up to here, OK?
-OK, OK!

406
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:28,743
Hurry up and go!
I'm sure your mother is waiting!

407
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,311
Have a safe trip, Mother...

408
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,748
Geez. My feet won't move.
Oh yeah, Jung Hwan.

409
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:38,052
I ironed your uniform and your drill
uniform and put them in your room...

410
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,020
Hurry up and go!

411
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:44,459
Go! We'll take care of ourselves. Hurry
up and leave this block, already.

412
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:50,950
-OK? OK. Go!
-Oh, also...

413
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,204
Go!

414
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:00,041
Bye!

415
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,808
Hey. Hey, stop sleeping!

416
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,950
How many hours
have you slept, already?

417
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:44,912
If you're going to be like this,
go home and sleep.

418
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:50,450
-What time is it now?
-The sun already set, girl.

419
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,352
It's 7:00 p.m.

420
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,189
I'm going to stop by at home for a bit.

421
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,850
Why? Did something happen at home?

422
00:37:58,826 --> 00:37:59,961
It's dinnertime.

423
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,076
Why are college students
doing this lately?

424
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:22,550
Geez. Don't they know how much they're
hurting their parents by doing this?

425
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,550
Geez.

426
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:38,199
Oh yeah, Duk Seon. You studied hard
at the study room today, right?

427
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:41,102
-Yeah.
-Good.

428
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:45,973
You know... I don't even wish for
you to do as well as your sister.

429
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:51,412
If you did even half as well...
just half as well

430
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:54,315
then I'll be so happy, I'll run around
the neighborhood 200 times.

431
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,484
Just look at your sister.

432
00:38:56,884 --> 00:39:02,323
She worked so hard to get into college,
and yet she still studies so hard.

433
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:07,095
So make sure you come to your senses
too, and study really hard, OK?

434
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:07,829
-OK.
-OK.

435
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,565
No Eul, you... just have to
stay healthy. OK?

436
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,036
What's wrong?

437
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:35,323
What do we do? Oh my God...
what will Bo Ra do?

438
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:41,050
I should go outside.
Maybe she's nearby?

439
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:45,050
What do we do? Bo Ra...
where could she be?

440
00:39:53,841 --> 00:40:00,550
Oh, thank God. Oh my God...
Oh my... oh my.

441
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:04,919
Thank God you're safe, Bo Ra.
Thank God.

442
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,050
You little... get over here.
Get the hell over here!

443
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,050
Let me go!

444
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,391
-Stop it!
-Let go!

445
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:16,964
You crazy wretch. Are you actively
trying to ruin your life?

446
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:21,536
Will you finally come to your
senses after I pass out?

447
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:30,511
You, if you get arrested while protesting
you're going to be blacklisted forever.

448
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,547
If you get yourself blacklisted
on our family registry

449
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:36,017
you're going to be taking our entire
family down with you! All right?

450
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,152
It's not only your life you're ruining.

451
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:42,857
Your mother. What are you going
to do about your mother?

452
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,726
Your mother, who believed
only in you for your entire life...

453
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:49,163
how will you make it up to your mother?
Your mother!

454
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,867
You think your mother will be able
to live properly if that happens?

455
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,536
Huh? Do you think so?

456
00:40:56,237 --> 00:41:01,050
And yet... and yet, you
still choose to protest?

457
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,111
No Eul. Get me the scissors.

458
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,315
I'm going to cut off all her hair
so she can't set a single foot outdoors!

459
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:09,050
Hurry up and get it, jerk!

460
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:12,787
Bo Ra. Hurry up and say you're sorry.
Tell your father that you're sorry!

461
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,189
Why should I? What
did I do wrong?

462
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:18,550
What the hell did this wretch
just say to me? I'll kill you!

463
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,050
Honey, please!
She won't do it anymore!

464
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,965
You seriously believe that?

465
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:32,273
Forget school. Go to your room
and stay there. Got that?

466
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:39,550
Until you tell me that you'll never
do it ever again and apologize to me

467
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,649
don't you dare take a single step
out of your room.

468
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,951
Got that? Also... honey!

469
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:50,057
Until she apologizes don't you dare even
give her a glass of water. Got that?

470
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,493
Hurry up and apologize! Sung Bo Ra!

471
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:54,362
I didn't do anything wrong.

472
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,898
What the hell did you say?
Get the hell back here!

473
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:58,833
Honey!

474
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,204
Heed my words. All right?

475
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:05,206
If anyone even gives
her a glass of water

476
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:08,376
I'm going to flip
the whole house upside down!

477
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,748
Don't you dare give a darn whether
or not she dies. Any of you.

478
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:15,683
-Got it?
-OK.

479
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:17,652
Don't give her anything.

480
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:22,189
Don't you dare.

481
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:30,364
That darned girl.
We sacrificed so much for her.

482
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:35,236
Even though we scrimped and saved
when it came to our own things

483
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:40,341
we never hesitated to give her the best.

484
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,143
I wanted to treat her

485
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,313
like the smart and precious child
that we told everyone she was!

486
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:48,683
We poured so much into her...
that ungrateful wench!

487
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:54,155
She's aware of all that, and yet she has
the gall to do this to her parents?

488
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,835
I heard that all of her upperclassmen
were captured already.

489
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:10,204
What if they take Bo Ra
away, too?

490
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:12,740
What if she gets a criminal record?

491
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:16,811
If so, then all of Korea's college
students will have criminal records.

492
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:19,780
Don't worry.

493
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,649
And even if she
does get arrested

494
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:23,551
she just has to write a letter of
reflection to be released right away.

495
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,252
What's that?

496
00:43:25,486 --> 00:43:29,023
Geez... it's basically a document
saying that you're sorry.

497
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:30,858
It's this thing you write
to formally apologize.

498
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,994
If she just writes that,
she'll be released right away.

499
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:38,699
Darn it! She's done for! My older
sister is Sung Bo Ra, OK?

500
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:40,701
She'll never say that
what she did was wrong.

501
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,505
-You know how she is.
-All too well.

502
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:49,050
But you said that she made it home.
Then she'll be fine.

503
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,546
-Oh, you're here?
-Yeah.

504
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,282
What are you two doing
by yourselves?

505
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,320
-What?
-What are you two doing?

506
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:01,789
What do you mean, jerk?
We're just conversing here.

507
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,624
You know, talking. Talking.

508
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,693
What's with you? I'm leaving.

509
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:10,498
-Where are you going?
-To the study room.

510
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:11,632
What?

511
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:13,834
Apparently, she's been
going to the study room lately.

512
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,672
Hey, do you know what time it is?
The sun set already.

513
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,306
I'll be back before 12:00 AM.

514
00:44:19,507 --> 00:44:21,050
I'm someone who has willpower, too.

515
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,310
Hey, even though your face
can be considered a lethal weapon

516
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:25,312
walking around past midnight
is dangerous.

517
00:44:25,446 --> 00:44:26,681
Just give up on college.

518
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:28,015
Like me.

519
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:29,884
The study room is right there.

520
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:32,386
I'll be back before 12:00 AM.
Bye!

521
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,255
Bye, friend!

522
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,632
Yes, this is Master Choi Taek's home.

523
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,133
Yes.

524
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:47,668
Yes.

525
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:48,836
Yes.

526
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:54,008
Who was that?

527
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:54,842
Kyu Won?

528
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:56,577
Your dad.

529
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,081
He says he's hungry, so he wants you
to hurry over and make him dinner.

530
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,741
What the hell is this?

531
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,344
My younger brother.

532
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:50,965
Grandfather once said,
"All things expand and shrink."

533
00:45:51,098 --> 00:45:53,734
If you have hot water on the bottom
and cold water on the top

534
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:57,671
the two different temperatures work
together in harmony to do this.

535
00:45:58,405 --> 00:45:59,807
We can make them come apart like this.

536
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:05,346
My son.

537
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,053
Shall your father lend you a hand?

538
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:24,131
Dad, this is burning!

539
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:13,214
Wow.

540
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,640
It's cold over there.
Come over here and sleep.

541
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:42,050
Don't you worry whether I die or not.

542
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:45,446
What if she leaves in the
middle of the night while I'm sleeping?

543
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:48,315
I'm going to guard this door
no matter what

544
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:50,550
so go ahead and sleep, honey.

545
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:53,687
Speaking of which,
Duk Seon still isn't home?

546
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:57,291
It's almost midnight!
She should come home earlier!

547
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,860
Did she fall asleep?

548
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,361
I'm home!

549
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:43,097
Hi, honey. Come home earlier.

550
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:44,431
OK.

551
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:57,845
-Sun Woo! Breakfast!
-OK!

552
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,118
Mom, we're eating in here?

553
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:05,686
It's OK. We can eat
in the living room.

554
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:07,488
It's warmer in here. So nice.

555
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,157
Let's eat in here.

556
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:25,305
-Mom, why aren't you eating?
-I will.

557
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,009
We don't have a lot of side dishes.

558
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:32,012
I should make you some meat dishes...

559
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:35,550
Oh... it's fine! I don't even
like meat that much.

560
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:41,789
It's delicious.

561
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,858
Who is that? It's so early.

562
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,094
Yes?

563
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:49,863
Mom! What is it?

564
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:52,032
What?

565
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:53,867
Is he badly hurt?

566
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:58,205
He was probably not watching his
step, as usual... which hospital?

567
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:03,610
You don't need to! I can
take care of him! Geez, Mom.

568
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:07,214
You have to hurry up
and get Tae Soo married, already!

569
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,451
What?

570
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:15,422
You're... coming to my house right now?
You're at the terminal?

571
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:18,325
You're getting off in Seoul now, Mom?

572
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,828
I have some things to give you

573
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:24,565
and I wanted to see Sun Woo and Jin
Joo so I'll be dropping by for a bit.

574
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:28,550
It'll only take me 30 minutes
to get there by bus.

575
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:30,304
You don't need to come and pick me up!

576
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,239
I'll take a taxi and
I'll be right there.

577
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:36,677
I'll just drop by for a bit and just
have a glass of water before I go.

578
00:51:36,743 --> 00:51:39,346
You don't need to worry. Not one bit.

579
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:40,747
See you soon!

580
00:51:54,228 --> 00:51:55,863
You're not going to work today, Dad?

581
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:57,397
He's taking the day off.

582
00:51:57,731 --> 00:51:59,333
He's doing it to make sure Bo Ra
doesn't escape.

583
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:03,637
Even so, we should feed her, at least.
She didn't even have dinner last night.

584
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:04,872
I told you, no!

585
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:10,644
Until she gets on her knees
and apologizes, I'm not budging.

586
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:15,048
I worked so hard to send her to a good
college and this is how she repays me.

587
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,550
She won't come to her senses
unless she starves.

588
00:52:17,651 --> 00:52:20,521
Don't you dare sneak her anything.
Got it?

589
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:37,671
Dad. The briquettes went out.

590
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:45,245
No they didn't. I just changed it
early this morning.

591
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:48,248
It's way too cold.

592
00:52:54,288 --> 00:52:55,522
The fire's fine.

593
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:57,124
What could be the issue?

594
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:01,828
Grandfather once said this.

595
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,550
There are two different types of
briquette boilers.

596
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,301
The type that uses the briquette
as a direct source of heat

597
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:10,637
and the type that uses briquettes to
heat water, which in turn heats rooms.

598
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:12,439
The type that our home uses
is the latter.

599
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,475
If the briquette is fine
but the room is still cold...

600
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,277
in that instance, the issue lies with...

601
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:23,684
this.

602
00:53:24,484 --> 00:53:27,988
The possibility that this tank has run
out of water is close to 100 percent.

603
00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:40,667
Jung Hwan. What's for breakfast today?

604
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:44,204
Oh. It's your favorite.

605
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:48,141
Is it, perhaps... ramyun?

606
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:50,544
I need something to put this on!
Hurry!

607
00:53:58,252 --> 00:54:02,122
Aw, yeah! What about Dad?

608
00:54:02,756 --> 00:54:04,458
Dad!
Have breakfast!

609
00:54:10,864 --> 00:54:14,401
Children. The toilet
is clogged again.

610
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:19,039
Oh geez. I just lost my appetite.

611
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,408
I tried using the plunger,
but it wouldn't work.

612
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:27,714
Grandfather once said this.

613
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,951
If the floor is full of feces,
you have to lower the pressure.

614
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:34,288
I have a good feeling about this one.

615
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,624
Stop spouting bullcrap
and do something about this.

616
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:03,784
Then, I'll leave the rest to you.

617
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,218
Thornton.

618
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:18,298
Sun Woo! Your grandmother is coming!
It's an emergency!

619
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,050
Change into something else
and clear the table! Don't eat!

620
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:29,050
Here, this one. Wash your face first!

621
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,277
I have to go to school, though.

622
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:31,244
Oh... yeah.

623
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:09,583
I'll use only a little
and give this right back!

624
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:25,465
These, too!

625
00:56:57,397 --> 00:57:00,267
Jung Bong! Can you help me?

626
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,741
Oh... oh geez.

627
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,304
Oh my God, you scared me!

628
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,106
It is finished.

629
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:52,552
Jung Bong, thanks so much. I'll
put everything back later.

630
00:57:52,786 --> 00:57:54,321
You can take your time with that.

631
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:57,691
Wow... I think this is
pretty much perfect now.

632
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:00,227
I won't be caught at this rate, right?

633
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:11,304
These are sesame seeds,
and these are senna seeds.

634
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:12,873
Make it into tea and give it to Sun Woo.

635
00:58:12,873 --> 00:58:14,674
I heard it's good for one's health.

636
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:19,312
Mom. They sell this stuff in Seoul, too.
Why did you bring it here?

637
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:20,213
Oh, geez.

638
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,548
-Mom, also...
-Yes?

639
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:23,083
Eat something before you go.

640
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:26,550
I called Tae Soo and he seems fine.

641
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,256
Things like that happen
when you're a cab driver.

642
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,224
You can take your time
heading over there.

643
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,361
No. I have to hurry
and go there.

644
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,213
Jin Joo!
Granny's going now!

645
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,115
Already?

646
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:59,753
Mom, it hasn't even been 10 minutes
since you got here! Stay a bit longer!

647
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:02,422
Oh, geez... what good would it do
for me to stay here any longer?

648
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:13,166
Oh my.

649
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,735
I'm just getting more worried about you.

650
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,638
Don't come outside to see me off.
I'm leaving now.

651
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:22,550
Mom! You should stay a bit longer!

652
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:28,050
Geez! You really don't listen!

653
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:32,819
Where's your bathroom? I kept
drinking so much juice, so...

654
00:59:33,386 --> 00:59:34,921
Over there.

655
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:57,177
I told you, go back inside!

656
00:59:57,277 --> 00:59:59,550
You're in such a hurry!

657
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:05,185
-Oh, hello, Sun Woo's grandmother!
-Yes! How are you?

658
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,721
-You're doing well, right?
-Yes.

659
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:10,190
You're already leaving, ma'am?

660
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:15,128
My son hurt his leg, so I have to
go see him at the hospital.

661
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,131
Then... I'm off!

662
01:00:18,498 --> 01:00:19,699
I'm leaving now!

663
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,167
Have a safe trip home, ma'am!

664
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,802
-Thank you!
-Bye, Mom.

665
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:27,874
She came here for the first time in a
while, but didn't even stay the night?

666
01:00:28,274 --> 01:00:30,710
She came here because
of your brother's leg injury?

667
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:32,946
-Is he badly hurt?
-I don't think so.

668
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:35,550
She probably just came to
see how I was doing.

669
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,153
She was probably curious
about my living situation.

670
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,957
She worries that
I don't eat properly and such.

671
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,725
She thinks that I'm not aware of that.

672
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:47,050
Is that right?

673
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:52,198
Madam. Look at me. I've been doing all
sorts of crazy things since this morning!

674
01:00:52,699 --> 01:00:54,550
But I didn't get caught!

675
01:00:56,269 --> 01:01:01,241
-Oh yeah. Is Bo Ra OK?
-No, she's not OK.

676
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,177
Her father didn't even go to work today
because he's watching her like a hawk.

677
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:09,749
Geez! She didn't even have anything
to eat... I'm so worried about her!

678
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:22,228
-Eat.
-Oh... put it here.

679
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,002
Oh my. That's all the side
dishes you have for me?

680
01:01:29,202 --> 01:01:31,404
Yes. Just eat.

681
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:35,675
You should have made me
a fried egg, at least.

682
01:01:35,742 --> 01:01:37,777
We don't have any eggs!

683
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:42,882
Anyway... what about you?
You're not eating with me?

684
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:49,122
You think that I could eat at a
time like this? How inhumane.

685
01:01:58,732 --> 01:01:59,532
-Oh!
-Oh!

686
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:00,667
Bo Ra's mother!

687
01:02:01,201 --> 01:02:03,103
What are you doing outside
on such a chilly day?

688
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,805
Geez... my heart feels so heavy,
so...

689
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,608
Jung Bong's mother hasn't come back yet?

690
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,443
No. She's coming back tomorrow.

691
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,550
I guess it's a vacation
for the guys at your place.

692
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:14,550
The house is a mess, right?

693
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:17,550
No, that's not true.
We're getting by so well.

694
01:02:17,684 --> 01:02:20,687
It's just that we don't do housework...
but when we do, we're good at it.

695
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,050
I see.

696
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:26,359
You should put some socks
on, at least. Geez.

697
01:02:30,764 --> 01:02:32,499
-You made alcohol out of ginseng?
-Yes!

698
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:34,601
When else could I drink it,
except when my wife is gone?

699
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:38,104
-My husband is home today, too.
-Oh, really?

700
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:42,308
-Then we can have a drink together!
-Yes!

701
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:05,031
There's no use in
getting your kids educated.

702
01:03:05,632 --> 01:03:10,550
Even if you get them to study hard,
they act like they're hot shit

703
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:13,106
and do whatever they want.

704
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:20,680
Even so... I wish Jung Bong
could be half of what Bo Ra is.

705
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:29,556
He's my child, but... this kid...
I'm so worried about him.

706
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:37,550
Because my wife and I had
a soft spot for him

707
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,066
we just let him do as he wished, but...

708
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:44,604
I'm really worried about him.

709
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,776
Speaking of which...
is Bo Ra OK?

710
01:03:55,315 --> 01:03:56,550
I'm not eating.

711
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,854
Eat already!
Are you planning to starve to death?

712
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,889
I'm not hungry and I have no appetite.

713
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,360
Just have one spoonful.

714
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,550
Just have one spoonful and sleep.

715
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,599
I made your favorite.
Just have one bite.

716
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,171
I told you, I'm not eating!
Leave me alone!

717
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:24,377
Just one spoonful, Bo Ra!
OK? Just one.

718
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:36,189
Then... I'll leave it here. So eat it
later whenever you want to. OK?

719
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:41,550
If you don't want to eat now,
eat later, at least. Got it?

720
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:16,296
Jin Joo! Oh, geez.
I have to wash that again!

721
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,730
Seriously...

722
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,204
OK. Your arms.

723
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,550
-Whose daughter is my little Jin Joo?
-Mommy's daughter!

724
01:05:32,745 --> 01:05:37,717
Oh, my child! Jin Joo, what do you want
to eat? What should we eat?

725
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:38,985
Banana.

726
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:41,854
Banana? You had that yesterday
too, though.

727
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:43,289
Banana!

728
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:49,529
OK. I'll go buy some later.
Go to your room. Good girl!

729
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:27,333
To my kind and beautiful daughter.

730
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,405
I don't have much money,
so I couldn't put in a lot.

731
01:06:33,272 --> 01:06:36,576
Buy some pretty clothes
for yourself, my daughter.

732
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:41,750
My daughter, whom I love so much...
don't live life with your head hung low.

733
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,886
You've done nothing wrong!
Make sure to take care of your health!

734
01:07:26,025 --> 01:07:28,227
Geez. Mom... really...

735
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:54,620
When did she leave that?

736
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,326
I can't believe her.

737
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,687
Honey, your laundry...

738
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,750
Oh geez. Way to go.

739
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:52,044
Sun Woo's mother. Have you see Bo Ra?

740
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:56,782
No, I haven't seen her.
Why, she's not home?

741
01:08:57,783 --> 01:09:00,987
Oh geez... where did that girl go?

742
01:09:03,623 --> 01:09:06,325
No, I haven't seen her.
She didn't come by here.

743
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:07,860
OK.

744
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:14,800
Taek's father. Did you see Bo Ra?
Did she pass by here?

745
01:09:14,934 --> 01:09:16,302
No, I didn't see her.

746
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:20,907
-Oh my... what do I do?
-Ma'am!

747
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,650
-Here.
-Thank you.

748
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,262
Sung Bo Ra. That's you, right?

749
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,365
Freshman, Math Education major
at Seoul University.

750
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:20,933
You're student Sung Bo Ra, right?

751
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:24,870
You know Ko Heung, right?

752
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:29,242
Student body president
at Seoul University.

753
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,310
He's your leader, isn't he?

754
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:40,720
Did you participate in the protest
at Garak-dong or not?

755
01:10:42,588 --> 01:10:44,523
No, I didn't. I didn't do it.

756
01:10:45,191 --> 01:10:46,425
Look at this jerk.

757
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:48,928
Cooperate and come with us
while we're still being civil.

758
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:50,529
Bo Ra!

759
01:10:59,372 --> 01:11:03,776
Bo Ra. My daughter isn't the one
you're looking for.

760
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:05,378
You can't take her away.

761
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,347
-Madam...
-Do you know what kind of daughter she is?

762
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:10,650
She's the smartest kid
in the entire neighborhood.

763
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:14,320
She's even smarter than
the kids from rich families!

764
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,689
She could have went to Seoul
University's law school

765
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:21,327
but she wanted to get a scholarship
to she settled for the Education major.

766
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:24,196
Her dream since she was young
was to be a prosecutor or a judge

767
01:11:24,797 --> 01:11:31,604
but she didn't want to burden
her parents financially, and settled.

768
01:11:31,604 --> 01:11:32,772
You know Seoul University, right?

769
01:11:32,772 --> 01:11:36,142
It's the university that only accepts
the smartest kids in our country!

770
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,645
She was never tutored or went to a cram
school, but she got in on her first try!

771
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,915
That's the type of daughter
that my daughter is.

772
01:11:43,482 --> 01:11:45,785
Do you know how many days
our neighborhood celebrated?

773
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:49,689
Even her father's company
sent flowers as a congratulatory gift.

774
01:11:49,755 --> 01:11:52,692
Also, when she was graduating
high school...

775
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:56,996
she got an award from the principal
as the student representative!

776
01:11:57,063 --> 01:12:00,333
She also made the top ten when it
came to her Korean SAT scores!

777
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,740
Her uncle is a provincial governor

778
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:06,439
and she's close enough with
him to have dinner with him!

779
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,908
And one of her cousins
is going to medical school now!

780
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:12,150
Also, also... do you know
about her father?

781
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:15,150
He worked so hard for 20 years

782
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:17,283
that he received an award
from the president of the bank!

783
01:12:17,483 --> 01:12:20,653
He even had dinner with her, and wow...

784
01:12:20,786 --> 01:12:24,256
he said that there couldn't be a smarter
or kinder daughter in the world.

785
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:26,826
The president even gave her
some spending money!

786
01:12:26,892 --> 01:12:30,863
And he even drove her all the way home
in his personal car!

787
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:33,733
I'm sorry! I'm sorry
for what I did.

788
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:36,335
Bo Ra! Don't say such nonsense!

789
01:12:36,335 --> 01:12:38,738
-What I did was wrong!
-No, no, no!

790
01:12:38,738 --> 01:12:41,674
My child would never do that!
My daughter isn't that kind of child!

791
01:12:41,674 --> 01:12:44,176
I said, what I did was wrong!
I'll go to the police station.

792
01:12:44,176 --> 01:12:49,150
No, Bo Ra! You did nothing wrong!
My child isn't that kind of child!

793
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,449
-Let's go.
-No.

794
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:51,450
Let's go.

795
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,386
I told you, my daughter
would never do that!

796
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:57,150
-Please let go, ma'am.
-Let go! Let go!

797
01:12:57,323 --> 01:12:58,657
My child isn't that kind of child!

798
01:12:58,657 --> 01:13:01,927
Sometimes, I felt like my mom
was an embarrassment.

799
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:05,998
There were time I couldn't understand
why she seemed to have

800
01:13:05,998 --> 01:13:09,101
self-consciousness or a sense of pride
and got angry.

801
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:15,950
I didn't realize it then, but it was
because there was something precious

802
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:20,112
that she wanted to protect
more than herself.

803
01:13:21,714 --> 01:13:23,282
And that it was because of me.

804
01:13:25,684 --> 01:13:29,688
When true love manifests it doesn't allow
one to be concerned over one's pride

805
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:32,391
and causes one to cast it aside.

806
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:37,596
That's why mothers are strong.

807
01:13:40,466 --> 01:13:41,734
Mom, I'm home!

808
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:43,903
Oh, my child!

809
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:48,641
Jin Joo! How are you?

810
01:13:48,974 --> 01:13:51,410
-Did Jung Hwan drop you off?
-Of course.

811
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,779
I didn't come home drenched,
which is a relief.

812
01:13:54,413 --> 01:13:56,015
-I'm going to go wash up first.
-OK.

813
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,055
Hello?

814
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,525
Tae Seok. Are you OK?

815
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:11,864
Geez, you... you're so old,
and yet you're still bothering Mom.

816
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,933
How are you going to get by without Mom?

817
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:18,637
Is Mom awake? Put her on the line.

818
01:14:23,275 --> 01:14:24,443
Hello?

819
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:29,281
Mom.

820
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,188
Sun Young?

821
01:14:37,823 --> 01:14:40,150
Oh... hello?

822
01:14:41,994 --> 01:14:43,529
Why did you give me the money?

823
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:04,683
Mom!

824
01:15:11,524 --> 01:15:18,330
Mom!

825
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,605
Mom!

826
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:31,577
They say that God created mothers because
they can't be everywhere at once.

827
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:35,447
Even when one is at
the age to be a mom

828
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:41,887
one's mother is always one's guardian
and even saying the word, "Mom"

829
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:43,923
is something that has the power
to tug at one's heartstrings.

830
01:15:46,258 --> 01:15:50,129
Mothers are always strong.

831
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,300
Is Bo Ra OK?

832
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,804
Well... they're letting her
off with a warning.

833
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,907
What a relief.
That's good, then.

834
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:36,609
It'll be OK.

835
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:40,212
Speaking of which,
they should be coming out soon.

836
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,415
Didn't you say that you quit smoking?

837
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:48,821
It's OK.

838
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:50,556
Just give her a stiff punishment!

839
01:16:50,756 --> 01:16:55,060
Sit her down and give her a scary look
and strike fear into her heart!

840
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:02,150
Geez. Why should I do that? It's
not like she committed a crime.

841
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:07,706
How could I make her
get on her knees and yell at her?

842
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,519
Banana.

843
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,650
OK. The biggest one is for Jin Joo.

844
01:18:04,063 --> 01:18:07,150
And, this one is for Mom!

845
01:18:07,299 --> 01:18:08,367
No, it's OK.
I'm not going to eat.

846
01:18:08,367 --> 01:18:09,301
You eat it.

847
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,403
Geez... then, I won't eat it either.

848
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:12,504
Let's throw it out.

849
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:14,473
OK, OK! I'll eat it!

850
01:18:18,544 --> 01:18:19,545
Is it yummy, Jin Joo?

851
01:18:24,383 --> 01:18:25,484
I'm home!

852
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:29,855
What should we do about dinner?

853
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,150
What about Dad?

854
01:18:34,026 --> 01:18:34,993
Yeah. What about dinner?

855
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:36,161
I'm hungry.

856
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:38,931
OK, hurry. I used all the leftover side
dishes to make fried rice.

857
01:18:38,997 --> 01:18:40,232
I put dumplings in it, too.

858
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:44,737
Hello?

859
01:18:52,377 --> 01:18:53,946
Who was it?

860
01:18:56,915 --> 01:18:57,850
Mom.

861
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,452
She said she just arrived
at the terminal.

862
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:06,125
Did you clean it?

863
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:08,427
What are you doing?
Hurry up and clean!

864
01:19:19,938 --> 01:19:22,508
When did anyone play badminton?

865
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:14,726
What about the charcoal briquettes?

866
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:16,028
You didn't let it go out?

867
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:18,797
Of course we didn't.
It's nice and warm.

868
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:23,836
What about laundry?

869
01:20:23,836 --> 01:20:25,237
You forgot the laundry
from the clothesline?

870
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:26,022
We collected it all.

871
01:20:26,033 --> 01:20:27,925
Jung Bong collected,
folded, and put them away.

872
01:20:30,309 --> 01:20:38,383
Honey. See? I told you we'd be fine. We
were totally fine without you here!

873
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,853
Don't you worry about us! OK?

874
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:47,740
Aren't you hungry?

875
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,561
I made the dumpling soup that you like.

876
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:52,264
I'm fine. You have some.

877
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:11,984
Since it's raining and all,
want to have some soju?

878
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,052
It's time to go to sleep... what soju?

879
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,320
Drink by yourself.

880
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,089
Should I make some kimchi pancakes
for you, then?

881
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:19,491
It's fine! Go and watch TV.

882
01:21:27,733 --> 01:21:30,135
Why? Why do I feel uneasy?

883
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:32,604
I guess something at home is a mess.

884
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,040
No way. We cleaned everything.

885
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,909
We cleaned, did the laundry,
and did the dishes perfectly.

886
01:21:36,942 --> 01:21:38,043
We even changed all the briquettes

887
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:39,778
and ate all the side dishes
she told us to eat.

888
01:21:40,012 --> 01:21:42,748
I'm sure my mom was shocked, too. She
doesn't even have to lift a finger.

889
01:21:44,082 --> 01:21:44,983
I see.

890
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,085
-Jung Hwan.
-Yeah?

891
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:02,534
What?

892
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:08,874
Mom, Jung Bong burned his hands!

893
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:12,311
Geez, I can't believe you!

894
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:15,213
How old are you that you can't
even make ramyun properly?

895
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,190
Geez! They're stuck again.

896
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:31,430
A scissor...

897
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,411
Mom! Dad broke the
briquettes again!

898
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:54,150
Geez... geez! Way to go! You can't do
anything right! I can't believe you!

899
01:22:54,286 --> 01:22:55,387
Geez!

900
01:23:02,427 --> 01:23:05,130
Mom! Have you seen my shorts?

901
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:07,933
Geez... geez, geez, geez!

902
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:13,238
Right here! You can't even find this?

903
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,074
I didn't see it.

904
01:23:16,108 --> 01:23:20,779
Geez! What would you
all do without me?

905
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,048
Nobody can do anything properly.

906
01:23:25,884 --> 01:23:27,152
Let's eat together.

907
01:23:28,453 --> 01:23:29,454
What kind of dumplings are those?

908
01:23:29,554 --> 01:23:35,460
Kimchi dumplings. The ones you like.
And soju!

909
01:23:37,796 --> 01:23:39,331
If you really want to, I guess.

910
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:42,367
I'm forcing myself to eat
for your sake.

911
01:23:42,501 --> 01:23:44,436
Thank you, ma'am.

912
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:45,871
Let's go!

913
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:48,573
Hey, Jung Hwan.

914
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,610
You don't understand
why your mom's in a bad mood?

915
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:52,544
No.

916
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,814
It's because the family
is doing way too well.

917
01:23:58,984 --> 01:24:02,020
You all were doing too well without her
for her liking.

918
01:24:08,493 --> 01:24:11,163
-Let's make a toast! Cheers!
-Cheers!

919
01:24:11,163 --> 01:24:12,898
It's been a while!

920
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:16,868
What do you mean, it's been a while?
It's only been two days.

921
01:24:17,736 --> 01:24:23,650
Wow! Really... without you
around, I realized something.

922
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,076
What?

923
01:24:24,176 --> 01:24:27,179
Us men are garbage without
you, honey. OK?

924
01:24:28,613 --> 01:24:31,750
When one is at the age when
one can console one's mother

925
01:24:32,184 --> 01:24:39,724
it's when one has matured past being able
to say "Thank you" and "I love you."

926
01:24:41,026 --> 01:24:44,362
If one wishes to make one's mother happy

927
01:24:44,563 --> 01:24:51,770
the words, "Mom, I need you,"
are more than enough.

928
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:05,177
Darn.

929
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:15,420
Darn it!

930
01:26:41,179 --> 01:26:42,547
Stop walking around so late.

931
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,666
-Where are you going?
-To get some batteries!

932
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:03,401
Hi!

933
01:27:04,202 --> 01:27:06,705
Hey, why do you keep coming
back here, with your leg like that?

934
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:07,872
It's almost done healing.

935
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:09,741
What brings you here?

936
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:11,943
Oh... I came to borrow a sewing kit.

937
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,845
-Are you going somewhere?
-To get some batteries.

938
01:27:14,045 --> 01:27:14,846
I have some.

939
01:27:15,013 --> 01:27:15,880
-Really?
-Yeah.

940
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,682
Let's go to my house.
I'll give you some of mine.

941
01:27:21,353 --> 01:27:22,487
Hello!

942
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:24,122
Oh, hi!

943
01:27:24,122 --> 01:27:25,657
You're here, Jung Hwan?

944
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:29,094
Hey, I need to use the bathroom.

945
01:27:29,094 --> 01:27:30,395
Go to my room.

946
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:43,174
Wow... look at this guy...
he has everything in alphabetical order.

947
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:44,609
What a freak.

948
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:00,859
Look at this. It
looks brand new.

949
01:28:18,443 --> 01:28:19,377
Do you want something to drink?

950
01:28:55,347 --> 01:28:57,182
I have someone I like.

951
01:28:57,282 --> 01:28:59,617
I think he'll do it soon. I feel it.

952
01:28:59,651 --> 01:29:02,020
Geez... it's about time
that he called already...

953
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:04,923
Your head's going to roll off
your shoulders while you're waiting!

954
01:29:07,192 --> 01:29:09,594
Duk Seon. Do you want me to
make you another ramyun?

955
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,396
Ugh... jerk.

956
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:17,802
Sit.

957
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:18,870
It's fine.

958
01:29:19,037 --> 01:29:21,940
I have no interest in hearing about
other people's love lives. Bye.

959
01:29:23,475 --> 01:29:25,610
I think it's going to be hard
for Taek this time.

960
01:29:25,877 --> 01:29:27,650
I don't think he's in a good state.

961
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,418
Even when it comes to Baduk,
he's wary against strangers.

962
01:29:34,419 --> 01:29:36,121
Want to bet?

963
01:29:36,254 --> 01:29:38,650
He'll come! You'll see!

964
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,291
Duk Seon!

965
01:29:44,829 --> 01:29:46,064
On the day of the first snow.

966
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:49,300
Confess on the first day
that it snows, OK?
