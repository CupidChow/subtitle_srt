1
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,720
AUGUST 1988.

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,639
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

3
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,409
I told you, that's not it.

4
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,540
NAME, JANG MI OK.
NICKNAME, MAGGIE CHEUNG

5
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,540
NAME, WANG JA HYUN.
NICKNAME, JANG JO HYUN.

6
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,328
Awesome!

7
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,540
Sung Deok Sun.

8
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,767
If you keep getting it wrong,
it will cause problems.

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Hey. We have two whole months left.
Worry about yourselves.

10
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:31,341
Even if you get everything else wrong
you really have to get this right.

11
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,275
Watch one more time.

12
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,619
Miss, three ramyuns, please!

13
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,892
Why are you here? You didn't
go to picket girl practice?

14
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:51,161
What about you guys?
What brings you guys all the way here?

15
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,230
Hey. Our school is closer than yours.

16
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,040
-Jung Hwan, I'm ordering ddukbokki, too.
-OK.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,940
Miss! Three servings of
ddukbokki too, please!

18
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,101
Jung Hwan, we're getting some too, then.

19
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,203
-Hey!
-That means it's OK.

20
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:03,173
Miss, give us some more ddukbokki, too!

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,908
Hey, Duk Seon,
can you pass me the water?

22
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,775
Sure.

23
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,540
I guess you don't have
picket girl practice today.

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,214
You pretty much live at the stadium.

25
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:13,817
I have to go after eating.
There's late practice today.

26
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:15,886
Hey, Special Unit.

27
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,421
Shut it. Who are you
calling Special Unit?

28
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,357
Even so, she turned right around,
didn't she?

29
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,892
Did you get a lot of practice in?

30
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,293
I heard that you're
doing song by Sobangcha.

31
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:26,029
Yeah. When are you going to manage
to get that done?

32
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,298
I'm sure you're already so busy
with picket girl practice.

33
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:31,201
-The ramyun's done!
-OK!

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,040
Duk Seon. Do you want some ramyun?
Want one?

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,743
-Hey!
-I'm not eating it! Darn.

36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,319
Duk Seon, we'll be heading out first.
Jung Hwan covered everything.

37
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,222
-Just how much did she freaking eat?
-Hey, hey.

38
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,056
Bye.

39
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,867
You're not eating? It's free, though.

40
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:07,737
He's the Student Council President
at Ssangmun High, right?

41
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,041
Who, Sun Woo? The tall one? Why?

42
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:15,712
-What are you going to do?
-What?

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,016
It seems like he likes you.

44
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,553
He was only looking at you
from the moment he walked in.

45
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:26,056
I know, right? I saw it, too.

46
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,091
Why did he ask you to pass the water?

47
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,780
He could have just asked
the cook for it.

48
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:35,999
Also. Did you see his worried expression
when you said you had to practice?

49
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,401
I totally saw it. I really saw it.

50
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,572
And the last piece
of decisive evidence...

51
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,444
"Do you want ramyun?"

52
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:03,393
Congrats, Duk Seon. You... just
got yourself a boyfriend.

53
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,720
Duk Seon!

54
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,222
Sung Duk Seon!

55
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:42,899
What is it?

56
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,402
Can you lend me some white-out?
You know, correction fluid.

57
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,005
White-out? I don't have any.

58
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,042
Way to go. What kind of student
doesn't even have white-out?

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,276
Hello.

60
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,980
Sun Woo, don't hang out with her.
You'll become stupid, too.

61
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,348
-Shut it!
-What did you say?

62
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:01,785
Hey, whatever. It's fine.
I'll just ask Jung Hwan. Bye.

63
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,422
-Goodbye.
-OK... bye.

64
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:15,799
Eat up.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,780
Is this the second Korean War
or something?

66
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:26,576
Why is it just "Potatoville" over here?

67
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,178
Are we on emergency rations
or something?

68
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,080
You're really going to be like this?

69
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
You bought an entire box
of potatoes yesterday.

70
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,617
Because you felt bad for
that guy's grandmother.

71
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,020
When did I ever? Why, I ought to...

72
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,588
Putting on quite a show, aren't you?

73
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,193
Your dad is great
at acting, right?

74
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,531
Why do you keep using all the money?

75
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,369
I want to actually have some money
left over, for once! Stop using it all!

76
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,803
Not in front of the kids!

77
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:59,242
Also, do you know just how good
potatoes are for the body?

78
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:02,779
I bought it for our kids' health,
but you didn't even realize that?

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,082
Your hands are so strong
for no good reason.

80
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:12,489
By the way, Duk Seon. Isn't it time
for the Sports News? Turn on NBC.

81
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:18,695
-It's not time for the Sports News yet.
-Oh... really?

82
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,780
I really like that guy, Kang Sun Ho.

83
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,780
He looks like an actor
and looks so tall!

84
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,939
Geez, you... All he does is
sit in that chair and blabber!

85
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,941
How do you know if he's tall or not?

86
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,780
You all have wire-taps inside
your stomachs, everyone!

87
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,545
You think that's cool?

88
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:37,947
You all have wiretaps inside
your stomachs, everyone!

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,117
I live at 136-35...

90
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:45,780
What the heck... it keeps flickering
back and forth, right?

91
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,056
What's going on?

92
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,280
Wow, that's weird.

93
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,062
Duk Seon!

94
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,433
Sung Duk Seon!

95
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,067
He's going to break down the
door at that rate.

96
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:02,605
Sun Woo! Come in and
have dinner with us!

97
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,542
Duk Seon, go and get some rice
for Sun Woo.

98
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:12,849
My... she was just there a second ago.
Where did she go?

99
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:17,280
-Wow... look at his face.
-He's totally shocked. Oh dear.

100
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Wow... it's the first time I've seen
a live broadcast interrupted like that.

101
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
I guess all sorts of things
happen in this world.

102
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,877
Hello.

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,012
Oh, hi, Sun Woo! Come in
and have something to eat.

104
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,081
Yeah. Have something.

105
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:49,052
No, it's OK. I'm having ramyun
with the others at Taek's...

106
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,227
Jesus... you shocked me more
than the interruption on TV...

107
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:00,780
What the... where are you going
at this hour, with your face like that?

108
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,299
To go eat ramyun.

109
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,337
Let's go, Sun Woo.

110
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,678
Summer, 1988.

111
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,981
Sung Duk Seon's
first experience with love.

112
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,280
In other words,
her first love had just begun!

113
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,466
All of Seoul has been riddled with
fear and uncertainty

114
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,780
since the convicts escaped.

115
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,780
Last August, convict Ji Kang Won
and three others

116
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,275
escaped from a prison transfer bus
en route to another jail.

117
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:49,280
There have been sightings of him
in Anamdong and Haengdamdong.

118
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,515
The police are still investigating
their location

119
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,350
as they deliberate on what to do.

120
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,221
Madam, I'm scared. What if
they come to our neighborhood?

121
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:01,324
Geez, don't worry. What's there to steal
in this neighborhood, anyway?

122
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,594
There are so many expensive things
in her house!

123
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:07,330
A record player, a microwave,
and a rice cooker!

124
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,066
You also have about
500 coal briquettes, don't you?

125
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,468
A thief will never break into our house.

126
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,103
How come?

127
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:17,006
-There already is one.
-What?

128
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:21,110
Not properly fulfilling one's duties
is what thieves do, isn't it?

129
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,451
Geez... how nice.
This would be great.

130
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,321
You sure are hard to satisfy.

131
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,489
Jung Bong's father is
a man of integrity.

132
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,024
There's not a lot of guys like him!

133
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,492
You keep him, then.

134
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,395
-Why? You're going to give him away?
-Yeah.

135
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,780
If someone takes my husband, I'll throw
in this house to sweeten the deal.

136
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:47,570
Me, me, me! I'll do it!
I'll give marriage another go!

137
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,640
-Oh my.
-What is it?

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,042
Your ex-husband came home so early.

139
00:09:58,648 --> 00:09:59,582
Mi Ran.

140
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,484
Mi.

141
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,753
Ran.

142
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,556
Stop it. Seriously.

143
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,425
Why do you only do that to me?

144
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,060
I told you to stop it, already!

145
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:16,280
OK, OK. I won't do it anymore.
Geez.

146
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,101
Were you talking about
something interesting?

147
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:24,073
Oh, yeah. She said that
you're pretty much a thief.

148
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,875
A thief?

149
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,280
You mean because... I stole her
life from making her laugh so hard?

150
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:48,698
OK, this thief here will be going.

151
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,566
Oh, everyone.

152
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:54,280
Have a great day, everyone!

153
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,647
First come, first serve, hon.

154
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,582
I'd rather live alone.

155
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,551
I should only serve one husband
after all.

156
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,123
Oh my God... I thought
he was a thief for a second!

157
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,780
Bo Ra's father looks like he raided
a small supermarket.

158
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,401
You're just getting home, sir?

159
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,780
And just what did you buy
so much of today?

160
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:35,411
-What is that? What did you buy this time?
-You'll see when you come inside.

161
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,413
Have some sweet potatoes.

162
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,982
Why are you in such a rush?

163
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,780
You should hurry.

164
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,620
He has to finish up everything
before the kids get home, after all.

165
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,755
I'm sure he's excited.

166
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,490
What did you buy now?

167
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,925
Oh my...

168
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,280
They're bracken ferns.

169
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,928
They say it's not good for
a man's sexual stamina, though.

170
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,420
Geez. How good must
his stamina be

171
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,800
if he's trying to get rid of
his excess stamina? Right?

172
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,035
I told you, let's talk inside.

173
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
And what's this, over here?

174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,040
Wow... she's getting a head start?

175
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,280
Darn it!

176
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:19,780
I don't know how they can stand to
chatter like that 365 days of the year!

177
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,258
I hate seeing them.
We have to move or something.

178
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:23,960
What the hell is all this?

179
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,129
Can't you tell just by looking at it?

180
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,363
They're greens.

181
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,066
I bought just a little
on the way home.

182
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,735
You call this "a little?"

183
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,036
Geez.

184
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,280
You know the paper store?

185
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:42,211
There's an old woman who sits in front
of that and sells greens all day.

186
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,280
And she looks just like my older sister.

187
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:47,083
She was squatting down there
and selling these

188
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:51,154
and she probably couldn't
sell all of these by the end of the day.

189
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:54,590
So how could I, as a human being,
just ignore that?

190
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,361
So... I just bought a couple.

191
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:04,133
Geez... these didn't even
cost that much!

192
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,736
People who are less fortunate
should help each other out!

193
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,280
We're not in the situation to be
helping other people right now.

194
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,780
Because of your frivolous purchases,
I can't even buy things for the kids.

195
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,480
Just look. I have to live wearing
holey socks because of you!

196
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,515
Look, look! Take a good, hard, look!

197
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:24,854
What? I bet it's nice and cool,
you'll have more ventilation that way.

198
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,292
Geez! Are you seriously
saying that, right now?

199
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,429
Geez, it's always money with you.

200
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,480
With money, you'll never be satisfied
whether you have a lot or not!

201
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,780
You wouldn't know, since we've
never had money, would you?

202
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,673
-Darn it!
-You, really...

203
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,643
Which greens should I prep first?

204
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,179
Two...

205
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,084
three...

206
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,458
four.

207
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,131
You thought that there was
only four, right?

208
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,101
Five.

209
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:16,005
Are you kidding me, right now?

210
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,574
There's four of us,
but you only bought five?

211
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,780
One person gets one each.
And you get two.

212
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,656
Honey. Please... let's start living
like people now, OK?

213
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,026
Let's use as much as other people
and live like other people live.

214
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,494
OK, Mr. Kim Sung Kyun?

215
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:40,529
What's wrong with the way we live?

216
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,400
Three years ago,
we couldn't even have tangerines!

217
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,470
We used to live on boiled dough
because we had no money for rice!

218
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:49,672
Thinking of how I used to live back then

219
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,140
even buying these feels like
something out of a dream.

220
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,643
Again with that past crap!

221
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,913
If you like talking about it so much,
why don't you go back to those times?

222
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,117
Geez. You... geez.

223
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,780
Who cares if we have money?
You don't have a rich person's mindset.

224
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,658
I'm worried that our kids
will take after you!

225
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,360
What are you going to
do about Jung Bong?

226
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,730
He takes after you
so he's cowardly and miserly.

227
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,533
Do you think he'll actually
be able to function in society?

228
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,902
Aren't you even a little bit worried?

229
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,071
He'll change when he goes to college.

230
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,441
He has to study
to be able to go to college!

231
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,045
Lately he's been doing nothing
but studying in his room!

232
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,247
You want to make a bet?

233
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,280
See? You call that studying?

234
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,595
Are you studying right now?

235
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:20,930
No, Mother.

236
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,232
There's not much time left
until the exams.

237
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,867
Are you not planning to go to college?

238
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,538
President Roosevelt once said.

239
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:33,275
"There's more to be learned from stamps
than from school."

240
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,352
And your mother once said this

241
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,155
"I've never seen
such a useless piece of jerk!"

242
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,923
You brat!

243
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,993
You took exams for
five darn years in a row... and what?

244
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,395
If you were of sound mind

245
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,964
you would have taken your mother
and father into consideration,

246
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:58,780
at least you should have buckled down
in front of your darn desk

247
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,737
and studied your darn brains out,
you immoral darn stupid!

248
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,545
All right.

249
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:13,115
What's so important about school?
Continue with what you were doing.

250
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,618
Yes, Mother.

251
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,297
There's a lot of greens,
so eat a lot of those.

252
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,470
You jerk... why do you
keep pushing the table?

253
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:36,906
I didn't.

254
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,042
Then would the table grow legs
and crawl toward me?

255
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,112
I can't move because
it's so close to my stomach!

256
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,780
Dad, can't you buy
me one of those?

257
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,484
Everyone in my class has one
except me.

258
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,780
Your sister has one!
Share that!

259
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,560
-Mine broke. Buy me one, too.
-I guess I need to buy it then.

260
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:02,965
Whatever. I wasn't expecting
anything from you, anyway.

261
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,869
Have some greens. I bought them.

262
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,780
Hey. You got it wrong again.

263
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,280
No, I didn't! She did!

264
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,462
Crazy wretch.

265
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,966
Sung Duk Seon. I really don't think
you have a talent for dancing.

266
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,468
We've been practicing for months
and you can't get that one thing right?

267
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,780
-I only got it wrong once.
-You get it wrong every day.

268
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,907
How are you going to be able to perform
at the overnight trip, at this rate?

269
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,077
-We still have two days.
-Just drop out.

270
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,046
Why do you want to do the talent show
so badly when you can't even dance?

271
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,280
You guys don't need to worry.

272
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:24,780
I'm going to master
it perfectly tonight.

273
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,780
How?

274
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,280
Don't you know that Park Nam Jung
lives in my neighborhood?

275
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:32,588
There's a guy in Ssangmundong we call
Park Nam Jung, who dances really well.

276
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,523
You probably saw him
at the ddukbokki place last time.

277
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,891
The one who had glasses on.

278
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,027
Oh. That guy.

279
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:41,230
He got first place once doing a
Park Nam Jung dance number.

280
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:42,565
It was this one.

281
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:50,005
My dreams, which have been
broken into small pieces...

282
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,280
They scatter far, far away
into the sky...

283
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:08,524
Darn it!

284
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,326
I told you, it's a Sobangcha song!

285
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,127
Who dances to Sobangcha songs anymore?

286
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,362
Everyone!

287
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,898
Come on. Stop messing around
and do "About Last Night."

288
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,468
That's way too basic. There isn't
anyone who can't dance to that!

289
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,706
Hey. Can you guys do it?

290
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:26,875
Us?

291
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,090
Darn it.

292
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,096
How many months
have you been at it, already?

293
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,165
I bet my dog would dance better than you
if it'd been practicing for three months.

294
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,601
Hey. We got first place
with this dance last year.

295
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,737
He does this dance
better than Dong Young does.

296
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,139
Geez... stop it. It's not like
that's anything impressive.

297
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,907
Go ahead and dance to it. I'll watch.

298
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,076
Yeah. Let's see how well you can do it.

299
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,646
If you shut him up, I'll dance.

300
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,280
Don't you say a word! Got it?

301
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,182
I can't even laugh?

302
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,384
No. Just go to sleep.

303
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,619
Satisfied? Dance now. I'll watch.

304
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:21,664
No!

305
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,033
Geez. So annoying.

306
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,036
Good! Keep going!

307
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,043
OK, let's go.

308
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:40,780
One, two, three, four. Five,
six, seven... hey. No.

309
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,284
What are you doing?

310
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:43,719
Geez...

311
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,868
Am I that bad? I didn't
get any of it down?

312
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,870
Not a single move!

313
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,406
Geez! You got everything wrong!

314
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,541
Shut it!

315
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,610
Sun Woo, was it weird?
Did I get a lot wrong?

316
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,512
Yeah. I don't think
dancing is your thing.

317
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,214
It's not like she's good at
anything else.

318
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:13,982
Duk Seon.

319
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,418
We'll save money and
just buy you a MyMy.

320
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,322
No... ask Taek to buy you one.
I feel like I'm going to die.

321
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,392
No, Let's open the door. It's hot.

322
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,662
Oh... my God. You scared me.

323
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,098
You're home and you're still
playing Baduk?

324
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Geez.

325
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,835
Taek! You should have said something
if you came home!

326
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,738
I've been craving ramyun
since a while ago.

327
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,507
Taek! Five ramyuns!

328
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,376
Hey, hey, hey! I'll make it!

329
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,111
Anyway, you don't know how to make it.

330
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:02,197
Hey, Il Hwa! Dong Il's here!
You know, your husband!

331
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,467
What the hell is that ruckus all about?

332
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,539
You went and bought something again.

333
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,209
Your hubby, Dong Il is here.

334
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:16,078
What the hell did you buy this time?

335
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:22,280
Ta-da!

336
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:36,432
There are so many unfortunate people
living in this world.

337
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:41,470
Remember, the person who
got us insurance last summer?

338
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:44,106
You know, Dang Soo's cousin's
daughter's hometown friend.

339
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,780
She lost her husband at such a young age

340
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,180
and is raising a baby boy
that's about Jin Joo's age

341
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,082
and is suffering so much.

342
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:57,186
After hearing that,
I started to cry.

343
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,190
What is that?

344
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:06,795
Can't you tell by looking at it?
Pre-natal... you know...

345
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:10,466
Why? You want to have another kid even
though we're already having a hard time?

346
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,930
No... if she just sold one of these
she'd be able to have dinner, at least.

347
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,103
How could I ignore her, hearing that?

348
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:17,940
And on top of that, she's Dang Soo's
cousin's daughter's hometown friend!

349
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,744
-It's not like she's a stranger!
-She is a stranger!

350
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:26,548
Come to your darn senses, already!
I can't live like this anymore!

351
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,230
Seoul is in shock after hearing
the news of the 12 convicts

352
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,025
who were to receive sentences
in the countryside, but fled.

353
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,928
Citizens are troubled by the fact
that they are on the run

354
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:41,930
and that they may commit more crimes.

355
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:46,401
But to day, the authorities apprehended
Kim Dong Yeon, who had escaped.

356
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,710
Geez. What a world we live in...

357
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,210
I'm going to rip that up!

358
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,710
It's still wearable!

359
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,219
It doesn't have any holes or anything.

360
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:06,955
Who wears tanktops
until they get holes nowadays?

361
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,724
Throw that away immediately!

362
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,710
Do you know what
the scariest thing in the world is?

363
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:16,965
The fact that someone who has nothing
is trying to help others.

364
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,700
We're not well off enough
to be helping others!

365
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,210
Geez... you're always like this
about money!

366
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,210
-Have you gone mad?
-Oh my God.

367
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,210
Am I the one who is weird
in this situation?

368
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,010
Ask anyone.

369
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:30,810
Is the guy who has nothing who gives all
he has to other people the normal one

370
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,710
or is the one who's trying to feed
and raise her kids?

371
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,210
What's wrong with living in
this basement room, anyway?

372
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:37,920
What did you say?

373
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,210
It's cold in the summer and
warm in the winter, so it's great!

374
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,210
Oh! Fine!

375
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,828
If you're nice and cool,
live like this forever yourself.

376
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:48,710
I can't live like this anymore!

377
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,369
Also... do you even know about
Duk Seon's overnight trip?

378
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,140
How are we going to pay for that
with no money?

379
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,411
We have to give her 20,000 won for that

380
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:05,710
but we only have 30,000 left
for the rest of this month!

381
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,383
What the hell are you going to
do about this? Tell me!

382
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,554
Geez... keep it short, already!

383
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:15,424
Where the hell are you going?

384
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,124
Where else?

385
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:19,294
To borrow money from Dang Soo's
cousin's daughter's hometown friend!

386
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,364
Oh, good...

387
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:58,867
Hey.

388
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:08,176
You guys are going on
an overnight trip tomorrow?

389
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,513
You remembered that?

390
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,885
I got this from your bag, Sun Woo.

391
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:18,520
We didn't have anything
to put the pot on.

392
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,421
That's fine.

393
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,856
Gyeongju?

394
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:22,791
Your school, too?

395
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,393
Yeah. We're going
to Gyeongju, too.

396
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:31,710
You're kind of jealous, right? That's
why I told you not to quit school.

397
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,568
Who cares about quarterfinals?

398
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,871
Jung Hwan.

399
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,539
Taek made 200 million won last year.

400
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:43,311
Even so, he'd probably
want to come to Gyeongju.

401
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:44,846
You've never been there, right?

402
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:45,981
Yeah.

403
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,518
Taek. Where's your
match tomorrow, again?

404
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,186
Tokyo.

405
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,651
Madam! I brought some potatoes.
You're not asleep yet, right?

406
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,619
Oh, come on in!

407
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:33,795
Prenatal music tapes? Wow.

408
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:41,136
Geez. Who understands
how I feel right now?

409
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,905
Because of that, we had a huge fight.

410
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,275
Even thought he has no money,
he's the neighborhood philanthropist.

411
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,878
What can you do about the fact
that he's a good person?

412
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,980
I guess he felt really bad.

413
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,984
But he doesn't feel bad for his
own kids? Geez. So pathetic.

414
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,154
Even so, you're better off than me.

415
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,710
My husband still can't overcome
the mentality he had when he was poor.

416
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,526
Even if we have money, we can't use any.

417
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,829
It can't be helped.

418
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,710
He's the one who was the worst off among
any of us in the neighborhood long ago.

419
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,670
It's not like he could forget
about living in poverty overnight.

420
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,941
I mean, if he'd already lived
like a poor man once

421
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,977
he should learn how to spend money now.

422
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,710
I'm so embarrassed by what other people
might think.

423
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,950
I'm sure he'll change, little by little.

424
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,954
He acquired that wealth overnight

425
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,956
so you can't expect him
to change that quickly.

426
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,194
Even so, you're the one
I'm most jealous of.

427
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,832
Wow... I wonder if I'll ever get to live
without worrying about money.

428
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,710
But, at any rate...
what brings you here so late?

429
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:56,244
Oh, that is...
It's...

430
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:57,679
What is it?

431
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:00,649
We're close enough that you should feel
comfortable asking me about anything.

432
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:04,210
Geez... I'm always indebted to you...

433
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,210
Madam. Can I...

434
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,256
It's because of the money
you borrowed before, right?

435
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,993
Geez.
It's fine! Give it to me next time.

436
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,328
You can pay me back slowly.

437
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,697
Money is no object for me, you know.

438
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,105
Geez. No need to worry so much.

439
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:50,732
What are you doing?

440
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,903
Oh... nothing. Nothing.

441
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:56,605
Is that money?

442
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,876
It's for school.
Money that was collected at school.

443
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,515
You sure collected a
lot from your class.

444
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:09,985
You guys really must have
more than 70 kids in your class, huh?

445
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,210
Yeah.

446
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,822
Hey, be careful with that.

447
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:16,057
I heard about another kid
who got school funds stolen from him.

448
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:19,561
Oh... really? Yeah,
I'll be careful.

449
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,329
Go ahead and sleep, Duk Seon.

450
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,199
-I want to get some air.
-OK.

451
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:30,805
What?

452
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:35,710
Your big sister is going on
an overnight trip tomorrow!

453
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,544
Stop messing around and go to sleep.

454
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:10,710
Go ahead and sleep.

455
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,914
I'll give you five minutes
until I turn off the lights.

456
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:14,783
Five minutes, my ass.

457
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,353
I don't know what I'll do
after the five minute mark.

458
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,210
Do you know how
the steel was tempered?

459
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm not talking about what happened in the
book. I'm talking about in real life.

460
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,210
You won't learn until you have
the crap beaten out of you, will you?

461
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,210
What the hell are you talking about?

462
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:45,981
Hey.

463
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,817
I told you to stop messing around
and to go to sleep, right?

464
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,285
Darn!

465
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:51,619
Stop messing around!

466
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:52,710
Mom!

467
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:54,856
Geez!

468
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,998
Geez... so noisy.

469
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:07,710
Bo Ra's mother!

470
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,372
Bo Ra's mother, are you sleeping?

471
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,975
Can you come out for a second?

472
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:26,021
Madam.

473
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,710
What brings you here so late?

474
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,025
My husband's family sent me some corn.

475
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,993
Geez... really?

476
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,361
I'll bet they're delicious.

477
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:34,996
I'll be going now. Go to sleep.

478
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,465
OK. Bye, Madam.

479
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,710
Duk Seon is going on the overnight trip
tomorrow, too, right?

480
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:04,192
Supplement her allowance with this.
Jung Bong's Mom.

481
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,710
Darn it...

482
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,053
Here.

483
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:34,656
Promise me.

484
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:40,962
You promised. That you won't lose it,
no matter what.

485
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,710
If you do lose it,
by any chance...

486
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:47,502
I'll disown you. I might even kill you.

487
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:51,106
If you flounce around and lose it
just watch.

488
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:53,210
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

489
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,210
I won't lose it, no matter what.

490
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,246
What about film?
Dad, give me some film.

491
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,851
I have a bad feeling about this...

492
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,124
I got you a pack of 36, so...

493
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:13,710
so don't you get trigger
happy, you hear?

494
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,332
I won't! Don't worry!

495
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:18,533
Oh...

496
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,935
Carefully. Carefully. Like this.

497
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:22,710
Does this have any film inside?

498
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,205
Should I check to see
if it really works?

499
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,018
Hey!

500
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:40,710
Do you have a death wish?

501
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,856
I'm off!

502
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:45,760
Geez... she's so happy.

503
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,098
Of course she is.
It's her first overnight trip.

504
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,599
I'm sure that, on a day like this

505
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,710
she'd be smiling even if she was
getting beat up by her older sister.

506
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,473
I'm really off now!
Look forward to your souvenirs!

507
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,243
OK. Hey! Duk Seon!
Don't forget the kimbap!

508
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,344
Oh, yeah.

509
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,254
Jin Joo. Your older brother
will be going now, OK?

510
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,524
-I'm off!
-Have a safe trip!

511
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,210
Let's eat.

512
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:55,456
Yes.

513
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,290
-Hey, Duk Seon!
-Yeah?

514
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,525
Give me your camera. We have to take a
photo before we get on the bus.

515
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:06,627
-OK.
-Wow... how nice.

516
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:10,498
-It's my first time in Jeollado.
-This is Kyungsangdo.

517
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,668
Is that really that important?

518
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:20,508
What are you looking for?

519
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,478
Are you looking for your camera?

520
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,080
No way.

521
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:43,097
I want to go back!

522
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,925
Go buy yourself a new jacket.

523
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,294
This is a new one, though.

524
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:14,862
I could probably wear this
for ten more years.

525
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,465
Do you want to see me
at divorce court later, honey?

526
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:22,637
Don't buy a bunch of cheap ones.

527
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:25,910
Just buy one expensive, good-quality one
from a brand-name company.

528
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,941
Got it?

529
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,410
Duk Seon. It's OK.
These things happen.

530
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:46,910
That's our family treasure!
My mom might kill me!

531
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,410
Teacher... can I just go home now?

532
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:55,610
I don't think I'll be able to have fun
because I'm so scared!

533
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,076
Should I call your mother for you?

534
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,213
Really?

535
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:16,410
This is Sung Duk Seon's home, correct?

536
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,693
Hello, Ma'am!

537
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,695
I'm Duk Seon's homeroom teacher.

538
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,730
Yes.

539
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,000
Ma'am... actually...

540
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,670
Duk Seon left the camera
on the train.

541
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,205
What do we do?

542
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:34,542
Ma'am?

543
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,878
Ma'am...

544
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,447
Ma'am?

545
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:44,118
Yes. She's crying a lot.

546
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:47,588
An overnight trip is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

547
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:52,960
No... I can't make it one filled with
horror and despair for her.

548
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:55,963
That would really be too much.

549
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,701
Thank you, ma'am.

550
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,570
I'll put Duk Seon on the line.

551
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,604
Yes.

552
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,147
Mom...

553
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:19,410
Duk Seon. Oh... it's fine.
Just have a fun trip.

554
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,390
Really? Really, Mom?

555
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,126
Geez... of course! Really.

556
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,730
Don't worry about the camera,
and have a fun time with your friends.

557
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,866
Mom!

558
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:10,871
Oh, my...

559
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,717
Hey... maybe we should have picked
a Kim Hyun Chul song

560
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,985
instead of a Sobangcha song?

561
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,687
I think she's going to get first place.

562
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:02,023
You're the only one
we need to worry about!

563
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:04,125
You didn't forget the moves, right?

564
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:05,860
Hey, I could do this in my sleep.

565
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,967
But... what if we still
can't get first place?

566
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,469
I feel like you'd cry
if you didn't win the MyMy.

567
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:20,007
Hey. As long as you guy don't break your
arms or something, we'll win for sure.

568
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:21,442
Want to bet on it?

569
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,617
Hello?

570
00:44:30,317 --> 00:44:35,189
Oh... oh, hello, Teacher!
What is it...

571
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:39,593
Did... No Eul cause
some sort of trouble?

572
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:44,565
It's nothing major, but he was
caught running a "One-day business."

573
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:48,669
What? A "One-day business?"
What do you mean?

574
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:51,272
It's something that's popular
among kids nowadays.

575
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,107
They sell drinks and have meetings.

576
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:57,044
Things like that. Maybe he did it to
go on a trip with his girlfriend.

577
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,550
First, one of his parents will
have to come into school tomorrow.

578
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,590
Ah... yes, of course. I understand,
Teacher. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

579
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:21,502
Geez.

580
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:12,620
Why were you taking so long?

581
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,555
Hurry up so we can practice together!

582
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:21,228
What the hell are you eating?
Hurry up, already! All right?

583
00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:22,263
Geez...

584
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,410
-Which school are they from?
-Awesome.

585
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,047
It's Ssangmun High.
They're known to go all out.

586
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:42,716
I guess their talent show is today.

587
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,485
Why did they start so early?

588
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,221
Is a another school's talent show
really that important right now?

589
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,356
Our school's talent show is tomorrow!

590
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:50,858
When are we going to practice, already?

591
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,661
Hey, where are you going?

592
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:55,663
To the Boys' place.

593
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,598
-Are you out of your minds?
-We're off!

594
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:05,706
Hey!

595
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,410
-Hey!
-We're off!

596
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,744
-Hey!
-Bye!

597
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,073
Oh, MyMy.

598
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:45,746
The thing that our Duk Seon
likes more than anything is this MyMy.

599
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,410
Honey. Go to No Eul's school tomorrow.

600
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,588
Uh... what's that about, now?

601
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,726
No Eul got into trouble running
a one day cafe or something.

602
00:47:59,827 --> 00:48:03,631
Apparently, he was trying to save money
to go on a trip with his girlfriend.

603
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:07,001
Geez... I'm so humiliated
that I can't bear to go.

604
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,910
So... you go to his school tomorrow.

605
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:13,140
OK. I'll go. I'll go, already.

606
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:18,545
Also, you know, boys will be boys.
Things like that can happen.

607
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:22,249
It's not like he beat someone up
or stole money from people.

608
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:28,389
Geez... why are you so worried about
such small matters?

609
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,525
I don't get it.

610
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:42,136
Granny, give me all
your greens today, too.

611
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:48,208
And go home quickly. Quickly...
go home.

612
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,584
Did you really buy this?

613
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:01,410
Of course I did...
you think I stole it, or something?

614
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,558
How is it? Does it look good?

615
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,927
They said that this color
was the most popular.

616
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:12,032
Yeah. It's great. You look
like a brand new person.

617
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:15,069
How much did you pay for this?
It looks really expensive.

618
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,704
150,000 won.

619
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,673
It was originally 200,000 won,
but they gave me a 50,000 won discount.

620
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,042
It turns our that they were
my friend from a while back!

621
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,577
Really? Who?

622
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:26,714
I'll tell you. You know them. Just a
second. Let me take off this coat.

623
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:31,618
I guess it's because it's from
a brand name, but it's really warm!

624
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:34,722
I guess expensive clothes
are really...

625
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:38,910
Why is this?

626
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:41,862
What...

627
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:01,382
I guess, with this, you're supposed
to... take it off like this!

628
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,119
What friend? Tell me their name.

629
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:07,910
It wasn't my friend.
It was someone I met today.

630
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,157
I told you, tell me their name already!

631
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:14,194
How could a friend
scam their friend like this?

632
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,530
Are you an idiot? Are you a hobo?

633
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:20,410
How much of an idiot did he think
you were to sell you a dud?

634
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:30,910
Look at this here.

635
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,410
Why does the horse have six legs?

636
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:35,482
And what's this trident he's holding?

637
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,985
It doesn't look like it's
even be worth 10,000 won!

638
00:50:38,052 --> 00:50:39,753
But they charged 150,000 won
for this?

639
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:41,088
And for a fake, no less?

640
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,222
Geez.

641
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,827
This is that friend's way
of looking down on you!

642
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,597
It really wasn't a friend.
I made a mistake.

643
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:53,734
Are you taking their side
because it's your friend?

644
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:55,636
Who's this darned friend?

645
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,910
I told you, they're not my friend.

646
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,910
Who is it? You said that I know them!

647
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,742
Why can't you tell me?

648
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:03,577
Darn it!

649
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,046
That six legged... darn it!

650
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:12,986
Duk Seon.

651
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:16,390
The two of us will save money
and buy you a MyMy.

652
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,164
If I tell my dad,
he'll buy you one.

653
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,910
Shut it.

654
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:33,607
They said you can be discharged now.

655
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,310
Mi Ok. You can walk, right?

656
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:37,678
Yes.

657
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,181
You two... only stay at the
hostel from now on, all right?

658
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,910
You two are forbidden from leaving.

659
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,119
What about the talent show, Teacher?

660
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:47,554
They have to compete in the
talent show with me tomorrow!

661
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:51,625
Talent show, my ass.

662
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:53,160
In this state?

663
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:55,796
I heard you guys were doing
Sobangcha?

664
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:58,098
You want to ride
an ambulance one more time, instead?

665
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,702
No, Teacher!
I really have to compete!

666
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,837
So I'm saying,
how are they going to compete like this?

667
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:09,880
At any rate, I won't un-register you so
give it your all on your own, Duk Seon.

668
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:14,781
-All I have to do is be on stage, right?
-Why?

669
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,017
Are you going to sing a song,
or something?

670
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,171
OK. One, two, three!

671
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,172
Hey, where are you going?

672
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,609
Sun Woo. Come over
here for a second.

673
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:49,560
Yes.

674
00:53:55,082 --> 00:53:56,250
Hey, Kim Jung Hwan!

675
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,150
Hey!

676
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,170
What is that?

677
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,525
Hold onto this for us.
They're checking our bags soon.

678
00:54:05,692 --> 00:54:06,627
Are you out of your mind?

679
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:08,895
At 12:00 AM come to
the steel gates... all right?

680
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,432
If you don't come, you're dead,
and if you open that, you're dead.

681
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:15,235
And if you lose it,
you're definitely dead.

682
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:18,405
Hey! Kim Jung Hwan!

683
00:54:18,739 --> 00:54:20,974
Jung Hwan! Hey!

684
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,160
What are you doing?

685
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:30,584
Dong Ryong! I'm so glad to see you!

686
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:33,160
Wow...

687
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:41,660
Just this once....
save me this once. Please?

688
00:54:42,396 --> 00:54:45,332
Even so... how could I compete
in your school's talent show?

689
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,760
I heard that kids from your school
officially registered last year

690
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,903
for our talent show
and they were allowed to perform!

691
00:54:50,137 --> 00:54:52,660
They even got second place
and won Gyeongju Bread!

692
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:54,041
Even so, no.

693
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,660
Dong Ryong! Bring the rest of them.
Please?

694
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,160
Please? I need the MyMy!

695
00:55:00,347 --> 00:55:02,482
I said I can't. I'm allergic to girls.

696
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:12,526
Among my friends, there's a girl
we call Wang Jo Hyun.

697
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:19,660
Her real name is Wang Ja Hyun,
but she looks just like Joey Wang.

698
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,660
So we call her Joey Wang.

699
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:28,041
There's one more. We
call her Maggie Cheung.

700
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,332
How am I going to get
that jerk over there, though?

701
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:53,300
Who, Sun Woo?

702
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,635
He's the Student Council President,
so he won't want to cause any trouble.

703
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:00,006
He'll come. Sun Woo will come.

704
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,775
How do you know?

705
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,911
Tell him that I requested it.
Throw me under the bus.

706
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:06,260
What are you talking about?

707
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:10,384
-And tell Jung Hwan just one thing.
-What?

708
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,660
-"Something Special."
-What?

709
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:16,923
See you later. 9:00 PM at the metal
gates in front of the Kim Yu Shin Hostel!

710
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,893
All right.

711
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,361
Next up is...

712
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,431
"Tonight, Her Eyes are Scarier."

713
00:56:25,332 --> 00:56:29,660
Ssangmun Girls' High's very own
Choi Jin Ah!

714
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:49,289
I guess they're not coming.

715
00:56:51,057 --> 00:56:53,160
Duk Seon, just give it up.

716
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:55,160
If it were me, I'd be
too embarrassed to come, too.

717
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:00,867
They're here.

718
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:02,160
Over there.

719
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,311
Hey, hey, come back here. Hey!

720
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:16,516
The news casts a negative light on it

721
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:20,887
but honestly, there aren't any kids who
don't run "One-day cafes" nowadays.

722
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,558
We ask the parents to come in
as a formality

723
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:27,027
but honestly, you don't need to worry.

724
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,360
Even so, I'm truly sorry.

725
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,700
I'm going to get No Eul
and really teach him a lesson.

726
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,368
No, no. Don't do that, sir.

727
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:37,471
No Eul is a good kid.
And he does well academically...

728
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:41,508
Just please direct him well
so that this doesn't happen again.

729
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,976
Oh, also...

730
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:48,548
since it's the rules, he'll be cleaning
bathrooms for the next 10 days.

731
00:57:48,982 --> 00:57:50,860
Please don't be too upset about that.

732
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:53,360
Oh, geez. Merely that won't suffice.

733
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,360
Make him clean up after
everyone's poop or something.

734
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,427
It's about time for No Eul
to be finished with cleaning.

735
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:02,195
Please go home with him, sir.

736
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:05,432
-Oh, Teacher... I'm so sorry.
-No, it's fine.

737
00:58:05,532 --> 00:58:07,200
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine, really.

738
00:58:13,306 --> 00:58:14,007
Dad!

739
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,860
Dad, I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

740
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,678
OK? I promise.

741
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:20,046
Please let me off the hook
this once.

742
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,215
You idiot!

743
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,119
Boys will be boys! Things happen!

744
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:27,587
What are you apologizing for?

745
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:36,296
It's fine! Relax your shoulders!
My darling child.

746
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:42,435
Here. I caught a few goldfish
for my good son to eat.

747
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:44,504
I already got all the bones out.

748
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:49,609
-Dad.
-No, it's OK.

749
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,818
Anyway... about those kids who run
the "One-day cafe" with you...

750
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:01,388
Are you guys really close?

751
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:02,556
Sung No Eul!

752
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,926
Yeah. I've been friends with
them since middle school.

753
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,128
I'm sure you know them too.

754
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Tae Joo and Hong.

755
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,597
-Oh yeah.
-No Eul!

756
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:13,266
Wow... you're still
hanging out with them?

757
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:16,136
Yeah. We're in different classes
but we see each other every day.

758
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:18,638
We eat lunch together, too.
And play soccer together.

759
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,707
And sometimes study together, too.

760
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:25,779
Oh yeah. Your mother must be waiting.
Let's go.

761
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:26,947
-OK.
-Hey!

762
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:27,881
Hey, Basement Room!

763
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:30,884
Basement Room!

764
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:32,285
Wait!

765
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,155
-Hello.
-Hello.

766
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,957
-Come over here.
-What the hell?

767
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,459
Dad. Just a moment.

768
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,398
-What are you eating?
-Want one?

769
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:47,000
My dad bought these goldfish breads.

770
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,439
You're supposed to
eat these from the tail.

771
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,225
All right...
this is the last act for tonight.

772
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:20,860
I'll read exactly as it says
on this.

773
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,569
Contestant Number 10!

774
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:27,860
From Ssangmun High School,
"About Last Night" by Sobangcha!

775
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:06,860
Sobangcha! Sobangcha!

776
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:52,860
Sobangcha! Sobangcha!

777
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,172
Hey, we're leaving now.

778
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,174
OK. Thanks, Sun Woo!

779
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,009
You were the best!
You're really the best.

780
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:16,810
You're that happy?

781
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,478
You're probably going to get it taken
by Bo Ra anyway.

782
01:03:18,645 --> 01:03:20,814
Are you crazy?
Don't you dare tell anyone.

783
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:23,616
Duk Seon.

784
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,218
We have something to discuss, right?

785
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:30,023
Guys, say hi.
These are my friends.

786
01:03:32,992 --> 01:03:34,360
-Hello.
-Hello.

787
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:38,865
This is Jang Mi Ok,
who we call Maggie Cheung.

788
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:41,701
Yes... hello.

789
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:44,704
And this is Wang Ja Hyun,
who we call Joey Wang.

790
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:45,972
Hello.

791
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,774
Hello.

792
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,043
What's your nickname then,
Duk Seon?

793
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:50,743
Me?

794
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:51,644
Lee Mi Yeon.

795
01:03:51,778 --> 01:03:53,213
-Oh.
-Want to be slapped?

796
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:56,549
How could you defile the name
of Lee Mi Yeon like that?

797
01:03:58,484 --> 01:03:59,986
You saw each other at
the ddukbokki place, right?

798
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:01,621
It's OK to use informal speech.
We're all the same age.

799
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:02,722
Shall we, then?

800
01:04:03,556 --> 01:04:06,459
Hey. You were really
great at dancing.

801
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:07,493
The best!

802
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,497
Uh... no... I can't dance, ma'am.

803
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:13,766
What are you talking about?
It's OK, use informal speech.

804
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,568
You're "Park Nam Jung,"
right?

805
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,536
Hey.

806
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:18,938
You dance a lot better
than Park Nam Jung.

807
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:23,860
Oh, geez...
you've made a mistake. I apologize.

808
01:04:25,044 --> 01:04:26,613
I think it's time we went.
Hey guys, let's go.

809
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,282
Duk Seon. You know that we have
something to discuss later, right?

810
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:32,018
Then... we must go. Guys, let's go.

811
01:04:35,188 --> 01:04:36,656
Hey, Duk Seon,
come here for a second.

812
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:38,360
-Hey, talk on the way.
-Me?

813
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:45,698
How the hell is she Joey Wang?

814
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:48,534
Hey, but... we're really late
so we're probably going to get caught.

815
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,870
And what was with
so-called "Maggie Cheung?"

816
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:51,871
Whatever!

817
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,107
-Hurry up and hand it over.
-What?

818
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:57,443
-My liquor!
-Oh... yeah.

819
01:04:59,078 --> 01:04:59,779
Hey.

820
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,216
The liquor... I definitely
had it this afternoon...

821
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,519
I did have it until then...

822
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,756
See you later.

823
01:05:09,856 --> 01:05:11,724
At the gates in front of
the Kim Yu Shin Hostel!

824
01:05:14,193 --> 01:05:15,628
I think they're getting on the bus.

825
01:05:15,962 --> 01:05:17,230
Oh no! I'm off!

826
01:05:17,363 --> 01:05:18,631
Hey, wait up!

827
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:42,322
Darn it!

828
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:46,360
I was the crazy jerk
for leaving it with you!

829
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,194
It's the dean! Run!

830
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:51,030
Isn't that Dong Ryong's dad?

831
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:52,065
Teacher!

832
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,733
Dong Ryong's father!

833
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:56,202
Are you out of your darn mind?

834
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,173
Stop right there, jerks!
You're not stopping?

835
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,860
Stop right there, or I'll kill you!

836
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,460
You're dead, you jerks!

837
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,030
You jerks... hey!

838
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,040
You jerks!

839
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,209
Hey!

840
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,978
Good going, jerks!
You're in for a hefty punishment!

841
01:06:39,012 --> 01:06:43,783
That's what you get! Stay right there!

842
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,351
Hey, are you OK?

843
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:51,524
Darn... how is he so fast?

844
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:52,759
Sun Woo.

845
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:56,029
Do you have a blunt object?

846
01:06:57,163 --> 01:06:58,197
Why?

847
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,801
Can you knock me out?

848
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,357
-Hey, breathe a bit quieter!
-Hush!

849
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:49,549
Let's hurry it up and go.
Go... It hurts, right?

850
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:50,950
Let's go, you jerk.

851
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,320
-You jerk...
-I'm sorry!

852
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,015
Where's that last one?

853
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,085
He should be here somewhere...

854
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:27,053
Jung Hwan.

855
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,622
Where did you go?

856
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,958
This jerk...

857
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:07,580
Dad!

858
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:13,820
Dad. Mom says to hurry up and come home.
Let's go.

859
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,387
OK?

860
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:20,826
OK. Just finish that, and come. OK?
I'll be waiting until you come home!

861
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,665
Take this and go home first.

862
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,606
I'm sorry.

863
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:53,726
You didn't get it
exchanged today, either?

864
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:02,501
You better get this exchanged tomorrow.
Got it, honey?

865
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:07,373
I bought it from a friend,
so how could I ask them to exchange it?

866
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,041
I'll just wear it.

867
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:15,414
Friend? Friend, my ass. How could you
call that jerk a friend?

868
01:12:24,457 --> 01:12:26,692
What kind of friend does that?

869
01:12:27,026 --> 01:12:29,628
Why are all your friends like that?

870
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,864
Geez.

871
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,568
After they heard we became better off,
they all came asking for money.

872
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:39,638
And when we didn't even have a single
briquette, they didn't even call.

873
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:45,444
But, what does
he do nowadays?

874
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,947
You know, when Jung Bong
was about this big

875
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,820
and he caught a cold
but we had no money for medicine

876
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,550
so we were borrowing money
left and right...

877
01:12:52,318 --> 01:12:54,320
you know, your friend
from your hometown.

878
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,588
The one who came to Seoul with you.

879
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:57,723
Geez.

880
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:02,027
He came by suddenly,
and... did he have soju with you then?

881
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:03,529
Geez.

882
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:06,031
I thought that he really
had no common sense.

883
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:09,001
A guest in a dilapidated home?

884
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:11,704
That's what I thought, but...

885
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:16,820
he gave me 50,000 won
secretly on the way out

886
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,879
telling me to buy
something delicious for the kids.

887
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,382
Even though he was in dire straits, too.

888
01:13:26,218 --> 01:13:30,189
Back then, with 50,000 won...
geez.

889
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,526
Back then, that friend of yours
seemed like God himself.

890
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:35,094
Our savior.

891
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,867
Have more of those friends.

892
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,471
Instead of having bad friends
who hurt you.

893
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:48,974
OK?

894
01:13:50,443 --> 01:13:52,320
Give him a call!

895
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,282
That's him.

896
01:14:00,252 --> 01:14:03,789
He's... the one.

897
01:15:01,614 --> 01:15:02,848
No thanks.

898
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:17,663
Ma'am. Give it here.

899
01:15:24,236 --> 01:15:28,841
Today's the last time.

900
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:33,345
I can't help you out anymore.

901
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:42,121
Yes, yes. Go home.

902
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,410
It was a shocking Sunday morning.

903
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,749
The four convicts who escaped
were caught at a home of a hostage.

904
01:16:44,283 --> 01:16:47,620
Unfortunately, this hostage situation
ended in bloodshed.

905
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,090
The escapees had final words to say.

906
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,459
"The rich are innocent,
and the poor are guilty."

907
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:55,320
If one has money,
one is blameless

908
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,162
and if one has no money,
one bears blame.

909
01:16:57,496 --> 01:16:59,965
This incident shows the
shortcomings of our society...

910
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:06,171
Oh dear. Geez. How pitiful.

911
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:08,874
What's so pitiful about them?

912
01:17:09,274 --> 01:17:13,445
Did they just figure that out?

913
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,820
Mom! Dad! I'm back!

914
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,284
Ta-da!
A present!

915
01:17:20,019 --> 01:17:22,054
You little... where
did I put the switch?

916
01:17:22,154 --> 01:17:24,820
How dare you lose that?
You know how expensive it was?

917
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,128
Hey!

918
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,320
I'm sorry, Mom! Forgive me!

919
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,673
Just where do you keep your brain?

920
01:17:40,673 --> 01:17:42,820
How could you be so absentminded?

921
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,043
I'm sorry!

922
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:48,820
Stop right there!

923
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,617
Mom, I thought you said it was OK!
Why are you so mad?

924
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:53,652
Then, what was I supposed to say
in front of your teacher?

925
01:17:53,652 --> 01:17:55,020
I'm going to beat you to death!

926
01:17:55,154 --> 01:17:58,490
Stop hiding behind him!
Jung Hwan, move!

927
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,625
Move!

928
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:03,262
Can't you just buy another one?

929
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:06,165
Ma'am, please calm down.

930
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:09,635
Jung Hwan, move.
I'm going to beat her to death today.

931
01:18:09,702 --> 01:18:11,403
-Move!
-Mom!

932
01:18:11,403 --> 01:18:13,320
I'm so sorry!
I won't do that again!

933
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:19,211
"Again," my ass!
Get over here!

934
01:18:31,356 --> 01:18:32,291
Darn it!

935
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,093
I can't live like this.

936
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,595
Who did she take after
to be like that?

937
01:18:36,695 --> 01:18:38,464
Geez... you know how
expensive that was?

938
01:18:40,599 --> 01:18:44,820
My treasure... oh, my treasure.

939
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,473
At this rate, you'll kill her over it.

940
01:18:47,506 --> 01:18:50,320
We can just buy a new camera.

941
01:18:50,576 --> 01:18:54,346
You beat her that much
just because she lost that?

942
01:18:54,546 --> 01:18:56,315
This is all your fault.

943
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,351
If only you earned a lot of money...

944
01:18:59,885 --> 01:19:02,554
do you think I would have
beat her like that, then?

945
01:19:03,255 --> 01:19:04,990
Even if you hadn't
become riddled with debt

946
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:07,192
we'd be living like the folks upstairs.

947
01:19:07,259 --> 01:19:10,529
If only I had money, I could've
been such a better mom for the kids.

948
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:13,932
This is all because
we don't have any money!

949
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,101
This is all your fault!

950
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:21,607
Where are you going?

951
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:23,675
To go earn some money.

952
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:27,146
I thought you wanted to
live like the folks upstairs.

953
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:30,916
So I'm going to acquire me
some sudden wealth, too.

954
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:36,820
Don't buy it! It's a waste of money!

955
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:40,292
You think just anyone has
that kind of luck?

956
01:19:42,961 --> 01:19:43,862
Darn it...

957
01:19:47,299 --> 01:19:48,320
Geez!

958
01:19:56,175 --> 01:20:00,145
MAY 1985, THREE YEARS AGO.

959
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,999
It's a new side dish!

960
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:24,320
Looks yummy. Wow, there's even
tofu in there!

961
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,637
Is today a special day?

962
01:20:29,975 --> 01:20:31,577
Hurry up and eat while
I'm still saying it nicely.

963
01:20:32,644 --> 01:20:33,820
Yes, Mother.

964
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:36,114
Jung Bong.

965
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:37,916
What are you collecting lately?

966
01:20:40,686 --> 01:20:44,189
I'm sure everyone remembers.

967
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:45,357
Yeah?

968
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,593
In 1981, on September 30...

969
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:51,964
Some great news reached us from a small
city in Germany called Baden Baden.

970
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,401
The one who won the bid
for 1988 Olympics was...

971
01:20:57,502 --> 01:20:58,203
Seoul!

972
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,009
He's interested in collecting lottery.

973
01:21:04,309 --> 01:21:05,310
The Olympic lottery tickets.

974
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:10,482
Mother, I only buy one at a time.

975
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,652
It's only 500 won for one...

976
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,088
You think 500 won is a small amount?

977
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,323
You can buy three charcoal
briquettes with that!

978
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:20,820
They're doing it now.

979
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:23,528
Let's see who will get first place.

980
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,820
I'll only watch this
until the end, Mother...

981
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:31,270
OK, we'll draw the numbers now.
Let's go!

982
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,175
From Group One to Group Five...
OK.

983
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:45,350
The numbers we'll be drawing for
is for Group Four.

984
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,719
Group Four. Next.

985
01:21:50,522 --> 01:21:55,494
Ten. So, one and zero.

986
01:21:57,095 --> 01:22:00,799
Next, we have... two.

987
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,203
So far, we have 102.
What will be next?

988
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:09,574
Next up is three.

989
01:22:11,944 --> 01:22:15,080
OK. Now, for the last two numbers.

990
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,822
The next number is six.

991
01:22:25,924 --> 01:22:27,492
Now, the last number.

992
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,996
The last number...

993
01:22:32,097 --> 01:22:33,031
No way will it be three...

994
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,833
is three!

995
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:46,611
Congratulations!
Group 4, 102363.

996
01:22:46,945 --> 01:22:50,682
Group 4, 102363.

997
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,952
You've won the grand prize.

998
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:56,788
My mother wanted you
to have some rice cakes.

999
01:23:00,592 --> 01:23:01,820
Dong Ryong.

1000
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,963
We're moving.

1001
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,320
Jung Bong!

1002
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,314
I'm going to college.

1003
01:23:56,648 --> 01:23:57,716
Tutor me, too.

1004
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,484
Can you even memorize it?

1005
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,386
Of course I can!
What do you take me for?

1006
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,855
Geez, I can't even get a word out!

1007
01:24:03,989 --> 01:24:05,924
What nonsense.

1008
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:09,720
Every time I try to say something,
you're always trying to shut me up.

1009
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,329
Hurry and come here. Let's eat together.

1010
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,936
Would you like some juice?

1011
01:24:18,437 --> 01:24:19,671
You have it.

1012
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,808
Father.

1013
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:45,420
You can just eat that
grain of rice stuck to your face.

1014
01:24:45,897 --> 01:24:46,720
You idiot.

1015
01:24:46,898 --> 01:24:47,632
Geez. Bye.

1016
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,205
Hey, Dong Ryong.

1017
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,440
Why do you think I'm acting this way?

1018
01:24:56,908 --> 01:24:58,076
What am I supposed to do?

1019
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,513
What are you doing?

1020
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:03,281
Were you waiting for me?
