each other before coming here?

163
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,385
We always come
and eat on our own.

164
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,261
And your cheeks are all red,
like some country hicks.

165
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,477
-You're Aurora from "A Dog of Flanders?"
-You're Nello, then?

166
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:14,422
-You look like a country bumpkin!
-Country bumpkin? Excuse me?

167
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,958
-Hey, Kukudas Cookie!
-What did you call me?

168
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,285
Stop it, you
country-bumpkin-Kukudas-cookies!

169
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:22,424
Hey, when are we going to mentally
graduate from Ssangmun Kindergarten?

170
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:24,202
Duk Seon.

171
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:28,547
Speaking of your cheeks
are really red. Seriously!

172
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:29,878
See?

173
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:33,287
Hey, it's because I came
from the cold and into this warm room!

174
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:34,986
It won't last that long!

175
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,548
Geez, you...

176
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:40,120
Duk Seon. Want me to make you a ramen?
It won't take that long.

177
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:43,074
No, it's OK.
I'm fine with this.

178
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,657
But why does Taek have to play
five rounds on his own?

179
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,221
It's because they're consecutive.

180
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,836
Hey... you think she understands
what you're saying?

181
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:54,491
All of the Korean players lost
and he's the only one left...

182
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,501
...but China has three,
while Japan has two.

183
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:59,570
But he'll have to win today
to keep going.

184
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,920
But I think it'll be hard
for our Taek this time around.

185
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,275
How can he beat them all
on his own?

186
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,373
He doesn't seem to be
in a good state either.

187
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,335
Hey, Dong Ryong.

188
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:12,805
Worry about yourself.

189
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:16,134
Have you ever even seen him play?

190
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,662
And what about you,
Nello and Aurora?

191
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,712
He's on a different level than us,
is what I'm trying to say.

192
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:29,521
You idiots from the Forsythia class
at Ssangmun Kindergarten.

193
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,612
OK?

194
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:33,008
Jerk.

195
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Yes?

196
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:23,373
Yes.

197
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:00,630
My shoulder.

198
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,521
-You're so warm. How nice.
-Get away from me.

199
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,410
But I'm so cold.

200
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,938
My body and heart
are so cold lately.

201
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,270
On this starry night...

202
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,443
Hello, everyone.

203
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,477
I'm Lee Moon Sae.

204
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,548
It's gotten very windy outside.

205
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,253
If, by any chance, you're
with someone you love right now...

206
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:36,785
...why not use the harsh winds
as an excuse to gently lean on them?

207
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,974
Into the embrace of your loved one,
which is warmer than anything else.

208
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:44,421
I'm sure they'll hold you tight.

209
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,818
Oh yeah.
Jung Hwan.

210
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:51,087
There's not much time before
Jung Bong's college exams, right?

211
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,825
Are his studies going well?

212
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,841
Do you know what
my Big Bro's favorite number is?

213
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,317
What?

214
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,827
Lucky seven.

215
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:03,357
I think he's going to make a mistake.

216
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,733
He's busy writing postcards lately.

217
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:10,100
What postcards?

218
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:11,300
To who?

219
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,198
This is today's first story.

220
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,209
Hello, Mr. Moon Sae.
I'm Kim Jung Bong from Ssangmundong.

221
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:22,784
It's been three years since I first
started listening to your program.

222
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:25,456
I'm a student who is about to retake
the college entrance exams again.

223
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:26,236
Yes!

224
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:29,120
Your voice and the great songs you play
are a great source of comfort...

225
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:32,796
...and strength to me,
someone who is worn out from studying.

226
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:37,736
If I make it into college this time,
it'll all be thanks to "Starry Night."

227
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:38,899
Mr. Moon Sae...

228
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,909
Why does he call him mister
even though Jung Bong looks older?

229
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:45,936
I send postcards to them all the time...
I wonder why they never read mine?

230
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,455
Hey, shush.
Let's listen.

231
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,593
I'm sure it's hard for you
to believe, but...

232
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,626
...do you know who lives on my block?

233
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:57,046
It's the genius Baduk player,
Choi Taek!

234
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:02,505
Choi Taek, 6-dan and I
are quite close.

235
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:07,032
But you know, Mr. Moon Sae,
Taek is having a difficult time...

236
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:09,455
...because he's competing
in a huge competition.

237
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:13,808
Soon, he'll have his first match
in Shanghai, China...

238
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:17,818
...and his opponents
all have an IQ of 160!

239
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,411
My IQ is lower than 90.

240
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,229
Jung Bong...

241
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,602
...it seems that you've revealed your IQ
to the entire country.

242
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,073
Oh, dear.

243
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:37,083
Mr. Moon Sae, please cheer on our Taek
so he can beat his brainy opponents.

244
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:41,547
Since China is such a big country,
I'm sure he'll need a lot of support.

245
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:46,477
Honestly, I'm a Buddhist
but I'll be praying for his success.

246
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,792
But, what do we do,
Mr. Kim Jung Bong?

247
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,996
We get at least 50 postcards
from people who say...

248
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,337
that they live on the same block
as Choi Taek.

249
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:03,634
So... next time, include a photo
you took with Choi Taek.

250
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:06,276
We need some means of confirmation.

251
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,310
Even so, we'll have to give you a gift.

252
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,488
To you, Mr. Kim Jung Bong
of Ssangmundong...

253
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,507
...we'll give you the third place prize.
A Cabbage Patch Kids doll!

254
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,157
We'd love to have Choi Taek
on our show sometime.

255
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,365
That'd be nice... right?

256
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,634
Oh, we also have some news
that just came in.

257
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:34,482
Choi Taek, 6-dan, defeated
that IQ-of-160 Chinese player!

258
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,024
Wow, how amazing.

259
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:45,086
For Choi Taek, 6-dan,
who was victorious in a lonely battle...

260
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,189
With well wishes sent his way, saying
that today will be a special day...

261
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:52,361
-We'll play One Day's...
-On That Kind of Day!

262
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:55,015
"On That Kind of Day."

263
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,380
Give me some room.

264
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:04,379
Hey, give me some of the blanket!

265
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,463
Fine.

266
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,627
Keep still.

267
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,900
Hey, hey, hey!
Stay still!

268
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,069
-I'm off.
-OK, bye.

269
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,261
See you tomorrow.

270
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,206
How many more people does
Taek have to play now?

271
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:09,582
Four.

272
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:13,091
The Chinese have two people left
but all of them are really skilled.

273
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:14,102
Wow!

274
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,767
Do you think Taek can win?

275
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,719
I don't know. He has to keep it up.

276
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,337
It'd be nice if he won though, right?

277
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:22,199
Yeah. If he wins, we'll get pizza.

278
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:23,689
Yeah!

279
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:35,260
The second round of the 6th International
Baduk Championships will start soon.

280
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:39,363
Choi Taek, 6-dan's opponent today
is Japan's Jang Shuei, 9-dan.

281
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:42,713
He is a skilled Japanese player
who has won over 1,400 matches.

282
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:46,091
Japan stated that Korea
would lose today for sure...

283
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,602
Hi!

284
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,665
How many more does
he have to beat, now?

285
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:52,817
Four.

286
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,720
Wow... still four more left to go?

287
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,230
That'll be difficult.

288
00:21:57,944 --> 00:22:00,701
At any rate, if...

289
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:05,822
...Taek defeats both China and Japan,
you can't settle for chicken this time.

290
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,289
You know, that thing... Maotai
or Mueitai, or whatever...

291
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,584
that really expensive Chinese liquor.
You have to buy that for us, all right?

292
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:13,849
OK.

293
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:15,342
But...

294
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:17,352
I think it'll be difficult
for him this time.

295
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,036
He has matches every day...

296
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,277
...so it'll be hard on his health.

297
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,702
And on top of that,
he's in a slump lately.

298
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,061
I don't think it'll be possible
for him to be victorious.

299
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:32,140
Also, the remaining Chinese
and Japanese players ...

300
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,688
...are really good, so...

301
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:42,092
That's why I said, "If!"

302
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:44,046
If he wins...

303
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:46,536
...Maota or whatnot.
You know that thing, right?

304
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:52,381
Are you, by any chance... saying this
because you don't want to buy the liquor?

305
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:55,182
No, not at all!

306
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,840
It's just that...

307
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,189
...he doesn't even get one day off
in between matches...

308
00:23:02,537 --> 00:23:06,067
...and my Taek wasn't in such a good state
before this championship.

309
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,577
So his mental state isn't great.

310
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:14,547
So... whether or not he wins all depends
on how he overcomes these burdens.

311
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,203
Second Match

312
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:30,204
Korea's Choi Taek, 6-dan,
vs. Japan's Jang Shuei, 9-dan

313
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,682
So you can make this kind of play
in this situation.

314
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:46,229
This is how you play.

315
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,205
Taek is amazing.

316
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:52,788
Should I make him my son-in-law?

317
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,339
My daughter...
daughter, daughter!

318
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:58,927
Oh, is that right?
Shall I try and seduce him for you, then?

319
00:23:58,975 --> 00:24:01,974
Yeah!
Go ahead and do that!

320
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,269
I'm sure he has no eye for women
since all he knows is Baduk anyway.

321
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,366
What? What's wrong with me?

322
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:10,377
I'm a catch!

323
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,661
What is this?
Where did you get this car?

324
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:30,970
It's my upperclassman's.

325
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,238
They're going away for a while
so I'm using it for a few months.

326
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:35,647
Oh dear...

327
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,080
That's dangerous!
You've never driven before!

328
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,790
It's fine!
I just need to take it easy.

329
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,659
What's with that jacket?

330
00:24:44,364 --> 00:24:47,304
I bought it by saving up my allowance.
So don't you pay any mind to it.

331
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,164
I'm wearing that jacket tomorrow.

332
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:51,785
Then I'm going to wear your dress.

333
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:53,295
The white, knee-length one.

334
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,806
Sure.

335
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,087
Wow, it's cold.
Let's go home. I'll make sujebi.

336
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:02,392
Get in!
We can take my car.

337
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,060
- No...
- We're almost home anyway!

338
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:05,348
It's cold!
Hurry up and get in!

339
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:08,549
-No! it's fine!
-It's right there!

340
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,519
Darn it!

341
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:14,571
-No! It's OK!
-Get in! It's cold!

342
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:16,131
Hurry up and get in!

343
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,750
-Oh, but...
-Hurry up and get in, Mom!

344
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:20,259
We have some great news
from Shanghai, China.

345
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,467
Choi Taek, 6-dan, defeated
Jang Shuei, 9-dan of Japan...

346
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:26,832
...in 245 moves.

347
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,843
Choi Taek, 6-dan
now has three matches left.

348
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:33,434
So, Korea is regaining the hope it had
lost in potentially winning it all.

349
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:36,573
Honey! I made some castella.
Come out and have some.

350
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:39,277
It's fine.
I don't want any.

351
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,165
OK. Study, then.

352
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,162
What, he said he doesn't want any?

353
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:46,182
Yeah.

354
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,332
Jung Bong!

355
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:49,475
Bonggie!

356
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,742
He's busy studying!

357
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,042
Don't bother him!

358
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:55,063
Jung Bong! Have some castella.

359
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,659
No thank you, Mother.
I don't want any.

360
00:25:58,261 --> 00:25:59,761
I don't have much time.

361
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,098
What did I tell you?

362
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:15,853
I told you not to bother him.

363
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,181
He just might really
have a shot this time.

364
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:19,945
His level of concentration
is totally different now.

365
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:23,766
See? When push comes to shove,
he gets things done.

366
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:34,238
Here... here.
I'll give it to you.

367
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:37,867
Stop it. I'm serious.

368
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,952
OK.
I won't.

369
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:52,521
How could you be so dumb,
as to fall for that again?

370
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,251
OK.
For real, this time.

371
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,762
I won't do that again.

372
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:58,468
Really.
OK?

373
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:23,372
The first song on "Starry Night" tonight
is a song that many people requested.

374
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:27,254
Kim Hee Ae's "Don't Forget Me."

375
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:29,588
I was thinking of reading...

376
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:33,815
...another one of Ssangmundong's
Kim Jung Bong's postcards.

377
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,694
I guess he's unemployed.
He sends postcards so often.

378
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,204
No... he said he was studying
for college entrance exams.

379
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:44,581
Maybe he gave up on them,
or maybe he's totally prepared for them.

380
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:46,256
It's one of those two.

381
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:49,772
"Mr. Moon Sae, I want to introduce you
to another star living in Ssangmundong."

382
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,686
Wow... I'm going to go insane.

383
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,278
Strangely enough, a lot of stars
seem to live in that neighborhood.

384
00:27:56,984 --> 00:28:00,983
"The star I want to introduce today
is someone who lives downstairs from me."

385
00:28:00,994 --> 00:28:02,994
"Her name is Sung Bo Ra."

386
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:08,901
"Bo Ra is the smartest person
in our neighborhood."

387
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,952
"She always had
the highest grades in school..."

388
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,827
"...and made 80th percentile
in the entire nation."

389
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:16,718
"She was able to attend
Seoul University for Math Education... "

390
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,595
"...due to her stellar grades."
"She's a genius among geniuses."

391
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:25,824
"Adults look at Ms. Sung and say
that she's off-putting and scary...

392
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,843
"...and even say that she makes them
want to piss their pants."

393
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:32,258
"But the Sung Bo Ra that I know
just has a rough exterior."

394
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:35,373
"Otherwise, she has a heart of gold."

395
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:43,530
Big Sis, are you out of your mind?

396
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,345
If Dad catches you, you're dead!

397
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,920
Whatever.
What do you want?

398
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,651
Our great-aunt passed away.
We have to go see the family now.

399
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:52,191
Oh, really?

400
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:56,103
OK.

401
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,084
Bo Ra.

402
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,983
We can just take the bus, you know.

403
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,715
None of the buses are running anymore.

404
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,718
Which one was it, again?

405
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:17,839
Bo Ra!

406
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,348
Bo Ra, we'll take a taxi.
This is hard on you, right?

407
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,763
It's not like we're rich.

408
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:22,868
We have no money for that.

409
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:23,879
Let's just go.

410
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,951
This goes here, and then...

411
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,405
Darn this shitty car...

412
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,073
Hey, you have to
turn off the side lights.

413
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:36,892
Oh yeah.

414
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:39,194
-Big Sis! Look forward!
-Bo Ra! Forward!

415
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,125
I am looking forward!

416
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:42,778
It's a puppy!

417
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:44,475
I told you, I am looking!

418
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:57,573
Hey... I think...
the car hit something.

419
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,621
-Should I go take a look?
-No! Don't leave the car!

420
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:00,999
It'll only take a second!

421
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,888
Don't leave the car!
Don't move!

422
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:05,140
I think we hit a puppy or something.
We have to go out and take a look!

423
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,666
We can't just sit here!

424
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:07,677
I told you, don't leave!

425
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:10,591
Then hurry up and go!
What if another car comes up behind us?

426
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,101
No!
I'm not moving!

427
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:13,759
What if it just makes it worse?

428
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:17,350
Honey, get out of the car
and see what it is!

429
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:18,361
Don't leave the car!

430
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:20,663
Don't leave!
Nobody move!

431
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,118
Hurry and go!
A car is coming!

432
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:24,628
I told you, I'm not budging!

433
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,699
I'm not moving!

434
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:27,857
Jesus.

435
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:37,317
Hey.
Turn it off!

436
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,626
Hey, you have to get out
and check out the situation!

437
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:44,006
No! You can't go out, no matter what!
If you do, watch what happens!

438
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:47,111
Bo Ra... I think it'd be fine for us
to keep going slowly then.

439
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,972
Are you crazy? What if it's a dead dog?
We can't just leave it here!

440
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:52,705
We're going to spend all night here,
at this rate!

441
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:56,488
You're so darn immature!

442
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:58,999
What the hell did I do?

443
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:04,654
One day...
he'll come back to my side...

444
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:05,665
Turn that trash off!

445
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,648
You're not dead, jerk!
Keep it together!

446
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,594
Did something happen?
You're dancing so happily.

447
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:39,940
Yeah.
Taek won again.

448
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:40,952
Really?

449
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:43,864
Taek said he'll buy us pizza
if he wins again.

450
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,229
But there's still three more people left.

451
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:52,756
I need to catch my breath.
The King of Baduk in Korea.

452
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:57,132
-Man, what are you doing?
-The King of Baduk in Korea.

453
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:58,769
Hey, stop it!

454
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:03,403
The Third Match

455
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:08,914
Korea's Choi Taek, 6-dan,
vs. China's Wang Le Yi, 9-dan

456
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:19,404
The match will now begin.

457
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:06,769
Mom, did you see my jacket?

458
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Your sister has it. She said she has
an athletic competition today.

459
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:12,807
Really?
Then I'm going to wear her dress.

460
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,332
Go ahead.
You two made a promise, didn't you?

461
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,104
But can you wear that,
in this weather?

462
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:19,182
It's OK!
I just need to wear a coat over it.

463
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:42,595
Darn it...

464
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:49,746
Sung Bo Ra, that crazy wretch!

465
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:53,247
I'm going to kill her!

466
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:57,261
I got it!

467
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:15,381
All right!

468
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:17,422
I got it!

469
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:21,362
Move, move!
It's mine! Go away!

470
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,680
I got it!

471
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,051
I bought this bag today.

472
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,164
Wow. Looks awesome.

473
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:34,413
Try and make some sense.

474
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,119
Students.

475
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:42,627
Let's chat for a second.

476
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,261
This was expensive, man.

477
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:47,048
Hey!

478
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:49,643
Who are you?

479
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:54,513
You two made two mistakes.

480
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:58,065
The first was that
you two students were smoking.

481
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,281
The second one was that you two threw
your cigarette butts on the ground.

482
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:03,715
OK?

483
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,351
Hey, Mister.
Just go.

484
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:12,333
You made a third mistake just now.

485
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:17,604
I'm not a "Mister."

486
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,117
I told you to leave, Mister!

487
00:35:25,644 --> 00:35:26,961
I told you, I'm not a "Mister."

488
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,472
Goddarn it...

489
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:29,644
Hey!

490
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:31,009
You little...

491
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:39,373
What the hell did you say,
you little brat?

492
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:42,823
Who are you?

493
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:44,840
Who do you think?
The Harbinger of Justice.

494
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:48,126
Hey, you're from Ssangmun High, right?

495
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,333
Want me to get the dean? Huh?

496
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,919
He lives right around here!

497
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,671
-No, ma'am.
-No, ma'am.

498
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:59,104
You darn troublemakers.

499
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:03,032
A student smokes '88s?
And not even Evergreens?

500
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,421
I'm sorry, ma'am.

501
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,518
Oh ho.

502
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:09,393
U.S.A. handmade goods? Huh?

503
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,310
You know how great
Korean-made goods are, nowadays?

504
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:14,295
Now, repeat after me.

505
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:16,606
Let's use Korean-made products!

506
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:18,942
-Let's use...
-Let's use...

507
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:20,365
Louder!

508
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,429
Let's use Korean-made products!

509
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:24,695
-Let's use Korean-made products!
-Let's use Korean-made products!

510
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:26,736
Let's quit smoking!

511
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,302
-Let's quit smoking!
-Let's quit smoking!

512
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:31,661
We are the nation's hope!

513
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,103
We are the...

514
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:33,952
nation's...

515
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:36,343
We are the nation's hope!

516
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:38,613
-We are the nation's hope!
-We are the nation's hope!

517
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:41,077
We will free the country!

518
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:43,746
-We will free the country!
-We will free the country!

519
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:46,384
Free the unjustly imprisoned protesters!

520
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,731
Free the unjustly imprisoned protesters!

521
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:52,107
Stop raising the tuition!

522
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,085
-Stop raising...
-Stop raising...

523
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,428
- The tuition!
- Tuition!

524
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:58,993
-Stop raising the tuition!
-Stop raising the tuition!

525
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:15,015
A miracle is happening
at the championships in Shanghai, China.

526
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:17,862
The only player left representing
Korea, Choi Taek, 6-dan...

527
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:19,459
...defeated China's
Wang Lei, 9-dan...

528
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,311
...and Japan's Wang Li Man,
9-dan consecutively.

529
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:27,822
And today will be his last match,
against China's Wang Shi, 6-dan.

530
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:31,798
I'm off.

531
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:32,809
OK.

532
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:38,567
Why not just live here
if you're going to come by every day?

533
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,659
I'm not here to see you.

534
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:43,001
Is Jung Bong up?

535
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,302
Yeah.

536
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:45,624
Why?

537
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:49,085
I always send postcards to
"Starry Night..."

538
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,380
...but they only ever pick his.

539
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:52,875
I want to borrow some
postcards from Jung Bong.

540
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:01,167
Your Big Bro isn't studying lately?

541
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,747
Did he ever?

542
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:06,787
I'm off.

543
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:13,793
Oh my, oh my!
What are you up to?

544
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:16,881
There's only one guy left now, huh?

545
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,913
Yes. If he wins today,
he'll be the champion.

546
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,423
Wow.

547
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,965
Taek is really something.

548
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:27,532
He just destroyed five guys on his own!

549
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:29,364
Then, when Taek comes back...

550
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:33,153
...shall we throw him a congratulatory
party and have some drinks?

551
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,541
There's still one game left.

552
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:36,218
He has to win today to be the champion.

553
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:38,761
Geez... stop spouting all this nonsense.

554
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:42,761
Isn't that last Chinese guy a newbie?

555
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:46,217
Of course Taek will win!

556
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:47,824
It's not so simple
when it comes to Baduk.

557
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:51,334
What do you mean?
Our Taek is no ordinary kid.

558
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:54,854
All the great Baduk players in the world
were beaten by Taek!

559
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:59,864
So there's no way that some greenhorn
would have a chance against him!

560
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,524
Taek has a curse.

561
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,834
Huh? What do you mean?

562
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:08,437
As you know, he's a quiet kid.

563
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,192
He doesn't take well to strangers.

564
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:13,202
Yeah, that's true.

565
00:39:13,658 --> 00:39:15,396
He's wary of strangers
when it comes to Baduk, too.

566
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:16,975
What?

567
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:18,580
He's somewhat weak mentally.

568
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,702
When he faces someone
for the first time, he crumbles.

569
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,134
Mister!

570
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:26,652
Did Sun Woo pass by?

571
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,519
-Yeah, just now.
-Darn it!

572
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,028
Greet people properly!

573
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,604
Goodbye!

574
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:39,021
So if he's really unlucky,
he could lose. Geez.

575
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:42,520
Well, even if he loses,
we've been cheering him on so much

576
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:46,030
...we wore ourselves out, so...
let's have a drink.

577
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,239
Good luck!

578
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,420
Today at 6 p.m.
Last Match of the Championships

579
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,143
[The Fifth Match]

580
00:40:14,154 --> 00:40:19,154
[Korea's Choi Taek, 6-dan,
vs. China's Wang Shi, 6-dan]

581
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:28,556
Sir.

582
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:31,054
Why isn't Choi Taek here yet?

583
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,263
Did something happen?

584
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:38,301
Choi Taek comes right on time.

585
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:43,128
He gets lost in thought and comes
right as the match is supposed to begin.

586
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:47,858
He's here.

587
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,500
He looks like he's about to pass out.

588
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:04,595
I guess he didn't get any sleep.

589
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:05,893
Reporter Shi.

590
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:08,436
He's had five consecutive matches!

591
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:11,159
Even during nationals,
they give people at least one day off.

592
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:16,014
The fact that he's even able
to sit there is an incredible feat.

593
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:20,995
Even if he loses today, make sure
you write a nice article about him.

594
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:23,524
No way he'll lose!

595
00:41:24,564 --> 00:41:28,563
It's because everyone speaks like that,
that Taek can't sleep.

596
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:47,778
I guess Choi Taek will be
playing with the black stones.

597
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:54,125
But... isn't his record better
when he plays with white stones?

598
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:01,031
We will now begin the match.

599
00:42:01,176 --> 00:42:03,866
We would like all the members
of the press to leave in ten minutes.

600
00:42:48,414 --> 00:42:49,913
Mister, have you heard anything?

601
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:50,924
Did you get a call?

602
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:52,354
No, not yet.

603
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:53,807
Ah, OK.

604
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:03,930
Hey! What happened with Taek?

605
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:04,953
Did he win?

606
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,683
What, did he lose?

607
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,113
The match isn't over yet.

608
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:11,478
I'm waiting for his call.

609
00:43:20,342 --> 00:43:22,842
Mister, how about Taek?
Did he win?

610
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:24,818
No, not yet.

611
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,555
You haven't heard from Taek yet?

612
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,230
We don't know yet.

613
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,499
The match isn't over yet
and I haven't gotten a call.

614
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:50,557
Go home and wait.

615
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,992
He still hasn't called?

616
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:02,714
No, not yet.

617
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,500
Darn it!

618
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:15,662
Returned to Sender

619
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,969
She only put a donation sticker on it,
instead of an actual stamp?

620
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:27,754
Hello, Mr. Moon Sae!

621
00:45:27,913 --> 00:45:30,913
I'm Sunny from Ssangmundong.

622
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:33,409
Please don't use my real name...

623
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,809
I'm in the middle of experiencing
my first love right now.

624
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,768
Not only that, I've fallen in love
with a childhood friend.

625
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:45,119
Whenever I see him,
my mood brightens.

626
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:48,798
And even when I'm eating or studying,
all I can think about is him.

627
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:51,163
Mr. Moon Sae.
This is love, right?

628
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:55,406
The name of the person I like is SW.

629
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:57,513
Even his name is so cool, right?

630
00:45:58,086 --> 00:46:00,675
But his looks are even more
charismatic than his name.

631
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:04,321
Lastly, I want to say something to SW.

632
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,611
"SW! Thank you for liking me."

633
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,384
"I like you too!"

634
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:25,099
Jung Hwan!

635
00:46:28,175 --> 00:46:31,502
The match is over.
I just received a call.

636
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:36,557
How was the match today?

637
00:46:38,266 --> 00:46:39,292
I couldn't win.

638
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:42,467
He's a really good player.

639
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,366
You've worked hard.

640
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:23,382
Hey!

641
00:47:23,535 --> 00:47:25,534
What happened?
Did he win?

642
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:26,953
Did he win, or lose?

643
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:29,602
I'm sure the results must have
been announced by now!

644
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:30,773
Tell us!

645
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,476
Jung Hwan didn't tell you?

646
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:35,032
No. He just went straight to his room.

647
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:39,163
Stop beating around
the bush and tell us!

648
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:41,257
I'm going to get mad!

649
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,073
He won.

650
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:49,468
I told you, didn't I?
That Taek would win!

651
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:51,570
Hip, hip, hooray!

652
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:54,480
On a day like this,
we can't not have these!

653
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,342
What are you going to do now?

654
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:38,862
There aren't any competitions coming up.

655
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:40,394
You don't have any plans?

656
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:47,746
I do.

657
00:48:49,953 --> 00:48:50,953
What?

658
00:48:58,461 --> 00:49:03,460
An unbelievable phenomenon has occurred
at the International Baduk Championships.

659
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:05,397
Korea's very own Choi Taek, 6-dan...

660
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:09,931
...has beaten the odds and won five
straight matches to win the championship.

661
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:14,239
Oh my! I knew Taek was good...

662
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,327
... but I didn't know
he was this good.

663
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,552
It's just us.

664
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:21,061
Apparently, they treat him better than
the President himself everywhere else.

665
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,700
Really?

666
00:49:23,485 --> 00:49:27,263
Duk Seon, what are you doing?
Come eat some sweet potatoes.

667
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,438
I'm sure she shoved something else
down her pie hole already.

668
00:49:29,644 --> 00:49:32,877
How can you say that
about your sister?

669
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:34,773
Why not just say "ate?"

670
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:36,421
Duk Seon.

671
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:39,217
Have some sweet potatoes
before they get cold.

672
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:42,458
I'm not having any!
I can't get full on something like that.

673
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,771
He should've called by now.

674
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:53,121
Choi Taek, 6-dan, was suffering through
a slump prior to the championship.

675
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:58,825
However, he proved his world-class
skill set to the nation once again...

676
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:04,222
...by winning five consecutive games
to become the reigning champion.

677
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:08,003
Choi Taek, 6-dan, remained
unaffected by the doubt surrounding him...

678
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:10,696
...and confidently won the championship
with his arsenal of skills.

679
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:17,422
His performance makes one go
crazy at the fact that he is merely 18.

680
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:20,740
Jung Hwan.
Have some sweet potatoes.

681
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:23,042
It's fine.

682
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,040
Taek still isn't home yet?

683
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:35,697
Have some rice cakes!
Aren't you hungry?

684
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:37,096
You have some.
I'm fine.

685
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:41,053
Your head is going to roll off
your shoulders while you wait.

686
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:46,058
Hello?
You're here?

687
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:47,492
OK.

688
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:49,508
Mom, I'm off!

689
00:50:52,604 --> 00:50:53,604
Hello?

690
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:54,902
OK!

691
00:50:57,485 --> 00:51:00,017
I'm sure Taek is tired!
Come home soon, OK?

692
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:05,308
Yeah! Taek, you're home?

693
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:08,080
OK!
I'm coming! OK!

694
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,910
Watch your step!

695
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,959
You're going to trip like that.

696
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:19,903
You're here?

697
00:51:44,419 --> 00:51:47,231
I came as quickly as I could
but I stopped by the club...

698
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:55,748
Hurry over.

699
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:04,360
Then...

700
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,371
I'm eating this one.

701
00:52:05,382 --> 00:52:06,871
Why?
Are you out of your mind?

702
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:08,452
You want to die?

703
00:52:09,507 --> 00:52:12,136
What the hell?
You were all like, "I have no appetite."

704
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,140
-I'm taking it home.
-Hey, play rock-paper-scissors for it!

705
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,120
I confessed to the girl that works
at the study room, and got rejected.

706
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:23,001
I'm so pitiful.

707
00:52:24,414 --> 00:52:26,414
I live in a half-basement.

708
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:33,254
Jung Hwan lived in a one-bedroom house
until three years ago.

709
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:39,326
My older sister is Sung Bo Ra.

710
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:43,864
His older brother is Kim Jung Bong.

711
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:45,221
Darn it...

712
00:52:45,285 --> 00:52:47,460
What?
I like my older brother.

713
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:48,565
Then I'm eating this one.

714
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,708
No, no, no, wait.
Want to chime in?

715
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:52,458
What, something pitiful about myself?

716
00:52:57,263 --> 00:52:58,878
You better not bring up your dad.

717
00:53:00,398 --> 00:53:02,382
You better not bring up your mom.
That's cheating.

718
00:53:02,977 --> 00:53:04,477
You punks...

719
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,774
I have someone I like...

720
00:53:14,516 --> 00:53:16,659
But I haven't been able to confess
my feelings for two years now.

721
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,944
I was just kidding...
What's up with this mood shift?

722
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:33,032
Fine. You eat it.

723
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,110
Yeah, go ahead.

724
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,278
It's true, though.

725
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:42,397
What's up with this gloomy mood?

726
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,587
I don't know what to do.

727
00:53:48,786 --> 00:53:50,286
Confess.

728
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:51,803
What?

729
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,620
I said, confess!

730
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:56,665
Do it on the first day that it snows.

731
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,425
Darn it...

732
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:07,022
Confess on the day
of the first snowfall! OK?

733
00:54:15,104 --> 00:54:17,779
Wow... Taek is really something.

734
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,029
You must be so happy!

735
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:25,071
Yes, I feel good today.

736
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:28,365
That's why I'm saying this...

737
00:54:28,572 --> 00:54:33,486
But do you want to trade,
my three kids for Taek?

738
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:35,381
Three-for-one trade.

739
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:39,064
If you think about it,
you're not really losing out.

740
00:54:39,115 --> 00:54:44,799
It's because it's so darn hard
to raise daughters!

741
00:54:44,938 --> 00:54:46,437
That's right!

742
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:48,517
Raising a daughter
like Bo Ra is difficult!

743
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:52,102
I can't even look her in the face,
she's so scary.

744
00:54:55,564 --> 00:54:57,563
Where's Jin Joo?
I don't see her around.

745
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,410
I sent her to her grandmother's house.

746
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,420
Tae Seok said he was going,
so I had her tag along.

747
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,281
Even so, I guess she's not
putting up a fuss and is doing well.

748
00:55:04,405 --> 00:55:06,904
Yeah! She loves my mom!

749
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:11,802
She gets to eat all the things she likes
and, in turn, so do I...

750
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:14,163
What the...

751
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:16,268
We're already out of liquor!

752
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:23,417
Yeah... why'd you only buy one?

753
00:55:23,428 --> 00:55:26,506
You should've bought
at least three.

754
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,234
-I'll go buy some.
-No, no, no.

755
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:30,848
We have some plum wine at home.

756
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:34,192
Honey, call home
and ask Bo Ra to bring in.

757
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,333
We have other kids, though.

758
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:40,842
No Eul went to go sleep over
at his friend's house...

759
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:43,878
...and Duk Seon is hanging out at Taek's.

760
00:55:44,144 --> 00:55:46,644
What are you doing?
Hurry up and call.

761
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:55,367
Why are you asking me to bring that?

762
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:56,200
No!

763
00:55:56,232 --> 00:55:57,840
I'm getting ready to go
to my upperclassman's place!

764
00:55:57,859 --> 00:55:59,483
I told you that I'm sleeping there!

765
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,738
So... like... on your way out...

766
00:56:04,785 --> 00:56:07,149
...you can drop by here
for a quick second.

767
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,160
You'd be here after you take
four steps out the door.

768
00:56:20,278 --> 00:56:21,680
Geez, that girl.

769
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:23,826
She was so loud,
I thought she'd pop out of the phone.

770
00:56:24,699 --> 00:56:26,630
Just watch.
She'll come anyway.

771
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:28,037
Really, Miss?

772
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,871
Want to bet on it?
Whether she'll come or not?

773
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:31,968
She'll come!
Just watch!

774
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:35,090
Even though she talks like that,
she has a warm heart.

775
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:40,271
If her heart was any warmer,
we'd all burn to death.

776
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,301
See?
I told you she'd come.

777
00:56:48,722 --> 00:56:51,480
Bo Ra, come over here!

778
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:55,548
Where's the bathroom?

779
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:57,080
Bathroom?

780
00:56:57,485 --> 00:56:58,985
This way.

781
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:08,017
Oh... who could that be,
at this hour?

782
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:13,977
Since when?

783
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:17,549
What did the people at the hospital say?

784
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:19,675
Yeah.

785
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:24,491
Even so, you have to stay by her side
and watch her all night.

786
00:57:24,556 --> 00:57:26,556
Her fever could go up
out of nowhere.

787
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,437
I'll take the first bus down there
tomorrow morning, Mom.

788
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,124
Yeah. OK.

789
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:44,028
Is Jin Joo sick?

790
00:57:44,478 --> 00:57:45,292
Yeah.

791
00:57:45,317 --> 00:57:47,817
She said that her fever went up
to 40 degrees, Celsius.

792
00:57:48,572 --> 00:57:49,695
What about the hospital?

793
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:52,217
They went and she got
better after that, but...

794
00:57:53,675 --> 00:57:57,175
I didn't even know she was sick...
and here I was, getting drunk.

795
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:00,999
Don't you have to go down there?

796
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:03,859
Let's go.
I'll give you a ride down there.

797
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,797
Sit down!

798
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,850
You can't drink and drive!

799
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,896
I bet that the trains
stopped running by now, too.

800
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,456
Just take the first train
down there tomorrow.

801
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:14,467
She'll be fine.

802
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:17,477
They said they went to the hospital,
so I'm sure she'll be fine.

803
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:21,184
Don't worry! Kids all get sick
while they're growing up.

804
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,207
Goodbye.

805
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:26,581
Hey!

806
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:30,498
About this upperclassman...
it's a girl, right?

807
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,833
Geez, she's an adult now!

808
00:58:32,852 --> 00:58:36,852
Stop interrogating her.
Who cares if it's a guy or a girl?

809
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,977
I don't know where the hell
she's off to, all the time.

810
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,958
Don't worry about Bo Ra.
She'll take care of herself.

811
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:47,063
She's a smart one, after all.

812
00:58:47,468 --> 00:58:52,967
If she were any smarter,
she'd be bossing us around.

813
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:54,087
Jewelry Store

814
00:59:04,762 --> 00:59:05,762
Taek!

815
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:08,056
Good night!
I'm off to bed!

816
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,407
Yes!
Good night!

817
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:13,918
-Good night, Mister!
-Good night, Mister!

818
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:35,635
Sun Woo.

819
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:37,730
What?

820
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,398
Switch spots with me.

821
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:43,649
No! I want to sleep next to Taek.

822
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,160
He's so nice and toasty.

823
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,319
He's the perfect person to cuddle with.

824
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:50,279
It's not that...

825
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:55,111
This jerk farted again.

826
00:59:56,461 --> 00:59:58,337
Why do you keep doing that?

827
00:59:59,231 --> 01:00:01,165
It smells!

828
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:03,040
Hey, hey, hey!

829
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:06,558
Why do you always do this? Darn it!

830
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:09,176
She's not asking for me?

831
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:15,341
She could be indigested,
so don't feed her anything.

832
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:17,644
OK.

833
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:19,671
OK. I'll go first thing,
tomorrow morning.

834
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:21,024
OK.

835
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,120
Darn it...

836
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,580
What is it?
Did Jin Joo wake up?

837
01:01:00,048 --> 01:01:01,365
I can just go tomorrow, you know.

838
01:01:01,383 --> 01:01:03,494
You probably won't
be able to sleep all night.

839
01:01:04,663 --> 01:01:08,944
Even if I went to my upperclassman's,
we would've just partied all night.

840
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:11,093
Get in.

841
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,634
Hurry up and get in!

842
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:18,936
It's cold!

843
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:21,013
Oh, OK. OK.

844
01:01:33,263 --> 01:01:36,213
Bonggie. Call Dad and tell him
to come eat dinner.

845
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:38,377
Yes.

846
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:49,249
Yes.

847
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:54,915
He asks what we'll be having
as side dishes for dinner.

848
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,755
Meat.

849
01:01:58,184 --> 01:01:59,684
She says "meat," Father.

850
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:06,763
"What kind of meat?
Beef? Pork?"

851
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:11,131
Beef !Beef! I bought beef!
Hurry up and come home.

852
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,238
Now, for the weather forecast.

853
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:16,590
It seems that today,
the first Wednesday of November...

854
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,618
...will also be the first day
of snow this year.

855
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:23,190
We are predicting
that there will be heavy snowfall.

856
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,495
I'm back from school!

857
01:02:24,506 --> 01:02:26,988
Yes. Hurry and get washed up for dinner.

858
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:27,999
OK.

859
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:31,459
I'm home.

860
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:32,975
You're home, my son?

861
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:34,970
Hurry and get washed up.
I bought beef today.

862
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:37,248
You haven't been eating lately.

863
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:38,918
No, thank you.
My stomach doesn't feel good.

864
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:40,201
I'll go wash up.

865
01:02:49,184 --> 01:02:51,314
All right, shall we read
some stories, then?

866
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:52,418
Yes!

867
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,087
It may be because
Christmas is coming up...

868
01:02:55,246 --> 01:02:57,512
...but we're getting
a lot of love-related ones lately.

869
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,569
This is the first one.

870
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:04,230
I'm Lee Ji Eun,
from Myunmokdong.

871
01:03:04,428 --> 01:03:06,501
Duk Seon!
Set the table!

872
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:08,089
OK!

873
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:18,650
Wow!
It really looks like it'll snow.

874
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,945
Geez... so cold!

875
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,213
Younger Brother!
Snow...

876
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:43,249
It might snow tonight.
If it does, wake me up.

877
01:03:45,582 --> 01:03:47,436
I really want to see
the first snowfall of the year.

878
01:04:16,202 --> 01:04:19,202
Please, just read mine, just once!

879
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:21,243
Duk Seon!

880
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:24,614
Sung Duk Seon!

881
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:39,917
Oh... it's you, Sun Woo?

882
01:04:41,186 --> 01:04:42,459
Come in.

883
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,970
No, that's OK.

884
01:04:44,677 --> 01:04:46,177
What is it?

885
01:04:47,909 --> 01:04:49,249
Is Bo Ra here?

886
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:50,908
Who?
Sung Bo Ra?

887
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:53,250
She's not here.

888
01:04:56,656 --> 01:04:57,888
Why are you looking for her?

889
01:05:00,948 --> 01:05:02,948
It's... snowing.

890
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:49,055
Sun Woo, just a moment.

891
01:05:49,066 --> 01:05:50,261
I'll bring it quickly.

892
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:51,527
OK.

893
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:16,050
Bo Ra!

894
01:06:16,336 --> 01:06:19,140
Oh, Sun Woo. Did you come
to borrow something again?

895
01:06:19,284 --> 01:06:21,393
Just some lead pencil lead.

896
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,096
What are you looking at?

897
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,606
Did you come to watch over me?

898
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:11,123
No.

899
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,250
I just wanted to know
if you were OK.

900
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,750
Sun Woo.

901
01:07:20,058 --> 01:07:21,733
Here. A sewing kit.

902
01:07:22,525 --> 01:07:23,961
That's mine.

903
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:26,997
You think she'd have a sewing kit?

904
01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:29,114
Borrow it from the right person next time.

905
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:31,121
You're a frustrating kid.

906
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:34,292
How did you manage to become
student council president?

907
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,468
Hey!

908
01:08:51,551 --> 01:08:53,051
Stop right there.

909
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:57,504
Why?

910
01:08:57,515 --> 01:08:59,013
Why is it Sung Bo Ra,
of all people?

911
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:01,352
Why her?

912
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:03,590
Because I like her.

913
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:05,895
What part of her?
What part of her do you like?

914
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:07,445
She's pretty.

915
01:09:07,573 --> 01:09:08,597
My ass.

916
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:09,819
And she's smart.

917
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:10,830
Oh my God.

918
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:12,410
And she's kind.

919
01:09:12,633 --> 01:09:14,135
You crazy jerk...

920
01:09:14,262 --> 01:09:16,402
I think that even the mole
next to her eye is pretty.

921
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,239
I made that for her!

922
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,250
I stabbed her
with a lead pencil there once!

923
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:28,384
Oh my God!
Why does it have to be her? Why?

924
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,020
Ow! Hey!

925
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:38,750
I'm never seeing you again.

926
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,206
What are you going to do if you
keep starving yourself like this?

927
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,064
You're really not hungry?
Want me to make you ramen, or something?

928
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:48,250
Yes, please.

929
01:10:48,932 --> 01:10:50,432
Ramyun.

930
01:10:52,472 --> 01:10:53,718
Ramyun.

931
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:01,629
And this is the last story for today.

932
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:07,979
Honestly, we've been waiting for this day
to be able to read this.

933
01:11:08,186 --> 01:11:10,686
The first snowfall of the year.

934
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:14,598
I'm sure those of you listening
to "Starry Night"...

935
01:11:14,622 --> 01:11:17,736
...really want to see
a loved one on a day like this.

936
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:25,739
But I bet that the person who sent this
feels that way more than anyone.

937
01:11:25,857 --> 01:11:30,250
Sunny from Ssangmundong
sent us this one.

938
01:11:31,324 --> 01:11:33,739
"Hello, Mr. Moon Sae!"

939
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:38,249
"I'm Ssangmundong Sunny,
who is love-sick from her first love."

940
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:42,749
"I have a crush on someone
living in my neighborhood."

941
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:45,724
"And that guy likes me, too."

942
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:51,239
"But... I haven't received
a confession from him yet."

943
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:56,749
"Since he's such a shy guy, he doesn't
seem to be able to muster the courage."

944
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:58,115
"Mr. Moon Sae."

945
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:03,125
"My wish is for him to be confessed
to on the day it first snows."

946
01:12:03,348 --> 01:12:07,585
"So please read my postcard
on the day of the first snow, OK?"

947
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:12,153
"That's because, even if
I'm not confessed to on that day..."

948
01:12:12,258 --> 01:12:14,624
"this will be broadcast
all over the country...

949
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:17,722
...which will console me a bit."

950
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:22,610
"Oh... of course, if I'm confessed
to and my postcard is read..."

951
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:24,120
"...that would be even better!"

952
01:12:25,204 --> 01:12:30,051
"Mr. Moon, please pray with me
that my first love works out."

953
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,250
"I'll put all my faith in you!"

954
01:12:33,277 --> 01:12:35,186
Wow, that's a lot of pressure.

955
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:38,515
It's nice that you believe in me, but...

956
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:46,249
I think a lot of people feel the
same way as Ssangmundong Sunny.

957
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:51,750
Ssangmundong Sunny,
you know that it's snowing now, right?

958
01:12:52,806 --> 01:12:56,405
Did you get confessed to?
I'm really curious.

959
01:12:57,795 --> 01:13:00,739
I wonder what it feels like
be confessed to from your first love...

960
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,239
...on the first day of snow of the year.

961
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:07,273
I bet she'd be the happiest person
on the planet.

962
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,539
That's what I think.

963
01:13:09,702 --> 01:13:13,330
Just like that beautiful
first snowfall outside

964
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:18,024
I hope that you all nurture
a beautiful love.

965
01:13:22,457 --> 01:13:24,492
Listeners of "Starry Night..."
do you know this?

966
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:27,622
They say that the chances
of your confession succeeding...

967
01:13:27,641 --> 01:13:30,640
...increase to over 90 percent
on the first day of snow of the year.

968
01:13:31,014 --> 01:13:34,223
I wonder if it's because
of the romantic atmosphere it creates.

969
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:38,623
If you love someone right now...

970
01:13:39,218 --> 01:13:42,729
...and you're wondering whether or not
you should confess...

971
01:13:42,827 --> 01:13:45,739
...tonight's your chance.

972
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:48,144
Muster up your courage and confess.

973
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,170
Bo Ra!

974
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,215
Well, though there's over
a 90 percent chance of success...

975
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:59,239
...the remaining 10 percent...
has you relying on sheer luck.

976
01:13:59,342 --> 01:14:01,396
You'll have to leave it to chance.

977
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:02,611
Yes. Well.

978
01:14:02,663 --> 01:14:04,502
Have strength.

979
01:14:04,575 --> 01:14:06,074
Where have you been?

980
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:07,759
I had to go to the countryside for a bit.

981
01:14:08,664 --> 01:14:09,920
Dressed like this?

982
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:12,430
Darn. Speaking of which,
I'm so cold, I could die.

983
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:15,124
Why?
Is something the matter?

984
01:14:15,135 --> 01:14:16,625
What are you doing here?

985
01:14:17,845 --> 01:14:19,845
I was waiting for you.

986
01:14:22,113 --> 01:14:23,399
For me?

987
01:14:24,522 --> 01:14:25,749
Why?

988
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:27,326
Because I have something
to talk to you about.

989
01:14:29,472 --> 01:14:30,313
Go ahead, then.

990
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,852
I'm really going to say it.

991
01:14:33,003 --> 01:14:34,400
Sure.
Go ahead.

992
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:38,599
I like you.

993
01:14:48,675 --> 01:14:50,639
I said, I like you.

994
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:57,477
I hope that everyone who confesses
today has their love come true.

995
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,756
And, by any chance, if there is anyone...

996
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:04,165
...who hasn't been confessed to
by the one they love yet...

997
01:15:04,384 --> 01:15:09,646
...or, if you're suffering
from love-related pains...

998
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:11,765
...don't be too sad.

999
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:16,241
Another person may be
in love with you, right now.

1000
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,415
Hello?

1001
01:15:21,845 --> 01:15:24,345
Oh! Why are you calling at this hour?

1002
01:15:24,614 --> 01:15:26,614
Oh, OK.
Hold on.

1003
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,106
Duk Seon, pick up the phone!

1004
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,745
And they may just confess to you...

1005
01:15:32,467 --> 01:15:34,417
...that they've liked you
for a long time...

1006
01:15:34,815 --> 01:15:37,673
...even though you were
totally unaware.

1007
01:15:37,974 --> 01:15:39,030
Hello?

1008
01:15:39,096 --> 01:15:42,604
Wow. OK.
This is the last song for tonight.

1009
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:45,122
It suits tonight so well.

1010
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:49,074
Lee Jung Suk's
"The First Snow is Falling."

1011
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,950
It's me.
Taek.

1012
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:57,577
Yeah.
Why are you calling so late?

1013
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:59,089
Did something happen?

1014
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,749
No. Nothing like that.

1015
01:16:03,043 --> 01:16:05,542
Hurry and go home.
Go home and sleep.

1016
01:16:05,786 --> 01:16:06,949
It's almost midnight.

1017
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:08,528
OK.

1018
01:16:10,392 --> 01:16:11,392
Duk Seon.

1019
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:13,821
Yeah, what is it?

1020
01:16:16,186 --> 01:16:19,186
Shall we... go see a movie?

1021
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:25,045
Let's go see a movie.

1022
01:16:25,056 --> 01:16:26,056
The two of us.

1023
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:45,739
[November 2015]

1024
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:48,305
Big Sis!
Come on!

1025
01:16:50,874 --> 01:16:53,950
Hey, just let me off the hook.

1026
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:55,494
I can't smoke at home.

1027
01:16:55,505 --> 01:16:57,336
I can only smoke here.

1028
01:16:57,347 --> 01:16:58,533
Then go smoke outside.

1029
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:00,044
Out on the porch.

1030
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,867
Geez! You punk...

1031
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:04,547
It's your phone.

1032
01:17:06,162 --> 01:17:07,467
It's your husband.

1033
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:09,750
It's a video call.

1034
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,316
Hey...

1035
01:17:13,356 --> 01:17:15,250
Sorry, sorry.

1036
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:17,369
Honey!

1037
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,486
Why are you calling so late?

1038
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:22,631
I'm at Duk Seon's.

1039
01:17:23,336 --> 01:17:24,336
See?

1040
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:26,750
Duk Seon!

1041
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:28,760
It's snowing!

1042
01:17:29,755 --> 01:17:30,952
You're right.

1043
01:17:31,598 --> 01:17:32,598
Honey!

1044
01:17:33,152 --> 01:17:34,269
Jae Woo is with me, too.

1045
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,401
Hey!

1046
01:17:35,503 --> 01:17:37,974
-It's snowing! Hurry over!
-You come too, honey.

1047
01:17:38,815 --> 01:17:40,742
I miss you!

1048
01:17:43,733 --> 01:17:46,347
The thing I remember most
when you say, "First snow?"

1049
01:17:46,358 --> 01:17:48,158
When you got rejected by Sun Woo?

1050
01:17:48,717 --> 01:17:50,230
In 1988?

1051
01:17:50,637 --> 01:17:53,902
She was writing so many postcards
to "Starry Night" and stuff...

1052
01:17:53,913 --> 01:17:55,412
She put on quite a show.

1053
01:17:57,045 --> 01:17:58,763
How do you know that?

1054
01:18:00,056 --> 01:18:01,742
Did I tell you, by any chance?

1055
01:18:01,753 --> 01:18:04,021
There's nothing I don't know about you.

1056
01:18:04,424 --> 01:18:06,192
Be good to me.

1057
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,685
It's because it's me that
I'm so accepting of all this.

1058
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:10,315
Where else would you
find a husband like me?

1059
01:18:10,327 --> 01:18:11,739
Don't be ridiculous.

1060
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,606
Want to talk about all the people you
dated before we got married?

1061
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,178
We could spend all night doing that!

1062
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:17,920
Hey, but in '88...

1063
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:21,239
...wasn't that when
they did the singing contest?

1064
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,511
Was that at the gymnasium?

1065
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:24,542
And just who did you take to that?

1066
01:18:25,043 --> 01:18:28,042
No... we went there with everyone else!

1067
01:18:28,436 --> 01:18:30,974
I saw it on TV at home!

1068
01:18:31,008 --> 01:18:32,644
No. We went and saw it.

1069
01:18:32,655 --> 01:18:35,907
Who won the award that year, again?
Jeon Yoo Na's "That Thing Called Love?"

1070
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:37,448
That was in '89!

1071
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:40,459
In '88, it was Endless Orbit's
"To That Person!"

1072
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:45,476
No. It was Jeon Yoo Na.

1073
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:48,250
I told you, it was Endless Orbit!

1074
01:19:20,008 --> 01:19:21,527
Should we bet on it?

1075
01:19:21,702 --> 01:19:23,702
Everyone puts in 1,000 won,
and winner takes all.

1076
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:30,995
Merry Christmas in advance.

1077
01:19:31,525 --> 01:19:33,110
See you on Christmas Eve, OK?

1078
01:19:33,128 --> 01:19:35,984
Then, this year, the gift  for the kids
in this neighborhood will be...

1079
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:38,941
I don't have any of that.

1080
01:19:38,952 --> 01:19:40,952
Oh my, oh my!

1081
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:45,690
Hurry up and apologize!

1082
01:19:45,701 --> 01:19:47,085
Why do I need to apologize
over something like that?

1083
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:50,096
Just try and stop me.

1084
01:19:52,082 --> 01:19:54,997
What's with the mood today,
when it's Christmas?

1085
01:19:55,043 --> 01:19:57,794
What, what is it?

1086
01:19:57,844 --> 01:19:59,844
Did something huge happen?

1087
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,749
Don't tell anyone what happened today.

1088
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,750
Got it?

1089
01:20:09,315 --> 01:20:10,698
I have something to talk to you about.

1090
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:11,515
With me?

1091
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:13,024
What?
What is it now?

1092
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,567
Darn you!

1093
01:20:14,781 --> 01:20:18,339
Let's do Secret Santa!

1094
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:20,948
I got you, Jung Bong.

1095
01:20:21,827 --> 01:20:23,510
You're... my Secret Santa, right?

1096
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,979
I don't even have a Secret Santa.

1097
01:20:27,249 --> 01:20:29,749
I don't deserve to be loved.

1098
01:20:34,478 --> 01:20:35,977
Then, see you on Christmas day.

1099
01:20:36,508 --> 01:20:38,249
Don't fall asleep.
