1
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,147
April, 1989.
Ssangmundong, Dongbong-gu, Seoul

2
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,626
I'm sure it was difficult.

3
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:48,169
It was difficult and he had plans,
so of course he canceled.

4
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:53,286
But is it really that difficult?

5
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,640
He's the one who made plans with me,
then he cancels the whole thing.

6
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,453
I must be going insane.

7
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,990
I'm sure he's tired.

8
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,475
He's probably meeting with someone
very important.

9
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:11,874
Well, I'm a nobody anyway.

10
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:16,658
Wait, am I really nothing?

11
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:21,821
Yeah, I am kind of nothing.

12
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:26,080
I suppose I'm not that great.

13
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:47,039
Hey, I thought you were watching a movie.
You didn't go?

14
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:55,461
What's up with him?

15
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,394
Right?
Is he playing around with you?

16
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,399
I think I get it.

17
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,037
What?

18
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:11,954
Choi Taek, that baduk...

19
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:16,332
-He must view you as a total fool.
-What?

20
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,080
You're a total fool... a fool!

21
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,659
Yeah... what about Man Ok?

22
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:51,727
Man Ok's not allowed out.

23
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:53,380
I barely managed to talk to her.

24
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,469
She's not allowed one foot
out of her house.

25
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:59,244
What is she going to do?
She has to go on dates.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,525
Forget dating. It's all over for her.

27
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,902
Hey, you haven't forgotten tomorrow,
right?

28
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,791
We're supposed to eat pizza
in Apgujung with Sae Mi.

29
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,324
Of course. How could I forget?

30
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:11,787
We haven't been to
Apgujung for so long.

31
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,497
Ghosh...

32
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,554
Oh Moo Sung, she's heavy.
Give her to me.

33
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:55,200
No, I'm fine. She's not heavy at all.

34
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:57,416
Let's go in.

35
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:10,397
Can't you stop doing that work now?
I've been so bored lately.

36
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:13,122
Moo Sung, what happened to your hand?

37
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:18,683
-I burned it. It's fine.
-It doesn't look fine.

38
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:21,195
You should have put on some ointment.

39
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:22,721
I'm sure it'll heal.

40
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,625
I haven't seen the motorcycle
around these days.

41
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,839
Do you think he's in
a different neighborhood?

42
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,520
No, he's not. He drives by
once in a while. Be careful.

43
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,859
I'm going now. See you tomorrow
at the Hanyang shopping center.

44
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,256
OK. Bye.

45
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,212
All right, pizza!

46
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:39,618
-Hey, are you OK? Are you hurt?
-No.

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,243
Sung Duk Seon.
You're pretty athletic.

48
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:47,547
You even protected your bag. Not bad.

49
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,441
-Are you OK?
-No!

50
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,424
-Try moving it.
-I can't move it.

51
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,583
What do we do? What?

52
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,823
How refreshing.

53
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:16,865
You're working hard.

54
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:18,317
Here, I'll take it.

55
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,202
Come over here.
You're working hard, right?

56
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:24,109
All right. Get going now.

57
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:56,808
Gosh... that smells so bad. Gosh!

58
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,629
Why is it flushing so weakly?

59
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,315
My back hurts!

60
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,136
My back hurts so much.

61
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:53,148
Choi Taek, who won the Ying Shibei
World Professional Go Championship...

62
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:56,796
...arrived back into Korea this
Sunday morning at Kimpo airport.

63
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,601
Choi Taek, 6 Dan, by beating Ying Shibei,
Fujitsu, and the Woori Securities Cup...

64
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,049
...has won every major world tournament.

65
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,117
And has established himself as
the world's best baduk player.

66
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:08,839
Taek must be back home.

67
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,663
Hey, hey, hey... careful.
Hey, ouch!

68
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,145
Gosh, don't!

69
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:25,469
Duk Seon, I'll buy you
a pizza for next time.

70
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:27,947
Or you can ask Taek
to buy you one.

71
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:30,339
Why did it have to happen on the weekend?

72
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,415
It great if I got hurt tomorrow
or the day after.

73
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,387
I only need to wear this for a few days.

74
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,598
I don't even have school tomorrow
because it's the school anniversary.

75
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,656
It would be perfect
if I got hurt tomorrow.

76
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:46,724
Why on my days off? I hate it.

77
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:52,109
When is my sister going to grow up?

78
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:56,406
Hey, Sung Duk Seon!
You alive or dead?

79
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:57,606
Alive!

80
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,461
So you are alive. Then I'll be going.

81
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,915
Where are you going?

82
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,880
We're playing soccer.
It's been a while since Taek joined us.

83
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,638
Give me a piggyback ride.

84
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:14,037
Hurry up and give me a piggyback ride.
I want to go too.

85
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:19,121
How can I do that? How can I carry
someone bigger than me?

86
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,758
What are you saying?

87
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,762
Hey, Sung Bo Ra.

88
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,481
Let's eat, at least. OK?

89
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,951
Jung Hwan, I finally finished
the thousand cranes...

90
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,661
I folded them all.

91
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,331
Where did my little brother go?

92
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:59,218
Air Force Cadet

93
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,940
Training Institute

94
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:27,339
No one's here. Hurry.

95
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,252
Don't you think we'll get caught
if we keep this up?

96
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,231
Never. We've never been caught.

97
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:40,495
Where's Taek?

98
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,332
I'm here.

99
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:46,437
It's still cold.

100
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,821
Get some exercise, Choi Taek.

101
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,291
It's only because I haven't adjusted
to the time difference.

102
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:52,761
What a joke.

103
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:57,122
Here, you guys should warm up.
I have to use the bathroom.

104
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:59,302
Wake up already, would you?

105
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,653
You tied your shoelaces well.
That's unlike you.

106
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,484
You tied it for me before
and I just left it.

107
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:41,616
I thought I wouldn't be able to re-do it
if I untied it.

108
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,348
So I tied it once more really tight.

109
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,747
Did you open my wallet, by chance?

110
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:19,957
No.

111
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:28,506
I didn't look inside.

112
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,612
Hey, hey, hey. You guys will fall!

113
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:49,521
Get off me!

114
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,209
-No, I don't want to.
-Get off!

115
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,897
-Get off me!
-Hey, you're going to kill him.

116
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:58,124
Just let him go already.

117
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,517
He kept saying I was heavy in front
of all these people.

118
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:06,038
Was I incorrect? Huh?
You're really heavy.

119
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,241
Just be quiet. Enough.

120
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,233
The sun will be gone.
Let's do two on two.

121
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:12,894
I'll be with Taek.
Jung Hwan, you go with Dong Ryong.

122
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:15,094
I'm at a loss because it’ll be like
I have no partner at all.

123
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:16,724
Are you kidding me?

124
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,607
I can kick the ball around
pretty well.

125
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:24,242
That would be like Duk Seon getting
into Seoul University. How crazy.

126
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,163
Hey, you haven't even seen the sun
for a long time, right?

127
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:31,033
Jung Hwan, let's beat these guys good.

128
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:33,662
OK.

129
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,068
Well, Sun Woo.

130
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,271
Great!

131
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:56,043
Dong Ryong, are you OK?

132
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,730
I'm in so much pain.
I think my butt ripped apart.

133
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,486
Stop complaining so much.

134
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:04,240
Are you in a lot of pain?

135
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,452
I think I'm going to die.

136
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,598
Then go sit down over there for a bit.

137
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,910
OK.

138
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:18,391
But, you guys...

139
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:23,605
More than anything you can imagine,
my butt is hurting so much right now.

140
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,157
What's going on?

141
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,488
-Hey!
-Dong Ryong!

142
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,156
What?

143
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,670
Hey, are you menstruating?

144
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,389
What?

145
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:45,635
Hey!

146
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:49,044
Get him on my back.

147
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,270
-I'm taking him to the hospital.
-OK.

148
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:57,259
Taek, let Dong Ryong's family know.
His dad is home today.

149
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,690
-Quickly.
-All right.

150
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:03,797
My God.

151
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,264
Hey, you should go on your own.
Get going.

152
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:35,402
Hurry up.

153
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,464
Get on my back.

154
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,680
What are you doing? Get on.

155
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,804
What are you students doing?
You sit right where you are.

156
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,838
-What are you doing? Hurry up.
-That...

157
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:23,876
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey, put me down!

158
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,514
Hey, hey!

159
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:31,295
Let me go. Hey!

160
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:05,083
Bo Ra, congratulations, by the way.

161
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:07,794
Your dream came true.

162
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,428
I know you haven't passed the test yet.

163
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,462
You've been dying to get into law
since orientation in first year.

164
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,335
Anyways, congratulations.

165
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:31,293
Episode 17: Life is Irony - II

166
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:04,593
Honey, Mi Ran! I'm feeling hungry.

167
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,652
You didn't hurt yourself elsewhere,
did you?

168
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,359
Then why do you keep smiling?
Are you that happy you hurt your back?

169
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:41,998
Goodness, is this the year of
three disasters?

170
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,366
Why isn't anything working out?

171
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:48,560
First, you hurt your back.
Then, the singing contest.

172
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,308
Here.

173
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,676
Do you like me that much?

174
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:03,828
Yes.

175
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,361
You know how they say life is full
of blessings in disguise.

176
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:11,416
I think that saying is correct.

177
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:14,381
My back may be broken...

178
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:18,617
But when else would I get this
treatment from Mi Ran?

179
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:22,113
It's like our newlywed days.

180
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:28,301
Also, I'm glad that happened
with the singing contest.

181
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:31,001
Being in preliminary rounds
was just right.

182
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:34,443
If you made it further,
I would be dead right now.

183
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,369
And as for that contest...
it's our nation's best program...

184
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:42,395
...with a great reputation,
history, and tradition.

185
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,460
Not just anyone came make it, you know.

186
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:51,061
No matter how good your talent is,
they have standard to meet.

187
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:01,415
What did I just say?

188
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,604
I lost my mind.
I think I'm slightly insane.

189
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,872
Mi Ran... I have go poo now.

190
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,487
Honey, I'm so sorry.

191
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:18,042
I love you.

192
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,020
Mi Ran!

193
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:23,651
Take me to the toilet first.

194
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,688
Sun Woo, set the table.

195
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:37,555
OK, hold on, Mom.

196
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:55,694
Hold on, Jin Joo.
Let me put this on first.

197
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:57,124
It's OK.

198
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:12,243
Mister, you should have disinfected it
before putting on the band aid.

199
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,176
Sun Woo, call Taek over.
I'm making beef stew.

200
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,957
I'll tell him to come over.

201
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,441
Hello.

202
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,788
Hi, Jin Joo.

203
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:25,790
How did you know to come?

204
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,188
-I smelled the food.
-What?

205
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,555
Are you a dog?

206
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,900
Earlier, your mom told me to come by
for dinner.

207
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:37,977
By the way, is Dong Ryong OK?

208
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,226
How can a young student have hemorrhoids?

209
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:43,697
Yes, Taek and I saw him earlier
and he was doing all right.

210
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,829
Who told him to put garlic in there?

211
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:50,068
He put garlic in there? Why?

212
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:52,190
It's a folk remedy.

213
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:56,331
He knew he had hemorrhoids,
but was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

214
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,989
So he tried to fix it with the garlic.

215
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:01,463
He says he's too embarrassed
and not to come to the hospital anymore.

216
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:03,616
He ended up more embarrassed in the end.

217
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,665
And why is he so immature?

218
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:08,905
He wanted to eat bananas
and threw a fit asking Taek to buy some.

219
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:12,817
When will he grow up, that punk?

220
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:18,631
-Sorry... I'm sorry, Mister.
-It's fine.

221
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:25,414
Hey, it's more helpful if you do nothing.

222
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,301
You should just go away.
None of them even match.

223
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,765
Go on and play with Jin Joo.

224
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,856
A beauty one dreams of...

225
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:49,695
Hey, that girl...

226
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:55,534
Didn't you say that girl is the same age
as our Duk Seon?

227
00:24:56,003 --> 00:25:01,851
-Yeah.
-Really... She sure is pretty.

228
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:08,579
What did her parents do in their previous
lives to have such a pretty daughter?

229
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,028
Goodness.... by the way,
where's Duk Seon?

230
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:16,430
She can't go anywhere because
of her foot.

231
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:18,926
Is she maybe in her room... No...

232
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,188
She's not possibly studying... No...

233
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:23,333
Studying?

234
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:27,194
-She's sleeping.
-OK.

235
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,889
Because she needs her beauty sleep,
she's sleeping right now.

236
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:38,572
You slept a lot too.

237
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:02,381
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey, put me down!

238
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:31,468
Taek.

239
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:36,869
Never mind.

240
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:45,037
Sun Woo.

241
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,999
Before...

242
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:59,413
One time I was at the Baduk Club
and came home early.

243
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,663
But Dad was alone.

244
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,872
He was eating just cold rice mixed
with water.

245
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,273
He hadn't expected me to be home early.

246
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:19,382
Dad was so flustered and surprised.

247
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,723
I had a thought at that moment.

248
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:28,337
When I saw him so flustered...

249
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:33,636
And so surprised that he didn't
know what to do with himself...

250
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:37,036
When I saw him standing
there like that...

251
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,110
I thought to myself that it would be nice
if he had a good person by his side.

252
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,592
I'm happy that it's your mom.

253
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,350
It's a relief.

254
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,706
You're OK with it?

255
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:14,662
You don't think about your mom?

256
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,684
It's been longer for me than
it has for you.

257
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:24,228
I guess that's why it's easier for me.

258
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,657
I must be younger than you.

259
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,486
You didn't know that already?

260
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,647
Hey... my pride is hurt.

261
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:44,052
Hey, you know my birthday is earlier
than yours.

262
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:45,758
You should call me older brother.

263
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,515
Crazy jerk.

264
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm mentally more mature than you.

265
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:52,242
What the heck? I don't think so.

266
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,488
What, really?

267
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:57,772
Hey, you've learned a lot of bad
things lately.

268
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,783
Making a wish on a falling star
will make it come true.

269
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:10,619
I'm sure you've all heard that before.

270
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,319
Starting midnight until early morning...

271
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,159
...there will be a space show of
hundreds of falling stars every hour.

272
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,180
Following the shooting star of 1981,
this will be a chance to see the most.

273
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,351
Astronomically, you should be looking
north to see the stars...

274
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:30,410
Should we go outside to look at
the stars?

275
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,016
-No.
-OK.

276
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:40,014
East, west, south, north.
East, west, south, north.

277
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:42,946
East, three times.

278
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,557
You're a princess, Mister!

279
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:59,131
Moo Sung, there's a big article in the
paper. Shouldn't we have a big dinner?

280
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,793
-The prize money was a large amount.
-There's no need.

281
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,391
Taek will find it a burden.

282
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:11,159
There are times when he wins and loses.

283
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,117
If we're too happy when he wins,
he might feel burdened.

284
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,073
I try to be the same
whether he wins or loses.

285
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,543
That is true.

286
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:28,717
But still, Moo Sung. Keep this newspaper.
Taek looks so good in the photo.

287
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:31,474
No, it's fine.

288
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:37,060
I guess Taek wins so much,
now his articles are nothing to you.

289
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,671
-Is that right?
-That's right.

290
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:41,480
-That's no big deal.
-Gosh.

291
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:45,204
South, five times.

292
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:00,243
Why do you want to look
at shooting stars?

293
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,488
Jung Hwan...

294
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,360
Do you know about the legend of
shooting stars?

295
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:16,967
Should I know?

296
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:23,538
If you make a wish while looking at
a shooting star, it will come true.

297
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,401
Dad.

298
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:47,967
Yes? Yeah?

299
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:51,533
You can turn up the volume.
I'm resting today.

300
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:54,370
It's fine. I'm going to sleep too.

301
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,239
OK.

302
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:01,719
By the way, Taek...

303
00:32:03,156 --> 00:32:04,692
Don't take your pills to go to sleep.

304
00:32:05,897 --> 00:32:07,202
OK, I won't take them.

305
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,855
Should I make you warm milk?

306
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:12,883
No. I'll make some later if I can't sleep.

307
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:17,022
-Go to bed. Good night.
-OK.

308
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:29,662
Hello.

309
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:33,524
Bo Ra? Why are you calling at this hour?

310
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,609
Right now? You're out front?

311
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:41,724
OK, I'll be right out.

312
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,441
You have to melt it and eat it.

313
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:01,578
They say you will find your love
if you do.

314
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,399
What?

315
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:07,092
You have to melt the chocolate before
you eat it.

316
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,642
And then you will get your love.

317
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:15,442
It's just candy.

318
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:22,458
How is there nothing that you don't know?

319
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:29,488
-Do I have to watch the stars?
-Yes.

320
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:45,615
You kept these things?

321
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:48,000
Of course. You know me.

322
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:53,260
I'm giving it to Jung Bong and Jung Hwan
as gifts when they get married.

323
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,405
Look at Jung Hwan's neat printing.

324
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,815
He was always a smart child, wasn't he?

325
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,392
Bo Ra, is something going on?

326
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,982
-Sun Woo...
-Bo Ra, wait.

327
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,151
There's a falling star right there.

328
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:56,080
They should be falling about now.

329
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:10,771
Hey... Jung Hwan!

330
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:12,644
Thats!

331
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:17,626
OK, it really happened.

332
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:22,029
Realy, we saw it. Did you make a wish?

333
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:24,668
No, I forgot.

334
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,295
I made a wish.

335
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:29,544
What?

336
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:36,599
To have a good relationship with Man Ok?

337
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:39,642
No.

338
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:46,133
For my little brother...

339
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:50,248
...to be able to do what
he really wants to do.

340
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:10,165
Today, I played soccer.

341
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:15,433
Taek and Duk Seon got one goal
and Sun Woo and Dong Ryong got zero.

342
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,326
But I got two goals.

343
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:24,571
Because my older brother cheered for me
and shouted out my name.

344
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:30,179
My brother's dream is to be Maradona.
I made a promise to my brother.

345
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,152
I told him I'd become Maradona in place
of my brother.

346
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:36,386
I will have to work harder on soccer
from now on.

347
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:04,551
Hey, those pilots are so cool.

348
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,159
I could never be one.

349
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:30,404
Jung Hwan.

350
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:32,955
I...

351
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:39,566
I don't want you to go to the air force
academy because of me.

352
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:43,935
For my little brother...

353
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:48,400
I want him to be able to do what
he wants to do.

354
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:56,996
That is my wish.

355
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:10,129
It's not because of you.

356
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,862
It's because I really want to go.

357
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,543
Really!

358
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,667
Do you think I'm stupid
and can't even tell the difference?

359
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:35,782
-Thats.
-What do you mean by Thats?"

360
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:43,690
No... seriously! Why are
you being like this?

361
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:50,115
I really want to go. Really...

362
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:53,387
-Yeah? 
-Believe me.

363
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,852
Just believe me, OK?

364
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:09,866
Bo Ra, did you make a wish?

365
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:13,791
-How about you?
-I did.

366
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,556
What?

367
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:19,804
For you to stop smoking.

368
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:28,562
Did you make a wish?

369
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:33,368
Yeah, I made one too.

370
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,283
What was it?

371
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,124
For us to break up.

372
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:57,306
Sun Woo.

373
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,253
Let's break up.

374
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:06,554
I'm sorry.

375
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:09,747
Bo Ra.

376
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,571
If you take one more step from there...

377
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:28,202
I will never see you again.

378
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:46,626
Really, seriously!

379
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:38,828
Did you see it?

380
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:45,800
-Did you make a wish?
-No, not yet.

381
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:47,977
All right.

382
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:54,819
Jung Hwan... you have to make a wish,
OK?

383
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,091
My...

384
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:40,463
My wish is...

385
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:48,835
I wish that guy...

386
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,324
I wish that guy was a really big jerk.

387
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:54,904
Ssangmun Pharmacy

388
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:24,794
-Hello Mister!
-Hi there. How's your foot, Duk Seon?

389
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,092
You didn't sleep at the hospital
last night?

390
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:31,858
No, his mom is stuck right next to him.

391
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:34,947
Dads are pretty useless in times
like these.

392
00:45:35,425 --> 00:45:38,348
Where are you off to anyhow?
The buses aren't even running.

393
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:42,702
Hey... it is the school anniversary,
isn't it?

394
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:44,315
Is it a school day?

395
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:48,415
No, no. You're right.
It is the school anniversary day.

396
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:50,878
Reall, I was so scared.

397
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:56,677
-Where are you off to then?
-No. It's my secret.

398
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:59,085
What?

399
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:07,778
Choi Taek 9 dan. Ying Shibei...

400
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:18,319
A Mister Yoo had hemorrhoids...

401
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:22,577
Garlic... This crazy jerk!

402
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:02,661
-Hello there.
-Yes, good morning.

403
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:16,556
Be it taste or nutrition....I don't know if 
your sister is even eating a proper breakfast.

404
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:22,221
Don't you worry, Mom. She can
take care of herself just fine.

405
00:47:22,729 --> 00:47:26,942
She has money and her own room.

406
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:28,686
What are you worried about?
Worry about me instead.

407
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,088
I don't worry about
you at all, Duk Seon.

408
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,032
You have such a
good personality.

409
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:39,167
You'll do so well once

410
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:42,597
you're out in the working world.

411
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:44,856
Are you serious?

412
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,381
-Really?
-Really.

413
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,611
Duk Seon.

414
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:55,087
Is there anything you want to do?
What do you want to become?

415
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:00,228
-I have something, Mom.
-What is it?

416
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:05,153
A singer. I'm going to become a singer.

417
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,234
You can't. Do something else.

418
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:11,063
What do you mean, singer?
You should know your place.

419
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:14,535
You got noticed once in a contest
and now you've got notions in your head.

420
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:18,507
-I'm going to do it.
-You can't do it!

421
00:48:19,848 --> 00:48:20,861
You got it?

422
00:48:28,082 --> 00:48:29,362
What singer...

423
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,216
Hello?

424
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,634
What? OK.

425
00:49:21,147 --> 00:49:22,149
Jung Bong.

426
00:49:27,153 --> 00:49:30,387
What should we do, Jung Bong?
Man Ok can't make it today.

427
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:35,179
She just called me.
What are you going to do?

428
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:37,649
She can't even take one step out
her house.

429
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:42,256
She said not to wait in front
of her house because her dad's watching.

430
00:49:44,324 --> 00:49:45,410
What will you do, Jung Bong?

431
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:55,311
I'll make sure to get it to her.

432
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,377
I'll be at Bo Ra's for a bit.

433
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,884
Just lie down, would you?
Why do you keep moving around?

434
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:51,268
I'm bored and suffocated in here.

435
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:57,410
Then call Dong Il or Jae Myung
over for a chat.

436
00:50:57,577 --> 00:50:58,584
Should I?

437
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:01,953
Where are Jung Bong and Jung Hwan?

438
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:04,400
They're both probably studying.

439
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:09,311
I'm going to visit Dong Ryong
at the hospital. No one's with him?

440
00:51:09,763 --> 00:51:11,082
No, he just needs something from me.

441
00:51:12,013 --> 00:51:15,021
-I'm going now.
-OK, don't be late.

442
00:51:15,277 --> 00:51:17,176
Take a taxi if you're going to be late.

443
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:28,701
To Man Ok.

444
00:51:29,928 --> 00:51:32,327
First, happy birthday.

445
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,442
More than anyone else in the world.

446
00:51:35,815 --> 00:51:40,853
I want to wish you the happiest birthday
in the world.

447
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:44,746
Man Ok, if by any chance

448
00:51:45,088 --> 00:51:50,472
you are feeling bad that you could not
make it to our date today

449
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,731
you do not need to feel that way.

450
00:52:25,043 --> 00:52:27,570
-Come on.
-What is that?

451
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,863
I bought some blue crabs.

452
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:32,421
Sun Woo likes blue crabs a lot.

453
00:52:33,097 --> 00:52:34,210
I'll put it here.

454
00:52:34,407 --> 00:52:38,175
Why did you bring ours?
You have your own big family.

455
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,702
I got a good price at the market.

456
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,527
What are you eating there?

457
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:54,090
Missus, I didn't realize No Eul had
that kind of talent.

458
00:52:54,453 --> 00:52:58,536
Do you think a star will come out
of this neighborhood?

459
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:00,970
Don't even get started on that.

460
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:06,236
Ever since all of that.
No Eul wants to become a singer.

461
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:08,238
Then let him become one.
What's wrong with that?

462
00:53:08,372 --> 00:53:10,508
Hey no, he can't! Never.

463
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,400
He won't be able to make a living.

464
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:15,824
Do you think anyone can become a singer?

465
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,076
My dream was to be a singer when
I was young.

466
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:23,060
-What?
-Really?

467
00:53:24,525 --> 00:53:26,573
Is that so surprising?

468
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:30,555
When I was very young,
not now, but when I was young.

469
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:36,951
Well, when I was young...

470
00:53:38,326 --> 00:53:40,141
...my dream was to become a film star.

471
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:43,648
I was a big fan of Choi Moo Ryong.

472
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:46,611
I wanted to become a movie star.

473
00:53:47,763 --> 00:53:52,428
And my dream was to have one meal
with Choi Moo Ryong.

474
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,813
-How about you? What was your dream?
-Me?

475
00:54:00,587 --> 00:54:03,367
For me... an artist.

476
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:06,258
-What?
-What?

477
00:54:06,752 --> 00:54:10,246
This was when I was young, very young.
Can't I even dream when I was young?

478
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:17,359
That must be why you like to play
Go stop so much.

479
00:54:17,914 --> 00:54:20,988
You like to match the pictures and all.

480
00:54:24,016 --> 00:54:28,894
This year, there was a survey of primary
school students on their dream job.

481
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:32,200
First place was scientist
and second was professor.

482
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:35,194
Athlete and doctor followed.

483
00:54:35,895 --> 00:54:40,447
In the 1970's, government employee
and soldier were on top.

484
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,328
The results were quite different.

485
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:45,584
The change in the children's dreams
is likely influenced by...

486
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:50,139
...their parents' expectations
and the mass media.

487
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:53,538
I wanted to be a scientist, at one point.

488
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:58,430
Then I guess you've achieved your dream.
Not everyone is electronics dealership.

489
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:01,324
-Is that how it works?
-That's right.

490
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:06,855
I think Soo Dol's dad and Macgyver
are better scientists than Einstein.

491
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:12,312
By the way, what was your dream?

492
00:55:13,054 --> 00:55:15,562
You are so skilled with your hands.

493
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:18,381
I think you could have been some
sort of excellent technician.

494
00:55:20,274 --> 00:55:22,608
-A wrestler.
-What?

495
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:25,707
I wanted to become a wrestler.

496
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:27,947
If I had continued...

497
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:32,788
All of those trophies that Lee Man Ki
has would be mine right now.

498
00:55:33,925 --> 00:55:36,268
He is a very lucky person.

499
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:41,256
I think you're the lucky one.
Your back could have been broken.

500
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:45,278
You know you tend to make up lies.

501
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,438
No, I really was quite an athlete.

502
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:53,745
Suddenly... I ended up running
a clock shop.

503
00:55:54,843 --> 00:55:56,230
What about you, Teacher Yoo?

504
00:55:56,493 --> 00:56:00,251
As for me... a dancer.

505
00:56:03,057 --> 00:56:06,150
I was crazy about dancing
before going to the army.

506
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:09,746
I played a lot at the clubs.

507
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,551
-Should I show you all?
-No.

508
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:18,963
I don't know if I've still got it.

509
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:22,086
Come on everybody. Clap your hands.

510
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,819
That, looking good.

511
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:52,721
I wondered where Dong Ryong got his
fondness for playing and dancing from.

512
00:56:52,762 --> 00:56:54,619
He's just like his dad.

513
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:58,362
How did he hide that about himself?

514
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,300
And chose to become a teacher?

515
00:57:46,808 --> 00:57:48,717
Why are you out here
when your foot hurts?

516
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:54,309
It's OK. I can walk.

517
00:57:57,226 --> 00:57:59,514
You did your contest,
so why are you going to the baduk club?

518
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:02,373
If you skip one day,
will you get a thorn in your butt?

519
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:13,211
Hey, the saying is not "Butt."
Isn't it "Tongue?"

520
00:58:17,868 --> 00:58:20,782
-You should go inside.
-OK.

521
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:23,078
OK, you go on inside too.

522
00:58:58,294 --> 00:58:59,696
Come in.

523
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:07,777
-You didn't go home?
-No.

524
00:59:26,536 --> 00:59:28,624
Hey, stop it with the sleeping pills.

525
00:59:29,411 --> 00:59:31,976
OK. I'll take less from now on.

526
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,023
Duk Seon, I'm going to sleep now.

527
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:47,872
All right.

528
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,855
You should get going. Bye.

529
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,277
Sun Woo! Eat your breakfast.

530
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:57,717
Duk Seon, breakfast is ready. Come eat!

531
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,301
Jung Bong, Jung Hwan! Eat your breakfast!

532
01:02:03,662 --> 01:02:06,090
Here you are, in the middle.

533
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:10,254
Make some room, please.
Make some room, everyone.

534
01:02:11,693 --> 01:02:13,621
Let's eat, everybody.

535
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:16,133
Eat lots, my sons.

536
01:02:16,665 --> 01:02:17,723
Thank you for the food.

537
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,890
Hey, honey. This is just too delicious.
This is almost unfair.

538
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,893
You're better than Han Bok Sun
and Lee Jong Im.

539
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:34,701
-Son, is it good?
-Yes.

540
01:02:37,936 --> 01:02:40,073
What about you, my eldest son?
How is the bulgogi?

541
01:02:40,597 --> 01:02:42,431
Yes, it is very good.

542
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,311
It's really good. I'm
telling you it is.

543
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:49,569
It is so good. It's
absolutely delicious.

544
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:52,713
How can bulgogi taste like this?

545
01:02:53,078 --> 01:02:56,876
I can taste it to the tip of my tongue,
that delicious favor.

546
01:02:57,035 --> 01:02:58,949
I think my back is getting better
from this bulgogi.

547
01:02:59,537 --> 01:03:04,175
It's like the taste of 100 year old
traditional soy sauce. It's so good.

548
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,030
Here you go.

549
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,992
See, it looks good.
Hi Jin Joo.

550
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:19,900
Sun Woo, put out your
laundry if you have some.

551
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,021
And I'll clean your room today.

552
01:03:22,124 --> 01:03:25,572
No, Mom. I put all the laundry
in the machine and my room is clean.

553
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:27,416
I cleaned it yesterday.

554
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:32,357
Should we eat some soup, Jin Joo?

555
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:34,613
Here.

556
01:03:38,404 --> 01:03:39,723
Here.

557
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:47,652
Mom, how can we eat all of this?

558
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:49,485
Why can't we? I can eat it.

559
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:59,139
You're supposed to eat after
the adults start eating.

560
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:04,010
-Eat lots.
-OK.

561
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:14,311
Taek, Taek!

562
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:17,508
-Let's eat breakfast.
-OK.

563
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:26,551
Let's eat breakfast.

564
01:04:30,552 --> 01:04:31,993
I'll be right out.

565
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:52,341
-See you.
-OK.

566
01:04:54,351 --> 01:04:56,097
Bye. Open your eyes, would you?

567
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:57,956
OK. Bye.

568
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:14,776
What are you doing here?

569
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:16,825
I'm trying to wake up.

570
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:18,796
All right.

571
01:05:21,107 --> 01:05:22,459
Wait, Duk Seon.

572
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:30,515
When did you leave last night?

573
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:34,781
I left right after you said you needed
to sleep. Why?

574
01:05:38,174 --> 01:05:39,476
What is it? Did you have a dream?

575
01:05:41,899 --> 01:05:42,931
Yeah.

576
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:48,994
That's a relief.

577
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,483
What is it? Was I in your dream?
What kind of dream was it?

578
01:05:53,937 --> 01:05:57,049
No, it was just nonsense.
You don't need to be concerned.

579
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:00,900
What about Dong Ryong?

580
01:06:01,244 --> 01:06:03,159
Him? I envy him the most.

581
01:06:03,598 --> 01:06:05,503
He's probably at the hospital
playing and doing nothing.

582
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:46,564
-Dad!
-Duk Seon!

583
01:06:46,945 --> 01:06:49,790
Llook, my daughter.

584
01:06:50,122 --> 01:06:52,369
You were waiting for your dad?

585
01:06:52,895 --> 01:06:54,881
Your foot isn't even feeling well.

586
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:58,393
What is it? You wanted
to see your dad?

587
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,781
This is why I raised a daughter.

588
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:02,761
Yeah... yeah.

589
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:05,884
Dad, buy me an ice cream cone.

590
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:10,509
What the heck? You were waiting for
ice cream cone, not your dad.

591
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:13,289
Come on! I was waiting for both.

592
01:07:13,381 --> 01:07:14,584
-Dad!
-Where are we going?

593
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:15,998
Let's go eat ice cream.

594
01:07:17,821 --> 01:07:18,985
I waited for both.

595
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:27,654
Duk Seon, you've been studying
hard lately.

596
01:07:28,554 --> 01:07:29,775
It's been very tough, hasn't it?

597
01:07:31,158 --> 01:07:36,107
Dad, even if I don't get into college,
you can't mistreat me.

598
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,559
Come on.

599
01:07:38,682 --> 01:07:41,191
As if my Duk Seon
would accept mistreatment.

600
01:07:41,397 --> 01:07:43,973
And you wouldn't lose self confidence
over something like that.

601
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:48,911
No, this time I will lose confidence.

602
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,030
Duk Seon.

603
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,935
Who cares if you don't go to college?

604
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:03,215
You can do something else.

605
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,641
-Liar.
-Right?

606
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:07,735
That is a lie.

607
01:08:13,384 --> 01:08:14,576
But Duk Seon...

608
01:08:15,879 --> 01:08:18,732
You have, exactly, one year left.

609
01:08:20,072 --> 01:08:25,843
Pretend to be dead for this year.
And how about you work really hard?

610
01:08:28,227 --> 01:08:30,723
If you give up without
even trying...

611
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:32,871
...that just won't do.

612
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:39,071
Be prepared to suffer through anything
and work very hard.

613
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:43,678
And if it still doesn't work out,
then there's nothing you can do.

614
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,915
Dad, I'm going to work really hard.

615
01:08:49,663 --> 01:08:51,119
But still, if I don't get into college...

616
01:08:51,658 --> 01:08:55,493
I don't want you
to hate me, OK?

617
01:08:55,748 --> 01:08:59,097
All right, you. All
right, don't you worry.

618
01:09:00,451 --> 01:09:03,431
Duk Seon says she'll work hard.

619
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:08,969
And you've made up your mind.
I think the heavens are helping us.

620
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:14,689
By the way...

621
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:19,700
What is your dream, Duk Seon?

622
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:24,388
What kind of person
do you want to become?

623
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:32,635
Dad will support you even more than
your sister Bo Ra. So tell me.

624
01:09:34,043 --> 01:09:35,733
Don't worry about anything.

625
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:39,881
I repaid all my debts
and I'm saving lots of money now.

626
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:46,713
What is it? Is your dream a secret?

627
01:09:51,256 --> 01:09:52,364
I don't have one.

628
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:56,906
I don't have a dream, Dad.

629
01:09:58,752 --> 01:09:59,847
Pretty sad, right?

630
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,833
I must be really stupid.

631
01:10:05,328 --> 01:10:07,577
What do you mean? Stupid?

632
01:10:07,759 --> 01:10:11,446
You can get a dream then.

633
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:14,711
- Really?
- Yes, really.

634
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:18,756
When I was your age,
I didn't think about anything either.

635
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:23,135
Duk Seon, everyone is like that.
It's OK.

636
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:28,077
It's not just you, so don't worry.

637
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:34,831
It wasn't always my dream
to work at a bank.

638
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:38,872
It wasn't. I just...

639
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:45,118
I just needed to make a living,
so I worked away.

640
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:49,031
And I somehow ended up here.

641
01:10:52,077 --> 01:10:54,087
Then what's your dream now, Dad?

642
01:10:56,455 --> 01:10:59,037
What are your hopes and dreams?

643
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,923
My hopes and dreams?

644
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:10,803
I want my Bo Ra, Duk Seon...

645
01:11:11,837 --> 01:11:14,989
...and No Eul to never be in pain.

646
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,397
And to be healthy.

647
01:11:19,457 --> 01:11:22,840
That's the only dream that I have.

648
01:11:23,406 --> 01:11:25,560
No, not a dream for me but for you.

649
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:27,161
What is your dream?

650
01:11:27,894 --> 01:11:31,349
That's... that's your dad's dream.

651
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,519
Having all three of my kids being healthy
and not sick.

652
01:11:37,053 --> 01:11:40,095
Besides that, what could I want?

653
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:45,403
There's nothing.
That's the only one.

654
01:11:48,858 --> 01:11:50,264
What is that?

655
01:11:57,989 --> 01:11:59,171
What's wrong with you?

656
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,324
Why are you crying?

657
01:12:13,499 --> 01:12:17,980
I wondered where Dong Ryong got his
fondness for playing and dancing from.

658
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:19,810
He's just like his dad.

659
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,578
How did he hide that about himself?

660
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,422
And chose to become a teacher?

661
01:12:28,902 --> 01:12:31,280
I'm not in good enough shape to do it.

662
01:12:31,595 --> 01:12:35,964
Don't be like that.
Why not put out an album?

663
01:12:36,012 --> 01:12:37,537
It's in the past... the past.

664
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:43,011
When it comes to my dancing,
I don't have even this much regret.

665
01:12:43,582 --> 01:12:45,581
-Really?
-Yes, not even a bit.

666
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:49,511
I'm just concerned about my youngest
who's so much like me.

667
01:12:50,195 --> 01:12:55,826
He doesn't study and goes around dancing.
That's what worries me the most.

668
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,077
Gosh, Dong Ryong... that punk.

669
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,700
He really needs to get his act together.

670
01:13:04,456 --> 01:13:07,260
As a father,
I passed down a great thing to him.

671
01:13:07,976 --> 01:13:09,621
I really did.

672
01:13:12,052 --> 01:13:15,466
I, too, wish Taek wouldn't take after me.

673
01:13:17,248 --> 01:13:19,314
That is my dream.

674
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:21,260
What do you mean by that?

675
01:13:22,008 --> 01:13:25,073
Because he takes after you,
he's so mature and grown up.

676
01:13:25,342 --> 01:13:27,152
You don't need to worry
about Taek at all.

677
01:13:28,599 --> 01:13:30,895
He should take after good traits though.

678
01:13:32,723 --> 01:13:34,606
I want Taek to be like other kids.

679
01:13:35,592 --> 01:13:40,189
He should complain, be irritable,
and get angry.

680
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:42,900
Like that...

681
01:13:44,331 --> 01:13:48,612
I wish he would show his inner thoughts
to other people more often.

682
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:56,231
He started baduk at a young age
and was surrounded by adults.

683
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,211
He developed a habit of holding in
his anger.

684
01:14:02,954 --> 01:14:06,552
He wasn't that introverted
in the beginning.

685
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:10,486
There's nothing else for me.

686
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:15,039
I just want him to live like others his age.

687
01:14:17,288 --> 01:14:19,034
Also to stop taking sleeping pills.

688
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:23,450
For even one day,
I'd like him to sleep peacefully.

689
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:25,208
That is my dream.

690
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,711
I don't have many either.

691
01:14:30,284 --> 01:14:34,636
I want Jung Bong to be like he is now,
and not get ill.

692
01:14:35,108 --> 01:14:38,581
I want him to be healthy. I don't want
anything else for him.

693
01:14:41,377 --> 01:14:44,465
Why are you all worried about the kids?

694
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:53,030
That must be why you like to play
Go-stop so much.

695
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:56,669
You like to match the pictures and all.

696
01:15:03,503 --> 01:15:06,162
That's all in my past though.

697
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:13,110
My wish now is for Jung Bong to get
into college. That is my dream.

698
01:15:13,423 --> 01:15:17,531
Me too, me too, me too...
Also...

699
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:23,745
I wouldn't have anything to ask for
if Bo Ra's personality could soften up.

700
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:27,730
I want to put her in a mixer with
Duk Seon and just mix their personalities.

701
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:29,696
Sun Woo too.

702
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:33,017
He's just like his dad and
sticks to principles all the time.

703
01:15:33,741 --> 01:15:37,259
That's not going to work for him
once he starts working.

704
01:15:38,404 --> 01:15:40,842
You have to bend sometimes.
It can be so tiring.

705
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,719
No, don't worry about it.

706
01:15:45,038 --> 01:15:47,183
I have nothing to wish for, but...

707
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,512
Jung Hwan has such a cold, brusque
personality. It's a problem.

708
01:15:51,036 --> 01:15:54,175
He only takes after his dad's
bloody nose, not his personality.

709
01:15:57,409 --> 01:16:00,713
If you ask me what my wish is,
I don't have many.

710
01:16:00,816 --> 01:16:04,650
Just for Jin Joo and Sun Woo...

711
01:16:04,915 --> 01:16:07,411
I hope they can go out in the world
and not feel self-conscious.

712
01:16:08,036 --> 01:16:13,847
-That is my only wish.
-The kids are seniors now.

713
01:16:14,896 --> 01:16:16,460
I have one worry.

714
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:21,505
I wonder if I should feed her
herbal medicine.

715
01:16:22,187 --> 01:16:25,960
And apparently there are
so many born in the year of pig.

716
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:29,839
I don't know what happened in 1971,
but everyone was having kids.

717
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:35,018
What about my Jung Hwan?
What should I feed him?

718
01:16:35,813 --> 01:16:37,640
Where are you off to then?

719
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:42,169
-It's my secret.
-What?

720
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:45,275
I'm going to buy bananas.

721
01:16:45,711 --> 01:16:48,606
My youngest asked for bananas,
so I'm going to buy bananas.

722
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,830
But everything is probably closed
right now.

723
01:16:52,117 --> 01:16:54,976
I'm sure there's something open.
I'll be going now.

724
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,411
-Good bye.
-Bye.

725
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:07,665
Thank you. I need to go
to Youngdeungpo food market.

726
01:17:08,148 --> 01:17:09,181
Let's go.

727
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:21,643
-Hello there.
-Good morning.

728
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:00,153
1986 is Choi Taek's Year!

729
01:18:05,776 --> 01:18:07,860
Choi Taek 6-dan,
beats Japanese opponent!

730
01:18:57,581 --> 01:18:59,021
Sung Duk Seon

731
01:19:11,387 --> 01:19:13,094
Why I am the only one with no dream?

732
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:15,223
I was feeling troubled about it.

733
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:18,742
But my talk with Dad
was very comforting for me.

734
01:19:21,168 --> 01:19:24,836
However, I still envy people who
have dreams.

735
01:19:26,005 --> 01:19:28,610
I envy Ja Hyun who wants to be
a hairdresser.

736
01:19:29,277 --> 01:19:30,470
It may sound silly.

737
01:19:30,636 --> 01:19:33,043
But I also envy No Eul and his dreams
of becoming a singer.

738
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:39,201
How did they find out what they
want to do?

739
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:42,936
And why is it that I don't have
anything I want to do?

740
01:19:44,771 --> 01:19:46,980
I feel pathetic tonight.

741
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,403
Duk Seon, take this food to your sister!

742
01:20:08,718 --> 01:20:11,966
Gosh, is studying for the bar exam
some sort of an achievement?

743
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,598
Get that look off your face.

744
01:20:30,063 --> 01:20:31,756
Is this it? 108?

745
01:20:58,514 --> 01:21:00,565
What? What's with you?

746
01:21:04,897 --> 01:21:07,979
Bo Ra, you sleep in a place like this?

747
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:09,883
What's the matter with you?

748
01:21:10,362 --> 01:21:13,900
What's with the ramen?
Don't you have money? Buy rice.

749
01:21:13,992 --> 01:21:16,509
I have money. I just don't have the time.

750
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:23,542
Hey.

751
01:21:25,007 --> 01:21:26,647
Bo Ra.

752
01:21:28,966 --> 01:21:32,429
-This is stupid of you.
-What is this...

753
01:21:44,602 --> 01:21:46,755
Seriously, what's wrong?

754
01:21:47,758 --> 01:21:49,821
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed now.

755
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:54,230
Saturday, April 4, 1989.

756
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:57,194
It was the most shameful day of my life.

757
01:21:58,065 --> 01:21:59,831
I embraced Sung Bo Ra.

758
01:22:01,828 --> 01:22:06,259
Why did I do such a thing?
Regret is washing over me.

759
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:11,050
Here you go.

760
01:22:16,538 --> 01:22:21,925
Really! This thing is just filled
with so much meat.

761
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,415
Is that right? That's because
I cooked it well. Eat lots.

762
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:35,081
There's nothing to throw out here.

763
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,276
Thats, so good.

764
01:23:21,283 --> 01:23:23,087
Letter number 17.

765
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:28,138
I can hear the flower buds burst
open from everywhere.

766
01:23:29,006 --> 01:23:32,812
It is a beautiful season in which
everything comes back to life.

767
01:23:34,171 --> 01:23:36,086
Man Ok, who is like a spring day.

768
01:23:36,953 --> 01:23:38,770
Have you been well?

769
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41,385
I have been well too.

770
01:23:42,323 --> 01:23:46,333
I am curious about how you are
as I have not heard from you.

771
01:23:47,384 --> 01:23:49,822
I don't wish to burden you.

772
01:23:51,269 --> 01:23:54,088
I know the timing may be difficult
as it is your senior year.

773
01:23:54,636 --> 01:24:00,427
If you have the time,
please tell me how you're doing.

774
01:24:01,706 --> 01:24:05,901
I will be cautiously
awaiting news of you.

775
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:13,427
From your JB in Ssangmundong.

776
01:24:45,269 --> 01:24:46,292
Jung Bong.

777
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:12,560
This is my wish.

778
01:26:14,178 --> 01:26:15,586
Please forget me.

779
01:26:45,134 --> 01:26:50,360
Man Ok received 35 letters before
responding to Jung Bong.

780
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:55,257
And that letter was their last letter.

781
01:26:57,084 --> 01:27:00,436
Man Ok went to study abroad in the US
before the summer.

782
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:04,123
And I fell out of touch with her as well.

783
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:34,225
Saturday July 15, 1989.

784
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:36,890
Summer vacation had started.

785
01:27:37,275 --> 01:27:39,985
Jung Bong left for the temple.

786
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:41,733
And...

787
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:01,085
For the first time in my life,
I got a nose bleed.

788
01:28:01,683 --> 01:28:03,907
I must really be a senior, after all.

789
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:13,448
November 1, 1989.

790
01:28:13,459 --> 01:28:19,122
The Haitai Tigers baseball team
won this year.

791
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,782
There were no incidents.

792
01:28:21,401 --> 01:28:23,594
Yes, there was a small incident.

793
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:27,337
The Pacific Dolphins had advanced
to the playoffs.

794
01:28:54,444 --> 01:28:57,487
December 5, 1989.

795
01:28:58,473 --> 01:29:00,467
The first snow of the year.

796
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:16,890
Moo Sung, it's snowing.
Look, first snow of the year.

797
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:22,681
Yes, I know. I saw it.

798
01:29:35,218 --> 01:29:36,369
Have this.

799
01:29:47,658 --> 01:29:49,749
By the way, Sun Young?

800
01:29:51,795 --> 01:29:52,873
Yes?

801
01:29:54,103 --> 01:29:55,557
Since it's cold and all...

802
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:02,787
should we just live together already?

803
01:30:26,783 --> 01:30:29,512
December 8, 1989.

804
01:30:30,059 --> 01:30:34,393
We only have one week of this hellish
senior year left.

805
01:30:34,884 --> 01:30:38,516
Seven days. We only have
seven days to go.

806
01:30:40,451 --> 01:30:41,582
Taek.

807
01:30:43,158 --> 01:30:45,547
While we were in our senior year...

808
01:30:46,058 --> 01:30:48,946
Taek broke three records.

809
01:30:50,051 --> 01:30:53,325
Highest win rate in a year and
most cumulative wins.

810
01:30:53,488 --> 01:30:55,415
And the longest winning
streaks in baduk matches.

811
01:30:55,563 --> 01:31:00,481
This year, Taek had won
a whopping 111 matches.

812
01:31:04,179 --> 01:31:08,086
Tomorrow, 1989's academic exams will be
administered for the nation's 89 colleges.

813
01:31:08,319 --> 01:31:11,247
The exam will be taken at 526 locations.

814
01:31:11,776 --> 01:31:15,618
In particular, the baby boom years
of those born in 1971 will be tested.

815
01:31:15,787 --> 01:31:19,525
There is a record high of about
894,000 test takers.

816
01:31:19,972 --> 01:31:24,849
Therefore the competitive college entrance
exam in history has acceptance out of 4.57.

817
01:31:25,323 --> 01:31:28,044
Also, colleges will only be accepting
the same number as last year.

818
01:31:28,162 --> 01:31:31,985
More than any other year,
the competition will be fierce.

819
01:31:33,943 --> 01:31:37,779
December 15, 1989

820
01:31:41,917 --> 01:31:42,959
Did you do well?

821
01:31:43,836 --> 01:31:44,848
Don't ask.

822
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,167
Did you do well?

823
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:49,295
Are you kidding? I got accepted ages ago.

824
01:31:49,447 --> 01:31:51,138
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

825
01:31:51,778 --> 01:31:54,674
-What about Jung Bong?
-I think he did well.

826
01:31:55,154 --> 01:31:56,693
What else would he do at
the temple but study?

827
01:31:59,377 --> 01:32:00,444
You did well, didn't you?

828
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:04,454
-Yeah.
-Gosh, you're all so annoying.

829
01:32:05,532 --> 01:32:08,610
-What are you all doing next Saturday?
-Why?

830
01:32:10,152 --> 01:32:13,711
I have a ticket for seniors exhausted
from taking exams.

831
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:18,196
-What is it?
-Campus Music Festival.

832
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,571
-Yes...
-Taek is going too.

833
01:32:23,659 --> 01:32:26,498
What would you guys do without me?

834
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:32,528
Seriously, solving quadratic formulas.
You know nothing about the joys of life.

835
01:32:33,352 --> 01:32:34,538
Next Saturday.

836
01:32:46,787 --> 01:32:47,815
Hi.

837
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:52,447
What are you guys doing? We're late!

838
01:32:56,048 --> 01:32:58,944
December 23, 1989.

839
01:32:59,033 --> 01:33:00,922
The weather seemed like it might snow.

840
01:33:02,682 --> 01:33:06,628
We went to see the Campus Music Festival
the day before Christmas Eve.

841
01:33:07,774 --> 01:33:13,142
And this day was the last day
of our teens that we spent together.

842
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:44,502
The year changed and the number
was unfamiliar.

843
01:33:45,128 --> 01:33:47,227
It became 1990.

844
01:33:49,042 --> 01:33:51,930
And we became 20 years old.

845
01:34:25,606 --> 01:34:29,064
Jung Hwan went to Cheongju
to the air force academy.

846
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:41,943
My goodness.

847
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:49,284
Sun Woo got a scholarship
and went to medical school.

848
01:34:52,132 --> 01:34:53,852
Mom, why are you crying?

849
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:58,960
Hey, my son. My son...

850
01:34:59,089 --> 01:35:02,471
My son, my son.

851
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,769
Thank you so much.

852
01:35:03,879 --> 01:35:05,709
As for Jung Bong...

853
01:35:07,094 --> 01:35:12,547
He finally passed his test
and got into a college.

854
01:35:12,663 --> 01:35:17,440
-Victory!
-Victory!

855
01:35:24,988 --> 01:35:27,718
Civil Law

856
01:35:28,232 --> 01:35:31,511
That's how everyone took one step
toward their dream.

857
01:35:31,994 --> 01:35:35,555
I, too, started a new challenge
toward my dream.

858
01:35:35,566 --> 01:35:38,264
Today's newspaper for sale.

859
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:39,950
In March of Lunar Calendar,
when flowers bloom.

860
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:43,976
I enrolled in Noryangjin Hanssem
College Prep Academy.

861
01:35:45,237 --> 01:35:46,973
But I was not lonely.

862
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:51,214
I have my eternal partner, Dong Ryong.

863
01:35:57,686 --> 01:36:00,915
December 31, 1990

864
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:10,148
This year it's Byun Jin Seob.
He's getting the top prize.

865
01:36:10,266 --> 01:36:14,486
-It's Hyun Chul, kid.
-Just stay put.

866
01:36:15,112 --> 01:36:16,528
He's announcing it now.

867
01:36:19,611 --> 01:36:23,118
- Byun Jin Seob!
- Yeah, I knew it.

868
01:36:23,129 --> 01:36:26,539
-A woman that looks good in jeans.
-That's me.

869
01:36:31,123 --> 01:36:34,013
"My life is mine," Min Hae Kyung.

870
01:36:34,297 --> 01:36:37,223
-I don't think it will be.
-Be quiet.

871
01:36:42,356 --> 01:36:43,803
Congratulations.

872
01:36:43,814 --> 01:36:50,817
Our meeting was not coincidence.

873
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:53,649
You don't know me!

874
01:36:54,006 --> 01:36:58,040
This time I'm going to be right,
Kim Gook Hwan.

875
01:36:58,202 --> 01:36:59,216
Wrong...

876
01:36:59,294 --> 01:37:02,874
- This year it's going to be...
- Shin Seung Hoon!

877
01:37:04,233 --> 01:37:06,614
Shin Seung Hoon...

878
01:37:06,814 --> 01:37:10,444
-Shin Seung Hoon...
<b>-Shin Seung Hoon!...</b>

879
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:12,880
-Shin Seung Hoon...
-Shin Seung Hoon...

880
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:21,542
If I really can't
get it this year...

881
01:37:22,204 --> 01:37:23,844
I'll be your kid.

882
01:37:25,155 --> 01:37:29,683
-This year will be...
-Seo Taiji's "Hayeoga."

883
01:37:33,091 --> 01:37:35,152
How could I never...
not ever get it right?

884
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:38,322
It's about time I would get it.

885
01:37:39,232 --> 01:37:40,545
It's about time I would.

886
01:37:43,779 --> 01:37:48,093
October 8,1994
Honey, honey! Hold on to me.

887
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:49,713
-Hold on.
-Honey.

888
01:37:50,143 --> 01:37:52,525
-Honey, I can't look.
-I got it.

889
01:37:52,645 --> 01:37:54,297
Honey, Honey!

890
01:37:54,343 --> 01:37:56,729
I got you. I got you.

891
01:37:56,862 --> 01:37:57,999
Honey!

892
01:37:59,432 --> 01:38:01,353
What's all this fuss about?

893
01:38:01,552 --> 01:38:04,570
Hey! Do you like it that much?

894
01:38:05,168 --> 01:38:07,417
You're going to hurt yourself there.

895
01:38:09,304 --> 01:38:12,007
You went grocery shopping?
Why not just order in?

896
01:38:12,077 --> 01:38:16,090
No. The kids don't eat well as it is.

897
01:38:16,233 --> 01:38:18,490
I should cook for them when I can.

898
01:38:19,107 --> 01:38:20,429
They're all coming, right?

899
01:38:20,592 --> 01:38:23,758
Jung Hwan is coming because
it's the weekend.

900
01:38:23,923 --> 01:38:26,776
Duk Seon will be here in the evening
because of her work schedule.

901
01:38:27,055 --> 01:38:28,524
What about Dong Ryong?

902
01:38:28,543 --> 01:38:31,020
I heard he's so busy working at his
brother's restaurant.

903
01:38:31,129 --> 01:38:32,647
They are all coming.

904
01:38:32,703 --> 01:38:35,006
You know they always gather for
Taek's birthday.

905
01:38:35,472 --> 01:38:37,931
Though I suppose Taek is the busiest.

906
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:43,285
Let's feed the kids and then we can
play a round of Go stop.

907
01:38:43,747 --> 01:38:45,145
I'm in.

908
01:38:46,976 --> 01:38:48,785
Get it ready and wait for me.

909
01:38:50,197 --> 01:38:54,019
Get back on. Get back to your date.

910
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:00,566
This time, let's go from here to there.

911
01:39:00,654 --> 01:39:02,973
-Wait, honey!
-Come on now.

912
01:39:03,637 --> 01:39:04,769
Let's go.

913
01:39:05,891 --> 01:39:07,803
My dear.

914
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,395
Dad, 1000 won.
You said 100 won for one each.

915
01:39:28,517 --> 01:39:29,691
1000 won.

916
01:39:30,963 --> 01:39:32,346
I see black hair too.

917
01:39:32,577 --> 01:39:36,659
I pulled out more than ten. I'm
giving you a discount here.

918
01:39:39,397 --> 01:39:41,116
Jin Joo, Mom is here.

919
01:39:41,183 --> 01:39:43,672
I'll get that for you.
You should have called me.

920
01:39:43,856 --> 01:39:47,998
Today, Jung Hwan's coming
and Duk Seon and everyone.

921
01:39:48,101 --> 01:39:53,497
Yeah, it's been a long time!
Really.

922
01:40:17,654 --> 01:40:19,350
My goodness...

923
01:40:22,461 --> 01:40:24,749
Do you like it that much?

924
01:40:25,131 --> 01:40:29,169
You should just stick that right there
and look at it every day and night.

925
01:40:31,201 --> 01:40:33,253
I saved a lot... a lot.

926
01:40:33,347 --> 01:40:35,787
Soon, we'll be able to
move out of this basement.

927
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:38,964
That's right.

928
01:40:39,347 --> 01:40:43,152
Why must be live in a basement with
no sun forever?

929
01:40:44,186 --> 01:40:48,928
But now that our two daughters
earn money, it sure helps us to save.

930
01:40:50,597 --> 01:40:52,296
They're better than me.

931
01:40:52,773 --> 01:40:57,102
If I knew it would be like this,
I should have had only daughters.

932
01:40:57,193 --> 01:40:58,285
Daughters are the best.

933
01:40:58,407 --> 01:41:02,472
No, it's not that daughters are great.
It's that our daughters are the best.

934
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:06,723
Yeah, Duk Seon is coming
today for sure, isn't she?

935
01:41:07,175 --> 01:41:09,138
Of course, it is Taek's birthday today.

936
01:41:09,419 --> 01:41:12,715
Bo Ra is coming later tonight because
tomorrow's Sunday.

937
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:18,664
Now that you brought it up,
I'm glad my daughters are making money.

938
01:41:19,544 --> 01:41:23,551
Even if I can't see their faces
at meal time anymore.

939
01:41:23,568 --> 01:41:27,403
I see their faces on the weekends
and then they're gone.

940
01:41:28,662 --> 01:41:32,393
Then one day, these girls...

941
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,524
...they will get married and how
will I live in this empty house?

942
01:41:41,991 --> 01:41:44,270
Yeah, you are right.

943
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:51,167
Hey, why are you crying
about it now?

944
01:41:51,696 --> 01:41:54,401
I'm just bringing up the future.

945
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:55,981
Don't cry so easily.

946
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:00,892
It's not so far in the future.
Just you wait a bit.

947
01:42:01,446 --> 01:42:05,650
They will bring someone
and say they are going to get married.

948
01:42:05,989 --> 01:42:09,933
Well, were you planning on living
with them for thousands of years?

949
01:42:10,469 --> 01:42:11,863
Are you OK with it?

950
01:42:13,673 --> 01:42:16,376
I'm getting teary already.

951
01:42:22,224 --> 01:42:23,893
Just thinking about it...

952
01:42:24,211 --> 01:42:28,405
I don't know if I could enter
the wedding hall like this.

953
01:42:29,884 --> 01:42:34,054
Why would I cry at all?
You will see.

954
01:42:34,372 --> 01:42:37,281
In the future on Duk Seon and Bo Ra's
wedding days

955
01:42:37,388 --> 01:42:40,007
I'll be so happy when I walk in
holding the bride's hand.

956
01:42:40,095 --> 01:42:43,317
I'll be dancing and smiling as I walk in.

957
01:42:45,015 --> 01:42:46,203
Are you for real?

958
01:42:46,712 --> 01:42:51,264
I'll be watching you to see
if you cry or not.

959
01:42:51,421 --> 01:42:53,113
You can watch over me.

960
01:42:53,342 --> 01:42:56,840
If I cry at the wedding at all,
I'll be your dog's son.

961
01:43:57,001 --> 01:43:59,231
Where's your mom?
Is she still on the bike?

962
01:44:18,282 --> 01:44:21,128
Yes, Mi Ran! You are really good now.

963
01:44:21,231 --> 01:44:23,514
You should just go now. Go fast.
That's right.

964
01:44:29,372 --> 01:44:30,456
Sung Kyun.

965
01:44:34,942 --> 01:44:39,645
No! Honey, are you all right?
Sung Kyun, Sung Kyun!

966
01:44:39,722 --> 01:44:40,783
Honey!

967
01:44:48,853 --> 01:44:49,951
Mom, I'm home.

968
01:44:50,182 --> 01:44:51,483
What about dinner?

969
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,059
-I ate.
-OK.

970
01:45:35,059 --> 01:45:38,048
You can go home early today.
You worked hard staying up all night.

971
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:40,578
See you tomorrow...

972
01:45:41,175 --> 01:45:42,359
Thank you.

973
01:45:43,516 --> 01:45:47,064
Sun Woo, you know there's a class reunion,
right? We're going to Space today.

974
01:45:47,378 --> 01:45:51,179
-You're definitely in the basement.
-Hey, come on.

975
01:45:51,456 --> 01:45:54,213
I can't today anyways.
It's my closest friend's birthday.

976
01:45:54,322 --> 01:45:55,322
What?

977
01:45:55,378 --> 01:45:57,495
It's Choi Taek 9 dan's birthday.

978
01:45:57,694 --> 01:45:58,957
I'll be going now.

979
01:46:00,837 --> 01:46:04,019
Hey... tell him happy birthday.

980
01:46:33,114 --> 01:46:34,257
I'll be going now.

981
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:38,490
Yes, why are you going home
so early today, Choi Taek 9 dan?

982
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:40,994
I have plans with my friends.

983
01:46:41,544 --> 01:46:42,505
I know that.

984
01:46:42,516 --> 01:46:47,174
Your juniors wanted to have a birthday
party for you but I stopped them.

985
01:46:47,343 --> 01:46:48,730
I told them that you had important plans.

986
01:46:49,417 --> 01:46:51,481
-Thank you.
-You have your car, right?

987
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,927
-Yes.
-Should I pull it around for you?

988
01:46:54,483 --> 01:46:56,859
Don't go in and out a hundred times
like last time.

989
01:46:57,038 --> 01:46:59,091
I parked in a wide spot this time.

990
01:47:00,244 --> 01:47:01,284
I'll be going.

991
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:07,418
He bought a car?

992
01:47:07,706 --> 01:47:08,825
You didn't know?

993
01:47:09,111 --> 01:47:11,931
He got it as a prize
after winning the Toyota competition.

994
01:47:12,743 --> 01:47:15,403
Choi Taek 9 dan actually drives?

995
01:47:16,202 --> 01:47:17,342
That car goes?

996
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:20,916
It does go.

997
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:24,756
But he can't park.

998
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,800
Mom, I'm home.

999
01:47:46,721 --> 01:47:48,422
-Jung Hwan.
-Son...

1000
01:47:48,433 --> 01:47:50,774
-Jung Hwan!
-Son.

1001
01:47:51,004 --> 01:47:53,021
-Son!
-Jung Hwan...

1002
01:47:53,283 --> 01:47:55,119
-Jung Hwan!
-Son!

1003
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:56,923
My son!

1004
01:48:35,849 --> 01:48:37,164
Mom, I'm home.

1005
01:48:37,383 --> 01:48:39,282
Dad, your second daughter is home.

1006
01:48:39,354 --> 01:48:40,475
Duk Seon!

1007
01:48:41,154 --> 01:48:44,537
No Eul! Why have you gotten so young?

1008
01:48:45,629 --> 01:48:46,951
Get in here, you wench!

1009
01:48:51,657 --> 01:48:53,325
Do you have anything you need me to do?

1010
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:55,151
Study.

1011
01:48:57,977 --> 01:48:59,013
Really!

1012
01:49:01,103 --> 01:49:03,684
His nickname is Trash.

1013
01:49:04,222 --> 01:49:05,233
What?

1014
01:49:05,848 --> 01:49:07,017
Kim Jae Joon

1015
01:49:07,081 --> 01:49:08,620
Thanks. I'll pay you back.

1016
01:49:08,677 --> 01:49:11,454
You make it obvious you're from Seoul.
No need to pay me back.

1017
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,211
Hey! I'm popular too.

1018
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:16,975
-Don't get dumped this time, Duk Seon.
-I'm not getting dumped!

1019
01:49:24,089 --> 01:49:25,420
Why can't you date?

1020
01:49:26,199 --> 01:49:27,724
I made a lot of effort.

1021
01:49:28,164 --> 01:49:29,401
Make more effort.

1022
01:49:31,067 --> 01:49:33,532
You're going to die without ever
telling her how you feel.

1023
01:49:35,471 --> 01:49:36,505
Duk Seon...

1024
01:49:40,967 --> 01:49:42,909
I wanted to tell you for a long time.
