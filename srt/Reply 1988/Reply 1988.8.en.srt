00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:45,480
December 1988
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmundong

2
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:38,375
Mr. Choi!

3
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:40,544
Where did you get such pretty gloves?

4
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:43,254
Wow. Did a lady friend
get them for you?

5
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,679
I'm not crazy, right?
Those are actually pink, right?

6
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,179
Where did you get those gloves?

7
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:52,423
Taek gave them to me
as my birthday gift.

8
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:57,819
Wow, our Taek is so cool.

9
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,079
He bought his dad such pretty pink ones!

10
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:40,197
Episode 8: One Warm Remark

11
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,192
Do you two think that I'm an idiot?

12
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:45,257
No.

13
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,066
This time, it's for real.

14
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:48,138
Hey.

15
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:49,506
Isn't it obvious?

16
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,955
He's totally crazy about you!

17
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,901
Of course he is.
Hey.

18
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,189
Why else would he
come all the way...

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,337
..to the McDonald's
in Apgujung from Ssangmundong?

20
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,865
He totally likes you!

21
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:03,991
Congratulations, Duk Seon.

22
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,844
You just got yourself
a boyfriend again.

23
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,839
Shut it!
Pipe down, already.

24
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:10,983
When I think about how humiliated
I was because of you two, I...

25
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,689
Hey.

26
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,687
Also, what do you guys
even know about men anyway, huh?

27
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,775
If you rush to conclusions
one more time, I'll end you!

28
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,557
All right, already.

29
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:29,899
Hey, Joey Wang.

30
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,383
Your hair color looks nice.

31
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:32,693
What did you dye it with?

32
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:34,355
Oh, this?

33
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,016
Hydrogen peroxide.

34
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:38,368
What?
You did that to your hair?

35
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,013
Just get it done at the salon!

36
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,222
Hey.

37
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,507
Why don't you stay out of this one,
Ms. Rich Girl?

38
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,747
Us two, broke girls
are in the middle of talking.

39
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,402
Wow, Sung Duk Seon!

40
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,159
You know the English word, "talking?"

41
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:51,906
Are you kidding me?

42
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,863
Should I dye my hair
during winter break, too?

43
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,158
I have hydrogen peroxide at home.

44
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,968
Don't, don't. Use something else.

45
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,454
My head hurts so much from the smell.

46
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:01,165
Really?
What should I use, then?

47
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,490
What else?

48
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,046
Duk Seon.

49
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:36,937
Where did you go this morning?

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,360
To meet the girls.

51
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,651
What did you eat?

52
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:40,927
Ddukbokki.

53
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,072
Why?
Did something happen?

54
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,256
Never mind.

55
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,865
What's with Mom?
Did something happen?

56
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,334
Apparently, 30,000 won
disappeared from her wallet.

57
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,267
So?

58
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,064
It wasn't you?

59
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:08,357
What does she take me for?

60
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,326
Where's the hair dryer?

61
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:23,760
Why are you digging through
someone else's wallet?

62
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:26,626
You call yourself an older sister? How
could you doubt your younger sister?

63
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,978
Here!
Happy?

64
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,980
If it's not you, whatever.

65
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,404
It wasn't me, Mom!
It really wasn't me!

66
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,580
I didn't take it!

67
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,854
I don't even know
where you keep your wallet!

68
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,490
Why are you doubting me?

69
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:52,846
I really didn't take it!
Really!

70
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:54,965
OK, Duk Seon.
OK.

71
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,568
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:02,787
Want a sweet potato?

73
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,355
Does it taste good?

74
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:15,868
Yes.

75
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:18,061
But Mom...

76
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,286
Yes?

77
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,234
It might be No Eul.

78
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,088
He's the only one who
could have done it, right?

79
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,157
Even if he did,
don't say anything to him.

80
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:34,390
He'll feel hurt by that
and go down a crooked path.

81
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:37,934
He'll rebel because
I suspected him.

82
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,377
Got it?

83
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,171
OK?

84
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,960
What about me, then?

85
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,978
You're not worried about me
going down a crooked path?

86
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,590
Bo Ra...
Have some sweet potatoes.

87
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,688
What about me?

88
00:06:55,847 --> 00:07:00,047
I'm only a year older than him!
I feel hurt too, you know!

89
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:10,937
Oh yeah.

90
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,098
Isn't today the day that Jung Bong
gets the test results?

91
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:14,543
Probably.

92
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,333
I wonder how he did...

93
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:36,248
We could have misheard.
I'll call them again.

94
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:38,842
I'm sorry. You didn't pass.

95
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,569
I apologize.

96
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:08,800
I have nothing to say.

97
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,080
It's fine.

98
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,354
You can just take it again. Right?

99
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,207
Geez, you're going to cause an earthquake
with your tremendous sighs!

100
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,853
What's on your head? Is it Sports Day?

101
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,064
Jung Bong.
Go to your room and rest.

102
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,801
You're being hospitalized tomorrow.
It's no good for you to be stressed.

103
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:32,712
Hurry!
Go to your room!

104
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,876
It's fine!
Chin up, OK?

105
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,791
Kim Jung Bong!
These things happen!

106
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:49,272
They call it an exam
because you might fail!

107
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:51,256
It wouldn't be an exam if
everyone passed every time!

108
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,332
It's OK! OK?

109
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,947
If only he wasn't getting surgery...

110
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,992
Even so, he grew up so well.

111
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,143
I'm thankful, even just for that.

112
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,681
You sure are hard to please.

113
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,557
Did you forget everything already?

114
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,070
No...

115
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,399
Honey, leave the house
for about two hours.

116
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:21,972
Go to Mr. Choi's
jewelry shop or something.

117
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,053
And what will you be doing?

118
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,663
The lady from Amore is coming.

119
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:26,333
Just go play outside for two hours.

120
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:27,743
Are you going to buy makeup again?

121
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,472
Just leave!

122
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:31,613
OK, OK. I'm going.

123
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:34,611
But why two hours?
Doesn't it usually only last an hour?

124
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,693
The woman from Jutanhak is coming too.

125
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:47,457
Oh, really?

126
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,423
Yeah, I ate.

127
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:54,649
Where would I go, on a weekend?

128
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:57,765
No. I told you,
I'm not going.

129
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,713
You're going?

130
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:02,848
It can't be helped then.

131
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,434
We can just meet up next week.

132
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:08,863
Don't be disappointed that
I'm not asking you not to go.

133
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,668
I thought you were going because
you had something to take care of.

134
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,834
I told you, go ahead.

135
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,367
I'll be fine.

136
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:19,395
Hurry it up.
I'm expecting a call.

137
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:21,733
Yeah.

138
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:24,322
OK. See you next week.

139
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:25,395
OK.

140
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:29,210
Who would you be expecting a call from?

141
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:31,886
Dong Ryong! We're going to watch
the Pop Top Ten together today.

142
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,599
When did you guys ever
call before meeting up?

143
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,165
Hello?

144
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,700
Oh, Hwang Hee Soo?

145
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,146
What's up?

146
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:46,385
Right now?

147
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,209
Hi, Bo Ra.

148
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:53,871
That's "hello" to you, punk.

149
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:56,051
Hello.

150
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,408
Are you going somewhere?

151
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,061
I'm going to see my boyfriend.

152
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:12,146
Oh, top-of-the-morning to you!

153
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:13,684
Greet me properly, darn it!

154
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,836
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, ma'am.

155
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,362
Watch yourself, kid.

156
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:18,974
I will indeed watch myself, ma'am!

157
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:22,988
You like her, even when she's like that?

158
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,587
-Not that attitude in particular.
-Right?

159
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,693
You're human after all, too?

160
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,640
What are you going to do? She says
she's going to see her boyfriend.

161
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,967
No, she isn't.

162
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,496
When she goes to meet her boyfriend,
she always wears a skirt.

163
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,559
But look.
She wore pants.

164
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,408
She just lied on purpose,
for me to hear.

165
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,677
That freak.

166
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,252
He freaks me out.

167
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,486
She's not human.

168
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,787
What is she then?

169
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:56,686
A daffodil...

170
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:58,254
Crazy jerk.

171
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,986
You've moved on
from Joey Wang, then?

172
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,996
Yeah.
Ji Yeon's the best.

173
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:04,163
She's not really my type.

174
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,129
Yeah, of course not.

175
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,387
This jerk is into aggressive girls.

176
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,010
You know, strong girls and such.

177
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:17,387
Yeah.

178
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,896
You know, someone like Bo Ra.

179
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,553
Well, that's plausible.

180
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,888
But I'll bet that even she doesn't
act that way in front of her boyfriend.

181
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:31,686
What do you mean?

182
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:34,292
You guys really don't know anything.

183
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,601
All you know are formulas.
You know nothing about women.

184
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,787
No matter how much girls fool around
and do the crab-leg dance at home

185
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,787
...she'll be on her best behavior
in front of the guy she likes.

186
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:48,417
If a girl fools around or does
the crab-leg dance in front of you...

187
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:50,887
...that means that she doesn't
see you as a man.

188
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,287
If she did, she wouldn't
act like that, no matter what.

189
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,201
She'd be too embarrassed.

190
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:49,621
Who is it?

191
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,772
I'm the young lady from Amore!

192
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,263
Sun Young?

193
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:59,211
This feels so good...

194
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:05,321
-Wow. Thanks to you...
-This is great...

195
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,821
She does it the best.

196
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:09,743
It feels so nice.

197
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,079
Don't smile.
You'll get wrinkles.

198
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:16,321
Your skin is so good!

199
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:18,101
Maybe it's because you're
an affluent woman?

200
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,821
She's always had great skin.

201
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:21,922
Even so, she took such good care of it.

202
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:25,121
And it seems that she never gets
stressed out!

203
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:27,555
Well, figures, since
you live in such a big home.

204
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,202
What concerns could you possibly have?

205
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,846
Does it really seem like that?

206
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,372
Of course!

207
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:39,171
You look like such an affluent woman
who's never suffered once in her life!

208
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,981
Wow... I'm so jealous!

209
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,599
Does it really seem that way?

210
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,182
She really looks like someone
who's never suffered once in her life?

211
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,523
Yes!

212
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:52,525
-Wow... you've succeeded!
-I'll say.

213
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,629
What do you mean?

214
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:56,652
Oh, nothing.

215
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:57,923
Oh yeah.

216
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,693
You're going to give us
a lot of samples today, right?

217
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:03,105
Of course! You bought all that makeup,
so of course I will!

218
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:06,743
Just give us 300 or so.

219
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,922
Oh, my!

220
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,700
-Rock, papers, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, papers, scissors, shoot!

221
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,121
-All right!
-All right!

222
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,124
I'm not good at making ramen, though.

223
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:17,925
La Bamba

224
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:21,223
Stop messing around. You make it every
day because of Jung Bong. Hurry up, go!

225
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:22,755
I'm hungry!
Hurry up!

226
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:24,780
Darn it...

227
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:27,215
It's been a while
since Taek's been home.

228
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,252
Ramyun won't do.

229
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,948
Let's just order in.
OK? How about it?

230
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,573
-I want ramen.
-You little...

231
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,833
Don't turn it on until I get back,
all right? I haven't seen "La Bamba!"

232
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:37,443
Hurry the hell up and go!

233
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,702
Oh yeah.

234
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,347
You didn't forget about tomorrow...
right, Taek?

235
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:59,113
Wow look at you
and your selective memory.

236
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:00,666
You forgot, didn't you?

237
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:04,822
We're all going to see a movie
in Jongro tomorrow, remember?

238
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,422
I bought the tickets
at the theater in Jongro.

239
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:10,423
I stood in line for an hour!

240
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:12,422
I remember now.

241
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:15,422
I have a competition tomorrow though
and it'll be late when it's over.

242
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:18,833
Hey, that's why we decided to see it
in the evening, in the first place!

243
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,042
Did you forget?

244
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,185
Oh yeah... you're right.

245
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,656
Yes, that's right,
Master Choi Taek.

246
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,308
Do you even know where
the theater is?

247
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:27,659
Yeah. I just have to go to Jongro.
The Dansungsa Theater,  right?

248
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,890
Yes, that's right
but just wait for us at the club.

249
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,559
We'll come pick you up.

250
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,651
It's fine.
You think I can't even find a theater?

251
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,002
-Yep. You can't.
-Yep. You can't.

252
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:40,061
It's on the way to the theater anyway,
so we'll come get you.

253
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:43,602
Don't take a taxi, get off somewhere
weird and wander away again.

254
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:44,821
Got it?

255
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:48,022
Don't go wandering off
and wait for me. OK, honey?

256
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,593
Hasn't it been forever
since you went to the movies?

257
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,105
Not since we finished middle school, right?

258
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,232
He went with me a while ago.

259
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:55,874
Oh, really? Was it fun?
What did you watch?

260
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,222
As if he'd know.
He slept through the whole thing.

261
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:01,422
He'd stayed up two nights in a row
before he came.

262
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:39,321
Who is it?

263
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,756
I'm the lady from Jutanhak!

264
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,144
What the hell is this?

265
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,121
I just tossed in whatever
was in the fridge.

266
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,122
That's how we make it at our place.

267
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,493
My older brother eats like this.

268
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:15,839
It tastes great!

269
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:18,410
Thanks.

270
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:20,519
When is his surgery?

271
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,421
This weekend.
He'll be hospitalized tomorrow.

272
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,601
We all have to go visit him there.
Which hospital is it?

273
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,894
No need for that. He's just
having a one-hour surgery.

274
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:30,122
You don't need to come.

275
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:32,729
One hour?
It only takes that long?

276
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,840
Didn't it take about ten hours last year?

277
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,122
He had to get new valves that time.

278
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,434
This time, they're just
changing the batteries in it.

279
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:41,777
What about his exam?

280
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,116
Did he get into college?

281
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:47,302
He failed.

282
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:50,018
Your nose is bleeding.

283
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,909
I guess winter really has come.

284
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,421
What if you're sick, too?

285
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:00,821
What are you saying?

286
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:03,022
He got a checkup
but they said he's fine.

287
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,525
They said it was his immune system.
He and his brother have weak bodies.

288
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:08,249
I wonder how many perverted
things he saw for it to be this bad.

289
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,959
It's because of my immune system, OK?

290
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:11,254
Good for you.

291
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,809
You little...

292
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,876
Even so, I'll bet your mother
feels sad about it.

293
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:18,290
Even if it's a simple surgery.

294
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:21,422
Who?
My mom?

295
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,929
We're talking about Ms. Ra here.

296
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,921
-Wow, feels great!
-My face feels so soft.

297
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:29,677
Sun Young, look at my face!
How does it look?

298
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,631
You look beautiful!

299
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:35,055
Thanks!
You look pretty, too!

300
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,789
I feel like an affluent woman!

301
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,321
Wow! Look at your hands!

302
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:44,455
Wow! They're so soft!

303
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,076
I'll bet this lady lives like a queen!

304
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,616
Why do you say that?

305
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:54,600
Your hands are so soft. It looks
like they've never touched cold water.

306
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,237
Isn't that right?

307
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,456
And you have no worry lines
on your face either!

308
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,053
I'm so jealous!

309
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,532
Oh my... even it's just flattery,
it's nice to hear.

310
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:07,352
What do you mean?
It's as clear as day, here!

311
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:10,822
But you're going to give us
a lot of samples, right?

312
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,199
The young lady from Amore left us a ton!

313
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,804
Oh, of course!
I'll leave you a ton!

314
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,958
You bought so much at once, after all!

315
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:20,873
Just leave us 300 or so.

316
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,421
Let me see your face.

317
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:34,815
Wow, you're glowing!

318
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,397
No matter how I look at you

319
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:39,122
...you're not the same person
you were three years ago.

320
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,729
Is there anyone who has
suffered as much as you?

321
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,527
Just ask anyone who has suffered
more than you to step forward!

322
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,394
Words can't express
just how much you've suffered.

323
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:52,223
Yeah. Strange things happen in life?

324
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:56,360
I can't believe they'd say such things.

325
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:01,223
You suffered so much
when Jung Bong got sick.

326
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:04,835
Wow.
You're really a fighter.

327
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,294
You'd leave Jung Bong at home to go work.

328
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,223
You used to wallpaper
people's walls, right?

329
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,962
Yeah, I'd do that
and I would deliver newspapers.

330
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:15,421
And I worked at a restaurant.

331
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:17,421
You're really incredible.

332
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:20,970
If someone told me my child had
heart disease, I'd pass out right there.

333
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,821
What else was I supposed to do?

334
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:26,286
He had to get surgery
but I had no money.

335
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,333
I had to earn money any way I could.

336
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:31,497
There were times that my husband and I
starved for a day or two, too.

337
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,621
Wow... and you didn't even tell me!

338
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:35,933
You're really something!

339
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:38,602
It's not like I was the only poor one.
You two had it worse.

340
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:42,305
Well, yes.

341
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:44,820
Oh, yeah. What kind of surgery
is he getting this time?

342
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:48,730
Didn't he get a new valve
or something last time?

343
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,721
Yeah. He got that surgery last year.

344
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,313
Why does he need surgery again?

345
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:56,222
Oh, it's a simple one this time around.

346
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:58,795
There's a battery-like thing inside
and they need to swap it.

347
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:01,526
It'll be about an hour?
Two, if it takes a long time.

348
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:02,888
It'll be over quickly, then.

349
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:04,522
Yeah.

350
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:09,254
Even so, if my child were
getting surgery, simple as it may be...

351
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:13,129
...I'd be so nervous,
I wouldn't be able to eat anything!

352
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,796
Why worry?

353
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:18,444
We have money now, so the best doctor
in Korea is operating on him.

354
00:22:18,657 --> 00:22:19,928
There's nothing to worry about.

355
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:24,447
You're such a tough one!

356
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,879
That's how she managed to endure
during those hard times!

357
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:29,302
Otherwise, you would've
gone mad already, right?

358
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:30,795
Exactly.

359
00:22:31,336 --> 00:22:33,322
But where's Jung Bong?
Where did he go?

360
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,222
Hey. We've heard all the songs
on the LP already.

361
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,841
Hurry up and spill it.

362
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:08,921
What is it?

363
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:11,023
What's so bad
that you can't tell a friend?

364
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:15,112
-Bo Ra.
-Yeah?

365
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:17,822
About Jong Hoon...

366
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,651
Jong Hoon?

367
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,023
No, I mean, upperclassman Jong Hoon.

368
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:26,550
What is this?

369
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,222
Why are you referring
to my boyfriend so casually?

370
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:31,222
There's really nothing between us.

371
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,647
What do you mean?

372
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,622
Did something happen between you two?

373
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:42,444
I felt that you should know,
no matter what.

374
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:47,098
On the day you couldn't go on
the retreat because of family issues...

375
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:51,222
I had a lot to drink that day.

376
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:56,121
I drank a lot and upperclassman
Jong Hoon was really drunk too.

377
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:57,369
And so?

378
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:02,922
I went out for a bit
to get some fresh air...

379
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:08,222
...and upperclassman Jong Hoon followed
me out, saying his head hurt too.

380
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,159
Did you two kiss?

381
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:21,779
I'm sorry, Bo Ra.

382
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:24,022
It was honestly a mistake!

383
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,317
The two of us were way too drunk.
We weren't in our right minds.

384
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,504
I'm really sorry.

385
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:39,640
I felt so bad, I couldn't even
look you in the eyes properly.

386
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:45,816
Even so, you're my friend, so...

387
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,321
...you're my best friend, so...

388
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:50,723
I couldn't just keep quiet
and let it slide.

389
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,431
Bo Ra!

390
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:55,624
I'm sorry.
Really.

391
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:56,635
It's fine.

392
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,621
I'm not going to associate
myself with him anymore.

393
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:01,753
So don't cry.

394
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:09,925
And I'm not associating myself
with you anymore, either.

395
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:11,222
Friend?

396
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:13,032
As if.

397
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:29,335
Buckwheat jelly for sale!

398
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,590
No Eul, what time is it now?

399
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,546
I bet your dad is having
a drink somewhere again.

400
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:43,054
What a wretched fate...

401
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:46,473
My Il Hwa!

402
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,375
I'm home!

403
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:52,199
Hey. Your hubby is here!

404
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:54,974
You're at it again! You drank up a storm,
didn't you?

405
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,797
Is that any way
to talk to your husband?

406
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:04,075
I really tried to come home early today...

407
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:07,109
...but there was something really
important to be done at the bank, so...

408
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:11,445
...it couldn't be helped
and I just had one drink.

409
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:15,575
Work, my ass! How is it that you have
to work overtime every single day?

410
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:19,374
And just what is that, now?

411
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,689
This is a liquid that erases ink!

412
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,974
It's the first time you've seen
such a thing, right?

413
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,228
So, uh...

414
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:33,042
I was taking the subway
on my way home...

415
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:38,151
...and I saw a kid,
about No Eul's age, selling these!

416
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:40,374
Oh my, oh my...

417
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:43,052
You know as well as I do...

418
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:45,874
...that I usually don't buy
this kind of stuff!

419
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:50,452
But they said that this
really erases ink!

420
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:54,374
I would've regretted it if I didn't
buy it, so I bought just one.

421
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:57,564
And then... I bought just one more!

422
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:02,575
And then, just three!

423
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,575
Wait a minute.
Where's the ink?

424
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:13,075
Let's just see.

425
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:29,172
It's OK!

426
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:33,646
I can just get it out
with this stuff!

427
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,982
Just watch! Just watch.

428
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,035
You take this here, and
do this, and then... this.

429
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:44,197
You just sprinkle it on here,
like so. Rub, rub, rub, rub!

430
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,566
And then, you just rub it in!

431
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:49,519
Like this! Rub, rub, rub, rub.

432
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,300
Rub, rub !

433
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,457
This is weird... it worked so well
during the demo on the subway.

434
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,119
You half-wit! Half-wit!

435
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,749
How can you call your husband that?
A half-wit? A half-wit?

436
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,737
What else would you be then?
You idiot!

437
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,941
What does that mean?

438
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,010
I'm calling you an idiot, stupid!

439
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:20,751
How dare you call your husband an idiot?
Why I ought to...

440
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:23,586
Wow, what a saint we have here!

441
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:25,400
How many years ago
was your last promotion?

442
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:27,246
Why the hell are you
bringing that up now?

443
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:32,025
What does that have
to do with this liquid?

444
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,799
If you had performed
your wifely duties better...

445
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,700
...I would have kept on
being promoted by now...

446
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:40,117
Promoted, my ass!

447
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:44,713
My ass? My ass?
How dare you talk to me that way?

448
00:29:44,724 --> 00:29:46,057
Yeah, you heard me!

449
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,500
If only... imagine you didn't
rack up all that debt?

450
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:50,572
Would we still be living like this,
in a half-basement? Huh?

451
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:54,391
Why are you bringing up
irrelevant things again?

452
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,914
I dare you to say that again!
I'll kill you!

453
00:29:58,052 --> 00:29:59,086
What did you say?

454
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,378
What did you say you'd do to me?

455
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:04,221
Go ahead and try to kill me, then!
Go ahead!

456
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,599
-What are you doing?
-Go ahead!

457
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,296
You must be out of your mind!

458
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:09,385
Just try and kill me!

459
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:23,854
Are you... OK?

460
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:25,951
What do we do?

461
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,293
Can you see with that eye?

462
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,994
How many fingers am I holding up?

463
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:31,990
-Try and count them.
-I'll kill you...

464
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,984
What's all this, Big Bro?

465
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:50,228
This is my other half.

466
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:01,137
These are my Rubik's cubes...

467
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:05,949
And this is my stamp collection.

468
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:14,044
And these are my
Campus Music Festival LPs.

469
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:19,994
And these are all
the movie posters I've collected.

470
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,723
And this is...

471
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,260
...my journal.

472
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:32,958
I'll give you all of this.

473
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:34,751
I don't need any of this anymore.

474
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,360
Quit overreacting!

475
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:42,506
Why are you making such a big deal
over an hour-long surgery?

476
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:47,304
Even so, surgery is surgery.

477
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:49,134
Big Bro.

478
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:51,717
They say that the chances of the surgery
failing are less than three percent.

479
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:53,353
I looked into it already.

480
00:31:56,607 --> 00:32:01,877
The chance of getting heart disease when
you're young is less than two percent.

481
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:09,085
That's why I'm so scared
of that three percent chance.

482
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,725
Stop overreacting!

483
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,992
Big Bro! They say that it's a surgery
that doctors can do with their eyes shut.

484
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:37,727
Stop saying silly things
and go to sleep already.

485
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,472
Want to sleep with me tonight,
Little Bro?

486
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,677
That's a little...

487
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,886
Yeah.
I'm not too keen on it, either.

488
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:20,749
I'm home.

489
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,558
Oh, you're home?
Hurry and wash up.

490
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,719
Are you hungry?

491
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,038
I'm fine.

492
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:31,085
Oh my God, oh my God.
I'm totally hungry!

493
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:33,077
-Want to eat red bean porridge?
-Yeah.

494
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,700
Honey.

495
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,729
Do you want a bowl
of red bean porridge, too?

496
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:42,253
I do, indeed.

497
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:45,124
You must have been inconvenienced
by other household affairs...

498
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,915
When did you find the time
to make such a thing?

499
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:52,196
What's with your eye, Dad?
Did you get hit?

500
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,940
It's nothing, child of mine.

501
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,483
Mom threw a rock at him.

502
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:57,707
Do you want red bean porridge,
No Eul?

503
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:59,875
I'm good... ma'am.

504
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:00,875
All right.

505
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:01,886
Darling.

506
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:07,319
May I inconvenience you by
asking you for a glass of cold water?

507
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,086
Of course I'll get it for you!

508
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:12,410
Is there anything else you might like?

509
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,406
No, my lady.

510
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,004
Ah, yes.

511
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,971
I shall change
the charcoal briquette out tonight.

512
00:34:22,037 --> 00:34:23,925
Oh my, I'm so thankful!

513
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,835
I'll leave it to you, then!

514
00:34:28,744 --> 00:34:31,744
Don't stand the pillow up
like that, jerk.

515
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,561
If you could wait for me, my lady...

516
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,384
What's with them?

517
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,727
They decided to speak formally
to each other, starting today.

518
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:42,181
What?
Why?

519
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,029
They said they keep fighting because
of the way they speak to each other.

520
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:47,092
They say it's embarrassing
doing that in front of us.

521
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:49,323
This is more embarrassing, though.

522
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,129
Exactly, my lady.

523
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:59,408
Food's ready!
Time to eat!

524
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:04,496
Why don't any of you ever come out
the first time I call you?

525
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,927
What are you doing? Eat!

526
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,717
There's not much we're packing this year.

527
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:17,340
I stuffed the entire car
with luggage last year.

528
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:18,969
What's with this,
first thing in the morning?

529
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,080
Stop saying useless crap
and eat already.

530
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,843
Bonggie!
Let's eat breakfast!

531
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:31,148
I don't want to.

532
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:36,811
Hurry and wake the hell up!

533
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:40,123
Don't ask me to make you something later!
Just eat with everyone else!

534
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:45,543
I don't think I can
stomach anything right now.

535
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:48,127
What the hell are you saying?
Hurry the hell up!

536
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:58,677
Mom.
We don't have pork cutlets?

537
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:00,417
We always have the same sides.

538
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:04,022
Just eat. Don't you complain
about side dishes either.

539
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:08,625
Honey, hurry over!
The soup will get cold!

540
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:10,542
Apparently, the two of them decided
to use formal speech with each other.

541
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:11,621
Isn't it hilarious?

542
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:13,935
Honey!

543
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:28,195
You must have waited for me.
You all should have eaten without me.

544
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:30,704
Even so, we have to wait  for the head
of our household to eat first!

545
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,516
How long are you going
to keep this up?

546
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,084
It's seriously
embarrassing to watch.

547
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,682
Don't spill your food when you eat!

548
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,959
Who do you take after
that you're so sloppy?

549
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:45,019
Did you say that with the intention
to have me freaking hear that, my lady?

550
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,096
Oh, no! Of course not!

551
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:50,420
Let's eat.

552
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,521
Yes, hello?

553
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,451
They're looking for Bo Ra.

554
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,583
Tell them that I'm not here.

555
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:05,303
Yes, she told me to say
that she's not here.

556
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,241
Yes, I understand.

557
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:10,723
They said they'll call again.

558
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:16,428
I wonder who our No Eul took after...

559
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:19,392
...that he's a bit slow in the head?

560
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:25,568
Did you, by chance, say that to imply
he's stupid because he takes after me?

561
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:29,162
Now, now... of course not.

562
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,879
Shall we eat?

563
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:32,426
Yes.

564
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:35,545
You're done eating already?
Have some more, will you?

565
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,331
No. I'm going to sleep.
Don't wake me up.

566
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,093
Jung Bong.

567
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,289
You've already had two of these difficult
surgeries. Why are you so worried?

568
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,427
Don't you worry one bit, OK?

569
00:37:58,565 --> 00:37:59,878
Yes, Father.

570
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:03,305
Jung Hwan!
Hurry over.

571
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,065
Thank you for the meal.

572
00:38:09,076 --> 00:38:10,487
You got another nosebleed?

573
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,140
It's not like this is anything new.

574
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:14,230
It always happens when
I wash up with warm water.

575
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,296
You're going this afternoon, right?

576
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:19,758
Yeah.
You don't have to come, though.

577
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,241
Yeah. There's no place
for you sleep there, anyway.

578
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:23,351
Just stay home.

579
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,435
It's not a big surgery. There's no need
for the whole family to be there.

580
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:29,614
Yeah. Come tomorrow, Jung Hwan.

581
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:32,954
The surgery is on the day after tomorrow
so you can just come tomorrow.

582
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:34,181
OK.

583
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:41,364
Taek should be done by now, right?

584
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,361
Yeah, he has to be.
Just look at the time.

585
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,843
I wonder if he won.
Isn't the competition today a huge one?

586
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:48,792
I'm sure he won.

587
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,367
Isn't it because he was confident,
he agreed to see it in the first place?

588
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,741
We're here.
I see the Baduk Club.

589
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,501
What time was the movie, again?

590
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,069
Hey, over here.

591
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,701
Hey, go and get Taek.

592
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:03,096
You have to hold his hand tight
so you don't lose him, OK?

593
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,943
Want me to come with you?

594
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,708
It's fine.

595
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:24,462
Master Choi!

596
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,749
You've worked hard.

597
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,059
Congratulations.

598
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:32,349
Thank you.

599
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,312
It's an honor, Sir!

600
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,371
Congratulations, Sir!

601
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,162
You've worked hard, Sir.

602
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:45,855
Congratulations, Sir!

603
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,935
You've worked hard, Sir.

604
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:50,461
You've worked hard, Sir!

605
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,151
Hey, what about your bag?
You had it this morning.

606
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,027
-Oh yeah.
-You did it again!

607
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:04,275
What the hell do you do
with that brain of yours?

608
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:05,863
Hurry up and get it.

609
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:09,019
I'll get it for you, Sir!

610
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,963
No, it's OK!

611
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:12,304
He needs some exercise.

612
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:16,090
I'll be at the food cart over there.
Come over there, OK?

613
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:16,917
OK.

614
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:18,827
Don't mope around!
Come straight there, got it?

615
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:20,233
OK.

616
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:28,509
Then... goodbye.

617
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:39,273
Korean University Hospital

618
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,615
Jung Bong!

619
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,310
Let's eat!

620
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,921
There's a pork cutlet place
out front, so I got some to go.

621
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:01,178
Oh, good.

622
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:04,475
He won't be allowed to eat starting
tomorrow, so let's feed him a lot today.

623
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,794
I don't want to eat, though.

624
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:10,383
Stop talking nonsense
and get over here.

625
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
Mr. Kim Jung Bong.

626
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:16,878
His surgery is
the day after tomorrow, yes?

627
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:17,889
Yes, Doctor.

628
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:19,823
The surgery we'll be doing will
involve making adjustments...

629
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:21,220
...to his artificial
heart's pacemaker.

630
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:24,346
You can just think of this as
a surgery to switch the batteries

631
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:26,860
...on the pacemaker we inserted during
last year's cardiac valve surgery.

632
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,307
They last about five
to ten years...

633
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:30,986
...but there are some instances
in which surgery is needed...

634
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:32,913
when they're placed in
less-than-ideal locations.

635
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,085
It's a simple surgery right, Doctor?

636
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,936
There's no such thing as
a "simple surgery" in this world.

637
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,205
We have to open him up to know for sure.

638
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:44,068
But, even so, I heard that these types
of surgeries end in about an hour or so.

639
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:47,031
Even I, a doctor, doesn't know that,
so how would you know?

640
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,551
We'll only know after we do the surgery.

641
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,577
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

642
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,375
He could have spoken
a bit more kindly to us.

643
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,339
How could we ask him anything,
with him being so intimidating?

644
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,049
He's always like that.

645
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,598
He was like that last year, too.

646
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:06,394
And doctors always talk like that.
It's not exactly a new development.

647
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:08,761
Jung Bong, let's...

648
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,059
Hello?

649
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:29,149
Yes, are you looking for Bo Ra?

650
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,114
And who are you?

651
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:35,656
Oh.
OK. Just a minute.

652
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,513
Bo Ra, pick up the phone!

653
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:40,459
They say they're your friend,
Park Jong Hoon!

654
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:44,463
But what relationship
do you have with my...

655
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:48,109
Don't pick up his calls, Mom.
He's a crazy jerk.

656
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:28,960
I feel like Bo Ra is irritated
about something lately.

657
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,287
I almost pissed my pants the other day
because of her!

658
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:33,383
She got into a huge fight
with her boyfriend.

659
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:34,487
Wow.

660
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:36,283
She has a boyfriend?

661
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:38,542
Yeah. But I think they'll break up soon.

662
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:42,051
Even so, who in their right mind
would like her?

663
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:44,982
You'd have to be a real piece of work,
that's for sure.

664
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:55,177
Jung Hwan!
Come sit over here.

665
00:43:56,368 --> 00:43:58,804
No thanks.
We're almost here, anyway.

666
00:44:17,018 --> 00:44:18,116
Where are you going?

667
00:44:18,316 --> 00:44:21,021
To the waiting room.
I'm going to go watch some TV.

668
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:22,312
You go to sleep first.

669
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:24,447
Yeah, OK.

670
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:26,397
My Mi Ran...

671
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:28,995
You've gotten so strong.

672
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:31,981
You couldn't even
fall asleep in past years.

673
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:33,995
Now, you can even watch TV.

674
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,851
I'm not the same as I was back then.

675
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:38,359
This kind of surgery isn't even surgery.

676
00:44:38,951 --> 00:44:41,459
I'll just watch the Drama Awards
and come right back.

677
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:24,833
Did Jung Bong get admitted
to the hospital already?

678
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:26,256
You don't need to go?

679
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:28,310
They said to come tomorrow.

680
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:30,037
Thinking about it,
it's been a really long time...

681
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,268
...since we've played soccer with him.

682
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:34,524
We used to play soccer with him so much,
up until the night of his first surgery.

683
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:36,915
Jung Hwan.

684
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:39,542
Wasn't it your dream in elementary school
to be a professional soccer player?

685
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:41,608
Because you were crazy about
Diego Maradona?

686
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:44,700
This punk was good at soccer
back in the day, too...

687
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,112
Geez.
He's sleeping so soundly.

688
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:54,221
I'm sleeping.

689
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:57,021
OK.

690
00:45:57,623 --> 00:46:00,008
-Ugh, it smells!
-When did you fart? Darn it!

691
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:00,921
Ten minutes ago.

692
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:03,133
Just what the hell do you eat?

693
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:07,508
Do you smell it?

694
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,445
-Of course!
-I don't smell it, though.

695
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:11,025
-What the hell are you saying?
-What the hell are you saying?

696
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:14,028
I don't smell anything.
Hold on.

697
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:19,622
- Darn it!
- Darn it!

698
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:21,624
Why?
Just... why?

699
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:33,771
Do Not Feed

700
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,345
Isn't it about time for
Jung Hwan to be here?

701
00:46:39,356 --> 00:46:40,955
I told him to bring my razor.

702
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,036
Big Bro.

703
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:42,909
You're here?

704
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,642
-What about my razor?
-Oh, here.

705
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,973
You're fine, right?

706
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:56,578
What's with you? You were once in surgery
for ten hours, and you were fine.

707
00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:00,179
Where did you get such precious things
like pineapples and bananas?

708
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:02,349
-Did you buy them?
-Oh, Taek gave those to me.

709
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,360
He got them as a gift, and he gave them
to me to give to Big Bro.

710
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:09,708
He's not allowed to eat, already?

711
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:12,041
They just put that sign up now.

712
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:14,276
Wait here.
Let me go ask the doctor.

713
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,147
Yes, go ahead.

714
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,142
Excuse me, where is Dr. Choi Hyun Sung?

715
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:26,351
What is it, ma'am?
Please tell me.

716
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:30,179
I have something to ask the doctor.

717
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:32,598
Oh, here he comes now.

718
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:35,512
Oh, hello, Doctor.

719
00:47:37,236 --> 00:47:38,696
Doctor...

720
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,787
My child's younger brother's friend
is Choi Taek.

721
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:43,924
He's a really famous Baduk player.

722
00:47:44,273 --> 00:47:45,679
You've heard of him, right?

723
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:52,775
He sent pineapples and bananas
for my boy.

724
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,976
Couldn't he just have a little bit?

725
00:47:54,996 --> 00:47:57,249
They only put the "Do Not Feed"
sign up a short while ago.

726
00:47:57,268 --> 00:47:59,546
He'll fast as soon as he's done
eating this, I promise. Please?

727
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:04,050
Do whatever you want.

728
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:05,127
Excuse me?

729
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:07,006
I said, do whatever you want.

730
00:48:22,793 --> 00:48:24,437
Did you get a nosebleed this morning?

731
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:28,195
When did this happen?

732
00:48:29,092 --> 00:48:34,202
How strange. I used to get nosebleeds
a lot too, around your age.

733
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:37,778
That's a really useful trait
you passed down to him, isn't it?

734
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:41,135
Give this to Jung Bong.

735
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:44,035
No, no thank you.

736
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:46,413
Jung Hwan, eat up.

737
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,078
What's this? You're giving up food
to someone else for a change?

738
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,491
You really are scared of getting surgery,
aren't you?

739
00:48:54,592 --> 00:48:56,741
I don't have a good feeling
about this one.

740
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,630
Stop that kind of talk this instant!

741
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:02,247
They said it's a surgery
that even little kids handle well!

742
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:05,079
Stop spouting nonsense
and eat this banana, already!

743
00:49:07,158 --> 00:49:08,258
Yes, Sir.

744
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:18,875
I'm expecting a call.

745
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:21,235
Hurry it up.

746
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,527
Oh, OK.

747
00:49:25,144 --> 00:49:26,630
You're coming to our neighborhood?

748
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,142
No, I'll just meet you in front
of Sungshin Women's University...

749
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:34,327
OK.

750
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:37,179
I'll wait for you
in front of the bus station.

751
00:49:38,682 --> 00:49:40,182
OK.

752
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,277
You have a girlfriend? What school?
What grade?

753
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,443
A student should be studying!

754
00:49:52,454 --> 00:49:54,254
Is this the time for you
to have a girlfriend?

755
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,010
I'm going to tell Mom!

756
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:59,178
I've only met her a couple of times.

757
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:01,346
She's not my girlfriend.

758
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,565
I'm breaking up with her today.

759
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,403
She's not even your girlfriend,
so why do you need to break up?

760
00:50:07,515 --> 00:50:09,714
She has one-sided feelings for me.

761
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:12,193
For you?
Why?

762
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,559
What's with this development?
You expect me to believe that?

763
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:16,936
It's the truth.

764
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,335
Just let me off the hook for today.

765
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:22,807
I'm going to take care of it.

766
00:50:25,246 --> 00:50:28,378
You better take care of it
by today, got it?

767
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:47,906
Soo Kyung.

768
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,610
I think we should break...

769
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:52,121
What the flying freak!
That freaking scared me!

770
00:50:57,217 --> 00:50:58,217
Hey.

771
00:50:59,082 --> 00:51:01,504
-What did you say, just now?
-Nothing, I swear.

772
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,378
I thought I just heard you say
that we should break up.

773
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,079
Why?

774
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,178
-You don't like me anymore?
-No, I like you.

775
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,908
Do you take me for a fool?

776
00:51:13,346 --> 00:51:15,490
Hey. Even if we started
on your term...

777
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,589
...we can't part on your terms, too.

778
00:51:33,242 --> 00:51:34,965
What's with your hair?

779
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:37,411
I got a pinkle-perm.
This was seriously expensive!

780
00:51:37,422 --> 00:51:40,922
Hey. Who cares if it's expensive?
It doesn't suit you at all.

781
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,079
You two have weirder hair, you know!

782
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:47,231
What's with you?
You dyed your hair again?

783
00:51:47,261 --> 00:51:48,510
Yeah.
It cost a bit, too.

784
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,591
I knew you'd end up
doing that eventually.

785
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:52,356
-It looks pretty.
-It's pretty, right?

786
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:53,857
I used two bottles of
hydrogen peroxide for this color.

787
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:55,073
Really?

788
00:51:57,441 --> 00:51:58,540
Way to go.

789
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:05,622
Hey.
Isn't that your younger brother?

790
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:17,468
Wow, No Eul!
You're hanging out with girls already?

791
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:18,947
Who are you ladies?

792
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:20,576
You know my No Eul?

793
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:23,188
Wow, you're so skilled, No Eul!

794
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:28,377
How pathetic.
Really.

795
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:30,817
No Eul.
You don't want to come with us?

796
00:52:30,832 --> 00:52:32,168
I'll buy you ddukbokki.

797
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:33,179
Hey.

798
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,019
No Eul has plans with us.

799
00:52:35,681 --> 00:52:37,281
Please go on ahead.

800
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:44,679
Hey, No Eul...
are you crying?

801
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:48,970
Hey, you made my younger brother cry?

802
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:50,633
- Let go!
- Did you make him cry?

803
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,007
Are you out of your darn mind?

804
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,103
Oh no!

805
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:02,679
Hey!

806
00:54:11,202 --> 00:54:14,500
Look like my daughter
is having a lot of fun!

807
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:15,732
Where are you going, Mom?

808
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:17,470
It's raining.
I have to go get the laundry.

809
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:19,026
It's cold.
I'll do it, Mom.

810
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:20,226
Just a moment, Jin Joo.

811
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:21,434
I'll be right back.

812
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:23,136
I'll do it.

813
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:24,882
OK, then.

814
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:31,281
Oh yeah!

815
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,202
Let's run, let's run!

816
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,501
Good job, good job!

817
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:09,802
Let's talk.

818
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,403
I have nothing to say to you.

819
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:19,602
Even so, you can at least
hear me out, can't you?

820
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,403
Wow, they're all frozen solid!

821
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,779
It was a mistake, is all.

822
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:14,903
I drank way too much,
and I wasn't thinking.

823
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:16,939
The weird thing is...

824
00:56:17,113 --> 00:56:19,713
I only remembered all of this
after I woke up the next day.

825
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:22,822
It was a mistake.

826
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:24,273
OK?

827
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:28,901
OK, yes.
Mistake or not, it's my fault.

828
00:56:28,912 --> 00:56:32,601
I know. I'm the crazy jerk here.
I really am...

829
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:34,566
...such a crazy jerk.

830
00:56:37,453 --> 00:56:39,053
I'm really sorry.

831
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:42,202
Forgive me just this once.

832
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:45,402
If I ever do that again, I...

833
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:47,941
I'm sorry.
I really am.

834
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,220
OK?

835
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:55,906
Will anything change
just because you're sorry?

836
00:56:57,466 --> 00:56:58,942
A mistake?

837
00:56:59,156 --> 00:57:01,702
You've never done such a thing
under the influence before.

838
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,703
I've never seen you do that.

839
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:07,402
I don't understand you
and I can't forgive you.

840
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:10,403
I just can't rationalize what you did.

841
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:12,501
You call yourself a human being?

842
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:15,212
How could you do that
with my best friend?

843
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,823
Just let me go this once, already!

844
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:20,758
Hey, I said I was sorry!

845
00:57:20,903 --> 00:57:22,395
How many darn times
did I say it already? Geez.

846
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:23,728
Wait a minute.

847
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,703
What qualifies you to be
so high and mighty?

848
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:30,244
Are you perfect?

849
00:57:30,255 --> 00:57:31,255
You never make mistakes?

850
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:34,970
Yes, that's right, you are perfect.

851
00:57:35,548 --> 00:57:36,491
Yeah.

852
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:38,303
You're smart.

853
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:43,128
You always have to be number one
and you hate receiving help from anyone.

854
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:46,498
You rush home just because
your boyfriend got a little drunk.

855
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:48,607
And you act repulsed, like I'm an insect,
when I try to hold your hand.

856
00:57:48,618 --> 00:57:50,618
Look!
Look!

857
00:57:51,018 --> 00:57:52,018
Darn.

858
00:57:52,446 --> 00:57:55,044
Do you even have emotions?
Do you?

859
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,702
I've never met a more inconsiderate,
cold wretch than you.

860
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:00,290
Really, you're the first.

861
00:58:02,054 --> 00:58:03,454
Whatever.

862
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:07,616
Dating you, I felt so suffocated
that I thought I'd die.

863
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:12,803
I feel like I'm not dating a girl
more like a hunk of ice.

864
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,157
If you don't fix that darn temper
of yours, you'll be alone forever.

865
00:58:16,168 --> 00:58:17,168
You know that?

866
00:58:18,986 --> 00:58:24,403
You're really the worst
a woman there could ever be.

867
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:33,639
Whatever.

868
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:53,791
Wow, that guy really knows
nothing about you.

869
00:59:56,905 --> 00:59:58,405
I don't need your pity.

870
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:03,113
You're a warm person.

871
01:00:06,832 --> 01:00:08,651
And you're a good person.

872
01:00:26,073 --> 01:00:31,874
Winter, Two Years Ago

873
01:00:32,651 --> 01:00:34,292
Oh, Bo Ra's coming.

874
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,924
School's over, Bo Ra?

875
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:36,949
Hello.

876
01:00:36,964 --> 01:00:39,724
Go inside.
Your mother should be there.

877
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:40,830
OK.

878
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:02,604
Hey, just cry.

879
01:01:04,148 --> 01:01:06,448
Don't hold it in, and just cry.

880
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:14,303
At times like this, you're supposed
to just let it out, Sun Woo.

881
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,803
It's OK.
You can cry.

882
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:56,549
Hey. Something's falling.

883
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,990
It's raining, Sun Woo.
Let's go inside.

884
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:10,256
I really hate getting caught in the rain.

885
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:13,417
Bo Ra.

886
01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:16,602
Why are your hands so cold?

887
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:20,102
Because my heart is warm.

888
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,204
People with warm hearts have cold hands.

889
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:25,767
Let's go.

890
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,803
Coffee.

891
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,960
What about yours?

892
01:03:01,554 --> 01:03:02,739
I only had enough money for one.

893
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:07,224
Sun Woo...

894
01:03:07,235 --> 01:03:09,403
I won't tell anyone else about this.

895
01:03:10,497 --> 01:03:12,397
How did you read my mind?

896
01:03:14,148 --> 01:03:15,808
I'm very interested in you,
that's why.

897
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:16,819
Hey.

898
01:03:18,692 --> 01:03:21,192
I'm not in the mood for jokes right now.

899
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,221
But what happened to your hand?

900
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:36,917
Oh.

901
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:39,573
I tripped.

902
01:03:40,744 --> 01:03:44,644
Geez. Way to go, you klutz.

903
01:03:57,387 --> 01:03:58,486
Ouch.

904
01:04:01,613 --> 01:04:03,213
Doesn't it hurt?

905
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:09,541
I'll... go on ahead.

906
01:04:44,102 --> 01:04:47,303
Oh, thank you for your hard work.
Where are my children?

907
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,601
Duk Seon!

908
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:51,323
Mom!

909
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:53,824
Are you hurt anywhere?

910
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:56,056
Oh my... my child.

911
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:57,764
What happened to you?

912
01:04:57,784 --> 01:05:00,384
Oh my!
It must have hurt so much!

913
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,670
Who did this to you?

914
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,875
It was you?

915
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:08,119
You hit my Duk Seon?

916
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,461
I got hit too, lady!

917
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:11,712
How dare you look an adult in the eyes?

918
01:05:16,182 --> 01:05:17,326
And what are you doing here?

919
01:05:17,337 --> 01:05:20,336
She's No Eul's girlfriend.
He must be out of his mind.

920
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:22,048
What did you say?
Sung No Eul!

921
01:05:24,412 --> 01:05:27,601
Geez... just look at this girl's head.

922
01:05:27,602 --> 01:05:29,902
Who, in their right mind,
would take her for a high schooler?

923
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:32,601
What's it to you, lady?

924
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:35,916
Wow and just look at how she talks.
What is the world coming to?

925
01:05:35,927 --> 01:05:37,728
How in the world
did your parents raise you?

926
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:44,426
Excuse me!
May we go now? I have to feed my kids.

927
01:05:44,522 --> 01:05:45,816
I'm hungry, Mom.

928
01:05:45,827 --> 01:05:46,753
You are, right?

929
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:48,273
That student's parents have to come too.

930
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:52,114
Both parents have to come and sign this
for them to be able to leave.

931
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:01,970
Oh my look at her mother.
What's with her?

932
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:03,676
It's probably her stepmother.

933
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,854
I'm sorry.
I just got out of work.

934
01:06:06,584 --> 01:06:08,803
I'm very sorry.
I'm Soo Kyung's guardian.

935
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:12,802
What's your relationship with her,
exactly?

936
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,802
I'm Soo Kyung's older sister.

937
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:15,921
What about your parents?

938
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:20,892
Our parents passed away last year
in a car accident.

939
01:06:20,963 --> 01:06:22,394
She lives with me now.

940
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:23,905
Oh... I see.

941
01:06:24,602 --> 01:06:28,402
It was just a fight between kids,
so you don't need to worry too much.

942
01:06:28,676 --> 01:06:30,618
Please sign here and take her home.

943
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:31,704
Yes.

944
01:06:33,501 --> 01:06:35,102
I'm sorry.

945
01:06:39,874 --> 01:06:41,474
I'm sorry.

946
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,220
Get up.

947
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:48,160
I'm really sorry.
I should have taught her better.

948
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,238
I'm very sorry.

949
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:53,902
Oh... no... it's fine.
We're sorry.

950
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,682
She's actually a good kid...

951
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,292
...but after our parents
passed away last year...

952
01:06:58,303 --> 01:07:00,216
...she hasn't been able to deal
with it properly, it seems.

953
01:07:00,227 --> 01:07:01,425
I'm sorry.

954
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,056
She really is a good kid.

955
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,323
She's really not like this
on the inside.

956
01:07:04,442 --> 01:07:07,142
What the hell are you saying?
Stop it, already!

957
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:08,252
Shut your mouth.

958
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,101
You did nothing right!

959
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:11,851
-Hurry up and apologize!
-I don't want to.

960
01:07:11,879 --> 01:07:12,733
Hey!

961
01:07:12,744 --> 01:07:14,488
Oh... oh, it's OK.

962
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:16,447
My kid did nothing right, either.

963
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:20,494
I didn't even know
and you have red hair and all...

964
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:22,313
So I misjudged you.

965
01:07:22,603 --> 01:07:24,125
Oh my hair?

966
01:07:24,577 --> 01:07:26,979
I'm attending cosmetology school.

967
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:30,522
I'm practicing right now, so my hair
and makeup are a bit over the top.

968
01:07:30,533 --> 01:07:31,533
I'm sorry.

969
01:07:32,804 --> 01:07:35,103
Someone between us
has to earn some money, so...

970
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:39,341
Oh, I didn't even know that...

971
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:41,191
I'm sorry.

972
01:07:43,002 --> 01:07:45,062
You have such a great personality.

973
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,066
So you two can live on well then,
since you seem so dependable.

974
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:52,546
Who was it?

975
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,714
Who laid their hand on
my precious daughter?

976
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:00,387
Duk Seon! Are you OK?

977
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:04,186
Oh, look here.

978
01:08:07,106 --> 01:08:12,802
Look at your darn hair.
You two did it, didn't you?

979
01:08:12,803 --> 01:08:14,502
You two must have done it.

980
01:08:15,147 --> 01:08:20,389
You two really look like a pair
of disgustingly delinquent punks, too!

981
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:23,553
How could two girls pick up
such bad mannerisms...

982
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:25,464
...and beat up
someone else's precious child?

983
01:08:25,475 --> 01:08:27,873
Are you two gangsters?
Or part of a crime syndicate?

984
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:30,908
Did your mother and father
teach you to act like that?

985
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,253
Do your parents even know
you're living like this?

986
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,390
How dare you two...

987
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:42,229
Honey.
When did you get here?

988
01:08:42,507 --> 01:08:46,042
It seems that these two girls' parents
haven't come yet.

989
01:08:46,215 --> 01:08:51,189
I'm curious as to why they're fine
with letting their kids be such thugs.

990
01:08:51,306 --> 01:08:53,491
Shut your mouth already!
You're so annoying!

991
01:08:54,066 --> 01:08:56,194
And that's the end of the
formal speech saga.

992
01:08:57,603 --> 01:09:00,401
Their parents passed away
in a car accident last year.

993
01:09:01,113 --> 01:09:04,103
And the older sister's hair is like that
because she goes to cosmetology school.

994
01:09:04,815 --> 01:09:06,991
And Duk Seon is the one
who started it in the first place!

995
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:10,802
What the hell are you blabbing on about
when you don't even know their situation?

996
01:09:10,951 --> 01:09:12,838
What do you mean, "blabbing... on"?

997
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:14,010
What the hell do you think?

998
01:09:14,053 --> 01:09:17,052
You can't think clearly
without cooling your head, all right?

999
01:09:17,096 --> 01:09:19,220
Jesus... how the hell can you
speak like that to your husband?

1000
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:23,413
I guess you really must love
to humiliate your husband in public!

1001
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,696
Want to go for round two right here?
Huh? Darn it!

1002
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:28,406
You're so darn loud!

1003
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,592
Be quiet, please!

1004
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,501
What are you doing,
in front of these kids?

1005
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:35,102
-Yes... Sir.
-I'm sorry.

1006
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:36,401
Sir.

1007
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:38,455
I'm truly sorry.

1008
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,807
I'll teach her to be better from now on.

1009
01:09:40,818 --> 01:09:42,018
I'm really sorry.

1010
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:45,843
No need for that!

1011
01:09:45,854 --> 01:09:49,046
I didn't even know anything
and I'm the one who's sorry.

1012
01:09:51,502 --> 01:09:52,795
You jerk!

1013
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:55,215
What were you doing while
your sister was getting in trouble?

1014
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,002
Hello, there.
Who's the captain here?

1015
01:10:03,975 --> 01:10:06,001
Bring them here!

1016
01:10:06,176 --> 01:10:08,973
I'm the dean at Ssangmun High...

1017
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:14,136
...and I heard that Ms. Sung Duk Seon was
badly assaulted by some shady characters.

1018
01:10:14,285 --> 01:10:18,353
So I came here to deliver
some divine justice.

1019
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,991
What is this?
Who called Dong Ryong's father here?

1020
01:10:21,992 --> 01:10:25,191
I felt a bit nervous
on my way here from the bank...

1021
01:10:25,202 --> 01:10:27,802
...and Dong Ryong's dad said he knew
a lot of people in law enforcement

1022
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:29,001
...so I made a small request...

1023
01:10:29,002 --> 01:10:31,303
Oh my God... what am I going to do?

1024
01:10:34,589 --> 01:10:38,833
Offending the other person's appearance,
their hair, and physical violence!

1025
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:42,189
With all these offenses, we have
more than enough to put you behind bars!

1026
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:48,482
Student, consider your life
officially over.

1027
01:10:48,989 --> 01:10:50,389
Please, stop it already...

1028
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:52,240
And of course,
your expulsion is a given.

1029
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:57,377
Mr. Sung.
No need for such deep sighs.

1030
01:10:57,538 --> 01:11:00,102
I have, with me here, an inspector.

1031
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:02,012
He's my friend, Detective Kim.

1032
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:04,803
-Say hello.
-Hello!

1033
01:11:08,507 --> 01:11:10,077
Bring the police captain
out here, already!

1034
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:13,249
I'm going to have a nice
one-on-one chat with him.

1035
01:11:13,493 --> 01:11:15,302
You two are dead today.

1036
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:18,173
Dang it... stop it, already!

1037
01:11:18,184 --> 01:11:19,884
Please, stop it, already!

1038
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,242
I'm so sorry.

1039
01:11:26,261 --> 01:11:28,360
I'm extremely sorry
for the inconvenience.

1040
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,292
Then, I'll be off now.

1041
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,001
Oh, Inspector.

1042
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:42,502
Thank you so much for coming
all the way here, in person.

1043
01:11:43,922 --> 01:11:45,522
This man isn't an inspector.

1044
01:11:45,603 --> 01:11:46,603
Excuse me?

1045
01:11:46,604 --> 01:11:48,402
He's the principal of our school.

1046
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:51,972
His name is Kim Gum Sa.

1047
01:11:54,252 --> 01:11:56,084
Your younger sibling's name is
Kim Pan Sa, right? Judge Kim.

1048
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:00,102
And what was your
younger sister's name, again?

1049
01:12:00,476 --> 01:12:02,476
Kim Jip Sa.

1050
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,671
Then, we'll be going now.

1051
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,454
Geez... he really does have a family
full of law enforcement officers.

1052
01:12:14,495 --> 01:12:20,195
I always wondered who Dong Ryong
took after. He's just like his dad.

1053
01:12:23,293 --> 01:12:25,258
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

1054
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:28,899
You are, right? Let's go home.
I made doenjang soup.

1055
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:31,551
Goodbye.

1056
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:37,582
We'll also be leaving.

1057
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,701
Come eat at our place.

1058
01:12:40,108 --> 01:12:42,138
Our house is right around here.

1059
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:44,113
We can have dinner together.

1060
01:12:44,603 --> 01:12:46,501
No, thanks.

1061
01:12:46,502 --> 01:12:49,617
Hey, don't act all high and mighty.
Just come.

1062
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:50,967
I'm so hungry, I could die.

1063
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:58,201
All right!
It's not too good, right?

1064
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,792
No, it's delicious! It's the first time
in a while we've eaten like this.

1065
01:13:01,803 --> 01:13:03,902
We only ever eat ramen.

1066
01:13:16,193 --> 01:13:18,623
Hey.
What the hell are you doing?

1067
01:13:18,693 --> 01:13:20,274
All right, all right.

1068
01:13:23,629 --> 01:13:24,602
Hey.

1069
01:13:25,035 --> 01:13:26,401
What did you use to dye your hair?

1070
01:13:26,473 --> 01:13:27,792
This?

1071
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,419
No way you did that with beer.

1072
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:31,149
-Hydrogen peroxide.
-Hydrogen peroxide?

1073
01:13:31,566 --> 01:13:33,027
You can't get that kind
of color with that.

1074
01:13:33,065 --> 01:13:35,364
Three times.
You have to do it three times.

1075
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:36,919
And you need to
give it sunlight for one hour.

1076
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:37,930
Oh...

1077
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:42,815
Darn girl...

1078
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:45,067
Fix that hair color of yours first!

1079
01:13:45,274 --> 01:13:48,591
If you don't, I'll shave it all off
and ship you off to a monastery.

1080
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,381
Why are you only saying that to me?

1081
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,477
And you too, Soo Kyung!

1082
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:55,089
What's with that hair of yours?

1083
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,599
You have that beautiful hair
your parents left you...

1084
01:13:57,668 --> 01:14:00,366
...so why did you dip-dye it like that?

1085
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:05,002
And take off that
ghoulish-looking makeup!

1086
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:08,589
And wear nice clothes,
suitable for a student! Got it?

1087
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:10,970
I'm going to check on you
once a week!

1088
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:12,488
Got that?

1089
01:14:13,576 --> 01:14:14,632
Yes.

1090
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:19,086
We'll have to move.

1091
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:24,382
I'd like more rice.

1092
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:25,603
Oh, sure.

1093
01:14:25,604 --> 01:14:28,303
-No, I'll do it.
-No, no.

1094
01:14:35,863 --> 01:14:39,010
Hey, you.
Why do you like No Eul, anyway?

1095
01:14:39,268 --> 01:14:41,067
-Big Sis!
-Shut it!

1096
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:45,596
With a face like yours,
you could do a lot better.

1097
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:47,453
You have really low standards.

1098
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:51,691
He was the first one.

1099
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:56,068
What do you mean?
First what?

1100
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:58,291
The first one who told me
not to smoke.

1101
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:03,603
He's the first one who
ever said that to me.

1102
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:14,902
After my parents passed away last year,
people only said nice things to me.

1103
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:18,464
Things like, "It's OK"
or "Everything's fine."

1104
01:15:18,629 --> 01:15:20,030
Or, that anything I did was OK.

1105
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:25,491
But No Eul was the first one
to get mad at me and talk me out.

1106
01:15:25,549 --> 01:15:27,049
And he was doing it earnestly, too.

1107
01:15:31,112 --> 01:15:33,211
I was really thankful for that.

1108
01:15:54,868 --> 01:15:56,219
Honey.

1109
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:58,387
Go sign the surgery consent form.

1110
01:15:58,741 --> 01:16:00,341
OK.
Let's go together.

1111
01:16:00,985 --> 01:16:03,114
We don't both need to go.
Go by yourself.

1112
01:16:03,757 --> 01:16:05,603
OK.
Got it.

1113
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:15,001
Hurry up and go to sleep.
Your surgery is tomorrow.

1114
01:16:15,152 --> 01:16:16,753
I can't fall asleep.

1115
01:16:18,692 --> 01:16:20,212
And why not?

1116
01:16:23,809 --> 01:16:25,208
Are you scared?

1117
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:28,668
A little bit.

1118
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,179
Jung Bong.

1119
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:36,891
I asked all the nurses here
this afternoon...

1120
01:16:37,436 --> 01:16:41,002
...whether or not there's a chance
that the surgery won't go well.

1121
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:43,977
They said that there's
no chance at all. Really.

1122
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,270
Have you ever seen me lie?

1123
01:16:48,832 --> 01:16:54,302
Also I had ribs with your dad for dinner.

1124
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:58,002
Do you think I'd be able
to eat out if I were worried?

1125
01:16:59,087 --> 01:17:03,402
Neither of us are worried at all.

1126
01:17:06,509 --> 01:17:09,608
So... don't you worry either.

1127
01:17:09,782 --> 01:17:15,313
Hurry and get a good
night's rest, OK?

1128
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:21,102
What's wrong, my son?

1129
01:17:21,452 --> 01:17:24,502
You handled that other huge surgery
so well, too.

1130
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:34,002
You're a strong person, Mom.

1131
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:45,767
You're a strong person
but your son has such a weak body...

1132
01:17:47,731 --> 01:17:49,502
...and such a weak heart.

1133
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:56,717
Why is my child weak?

1134
01:17:57,384 --> 01:18:00,516
You have so much strength,
because you take after me.

1135
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:05,501
Do you think just anyone overcomes
such a difficult surgery, like you did?

1136
01:18:05,906 --> 01:18:07,707
Jung Bong.

1137
01:18:08,524 --> 01:18:11,024
That, in and of itself,
is an amazing feat.

1138
01:18:12,202 --> 01:18:18,803
You're a much stronger and greater
person that I am, honey.

1139
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:29,803
Hurry and go to sleep.
I'm going to go watch some TV.

1140
01:19:58,312 --> 01:20:00,012
What are you doing over there?

1141
01:20:01,732 --> 01:20:03,333
Oh... Doctor.

1142
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:08,128
Why are you still up?

1143
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,319
I was watching some TV.

1144
01:20:25,956 --> 01:20:27,076
Ma'am.

1145
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:28,686
You don't need to worry.

1146
01:20:29,903 --> 01:20:31,770
It's a very simple
surgical procedure.

1147
01:20:32,223 --> 01:20:34,422
It's quite easy.

1148
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:38,501
It won't even take an hour and it has
almost no risk factors whatsoever.

1149
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:42,103
So please don't worry
and go to sleep.

1150
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,558
Thank you.

1151
01:20:56,297 --> 01:21:00,002
I... I just...

1152
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:03,240
What's come over you?

1153
01:21:03,507 --> 01:21:05,806
You seemed to
bear it all so well up until now.

1154
01:21:10,438 --> 01:21:12,934
But, it's really nothing to cry over.

1155
01:21:12,945 --> 01:21:14,945
It really won't take that long.

1156
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:18,803
I'll make sure
to finish it within an hour.

1157
01:21:26,058 --> 01:21:27,401
Oh my.

1158
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:30,103
You must have been
so worried up until now.

1159
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:33,026
It's almost all over now.

1160
01:21:33,052 --> 01:21:34,753
You just have to overcome this one thing.

1161
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:10,724
Korean University Hospital

1162
01:22:11,186 --> 01:22:13,094
Operating Room

1163
01:22:31,608 --> 01:22:33,309
Oh, Doctor.

1164
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,602
It ended without a hitch.

1165
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,318
-Oh...
-Thank you.

1166
01:22:38,172 --> 01:22:41,201
Thankfully, we adjusted the location
and he didn't lose too much blood.

1167
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:44,212
Thank you so much, Doctor.
You've worked so hard!

1168
01:22:44,223 --> 01:22:46,684
You won't need to see me for some time.

1169
01:22:47,287 --> 01:22:48,595
I'll see you again in ten years.

1170
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:49,901
Thank you so much.

1171
01:22:49,902 --> 01:22:53,803
-Thank you so much!
-You've worked so hard, Sir!

1172
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,001
Mr. Kim Jung Bong.

1173
01:23:20,446 --> 01:23:22,346
Mr. Kim Jung Bong?

1174
01:23:22,801 --> 01:23:24,900
Yes. He's almost completely
conscious now.

1175
01:23:28,976 --> 01:23:30,075
Jung Bong.

1176
01:23:30,896 --> 01:23:33,095
Jung Bong.
It's me, Mom.

1177
01:23:35,483 --> 01:23:37,783
Your surgery went well!

1178
01:23:39,042 --> 01:23:41,242
What a relief...

1179
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,218
You've worked hard.

1180
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:44,593
You've worked so hard.

1181
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:52,838
I'm so sorry that I couldn't
give birth to you as a healthy child.

1182
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,177
Why are you crying again?

1183
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:04,384
Jung Bong!
They said your surgery went really well!

1184
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:06,049
You don't need to worry!

1185
01:24:06,202 --> 01:24:08,402
They said that everything is fine now!
OK?

1186
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:18,338
Jung Hwan.

1187
01:24:20,768 --> 01:24:22,367
Jung Hwan.

1188
01:24:23,704 --> 01:24:24,991
Yeah, Big Bro?

1189
01:24:25,204 --> 01:24:26,727
Your... nose...

1190
01:24:31,053 --> 01:24:32,302
Your... nose...

1191
01:24:36,997 --> 01:24:39,697
Is your nose OK?

1192
01:24:45,336 --> 01:24:47,328
Darn it. What the hell?

1193
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:53,102
One's feelings can be put into words.

1194
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:57,002
That's why just one remark
can give off warmth.

1195
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:03,750
In this cold, harsh world,
the thing that allows one...

1196
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:07,630
...to recognize the warmth that is present
in life, and makes it worth living...

1197
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:11,939
...is not a wise saying,
or a refined, witty remark.

1198
01:25:12,495 --> 01:25:16,803
Rather, it is one warm remark filled
with one's raw, unrefined feelings.

1199
01:25:20,243 --> 01:25:21,486
Brazil Ddukbokki

1200
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:33,602
Hey. Do you have a hole in your chin?

1201
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:35,602
Why do you keep spilling food
all over the place?

1202
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:40,649
But Big Sis.

1203
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,758
Who do you think took
Mom's 30,000 won, that time?

1204
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:44,401
How did you know about that?

1205
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:46,086
I heard from Bo Ra.

1206
01:25:46,671 --> 01:25:47,802
It wasn't you?

1207
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:49,888
Are you out of your mind?

1208
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,956
Dad gives me plenty of allowance.

1209
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:54,045
Really?

1210
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,182
Who could it have been, then?

1211
01:25:56,969 --> 01:26:00,701
It wasn't Sung Bo Ra, or you.

1212
01:26:00,982 --> 01:26:02,782
Or me.
Then...

1213
01:26:58,266 --> 01:26:59,667
Just a moment.

1214
01:27:00,103 --> 01:27:02,802
[November 2015]

1215
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:04,092
Who is it?

1216
01:27:04,392 --> 01:27:05,901
It's me, No Eul.

1217
01:27:05,902 --> 01:27:07,001
OK!

1218
01:27:07,002 --> 01:27:07,803
No Eul's here?

1219
01:27:07,814 --> 01:27:10,113
Yeah. I told him I'd give him
some red ginseng.

1220
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:11,371
Oh.

1221
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:13,810
What took you so long?

1222
01:27:14,106 --> 01:27:15,533
Were you playing baseball again?

1223
01:27:15,566 --> 01:27:16,865
Big Sis!

1224
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:22,143
Oh, Brother-in-Law.
Long time, no see.

1225
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:23,459
Yeah.
Come on in.

1226
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,769
Hey how is it that you look
younger by the day?

1227
01:27:25,862 --> 01:27:27,561
What are you saying?

1228
01:27:27,778 --> 01:27:30,306
It must be tough,
living with my Big Sis.

1229
01:27:30,317 --> 01:27:31,731
Oh, please.

1230
01:27:31,817 --> 01:27:36,122
Hey... what's with your foot?
Did you get hurt?

1231
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:37,541
Someone must have stepped
on his foot during baseball.

1232
01:27:37,606 --> 01:27:38,606
It looks like it hurts.

1233
01:27:38,617 --> 01:27:41,115
Oh, I'm fine.
Big Sis, give me my red ginseng already.

1234
01:27:41,351 --> 01:27:43,629
I left my car outside
without parking properly.

1235
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:46,757
-Big Sis. Where are you going?
-Who was it? Lead the way!

1236
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:49,102
How could they do this
to your foot?

1237
01:27:49,341 --> 01:27:53,127
Come on, Big Sis!
I'm not a little kid!

1238
01:27:53,244 --> 01:27:54,656
Do something
about that temper of yours.

1239
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:57,067
How is it that your temper
has gotten worse than Bo Ra's?

1240
01:27:58,283 --> 01:27:59,733
Are you really OK?

1241
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:00,772
Yeah.

1242
01:28:01,637 --> 01:28:03,281
Shouldn't he see a doctor, or something?

1243
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:05,891
Oh, he definitely should.
Looks like he needs surgery right now.

1244
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,856
I'll bet it'll take three whole hours
to recover from this.

1245
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:12,186
Do you still see me as seventeen years
old  and in high school?

1246
01:28:12,202 --> 01:28:14,103
I'm turning 48 this year!

1247
01:28:14,603 --> 01:28:17,444
To me, you'll always be a high schooler.

1248
01:28:17,687 --> 01:28:18,786
Got it?

1249
01:28:19,406 --> 01:28:20,797
OK, Big Sis.

1250
01:28:21,107 --> 01:28:22,961
How is it that you never seem
to get any older?

1251
01:28:23,035 --> 01:28:24,702
You look exactly the same
as when you were younger!

1252
01:28:25,478 --> 01:28:27,483
And how is it that you just
seem to get older and older?

1253
01:28:28,086 --> 01:28:30,584
He finally looks his age, is all!

1254
01:28:30,744 --> 01:28:33,043
It took me ten years to speak
informally to this punk.

1255
01:28:33,122 --> 01:28:35,949
Shut it.
He's still a kid to me.

1256
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,660
As if.
He's like... 70.

1257
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:40,103
I said shut it!
The kid will hear.

1258
01:28:40,832 --> 01:28:42,103
I already heard it all, though.

1259
01:28:42,675 --> 01:28:44,774
Don't listen to evil things, my child.

1260
01:28:46,226 --> 01:28:47,602
-OK.
-Only listen to good things, OK?

1261
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,603
OK.

1262
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:50,502
I won't.
I can't hear anything.

1263
01:28:50,945 --> 01:28:52,701
I haven't seen Jung Bong lately.
Did he go somewhere?

1264
01:28:52,972 --> 01:28:53,972
He went to a Buddhist temple.

1265
01:28:53,983 --> 01:28:55,582
Why, is he sick again?

1266
01:28:58,117 --> 01:29:00,302
Oh my.
She really has no fear.

1267
01:29:00,605 --> 01:29:03,202
Bo Ra... will be fine, right?

1268
01:29:06,194 --> 01:29:08,026
How dare you use
informal speech with me?

1269
01:29:08,052 --> 01:29:09,000
Do you know me?
Huh?

1270
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,010
Hello? Who is it?

1271
01:29:11,603 --> 01:29:14,156
-Bo Ra.
-Are you OK?

1272
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:19,701
Oh, geez!

1273
01:29:19,759 --> 01:29:22,302
There's no set order
when it comes to dying.

1274
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,432
Oh my god... what'll we do?

1275
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,592
How could this have happened?

1276
01:29:27,603 --> 01:29:31,501
Isn't this world
just way too unfair?

1277
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:33,501
They said they'll raise them.

1278
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:35,803
How am I supposed to live now?

1279
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,602
Then come eat with us,
at my place.

1280
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,501
OK.
Give that here.

1281
01:29:40,512 --> 01:29:42,982
Taek likes Duk Seon.

1282
01:29:43,093 --> 01:29:45,292
It has to go well.

1283
01:29:46,019 --> 01:29:48,918
What the...
so it's first love, huh?

1284
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,932
What would you do without me?

1285
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,261
Taek!
