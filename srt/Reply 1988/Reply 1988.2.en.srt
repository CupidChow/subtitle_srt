1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,960
All right.

2
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,220
I will now introduce my affectionate
family, full of love and happiness.

3
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,050
First, I will introduce
someone who is attempting

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,900
to get into college for
the sixth year in a row.

5
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,330
The symbol of tenacity and
being honest to a fault.

6
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,010
The eldest son of our
family, Kim Jung Bong!

7
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,760
He must have gone to the study room.

8
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,040
Next up is my son, who looks
exactly like me from head to toe...

9
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,340
I introduce to you our
second son, Kim Jung Hwan!

10
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,840
Jung Hwan.

11
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,180
Say something for the camera.

12
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,080
Geez... quit doing stuff
like this, already.

13
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,180
Today's the first time
I've done this, though...

14
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,540
The only one who I can trust is my wife.

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,700
The lady of our house and my cheetah...

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,870
My jaguar! Honey, say something!

17
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,240
Please.

18
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,280
You brought this from
your store again, didn't you?

19
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,610
How much is this worth?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,150
980,000 won.

21
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,910
What got into you?
You're such a miser.

22
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,600
How can you call your husband a miser?

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,040
Here... a word to your miser husband?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,330
Geez! I can't even hit you...

25
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,830
It's not that you can't hit me,
but that I am without fault!

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,900
-How are you without fault?
-Ouch!

27
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,040
Geez that hurts!

28
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,340
Excuse, excuse me.

29
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,250
Excuse, excuse yourself!

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
Look. Look.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,330
Seeing everything.

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,150
Is this the Fan Guru's house?

33
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:03,430
Yes, yes, yes it is!
How did you know?

34
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,630
Don't reciprocate his stupidity,
Deok Sun. It'll become a habit.

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
I think it's funny, though.

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,500
Mom wanted me to bring this to you.
My grandma brought it.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,740
Aigoo... tell her that we'll enjoy it.

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,640
Deok Sun, you must be happy.

39
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,410
You really love your grandma.

40
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,140
Yes.

41
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,980
But she's leaving tomorrow.

42
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,780
Hey!

43
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,950
Why are you using your hands?
So dirty...

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,540
What does it matter to you?

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,670
Ah, this scent... you have such a
nice scent coming from you.

46
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,660
Geez... don't old farts like me
just smell like old farts?

47
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,140
No.

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,040
You smell nice.

49
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,040
Dad smells like this, too.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,360
Your belly is so flat,
so how did Dad, my uncle

51
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,190
and my chubby aunts come out of here?

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,300
After giving birth to four chubby kids

53
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,680
my belly shriveled up like this.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,530
Look at the kind of question
coming out from a high schooler's mouth.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,360
Grandma. Do you know what
Sung Deok Sun's nickname is?

56
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,720
Don't you dare.

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
It's "Special Forces."

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,290
It stands for "Head Especially Bad at Studying."

59
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,530
Are you any good at studying?
All you do is participate in protests!

60
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,610
Did you just call me "you?"

61
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,940
You little...

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,800
Hey! I'm warning you!

63
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,650
Argue one more time, and I'll
beat you and kick you both out!

64
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,050
I'll beat you to a pulp!

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,830
Mother. You're not uncomfortable
in any way, right?

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,340
Then, have a good night.

67
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,300
OK, OK.

68
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,050
-Go on.
-Yes.

69
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,920
I oughta kill you both...

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,140
Sung Deok Sun... consider
yourself saved by Grandma.

71
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,580
-Grandma.
-What?

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,550
What was Uncle like?
Did he study better than Dad?

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,550
No. Your father was a whole lot smarter
than him when it came to school.

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,050
That's why he graduated from Gwangju Commerce
High School, regarded as the best in Gwangju.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,860
Your uncle...

76
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,050
took it upon himself since he was young
to earn money for his younger siblings.

77
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,440
But even so, Uncle is
the richest among us.

78
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,550
He even lives in the U.S.

79
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,050
Running a dry cleaner in
the States isn't easy.

80
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,550
He's just barely managing
to put food on the table.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,050
When I think about your uncle...

82
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,120
My heart still hurts.

83
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,950
Then, who's the more filial son?

84
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,160
My dad calls you every morning.

85
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,540
Why would I rank them?

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
Both of them are filial sons.

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,550
Your dad and your uncle never fought.

88
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,980
You think they were like you guys! Geez.

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,820
That's because unnie
always picks fights with me first.

90
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:13,950
Hey!

91
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,240
-Not again...
-What?

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,450
You little...

93
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,160
Come out.

94
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,040
-Mother, be careful.
-OK.

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,630
At any rate, why are you
in such a rush to leave?

96
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,900
Since you're here, you might as well
spend another night here.

97
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,540
Aigoo! I have to go home and dry the
peppers. I have a lot of things to do.

98
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,210
Grandma, I'll come visit
during winter vacation.

99
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,550
-Take care of your health till then.
-OK, my child.

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,050
But... where's Bo Ra?

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,920
Where'd she go so early?

102
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,550
She left early to go to the library.
College students study so much nowadays.

103
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,340
Library, my ass.
She probably went to protest.

104
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,060
Oh dear... hey.

105
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,000
You're throwing this away?

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,160
What?

107
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,540
Yes.
It's not usable anymore, Mother.

108
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,780
What are you saying?
It looks fine!

109
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,040
Give it here.

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Yes, Mother...

111
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,880
Let's see. Wow!

112
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm going to use it as
an umbrella holder.

113
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,480
Geez... you already have so
much stuff to carry back!

114
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,150
Why are you taking that, too?

115
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,380
When I come visit you,
I'll buy you a better one than this!

116
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,540
Why would you waste
your money like that!

117
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,090
I can just use this one.

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Hey, you'll be late to work.
Go. Quickly!

119
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,550
Geez.

120
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,700
-Good bye!
-Have a safe trip!

121
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
I told you, I've got it!

122
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,300
-No!
-Stop it!

123
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,100
-Give me that!
-No, I'm holding it!

124
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,440
-That's mine!
-Stop that!

125
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,040
Stop worrying about me and go!

126
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,470
Give me that!

127
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,280
No! You give me back my stuff!

128
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,110
-Geez!
-Why are you carrying everything?

129
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,350
Go, already. Go.

130
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,250
So stubborn.

131
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,750
I'm off!

132
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
OK, see you later.

133
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,360
If you wear that and get caught
by your sister, you're dead!

134
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
Unnie goes drinking every Saturday.
I'll be home before her.

135
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,540
Hey, Kim Jung Pal! How do I look?

136
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,710
I'm late. Get lost.

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,950
Hey, there's only three minutes left.

138
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,050
This is new. How does it look?

139
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,390
Isn't that your sister's?

140
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,550
Hey, only two minutes left! Let's hurry!

141
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,990
Hello!

142
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Hello, Go Kildong ahjussi!

143
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,870
Hey Heedong! When did you get back?

144
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:51,670
Yesterday.

145
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,870
Are you going to school?

146
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,370
Yeah.

147
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,340
Drink a lot of milk and grow big soon,
our little Taek!

148
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,640
You have to hurry and grow up so you
can marry me.

149
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,050
Special Forces, there's only
one minute left!

150
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,350
You want to die?

151
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,050
You want to die? Hey!

152
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,990
Come to school on time.

153
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,400
Aren't you tired of getting hit on the
head for being late every morning?

154
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,100
My head is hard like a rock.
It doesn't hurt at all.

155
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,200
Hey, Joey Wong.
So... what percentage did you get?

156
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,840
Only 45 percent.

157
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,550
I don't think our love will work out.

158
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,880
Look.

159
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
You idiot... you did it wrong!

160
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,210
What?

161
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,550
You wrote your name first. It means you
like Byun Jin Seob oppa 45 percent.

162
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,550
Really?

163
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Let me try it again.

164
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
I'll write oppa's name first.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,740
70 percent!

166
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,640
70 percent?

167
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,310
70 percent? Byun Ji Seob likes
you 70 percent? What the heck!

168
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm going to try it, too. Me too.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,960
What is this?

170
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,060
They're not Korean noodles...

171
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,660
It's called spaghetti.

172
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,860
You've never had it, right?

173
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,200
It's the first time I've seen it.

174
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,550
You should have just
made normal noodles.

175
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,930
I have money, but
nowhere to spend it on.

176
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm going to eat everything that
rich people eat before I die.

177
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
What are you doing?

178
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,540
Are you cooking Korean noodles?

179
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,110
Are these chewy noodles?

180
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,710
I said it's spaghetti!

181
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
Okay.

182
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,550
Don't glare at me like a wild beast.
It's scaring me to death.

183
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,350
At any rate, why are we celebrating
Taek's victory at our place?

184
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,440
What would a widower cook by himself?

185
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,860
I told him to just buy chicken.

186
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,120
-Taek is coming, too.
-Oh, really?

187
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,330
I guess I'll see Master Choi for
the first time in a while.

188
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,660
How great it would be to have him as a
my son-in-law if only I had a daughter!

189
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,550
I claimed Taek first.

190
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,730
He's going to be my son-in-law.

191
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,970
But, Bo Ra isn't coming today?
Everyone else is.

192
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,540
She has club meetings at school
every Saturday and comes home late.

193
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,810
She will be home after midnight today.

194
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,550
Mom! Where are you?

195
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,550
Bo Ra?

196
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,720
What the heck?
Why is she back so early?

197
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,550
Mom!

198
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,800
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

199
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,550
How old am I, again?

200
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,180
Eighteen.

201
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,470
You have two more clicks to go.

202
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,900
Seventeen, eighteen.

203
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,260
If it breaks, your love is doomed.

204
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,150
If it breaks, your love won't come true.

205
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,150
Hey. Don't you even dream
of love until you get those braces off.

206
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,420
Be quiet.

207
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,790
My first love depends on this.

208
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,290
I'm going to a club trip today.

209
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,550
I'm going to go as
soon as I pack my bag.

210
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,170
What's this about a club
trip, all of the sudden?

211
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,550
I don't know.

212
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,900
An upperclassman said he got
paid today, so he wants to go Daesungri.

213
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,780
Crazy jerk!
He just does whatever he wants!

214
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,780
Mom.

215
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,550
Did you see my stirrup
pants that were here?

216
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I washed those this morning
and hung them up.

217
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,120
They should be dry by now.
Let me go get them.

218
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,390
No, it's okay.
I'll just wear these pants.

219
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
But Mom...

220
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,230
I don't see that.

221
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,050
You know... my jumper.

222
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,170
Where's my jumper?

223
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,140
The baseball jumper.

224
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,380
I left that at the dry cleaner's...

225
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,150
No, no. My denim jacket.

226
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,690
Where's my denim jacket?

227
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,920
It was definitely here.

228
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,660
I even saw it this morning!

229
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,630
Where's my denim jacket?

230
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,660
That is...

231
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,530
That is... Bo Ra.

232
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,600
It was definitely here this morning!

233
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,320
Why isn't it here now?

234
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,610
Where's my denim jacket?

235
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,380
-Darn it!
-Did I wash it?

236
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,550
Wait just a minute.

237
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,050
Where's my denim jacket?

238
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,550
Darn it!

239
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,050
Sung Deok Sun! I'm going to kill her!

240
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,540
I'm going to kill her!

241
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,040
Ah, Sung Deok Sun!

242
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,550
I think watching the fiasco downstairs
would be more entertaining than this.

243
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,710
Lend me your phone.
Oh, and the phone directory too.

244
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,140
Yes, this is Ssangmundong High School.

245
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,090
I'm looking for Dong Ryong's dad..
No, no...

246
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,860
Can you please put the
student dean on the line?

247
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,520
Yes, this is the student dean speaking.

248
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,760
Dong Ryong's father!

249
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,230
Can you put No Eul on the line?

250
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,550
Yes, hello?

251
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,470
Mom?

252
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,370
Noona!

253
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,540
He's on steroids. On steroids, for sure.

254
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,640
What am I going to wear?

255
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm going to kill Sung Deok Sun!
Darn it!

256
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,820
Where did Sung Deok Sun go?

257
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,690
Geez... where do you think?
School, obviously.

258
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,040
Geez... sometimes, I wonder how
she even got into Seoul University.

259
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,170
She's coming. Over there.

260
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,040
Where are you going?

261
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,170
To go kill Sung Deok Sun.

262
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,270
Here it is!

263
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,270
It was right here.

264
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,810
I totally forgot.

265
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm back from school.

266
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,420
Oh, you're home, Deok Sun?

267
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,920
You're extremely early today.

268
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,960
It's Saturday so I got out earlier.

269
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,630
Hey, Sung Deok Sun.

270
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,920
What?

271
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,830
Did you wear that to school today?

272
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,170
If not this, what else?

273
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,800
Deok Sun.

274
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,710
Go get washed up,
and let's go to Jung Hwan's.

275
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,570
We're celebrating Taek's victory today.

276
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,940
So Jung Hwan's mom bought
American noodles and everything.

277
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,940
Darn it!

278
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,610
What are you going to do about this?

279
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,920
-Should I try drying it with a hair dryer?
-I don't have time for that!

280
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,050
Why did you wash this
without even asking me?

281
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,690
What am I supposed to wear today?

282
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,430
Hey. Grow up.

283
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,330
What did you just say to me?

284
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,830
I said, grow up instead
of harassing Mom!

285
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,100
You little... hey!

286
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,800
You grow up.

287
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,330
You're always last place.

288
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm not last place!
There are 400 people below me!

289
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,270
Is that something to brag about?

290
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,110
And also, what do you need clothes for
when all you do is eat and play all day?

291
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,640
Just wear whatever!

292
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,180
You're so ugly.
Who would look at you?

293
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,780
I held back a lot today.

294
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,420
You're dead today. Hey!

295
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,820
And are you pretty at all?

296
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,490
You nose is as big as Mount Namsan!

297
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,540
Seriously!

298
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,040
I'm back... off to school.

299
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,630
What are making of your older sister?
Am I your friend?

300
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,990
You looked down on me first!

301
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,040
"You?" You wanna die!

302
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,330
She's crazy!

303
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,080
GoldStar High Tech Stereo.

304
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,210
If only I can meet Yong Pil oppa before
I die, I would have no other wish.

305
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,280
He's not an oppa. Jo Yong Pil
is two years younger than you.

306
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,320
Aigoo, once an oppa, forever an oppa.

307
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,550
Missus!

308
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,830
-They're still not here?
-Oh, hi, Jin Joo!

309
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,760
Wow, what is smelling so good?

310
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,460
Honey, you're home early today.

311
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,060
Geez, you...

312
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,470
Taek's dad said he's treating us for first time in
a while, of course I couldn't be late today.

313
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,800
Speaking of which,
what's on the menu for today?

314
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,940
We have spaghetti.

315
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,440
Get... getty?
What's that?

316
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,810
Spaghetti. It's American noodles.

317
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,210
How are we supposed to eat this, anyway?

318
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
How else? The same way
you eat anything else.

319
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,890
Why isn't Taek's dad here yet?
The noodles will get bloated.

320
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,190
Taek's dad is like the Jo Young Pil
of our neighborhood.

321
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,090
The superstar always comes last.

322
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,530
Oh, the superstar is here.

323
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,940
The door is open.
Why is he ringing the bell?

324
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,800
Here you go.

325
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,940
Hello.

326
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,940
"Kanttappia."

327
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,570
Go to Jung Bong oppa's room to play.

328
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,870
Why did you get here so late?

329
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,840
We were waiting for you until
our necks were about to break.

330
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,310
You should have closed
shop on a day like today.

331
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,050
You don't need to work so hard
when your son earns so much money.

332
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,580
That's not my money.
That's Taek's.

333
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,550
Where would Taek use all that money?
All he does is play baduk everday.

334
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,760
Why not use some of it?

335
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,160
Oh yes... here you go.

336
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,390
Wow... you bought two chicken?

337
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,860
Honey. Put this in kid's room.

338
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,460
Okay.

339
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,540
Is Taek coming, too?

340
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,130
It's been so long since I've seen him.

341
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,540
He's coming.

342
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
He doesn't even attend school

343
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,540
so the only friends he has
are the kids from this block.

344
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,040
He said he's going to
take a break in a long while.

345
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Oh, geez.

346
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,040
Mr. Choi.

347
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,920
Say a greeting for me.

348
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,690
Oh my! What's that?

349
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,540
Taek's father!

350
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,660
At least wave your hand once!

351
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,830
No, it's okay.

352
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,540
Geez... then...

353
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,200
Then, Bo Ra's father,
please say something!

354
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,040
Then, what about the Ugly Sisters
of our neighborhood?

355
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,900
-A camera!
-It's what they use at TV stations!

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
It records our movements!

357
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,310
Geez.

358
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,240
Oh!

359
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,540
There's a missing lady here.

360
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,480
There was a lady who was
the prettiest among you three.

361
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Has anyone seen my cheetah?

362
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,190
Here she is.

363
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,690
Put that thing down
at the count of three.

364
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,460
One, two, three!

365
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,620
You thought I was
putting it down, right?

366
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,330
-Geez...
-Ow!

367
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,280
Get rid of it!

368
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,130
My eye almost popped out!
How can I live when you're so scary!

369
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,000
-I'm back.
-Hello.

370
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,040
Come on in.

371
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,610
-Where's our Sun Woo?
-He's coming behind me.

372
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,250
-Hello! I'm back from school!
-You're here, my son?

373
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,210
Our Sun Woo... you know
I love you, right?

374
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,180
Yes.

375
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,150
I wonder why my friend
isn't coming?

376
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,120
Who?

377
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,130
Aigoo, President Sung!

378
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,000
Aigoo, President Kim!

379
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,540
-It's so great to see you!
-It's so great to see you!

380
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,770
Oh, Deok Sun!

381
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,420
Thanks for reciprocating.

382
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,710
I got it. I know.

383
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,810
How ridiculous!

384
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,220
How come Taek didn't come with you?

385
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,980
He's coming.

386
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,150
The star of the show
indeed shows up last!

387
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,560
I told him to go borrow
some comic books.

388
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,460
Wow, Deok Sun.
You've got some nerve.

389
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,540
Treating the Almighty Master Taek
like her servant.

390
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,760
He's just a star outside.

391
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,300
Amongst them, he doesn't get
any special treatment.

392
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,420
They're childhood friends.

393
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,140
Hello.

394
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,440
-Congratulations!
-Yay!

395
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,910
-Come on in!
-Hi!

396
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,880
Thank you for gracing us with
your presence today, Master Choi!

397
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,520
This place is unfit for your presence,
and yet you've come.

398
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,840
What an honor to our family!

399
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,960
Oh yeah, I want you all to greet him.
He's our son-in-law.

400
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,530
What are you saying?
He's going to marry my Jin Joo!

401
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,570
We called dibs first! Right, Taek?

402
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,970
Nice to meet you. I'm your stepmom.

403
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm your stepdad.

404
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
Oh, stop it, already.

405
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,340
Go on in.
All the kids are here.

406
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,750
Enjoy your meal.

407
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,650
Okay.

408
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,580
Taek is all grown now.

409
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,620
Geez... he's totally like an adult!

410
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,720
Compared to Taek, our
kids are all babies.

411
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,930
He's still just a kid.

412
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,900
All he knows how to do is play Baduk.

413
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,600
He knows nothing about the world.

414
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,740
Geez, you... elements of the real
world are all a part of Baduk.

415
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,640
Do you think Taek doesn't know that?

416
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,440
And he's the best Baduk player
in the world too.

417
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,140
I bet his character is even
more mature than us adults.

418
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,680
By the way, how much was
his prize money this time?

419
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,180
I heard that he won the largest
competition in Korea.

420
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,790
50,000,000 won.

421
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,340
Oh my goodness!

422
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,900
Taek should buy a huge
round for the kids today!

423
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh my!
50,000,000 won...

424
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,430
I'm speechless.

425
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,840
-I'm speechless.
-You must be so happy. I'm so jealous.

426
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,250
-50,000,000 won?
-50,000,000 won?

427
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,510
Buy us ddukbokki.

428
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:15,800
-Ddukbokki!
-Ddukbokki!

429
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,090
-Hey, have some chicken.
-That's okay.

430
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:21,250
Look at how pale your face is.

431
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:23,818
Don't just stay at the Baduk
Center and work out some too.

432
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,300
Is this your stomach or your back?
You're so thin.

433
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,630
I'm fine.

434
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,870
Hey, Taek. You're going
to China again, right?

435
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,600
When are you coming back?
Before your birthday?

436
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,140
Why? You want to throw
him a birthday party?

437
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,370
No. Bring us some liquor.

438
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,080
-Mom!
-What's wrong with you?

439
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,310
Why are you telling Taek to do that?
Buy it yourselves!

440
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,910
He's on a different level.

441
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,340
They always give him expensive
bottles of liquor in China.

442
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,480
Hey, Choi Taek.

443
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,340
Don't give it to your dad this time.
Give it to us. Okay?

444
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,260
Hey. Where are you going?

445
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,030
-To get some juice.
-Don't you dare tell on us.

446
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Fine.

447
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Hey, Special Forces.

448
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,630
Get only the juice!

449
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,495
Don't eat the ham in the fridge.
It's Jung Bong hyung's.

450
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:07,744
I won't!

451
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,010
Land.

452
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,210
Land is the best.

453
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,110
Taek's dad, buy some
land no matter what.

454
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,880
They say that Ilsan is
booming these days.

455
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,650
Geez... if you don't know
anything, don't talk.

456
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,520
What's there to see in Ilsan?
It's in the middle of nowhere!

457
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,340
Rather, it's safest to put
your money in a bank.

458
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,530
Geez... bank interest
doesn't even amount to much.

459
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,160
Of course, the interest rates
have decreased a bit

460
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,500
so it'll only be about 15 percent or so
but even so, you'll accrue interest.

461
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,640
There's no place safer than a bank.

462
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,010
You're going to put
all that money in a bank?

463
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,240
Taek's dad.

464
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,810
Buy an apartment.
The most popular apartment in Gangnam.

465
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,920
What's it called?
Mom's Apartment, yes.

466
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,850
It's Silver Horse...

467
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,820
Yeah. Grace Horse.
Umma Apartment.

468
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,790
-Eunma. Eunma.
-That's what I just said! Umma. Umma.

469
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,630
I heard they go for 50,000,000 won.

470
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,730
That's crazy! How is an apartment
that much money?

471
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,640
Ham! Ham! Ham!
It was here before.

472
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,320
-Anyway, congratulations, Taek's dad!
-Yes. Thank you.

473
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,060
Meanwhile, our daughters
are busy blowing our money...

474
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,340
Taek's dad is so lucky.

475
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,260
Jung Bong's father, come sit down.
It's still not working?

476
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,794
What's the use of being rich?

477
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,190
When you paid so much for it and
don't even know how to use it?

478
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,070
If it doesn't work, just give up
and come sit here!

479
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,570
Why are you fussing about putting on
some music in the middle of the day?

480
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,180
Then, let's just toast! Cheers!

481
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,380
Congratulations!

482
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:13,890
Jin Joo.

483
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,230
Does that taste good?

484
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,970
Can you give me just one bite?

485
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
Here, here, here!

486
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,610
Here it is!

487
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,950
Who could that be?

488
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,260
Who could that be?

489
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,060
I think someone's here.

490
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,560
Taek's dad.

491
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,160
What did I say you should buy earlier?

492
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,200
What?

493
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,130
What did I tell you to buy
if you got a lot of money?

494
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,040
Apartment.

495
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,480
Here, get up.

496
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Everyone, get up! Yeah!

497
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,620
Nice!

498
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,240
Shut the door.

499
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,320
They're at it again.

500
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,920
Who's the featured singer today?

501
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,120
The usual.

502
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,150
-My mom...
-And my dad.

503
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,560
Hello? Hello?

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:11,980
Taek.

505
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,750
Do you have anything you want
for your birthday?

506
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,720
Yeah. Tell us before you leave for China.

507
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,620
Do you even listen to music?

508
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,620
He only listens to Deulgukhwa.

509
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,665
Oh, yeah. Jeon In Kwon's solo album
is out. Do you want that?

510
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:27,903
Kim Jung Pal, you heard him, right?

511
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,337
-Buy it.
-No, thanks.

512
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:30,939
Hey.

513
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:32,407
Brazil Ddukbokki is going to close soon.

514
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,820
They close early on Saturdays.

515
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:49,120
Where are you going?

516
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,460
To eat ddukbokki!

517
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:58,280
Goodbye!

518
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,277
After the ceremony last night at 7:00 PM,
at the Jamshil Olympic Stadium,

519
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,347
the 1988 Seoul Olympics
has come to a close.

520
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,051
The Seoul Olympics,
in which 159 countries participated

521
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,653
had the Soviet Union get first
place, with 55 gold medals

522
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,723
and East Germany in second
place, with 37 gold medals.

523
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:25,961
Korea came in fourth place
with 33 total medal count,

524
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:27,963
which is its best record
in its Olympic history.

525
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:30,198
Hey, get up!

526
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:34,336
Why does he always shift down
in his sleep?

527
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:36,638
Get up, Sung No Eul!
You have to go to school!

528
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,709
-What time is it, Noona?
-6:30 AM. Eat and wash up.

529
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:47,816
Hello? Mom!

530
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:50,120
Oh... you're awake?
What about food?

531
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:53,755
We're eating now. How's Grandma?
Is Grandma okay?

532
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,825
She's not doing so well.
I have to stay here a couple more days.

533
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,026
Did you pack the lunches?

534
00:32:58,326 --> 00:32:59,120
Yeah.

535
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:01,696
What about Dad? Is he okay?

536
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:03,732
He's fine. He's doing well.

537
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,133
Did you wake up your older sister?

538
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,120
She has to go to school early today.

539
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,320
Whatever.
I'm sure she'll wake up on her own.

540
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:32,120
Older noona. Wake up and eat breakfast.

541
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:35,163
Darn it...

542
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,120
Why, I ought to... kill you...

543
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,200
She says she's not eating.

544
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,910
I told her she has to eat.

545
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:50,779
Tell her I said that.

546
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,157
She said, "I told her she has to eat."

547
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,620
Darn it!

548
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,729
Tell Sung Deok Sun
to stuff her own darn face.

549
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,620
Okay.

550
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:15,203
She told you to stuff
your own darn face.

551
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,120
Tell her that, if she doesn't stuff her
darn face, I'll wash up first!

552
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,680
Geez...

553
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,487
She says that if you don't stuff your
darn face, she'll wash up first!

554
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:36,191
Tell her to do that
if she has a death wish!

555
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,400
Okay.

556
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,120
She said, "Do that
if you have a death wish."

557
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:51,620
Is this fun for you?
I ought to kill you!

558
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,120
Seriously! You're all psychopaths!

559
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,917
Mommy...

560
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:25,620
Seriously!

561
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,376
Is there no hierarchy
in this house?

562
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,620
Why are you washing up first?

563
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,080
You didn't wash up when you were
supposed to! I'm going to be late!

564
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:34,616
I told you last night that
I was washing up first, didn't I?

565
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:36,784
Then why don't you get up early
and wash up first?

566
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:37,919
What? "You?"

567
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,487
You think you're a freaking
queen or something?

568
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,455
"You?"

569
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,120
Yeah, "you!"

570
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:45,360
Hey!

571
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,463
You're insane!

572
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:50,880
Hey!

573
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,120
-Get over here.
-Hey!

574
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
I'm telling Mom!

575
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,088
Let go. Let go!

576
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:26,901
You know what we're
doing tonight?

577
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,102
-Yeah.
-What?

578
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:29,871
Look at you,
acting like you don't know.

579
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,220
We agreed to go to Samyang Movie Theater!

580
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:36,010
I heard that this is much better
than "Two Moon Junction."

581
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:45,060
Isn't your mother too much?
What did she just make?

582
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
It's not cooked at all!

583
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,057
It's much better than your crappy
instant noodle lunch!

584
00:36:50,992 --> 00:36:52,393
You know about lunchtime, right?

585
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:53,795
What is it now?

586
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:56,120
Soccer, you punk!

587
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,366
I'm not playing with Crazy Mutt.
I don't want to break my ankle.

588
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:02,770
He's always singling me out!
He's a total psycho!

589
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,400
It's fine. He's a nice guy.

590
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,040
And what do you base that on?

591
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,509
He doesn't smoke.

592
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:10,712
Does that make him nice?

593
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,700
Yeah.

594
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,583
Geez... you're so simple.
Are you an amoeba?

595
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:16,985
We already told them that you're coming.

596
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:18,853
Whatever. I'm sleeping during lunchtime.

597
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,787
Crazy jerk.

598
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:21,823
Why sleep at lunchtime when we
already had math and physics classes?

599
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,625
Jung Hwan says he'll cover you.

600
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,920
Sun Woo. Sun Woo! Please?

601
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:29,297
If you're not there,
who's going to score goals for us?

602
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,766
Tell me, who? Please?

603
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:32,667
Your turn.

604
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,520
Sun Woo. Please?

605
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,711
I'm gonna kill you.

606
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,300
Stop reading romance novels
already, you two.

607
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:11,272
Aren't you tired of them by now?
What's this?

608
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,741
"An Officer and a Princess?"

609
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:19,620
"He headed straight,
toward her lips."

610
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:22,817
"And he desired
her luscious lips deeply."

611
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,053
"She grew flustered."

612
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,721
"What flustered her was"

613
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:32,620
"not his rough lips, but the feeling of
his bare, rock hard chest against..."

614
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:34,996
Are you sexually frustrated?

615
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,265
What is she saying? Give it here.

616
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,134
Hey, come to your senses, already.

617
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,303
There are no guys like this
in real life.

618
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,306
"Bare, rock hard chest," my ass.

619
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:50,445
Hey. Ben Johnson.
He has the best body.

620
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,649
Hey, hit them no matter what.

621
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:57,620
Do it when the referee
isn't watching, okay?

622
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,319
Okay.

623
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:01,089
If we lose again today,
I'm going to hit you upside the head.

624
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:01,856
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

625
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:02,724
Let's work hard.

626
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,991
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

627
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:07,195
Why aren't these jerks coming?

628
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:15,336
Hurry up and get your asses over here!

629
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,120
You take care of Crazy Mutt.

630
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,820
You know that I hate
guys like him, right?

631
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,325
Geez you jerk.

632
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,532
Here. Here.
Hey hey hey here.

633
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
I got that goal in.

634
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:22,620
Geez... Seriously!

635
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,372
Did you see that? The referee didn't see.

636
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:51,766
Over here, over here!

637
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,694
This one is a bit weak.

638
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,140
They only kiss.

639
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:23,397
Throw it out.

640
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,705
Don't disappoint me.

641
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,120
Show me some bare skin!

642
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:38,240
Deok Sun!

643
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,914
The teacher is looking for you.

644
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:57,200
Hey... what do I do?

645
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,769
If you get caught,
just say that they're mine.

646
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:03,504
All you did was bring them to me.

647
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:04,980
Okay?

648
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,454
Deok Sun.

649
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,223
Yes, Teacher?

650
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Pick up the phone.

651
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,627
-It's from your family.
-What?

652
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,234
Hello? Who is it?

653
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:45,446
If it weren't for Crazy Mutt,
we could have won 5-0.

654
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,515
No, 10-0.

655
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,785
Hey Salamawakr,
what time is the movie tonight?

656
00:42:51,018 --> 00:42:52,153
We can skip evening
study hall, right?

657
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:53,454
Three o'clock.

658
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:56,457
You crazy jerk... we at
least gotta attend class!

659
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,758
No, Crazy Mutt...
At your three o'clock.

660
00:42:57,858 --> 00:42:58,359
What?

661
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:00,620
Move over.

662
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:03,620
You guys are real close.

663
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:06,233
Yes, hyung. We're friends.

664
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:09,570
Hey, Student Body President.

665
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:12,873
You're all right at soccer.

666
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,810
Why don't you be the only
forward from now on?

667
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,615
I said you become the
forward next time onwards!

668
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:24,986
So scary! Look at this jerk's eyes!

669
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:32,126
What are you going to do
by just glaring at me?

670
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,596
You think you're great because
you're President?

671
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,801
And what's this? Is it a necklace?

672
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,605
Take it off, jerk.

673
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,408
A student can't wear
a necklace to school.

674
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:50,526
A Student Body President...

675
00:43:50,537 --> 00:43:52,381
...has to set an example for the rest
of the student body, right, sir?

676
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:57,120
I said take it off, jerk.
Take it off.

677
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,186
Take it off!

678
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,620
You can't hear me?
Are you deaf?

679
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,595
I said, take it off, jerk!

680
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:11,265
Hey.

681
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:13,768
We're dead meat if we're late
to our next class. Come on.

682
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:14,435
Let's go.

683
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,904
This dumbhead!

684
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:20,408
See you next time.

685
00:44:20,975 --> 00:44:21,942
You're dead.

686
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:28,916
You dropped something.

687
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:38,793
Darn it... let's go.

688
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:39,927
We have the dean's class.

689
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,268
Can't you just take that
off for a little bit?

690
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:49,637
My dad gave this to me,
how could I take it off?

691
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:52,373
Why can't you?
You can just put it back on later.

692
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,242
Geez... you're so frustrating.

693
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,620
Don't cry. Pack your bag and come.

694
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:12,893
Unnie.

695
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:16,897
Unnie!

696
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:18,666
It's okay. Stop crying.

697
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,901
Grandma is in a better place now.

698
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:25,706
I told your teacher everything
so pack your bag quickly and come.

699
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:27,141
Unnie!

700
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,176
No Eul is coming, too.

701
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:32,379
We have to catch the last train. So
there isn't much time. Hurry and come.

702
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:34,120
Unnie!

703
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:01,208
Hurry and go to sleep.

704
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:03,410
It'll be a while until
we get to Gokseong.

705
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:05,312
You won't be able to sleep there.

706
00:46:57,832 --> 00:46:59,934
Okay. I won't cry anymore.

707
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:02,736
Are you sadder than Dad?

708
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,609
Don't you cry, either.

709
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:10,811
The son has to console Dad.

710
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:14,949
Let's go.

711
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,325
Is this really the wake?

712
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:00,461
It feels more like a party.

713
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:04,632
This is our Grandma's house... right?

714
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:11,205
Bo Ra, you're here? Eat.

715
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,120
Where did Dad go?

716
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,620
I only see our aunts.

717
00:48:36,263 --> 00:48:38,065
What if Dad is sick?

718
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:41,120
Oh. Hey, Bo Ra!

719
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,120
Dad...

720
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:54,315
What are you doing? Say hello.

721
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,321
Sir! This is my eldest, Bo Ra.

722
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:03,824
She goes to Seoul University,
the best college in the nation!

723
00:49:03,924 --> 00:49:05,426
She's a student there!

724
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:07,120
-Hello.
-Yes, yes!

725
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:08,662
You're Bo Ra?

726
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:10,965
When did she grow up to be a lady?

727
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:15,102
Yeah, she did well in her studies
since she was a little girl!

728
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:21,008
We didn't have money to send
her to cram school like others

729
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,376
or get her a tutor.

730
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:27,915
Even so, she studied up all on her own.
And then got into Seoul University!

731
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,354
And... this is my second eldest,
Deok Sun.

732
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:37,257
She's the one who was on TV
during the Olympics!

733
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,261
This is Deok Sun! I saw her on TV!

734
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:46,620
Hey... after this is over,
let's take a photo together!

735
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,969
Yes, yes.

736
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:57,644
I heard that holding those picket signs
is really competitive.

737
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:01,620
Since you're seen on
international television and all.

738
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:06,420
I heard hundreds and thousands
competed for a spot!

739
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:09,120
That's amazing.

740
00:50:10,324 --> 00:50:14,962
Oh yes, and the one on the end
is my youngest, No Eul.

741
00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:19,700
He's a much more filial
son than he looks.

742
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,503
He looks kind.

743
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:24,471
Hyungnim. It's me, Jae Young.

744
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:27,141
You must be so mournful.

745
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:29,120
Oh my, Jae Young! You punk!

746
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:32,620
Wow, it's really been a while!

747
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,549
Wow... you look like you're
doing well for yourself nowadays!

748
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:36,483
Not at all.

749
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:38,752
Sit down, and let's have a drink.

750
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:40,320
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

751
00:50:45,926 --> 00:50:48,620
Unnie. Is Dad a cyborg?

752
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:51,965
How could he not shed
a drop of tear?

753
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,838
Wow... it's really been a long time
since I've seen you.

754
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,475
-Yes.
-Isn't the soup good?

755
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:04,120
Are all adults like that?
They don't get sad?

756
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:06,747
Be quiet. Just keep frying these.

757
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,316
Our aunts, too.
It's their mother.

758
00:51:09,383 --> 00:51:10,818
Is this the time to be
showing off her ring?

759
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,820
Unnie, not white gold!

760
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,120
I'm telling you, yellow
gold is the best!

761
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:19,760
Just look at the design.

762
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:21,829
I feel so bad for Grandma.

763
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:27,734
Geez... take the younger kids
and go to sleep.

764
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:30,120
I'll take care of this.

765
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:32,306
Uncle isn't coming?

766
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:34,875
We gave him a call as soon as
Grandma collapsed.

767
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:36,743
He didn't get to be by her side
during her final moments.

768
00:51:37,277 --> 00:51:39,046
I'm sure he'll be here tomorrow.

769
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,014
It's not like the U.S.
is around the corner.

770
00:51:41,915 --> 00:51:43,851
And there's nothing that can be done
if he can't come.

771
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:47,454
I feel so bad for Grandma...

772
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,892
Stop crying.

773
00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:53,227
I won't stand for it anymore.

774
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:55,429
What? I can't even cry if I want to?

775
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:57,598
You little...

776
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:01,335
Stop it. Other people are watching.

777
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,620
But... what if there are cops there?

778
00:52:24,124 --> 00:52:25,859
You know how busy
Korean police officers are?

779
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:27,494
Why would they waste time
coming to a local theater?

780
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:30,620
That's nonsense.

781
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:56,223
Why are the cops...
was there a thief?

782
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:00,227
It's because today's
the premiere. Tomorrow is okay.

783
00:53:00,227 --> 00:53:02,296
-You want to come back tomorrow?
-Of course!

784
00:53:03,664 --> 00:53:05,599
-Let's go.
-Where? Back to school?

785
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,534
-Are you crazy? No. Taek's place.
-Why?

786
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,038
An erotic love tale among mulberry
trees, as sweet as honey.

787
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:13,807
I borrowed "Mulberry 2."

788
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:19,513
Taxi!

789
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:13,133
I'm off!

790
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:16,203
Sun Woo!

791
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:19,139
You're going to be late
again today, right?

792
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:21,008
Uh... yeah.

793
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:22,075
Oh yeah, Mom.

794
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:23,510
When are you going to Gokseong?

795
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:27,047
Tomorrow. I was going to go
with everyone in town.

796
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:30,384
Sun Woo. Your lunch will
be cold by dinnertime.

797
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:32,052
Buy yourself cup noodles.
How much do you need?

798
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,520
I only need 500 won.

799
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,622
Here's your lunch.

800
00:54:36,723 --> 00:54:38,792
Eat it with some cup noodles.
How much is it?

801
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:40,460
10,000 won.

802
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:42,262
Want to die?

803
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:45,766
I'm off.

804
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:54,141
Mother. Please just give me 100 won.

805
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:58,512
With just 100 won, I can play all day
with an Olympic legend.

806
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,013
Study!

807
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:03,750
Mother, please just give me 100 won!

808
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,037
He's still sleeping.

809
00:55:57,971 --> 00:56:00,607
Oppa, wake up and have breakfast.

810
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:03,120
Wake up! Breakfast.

811
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,244
Let's eat.

812
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:06,513
Geez... eat up.

813
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:09,249
Put the rice in the soup.

814
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,450
Oh my...

815
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:14,988
You didn't make any seasoned clams? Or
Korean pancakes? You should give me that!

816
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:18,120
Just eat the rice in the warm soup!

817
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:19,459
You knew I like that.

818
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:24,865
Wow. This spicy meat stew is great!

819
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:31,772
Wow. A son of a nouveau-riche
sure is different.

820
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:34,141
Here we go.

821
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:38,078
It's kimchi.

822
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:40,447
What is this?
You only have kimchi?

823
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,516
If there's only kimchi...

824
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:47,354
Curry rice!

825
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,557
Then first eat what you
brought for dinner.

826
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:52,926
I was going to do that.
I had curry for breakfast, too.

827
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:54,995
All right.

828
00:56:58,532 --> 00:57:00,734
Side dishes? Nope, none.

829
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:04,471
Do we have any soup?

830
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:06,573
No, we do not.

831
00:57:06,873 --> 00:57:11,144
Then... kimchi fried rice. Darn.

832
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,980
Hey, have some of mine.

833
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:19,620
Wow, sausages.
It's hard to make these taste bad.

834
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,221
Shall I try one?

835
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:25,725
Ugh, it's so salty!

836
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,896
Just what is your mom making every day?

837
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:31,998
This one tastes fine.

838
00:57:35,735 --> 00:57:37,304
Oh, it's just an eggshell. It's fine.

839
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,120
He lives in an environment
where it's impossible to gain weight!

840
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:42,742
Ugh, so salty.

841
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:49,149
You know that we're making
our second attempt tonight?

842
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:52,886
The cops are probably going to
be there today, too.

843
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,256
That's why I came prepared.

844
00:57:56,389 --> 00:58:00,293
You guys just have book smarts
but no wisdom of life.

845
00:58:08,535 --> 00:58:10,971
What about dinner, though?
My mom packed me dinner.

846
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:13,273
It's all eggshell-encrusted
sausages, anyway.

847
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,620
I'll buy today.
Hamburgers. You down?

848
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:17,277
Of course.

849
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:19,246
We don't have much time. Strip!

850
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:29,623
Three soldiers.

851
00:58:45,338 --> 00:58:46,573
Hey, wait.

852
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:47,941
I have to go to the bathroom.

853
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,343
What, already?

854
00:58:51,912 --> 00:58:53,513
You crazy jerk.

855
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:19,390
Sun Woo.

856
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,043
He wants you to come over here, too.

857
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:39,501
Look at Uncle.

858
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:41,739
Is he here just to play cards just
because it isn't his own mother.

859
00:59:42,128 --> 00:59:44,364
Hey. Even his wife, the daughter,
is perfectly fine.

860
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:45,599
So what more the son-in-law?

861
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,870
Way to go, you little rascals!

862
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,972
You're third years with
important exams coming up!

863
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:54,630
You must be crazy!

864
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,450
And you call yourselves prefects?
Prefects?

865
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,778
You little rascals!

866
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,370
You really must be out of your minds.

867
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,049
How dare you come here now?

868
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,619
Geez... these punks!

869
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:16,529
Oh, look here. Isn't this my son?

870
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,498
You must be so busy, sir.

871
01:00:18,498 --> 01:00:20,266
So how did you make time
to wander all the way here?

872
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:22,302
-Hello, Father.
-Yes, yes.

873
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:24,571
You see, I was just going to partake
in some cultural education, and then...

874
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:26,106
What is this kid saying?

875
01:00:26,106 --> 01:00:27,841
What cultural education, you rascal!

876
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:31,370
-You should be studying!
-Ow... Father, Father!

877
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,413
Who's your father?

878
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:37,584
Your father died because
you drove him insane!

879
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:41,955
If you're bad at studying,
you should at least stay out of trouble!

880
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:42,822
I ought to...

881
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,164
Geez.

882
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,870
Consider yourselves saved
thanks to Sun Woo. Got that?

883
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:55,870
All right?

884
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:59,039
Come to the teacher's lounge
after classes tomorrow. Got that?

885
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:00,370
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

886
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,370
-Got that?
-Yes sir!

887
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,108
Got that?

888
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,370
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

889
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,279
I'll see you later at home...

890
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,890
Don't you dare think about
coming home tonight, punk.

891
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:14,287
-I respect you, Father!
-You punk.

892
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,370
Hey, Student Body President!

893
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:26,499
Why don't we chat for a sec?

894
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:29,769
Hey.

895
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:31,870
Hey.

896
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:33,720
Thanks.

897
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,576
How can I ever repay this debt to you?

898
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,013
-Hyung, it's not like that...
-Shut up.

899
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:48,310
Hey, Mr. President.
I said thank you.

900
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:49,489
All right?

901
01:01:54,227 --> 01:01:55,520
Look at this jerk.

902
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,864
His upperclassman
is saying something to him...

903
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,868
What's this?

904
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:07,530
I told you to take it off.

905
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,630
Take it off, jerk!

906
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,520
This jerk...

907
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,020
That... that was Sun Woo's father's.

908
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,520
He got it as a keepsake
when his father passed away.

909
01:02:36,469 --> 01:02:37,410
So what?

910
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,839
What do you want me to do about it?

911
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:43,643
Can you disrespect your seniors
because you have no dad?

912
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:46,713
You proud that you don't
have a dad or something?

913
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,020
You flaunting that, jerk?

914
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,091
Are you out of your mind,
you crazy jerk?

915
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,328
You just say whatever that comes out
of that shithole you call your mouth?

916
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,264
Choose your words before
you speak, jerk.

917
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:27,253
I guess Uncle isn't coming.

918
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:28,521
It's almost 10:00 PM.

919
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:32,759
Tomorrow's the funeral so if he can't
make it today, it means he's not coming.

920
01:03:47,373 --> 01:03:49,642
Dad. Get some sleep.

921
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,490
Geez... my pretty and kind daughter.

922
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,186
Your Dad is fine.

923
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:02,590
I'm fine.

924
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:17,530
Dong Il.

925
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,020
Dong Il.

926
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,520
Dong Il.

927
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,967
Our poor mother...

928
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:25,020
Our poor mother!

929
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:29,520
Why did she have to go so soon?

930
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,679
Why the hurry?

931
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:36,683
Now we can't see her anymore!

932
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,386
I miss our Mom...

933
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,420
-Oppa!
-You're here!

934
01:05:44,557 --> 01:05:46,826
Why did you come so late?

935
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,920
We waited for so long!

936
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:52,420
You couldn't even say goodbye to her...

937
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:56,602
Mom wanted to see you so much!

938
01:05:58,304 --> 01:06:01,040
It's just that adults were holding on.

939
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:08,681
They were just busy being adults

940
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:13,252
and they just acted strong due to
the pressure that came with their age.

941
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:17,420
Adults feel pain, too.

942
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,727
I can't go on.

943
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,563
I can't go on without my mother!

944
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:25,965
Mom!

945
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:29,420
Mother!

946
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,172
Mother...

947
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:52,358
Sit down.

948
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,634
Give me your hand.

949
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:50,049
Bye.

950
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:54,987
Jung Hwan!
Can I sleep over at your place tonight?

951
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,390
You know, the dean lives at my house.

952
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,025
You think he won't know
if you're at my house, you idiot?

953
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:06,766
What do we do about your necklace?

954
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:08,920
I'll just not wear it anymore.

955
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,038
What about your face, though?

956
01:08:13,372 --> 01:08:14,807
Worry about yourself.

957
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,612
Bye.

958
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:24,650
Bye.

959
01:09:15,635 --> 01:09:18,237
Even so, it's fine to
be deluded sometimes.

960
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:22,275
If you can make your mom happy
by making her think her cooking is good

961
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:27,079
it's easy enough to eat bad tasting
lunches without any complaints.

962
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:32,950
I'm home!

963
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,830
Oh, you're home, my son?

964
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,290
-Yes!
-Oh, my son!

965
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:39,420
I'm going to go wash up. Go to sleep.

966
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,226
Okay.

967
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:47,433
Wow... my Sun Woo ate all of his lunch.
Were they good?

968
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,068
Yeah! They were delicious!

969
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,207
There's no need to force the harsh truth
onto happy delusions.

970
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:58,444
Some times, delusions make us happy.

971
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:04,310
Another victory for Choi Taek,
"6-dan," has been reported in China.

972
01:10:05,251 --> 01:10:07,286
Yesterday at 6:00 PM,
at the Tong Yang Cup

973
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,455
taking place at the
Shangri-La Hotel in Beijing.

974
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:15,190
Choi Taek, "6-dan," beat Jeo
Bi Pyung, "9-dan," of China

975
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:20,070
with 343 moves.

976
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:24,370
Choi Taek, "6-dan," came back to Korea
through Gimpo Airport this morning.

977
01:10:24,537 --> 01:10:29,420
In order to celebrate his 18th birthday
along with his victory...

978
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:33,130
I'm sure Taek's mother
is so happy up in Heaven.

979
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,314
What a filial son he is.

980
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,651
Oh, please. It's over once you're dead.

981
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:41,053
What good are filial deeds
after your parent dies?

982
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:43,610
You have to treat your parents
well while they're around.

983
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:50,130
Is it a blackout?

984
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,665
The lightbulb must be out.

985
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:55,668
I'll go buy one. Give me some money.

986
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,905
On your way back, get 200 won's
worth of bean sprouts too

987
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:01,641
so we can have some
soup tomorrow morning.

988
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:07,580
Don't drink, honey.

989
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:09,420
All right, all right.

990
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,920
Oh, Master Choi!

991
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,800
Are you heading home?

992
01:11:29,468 --> 01:11:30,503
Hello.

993
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:40,270
Hey, Taek... today...
can you be my drinking buddy?

994
01:12:06,105 --> 01:12:10,920
Wow... our Taek is an adult now.

995
01:12:13,179 --> 01:12:15,247
When did you become so mature?

996
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,418
You're all grown now.

997
01:12:24,056 --> 01:12:24,920
Ahjussi.

998
01:12:28,294 --> 01:12:29,962
I heard that your mother passed away.

999
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:34,710
I'm sorry.

1000
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,336
I couldn't even visit.

1001
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:42,074
Why are you bringing that up now?

1002
01:12:42,842 --> 01:12:44,610
I'm going to start crying.

1003
01:12:47,513 --> 01:12:48,630
That's right.

1004
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:55,588
Mothers tend to be the one you miss
the most, whether they're alive or dead.

1005
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,420
Yeah, I miss my mother.

1006
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:07,420
Taek.

1007
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:11,750
When do you miss your mom the most?

1008
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,456
Every day.

1009
01:13:35,728 --> 01:13:39,064
I miss my mom every single day.

1010
01:13:56,782 --> 01:13:58,390
An adult-like child is just one

1011
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,486
without complaints.

1012
01:14:01,987 --> 01:14:04,920
It's just that they've acclimated to the
world of adults

1013
01:14:05,624 --> 01:14:08,661
and they've grown used to
the illusions around them.

1014
01:14:10,396 --> 01:14:13,666
But an adult-like child is still a child.

1015
01:14:18,804 --> 01:14:20,920
An illusion is short, but a
misunderstanding lasts a long time.

1016
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:25,711
That's why illusions offer freedom while
misunderstandings chain you down.

1017
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,990
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you!

1018
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,381
Happy birthday, dear Taek!

1019
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,710
Happy birthday to you!

1020
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:06,930
Yay!

1021
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,690
Come home earlier!

1022
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:12,925
Look here.

1023
01:15:13,893 --> 01:15:15,995
Hey, change into something else.
Are you a grandpa?

1024
01:15:15,995 --> 01:15:17,530
I thought I'd die of
starvation waiting for you.

1025
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:18,831
We even called the Baduk center!

1026
01:15:18,864 --> 01:15:19,899
Hurry up and blow it out.

1027
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:20,900
It's going to blow out. Hurry.

1028
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,420
Hurry! One, two, three!

1029
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:28,807
-Here, your present.
-Yay!

1030
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:30,676
We're done now, right?

1031
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:32,545
Where is it? Hurry it up.

1032
01:15:32,545 --> 01:15:33,812
-Where is it?
-Take it out!

1033
01:15:33,812 --> 01:15:34,920
Here, here.

1034
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,550
Hey, let's do this later.
Where is it?

1035
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:39,920
Hey, I want to watch
Saturday Night Movies.

1036
01:15:40,019 --> 01:15:42,154
Hurry up and take it out!

1037
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,390
Hey, let me see.

1038
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:46,091
Where is it? Hey, lower the volume!

1039
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:48,761
Taek, you're not going to eat
all this, right? I'm taking it home!

1040
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:49,862
-Okay?
-Where is it?

1041
01:15:49,862 --> 01:15:51,997
Hey, it's obviously in his bag!
Geez!

1042
01:15:51,997 --> 01:15:53,399
Bag! Give me that.

1043
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:54,633
Let me see. Open it.

1044
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,168
All right, all right, all right!

1045
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,372
Oh Maotai liquor. It's a good one!
Nice job!

1046
01:16:00,372 --> 01:16:03,042
Mom! These kids are drinking!

1047
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:04,420
Stop screaming! Hey!

1048
01:16:07,613 --> 01:16:09,682
They're drinking!

1049
01:16:09,882 --> 01:16:13,052
Taek was the last one
to move into this neighborhood.

1050
01:16:49,655 --> 01:16:51,920
After his mother passed away, they left

1051
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,327
their hometown which was
full of her scent and came to Seoul.

1052
01:16:57,596 --> 01:17:02,134
We don't know why this shy father and
son chose this block in particular

1053
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,836
but what I am sure of

1054
01:17:04,236 --> 01:17:09,041
is that the four troublemakers of
this block found a new friend.

1055
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:46,478
Taek was a quiet kid.

1056
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:52,851
So the boisterous kids on this block
may have been too much for him.

1057
01:19:09,194 --> 01:19:12,331
Even so, Taek was always with us.

1058
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:15,067
Even when we were
doing mischievous things

1059
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:18,937
or doing pathetic things
he was always by our side.

1060
01:19:20,105 --> 01:19:23,041
Of course, he always had
an expressionless face.

1061
01:19:23,642 --> 01:19:25,911
But even so, he was always with us.

1062
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,156
The alley creates friendships
just through the power of time.

1063
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:43,061
That is how the taciturn child
and the four noisy kids became friends.

1064
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,732
And that's how we became five.

1065
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,420
Geez... really.

1066
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,289
Just from drinking this?

1067
01:20:10,656 --> 01:20:13,130
And here, I thought you guys
could handle your liquor.

1068
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:18,597
Hey.

1069
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:22,267
Just try it, then. You'll die.

1070
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:25,571
What do you take me for?

1071
01:20:41,553 --> 01:20:42,521
Oh... hey!

1072
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:52,497
Hey! You're all dead!

1073
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:57,236
Ugh... what do I do?

1074
01:21:18,257 --> 01:21:19,758
She's pretty. Joey Wong.

1075
01:21:21,026 --> 01:21:22,027
Yeah.

1076
01:21:25,697 --> 01:21:28,066
There's no such girl in real life.

1077
01:21:30,535 --> 01:21:32,271
Who do you think is the prettiest?

1078
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:38,290
Joey Wong.

1079
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:41,713
We said there's no such
woman in real life.

1080
01:21:42,514 --> 01:21:44,820
I have my eyes on a girl
at Jung Ui Girls' High School.

1081
01:21:45,918 --> 01:21:48,086
The girl with the short
hair with the pale face?

1082
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:50,920
How did you guys know?

1083
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,126
Everyone who takes the
20-2 route bus knows her.

1084
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:57,920
Then... there's another girl
I have my eyes on from the study room.

1085
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:00,010
She's a Third Year with long hair.

1086
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:00,966
She goes to a
arts high school.

1087
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:03,001
The noona who wears a white cardigan?

1088
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:08,920
You little rascals...
you don't study but only ogle at girls?

1089
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,913
That's right. That noona looks pretty
to everyone's eyes.

1090
01:22:15,814 --> 01:22:16,748
Also...

1091
01:22:16,748 --> 01:22:17,920
You have another one?

1092
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:24,222
Doesn't it seem like Deok Sun has
gotten just a little bit cute, lately?

1093
01:22:28,727 --> 01:22:29,570
Yeah.

1094
01:22:31,496 --> 01:22:33,198
Yeah. A little.

1095
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:37,569
Hey, Taek. What about you?

1096
01:22:40,572 --> 01:22:41,306
Yeah.

1097
01:22:43,508 --> 01:22:44,376
Hey, Jung Hwan.

1098
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,690
You're crazy, aren't you?

1099
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,080
You're all out of your minds.

1100
01:22:48,613 --> 01:22:49,982
Are you all drunk?

1101
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:52,951
Geez.

1102
01:22:53,952 --> 01:22:54,810
Geez.

1103
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,850
After drinking all
that expensive liquor!

1104
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,920
Darn it! That jerk farted!

1105
01:22:59,024 --> 01:22:59,992
It smells!

1106
01:22:59,992 --> 01:23:02,027
Stop that, already!

1107
01:23:02,027 --> 01:23:03,695
Why did you have to fart on us?

1108
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:06,999
And why are you coughing?

1109
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:33,859
You read it, didn't you?

1110
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:35,394
Read what?

1111
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,770
My diary!

1112
01:23:37,162 --> 01:23:37,996
No.

1113
01:23:37,996 --> 01:23:39,131
Yeah, you did!

1114
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,233
I told you, I didn't.
Stop being so loud.

1115
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:43,350
It's coming out of my mouth,
so mind your own!

1116
01:23:43,468 --> 01:23:44,569
Be quiet!

1117
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:45,537
You read it, didn't you?

1118
01:23:45,537 --> 01:23:46,338
I told you, I didn't!

1119
01:23:46,338 --> 01:23:47,350
Mom!

1120
01:23:58,984 --> 01:23:59,885
You read it, didn't you?

1121
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,420
I told you to be quiet.

1122
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,650
You did.

1123
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:05,420
I didn't.

1124
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:18,570
"At the hour when everything
is draped in darkness..."

1125
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:22,420
"and therefore,
becomes a lonelier time..."

1126
01:24:23,508 --> 01:24:25,577
"at this hour, when even the
wild flowers are asleep..."

1127
01:24:26,011 --> 01:24:29,614
"my feelings for you cannot
seem to become still with the night."

1128
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:30,920
I'm going to kill you! Hey!

1129
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:33,385
"They say that love
is meant to be expressed."

1130
01:24:33,452 --> 01:24:35,820
"That's why I have to become brave
and let these words escape my lips..."

1131
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,920
Hey!

1132
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,391
Mom! Deok Sun has someone she likes!

1133
01:24:39,624 --> 01:24:40,926
She even gave him chocolate!

1134
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:42,010
Hey!

1135
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,120
How did I write these words
in a sober state?

1136
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:56,470
I want to throw it away,
but nowhere to toss.

1137
01:24:57,809 --> 01:25:00,512
I'm afraid to put it in the trash
in case someone finds it...

1138
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:05,750
If anyone reads it...
Oh, so embarassing!

1139
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,420
You were pretty bad back then.

1140
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:14,159
What kind of a high schooler
is that crazy about boys?

1141
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:19,264
You read my diary, didn't you?

1142
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:23,920
Wow. I can't believe you.

1143
01:25:24,503 --> 01:25:25,537
What the heck!

1144
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:28,507
You read my diary, right?

1145
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,443
-No.
-Yeah, you did!

1146
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,544
I didn't.

1147
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,420
Hey. Be honest with me.

1148
01:25:36,848 --> 01:25:39,084
How can you say "hey" to your husband?

1149
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,420
If you can say it, why can't I?

1150
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:43,088
You did read it, didn't you?

1151
01:25:43,088 --> 01:25:44,322
I didn't!

1152
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,920
Who did you give the chocolate to?
I didn't receive it.

1153
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,420
Really...

1154
01:25:55,934 --> 01:25:57,950
Why did you read someone else's diary?

1155
01:25:58,036 --> 01:25:59,471
Why?

1156
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:00,430
Who did you give it to?

1157
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:01,650
I gave it to you!

1158
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,141
What the heck! You want to die?

1159
01:26:03,141 --> 01:26:03,990
It wasn't me!

1160
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,843
Yeah, it was.

1161
01:26:04,843 --> 01:26:05,770
It wasn't you?

1162
01:26:08,813 --> 01:26:09,730
Yeah, it was.

1163
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,770
I'll come back after a smoke.

1164
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,170
It was you!

1165
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,310
I told you, it wasn't me!

1166
01:26:33,371 --> 01:26:35,590
Geez... it was him.

1167
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,710
It's been almost 30 years,
so I guess he forgot.

1168
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,781
He was so smart back then, too.

1169
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:15,914
Jin Joo.

1170
01:27:20,619 --> 01:27:21,553
Does it taste good?

1171
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,069
Where are you going?

1172
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,271
To go eat ddukbokki!

1173
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,682
Goodbye!

1174
01:28:00,091 --> 01:28:02,761
Your sister is going on
a field trip tomorrow!

1175
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:09,434
My mom might kill me...

1176
01:28:14,773 --> 01:28:15,573
Hey!

1177
01:28:16,841 --> 01:28:17,610
Hey!

1178
01:28:26,351 --> 01:28:27,052
Deok Sun.

1179
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:28,019
Want to eat ramyun?

1180
01:28:28,019 --> 01:28:30,255
Deok Sun! Sung Deok Sun!

1181
01:28:30,255 --> 01:28:31,222
Deok Sun!

1182
01:28:31,323 --> 01:28:32,490
Sung Deok Sun!

1183
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:34,259
Sun Woo is going to wear down
the threshold.

1184
01:28:34,326 --> 01:28:35,093
Bye.

1185
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:37,829
What are you going to do?

1186
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:38,897
About what?

1187
01:28:39,164 --> 01:28:40,699
It looks like he likes you.

1188
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,805
Let's go, Sun Woo.
