I thought she was getting better.

Yes. I admit.

Why don't we make a bet while we're on it?

Will Han Su die or wake up again?

A search and seizure warrant? On what grounds?

75
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:05,940

They're worried that this investigation...

87
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,985
will end up leaking all their private cases.

88
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,685
It's not like those clients came to me personally.

89

for all the damages too.

96
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,385
Was this your plan all along?

97
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,355
Did you give me Kim Han Su's case...

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,425
to do this to me?

99
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,840
Giving me the case got you out of a headache,

100
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:46,395
and if anything goes wrong, you could just blame it on me.

101

Let me be honest with you.

102

There are many others...

103
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,245
who could replace you.

104
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,290
So you were the top student at the training institute.

105

than a cog.

108
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,140
You're stuck in a system I created, and you must turn...

109
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,995
until your teeth wear out.

110
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,765
You're just a cog.

Once your teeth wear out and you don't turn as well anymore,

112
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,815
then I'll get rid of you and find a new one.

Just because I need it...

114
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,855
doesn't mean it's valuable.

00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,565
(Teaching License)

167
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,805
Are you homeless?

168
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,750
I told you not to eat...

169
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,560
the expired food.

170
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,790
How dare you eat them without my permission?

171
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,945
I was hungry at night.

172
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:34,400
If you're hungry, then buy something with your money.

173
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,330
Are the expired food yours?

174
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,425
Why are you stealing someone else's property?

175
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,570
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.

176
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,610
I'll deduct what you ate from your paycheck,

177
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,465
got it?

178
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,250
I hired you although you're underage because your family is struggling.

179
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,120
How can you be so shameless?

180
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,935
Gosh.

181
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,385
Hey, Porter!

182
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,665
- Nice. - Awesome.

183
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,320
You're the best porter.

184
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,405
Just in time. I'm almost out of cigarettes.

185
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,020
You have to pay me first.

186
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,590
Hey, it's not like this is our first time.

187
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,085
You think I won't pay you?

188
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,815
Here. This is for the merchandise.

189
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,185
This is for the delivery.

190
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,425
Okay.

191
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,110
- I want one too. - Nice.

192
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,680
Take it. This is for you.

193
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,975
Please get us different kinds next week.

194
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,885
Byung Ho.

195
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,525
Why isn't he wearing a helmet? It's dangerous.

196
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:57,780
- Hey. - Give me one too.

197
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,480
- This will last a week. - I want one.

198
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,850
- You've got three of them. - Why don't you give me back...

199
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,250
- the one you borrowed last time? - You have four of them.

200
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,180
- I have only two. - I gave it to you.

201
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,950
- I'm leaving. - You have four.

202
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:08,335
Give it to me.

203
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,760
My gosh. Why am I put through this again?

204
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,330
Give me 1 more. You've got 3.

205
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,975
I'm older than you.

206
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,355
Hey, handsome boy.

207
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,025
Can we talk?

208
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,325
Who are you?

209
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,740
I work at Cheonmyung High School and my name is Ha So Hyun.

210
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:32,240
Nice to meet you.

211
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,135
You guys go to Gwangjin High School, right?

212
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,280
What does it have to do with us that you're a teacher there?

213
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,280
Is it because of this?

214
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,950
Yes, it's because of that.

215
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,420
I'm afraid smoking on your way to school in school uniforms...

216
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:47,405
is too much of a threat to other pedestrians.

217
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,190
What are you saying? Just leave us alone.

218
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,360
You're not even our teacher.

219
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,685
I wish I could,

220
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:58,325
but I have too great eyesight and sense of justice.

221
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,870
Unless I failed to see it,

222
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,110
I can never let this happen.

223
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,480
Excuse me.

224
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,465
I'm an adult. Surprise.

225
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:10,180
I flunked out a year because I caused trouble.

226
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,380
Ma'am, please excuse us.

227
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,790
This is our ritual to start a fresh morning.

228
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,835
- Hey, the lighter. - Okay, one second.

229
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,805
Goodness.

230
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,345
I said you'd better give up.

231
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,285
What are you doing? Let go of me.

232
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,400
If I do, will you quit smoking? Then I will.

233
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,325
What the...

234
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,240
Will you stop?

235
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,410
If you quit smoking, you'll get muscles and your lungs get stronger.

236
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,250
This is what makes you weak like this.

237
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,150
Hey, just shake it off already.

238
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,075
It's not like I'm not trying to. I can't...

239
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,520
Are you two flirting or what?

240
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,375
- Hey, use your muscles. - Hurry.

241
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:56,015
Darn it!

242
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,185
- What? - Oh, no.

243
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,230
- Are you okay? - Are you all right?

244
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,370
I crossed the line again.

245
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:07,070
Hey, are you okay?

246
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,870
Leave me alone! Hey, call the police!

247
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,980
- Okay. - Let's call the police.

248
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,010
Police? You don't have to call the police over this.

249
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:17,880
Wait. How about we settle...

250
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,735
Look over here.

251
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:22,190
Hi, guys. Say "cheese".

252
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,060
- "Cheese". - What?

253
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,645
What is this? Where did you get this?

254
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,160
A group picture. In 1, 2, 3.

255
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,260
What are you doing? You can't just take pictures of us.

256
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,670
You don't want to destroy evidence. Stay away.

257
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,070
Who are you, old man?

258
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:37,415
Old...

259
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,240
You know what?

260
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:41,870
Did you know that ID forgery is a very serious crime...

261
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:43,410
and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years...

262
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:47,140
under the terms of Article 225 of the Forgery Act?

263
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,150
You also violated Article 3-11 of the Minor Offenses Act by littering,

264
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,950
Article 3-15 by abusing nature, and Article 3-22 by using a lighter.

265
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,990
All together, you will have to pay at least a few hundred dollars.

266
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,390
You're going to be short of pocket money for quite a while.

267
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,290
I just got hit. She threw me over.

268
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,600
You pushed her first aggressively. You were so tough.

269
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,115
I filmed everything here.

270
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,070
So what do we do now?

271
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,740
Should we go to the police station as you insist...

272
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,110
or you just reflect on yourselves here...

273
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:20,365
and be good students by quitting smoking.

274
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,505
- What is this? - I don't know.

275
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,390
We'll quit smoking.

276
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,750
- We will. - We will.

277
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,090
We will quit smoking.

278
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,020
Good. So we settled, right?

279
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,245
Give the rest to me.

280
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,785
But this is really expensive.

281
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,570
Hurry up. You're good kids.

282
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:47,425
All right. Now go to school. You should go study.

283
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,470
They don't even have bags.

284
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,680
Bye. Good luck with your studies.

285
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,325
- Wait for me. - Quit smoking so you can live long.

286
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,705
Are you okay?

287
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,775
You almost got arrested for assault.

288
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,390
Pardon?

289
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,990
But that boy pushed me first...

290
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,990
When someone pushes you, you should just dodge...

291
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:12,300
or at least push them back to call it self-defense.

292
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,630
If you throw him down onto the concrete,

293
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:17,785
that's without doubt excessive self-defense.

294
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,325
Right.

295
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:23,770
Anyway, thank you for helping me.

296
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:27,480
That's okay. I can't turn a blind eye to this kind of things.

297
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,495
I'm a teacher.

298
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,205
Teacher?

299
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,265
Yes, I'm a teacher.

300
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,845
Nice to meet you.

301
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:42,490
Starting this semester,

302
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:45,330
I'll be teaching politics, law, and German.

303
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,460
My name is Gi Kang Je.

304
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,770
I appreciate your kindness...

305
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,770
and support in advance.

306
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,185
Thank you.

307
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,640
After getting a law degree from Hanguk University,

308
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:02,080
he even went to a German law school as an exchange student.

309
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,880
He's such an elite.

310
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,220
He'll also be the assistant teacher for sophomores in Class 3,

311
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:08,275
so please help him out.

312
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:14,175
- Mr. Gi, your desk is over there. - Okay, ma'am. Thank you.

313
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,160
Gosh, he's overqualified.

314
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,770
Shouldn't he be a lecturer in a college...

315
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,370
instead of a high school short-term teacher?

316
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,870
He even teaches two subjects and will be in charge of Class 3 too.

317
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,095
Goodness, he's an all-rounder.

318
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:30,980
He will definitely help them cut the budget.

319
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,580
All right.

320
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:36,210
Make sure to create an academic atmosphere...

321
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,880
so no student thinks they are still in the middle of the vacation.

322
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:43,175
Oh, and finish up the career counseling by next week.

323
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,105
Ms. Jo.

324
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,645
Yes?

325
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:48,690
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:52,460
Please take extra care of your students.

327
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,485
You know what I mean.

328
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:59,325
I want you to do your job properly.

329
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,565
Yes, ma'am.

330
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:10,480
Now, let's have another fun and hard-working year.

331
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:13,405
- Yes, ma'am. - Let's go.

332
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,490
Alas, it is gone.

333
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:24,945
Sadly, my dear vacation is gone for good.

334
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,260
Love is what humans do.

335
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,630
I knew the day of parting would come...

336
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,870
and stayed alert,

337
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,870
but the school started unexpectedly...

338
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,570
and we get filled with grief, as there's an exam ahead of us.

339
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:40,110
Alas, the vacation is gone,

340
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:43,310
but I have yet to let the vacation go.

341
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,050
To my poor fellow students who still remember...

342
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,650
the sweet morning sleep and brunch,

343
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:49,650
I will dedicate this song.

344
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:53,305
"24 Hours" by Sunmi.

345
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:17,695
Yun Ah, don't you think that was too half-hearted?

346
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:20,480
You're only a freshman. You don't know anything...

347
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:23,120
about the sophomores' sentiment...

348
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,060
who will soon take the exam.

349
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,075
You're right. I'm just a freshman, so I'd like to stay innocent.

350
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:33,145
That's new. Did you buy it?

351
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,985
It was on sale. It's not expensive.

352
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,955
I see. It's pretty. It looks good on you.

353
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,365
A smartphone released a year ago.

354
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:50,365
Touch screen, fine. Minor scratches, many.

355
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,750
B plus.

356
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,065
(Cell phone, B plus)

357
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:58,290
Cell phones and tablets are dirt cheap these days.

358
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,145
I'll buy them both at 100 dollars.

359
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,645
But I paid 300 dollars for this tablet last month.

360
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,645
Really?

361
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,155
Then sell it there.

362
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,755
Do you want to take it back?

363
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,225
No, I'll sell it to you at that price.

364
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:18,795
Okay. Now, let's see.

365
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,895
Everything including the smartphone...

366
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,380
I'll be generous. 600 dollars. Is that good?

367
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,550
Your interest upfront is 10 dollars, it's 5 dollars for the appraisal,

368
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,020
and the keeping fee is 10 dollars. If we take 25 dollars off,

369
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,560
you'll be left with 138 dollars after your overdue interest.

370
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,345
Do you want this amount in cash, or do you want to pay the principal?

371
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,330
Are you going to broadcast the fight tonight?

372
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,045
I'll bet everything on it.

373
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,030
Deal. Come to the rooftop tonight.

374
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,070
No one will be at school since it's the first day back.

375
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:48,025
Okay. I'll see you later. Bye.

376
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,550
They're such losers.

377
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:58,520
They're so simpleminded for being the smartest kids in Korea.

378
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,605
It's good for us.

379
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,605
We better get Porter ready.

380
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,690
Let me officially introduce myself.

381
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,990
I'm the homeroom teacher for Class 3 of the sophomores.

382
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,615
I'm the PE teacher Ha So Hyun.

383
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,185
I'm Gi Kang Je.

384
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:16,885
It's your first time teaching, right?

385
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,370
Yes.

386
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,485
Don't worry too much.

387
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,570
Kids these days can be scary,

388
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,710
but I'll help you as your senior.

389
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,035
I'd be so thankful. I look forward to learning from you.

390
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:34,020
I think it'd be best if we didn't tell other teachers...

391
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:37,175
or students about how we met earlier this morning.

392
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:41,405
It could start a misunderstanding.

393
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:45,430
"Misunderstand"? In what way?

394
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:48,900
You know, this or that way...

395
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,470
Are you talking about the time you tried to preach some kids...

396
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:55,325
who were smoking, but were humiliated?

397
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:58,640
Yes, well... That too.

398
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,780
Or do you mean...

399
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:02,650
when you got excited and threw a defenseless young boy...

400
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,580
onto the pavement by his wrist?

401
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,150
That too...

402
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:09,690
I know. Was it when you got scared when a girl...

403
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:11,820
tried to take you to the police station?

404
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:15,815
Yes, you're right. I mean all of that.

405
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,300
Are you trying to kill me twice?

406
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,045
Don't worry. I'll keep everything a secret.

407
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:23,700
- Really? - Of course.

408
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,625
A senior is asking me for a favor. I'll keep my lips sealed.

409
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,280
You're a pretty cool guy.

410
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,780
Let's forget about the past,

411
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,450
and do our best as colleagues.

412
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,950
- All right. - Let's do this.

413
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,150
Let's do this.

414
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:40,905
- Let's go. - Okay.

415
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,585
Tae Ra, you have such silky hair.

416
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,510
Tae Ra, do you know...

417
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:07,610
if there's a spot open for English at your mom's private institution?

418
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,780
Please help me get tested.

419
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:10,780
I need to take a math course.

420
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:14,005
My mom's nagging at me to join an intensive class.

421
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:16,490
I'll ask Mom.

422
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,475
- Thank you. - Thank you.

423
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:22,875
Hey, followers. It's Ye Ri.

424
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:27,330
It's the first day back at school today, so I'm really nervous.

425
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:31,255
Please click on the heart to help me cheer up.

426
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:32,885
(Don't be fooled, everyone. She's evil.)

427
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:37,125
Lee Gi Hoon, you son of a gun.

428
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:46,020
Hey guys, were you surprised?

429
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,635
My agency has been telling me to work on my acting.

430
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,305
Let's take a break.

431
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,690
(Followers 349, Following 256)

432
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,930
Darn it.

433
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,645
(Block)

434
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,885
(You cannot access this broadcast.)

435
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,200
Will you look at that. Did she block me?

436
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,255
Does she think this is the only account I have?

437
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,070
(Switch Accounts)

438
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:09,425
(Log-in)

439
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:18,180
Hey, Gi Hoon. We're thinking of using the rooftop.

440
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,305
We're broadcasting a fight today.

441
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,820
Sure, go ahead. Don't make too much noise.

442
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,250
It'll be annoying if someone makes a report.

443
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,505
All right. I'll manage it well.

444
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,195
(Key expressions)

445
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,465
Hello.

446
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,390
Nice to see you. I look forward to teaching you again this semester.

447
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,430
I won't need an introduction,

448
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,415
but you must be curious about someone else.

449
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:06,185
- Mr. Gi, please introduce yourself. - Okay.

450
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:19,980
Do any of you know what I just said?

451
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:21,935
You'll get bonus points if you get it right.

452
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,995
Bonus points?

453
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,505
"The truth..."

454
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,275
Can you speak louder so everyone can hear?

455
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:51,125
"The truth doesn't require a lot of words,"

456
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:55,695
"but no words are enough for a lie."

457
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,280
Do you know who said it too?

458
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,005
Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche.

459
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:05,805
That's correct.

460
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:10,175
- Porter. - Porter.

461
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,930
Nice to meet you.

462
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:15,070
I'll be teaching you politics, law, and German.

463
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,985
My name is Gi Kang Je.

464
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,340
Our laws were influenced by the Continental Law,

465
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,440
and especially laws from Germany.

466
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:25,010
If you're thinking of studying in this field,

467
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,435
you'll benefit from my classes.

468
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,165
I look forward to teaching you.

469
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:33,365
All right. That's it for the introduction.

470
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,005
Are we missing someone?

471
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:40,045
Yu Beom Jin. He must be in a shoot.

472
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:44,115
Okay. I'll do the attendance.

473
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,445
Cho Joon Ho.

474
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:50,330
We're Korea's first 1 on 1 survival debate program...

475
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:51,600
with regular citizens.

476
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,100
Citizen Debate Battle.

477
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:55,510
Today's battle between a law school student from Hanguk University...

478
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,440
and a high school student has been a hot topic.

479
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:02,310
The theme is "Should the law against parricides be abolished?"

480
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:05,050
A tight debate will continue.

481
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,650
The law that condemns parricides...

482
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:10,505
derives from a Korean-specific culture.

483
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,120
Even the Constitutional Court, which is the highest judicial authority,

484
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,630
showed in a ruling in 2013...

485
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:19,600
that parricides should be subject to stronger social criticism...

486
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:23,670
in comparison to regular murders.

487
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:26,970
A human should act humanely.

488
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:29,410
There are means we must follow.

489
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,670
A family is precious.

490
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,340
This law reflects respect for families.

491
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:34,880
It shouldn't be abolished.

492
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:37,750
As this law reflects Korea's family values,

493
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,280
his opinion is that the law should be kept.

494
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,235
Please make your refuting statement.

495
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:44,220
According to what you just said,

496
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,790
do you mean that the law against parricides contributes...

497
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:48,560
to straightening our beliefs about families and filial duty?

498
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:52,730
Of course. The law helps to change people's awareness.

499
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,015
Does the law help change people's awareness?

500
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:58,000
To me, it sounds like the state is forcing...

501
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,325
filial duty as a value on its citizens.

502
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,940
What do you mean, "force"?

503
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,840
If a child murders their parent, it'd cause an outrage.

504
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:08,780
It's an emotion anyone would feel if they're human.

505
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,910
That's right.

506
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:12,635
However, that emotion shouldn't control the law.

507
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,490
Looking at it from a juridical perspective,

508
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,650
being born as a child to someone isn't out of choice.

509
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:20,390
Whereas for the parent, it's something they chose to have.

510
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:23,260
To give a bigger sentence to someone who never had the freedom...

511
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:26,460
to choose is an illogical law and a violation of the constitution.

512
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,615
But this law is important in our society...

513
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,170
because it reflects our society's general ethics.

514
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:33,400
Out of those who murdered their parents,

515
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,870
over 40 percent of them were victims who were...

516
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,210
harmed psychologically or physically by their parents.

517
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:41,410
In comparison, only seven percent were immoral murders.

518
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,310
Do you still believe this law...

519
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,605
helps straighten our values on families and filial duty?

520
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:49,090
There are other laws that could punish murderers...

521
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,120
for immoral homicides.

522
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:53,190
Keeping this law would be unnecessary.

523
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:55,660
Also, the law doesn't exist as a tool to maintain...

524
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,175
our values on families and filial duty.

525
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:00,330
If you plan to become a lawmaker,

526
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,830
you should ponder on why Lady Justice...

527
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,985
has her eyes covered.

for Kim Han Su.

537
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:52,050
Ms. Jun didn't approve your request to take the day off,

538
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,080
so you were absent without notice.

540
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,675
Yes.

541
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,975
I did what I did because he's my student.

542
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,430
He doesn't have a guardian,

543
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:09,785
so I went to the station when I didn't have any classes.

544
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,615
It didn't get in the way of work.

545
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,425
Good job.

546
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:21,080
That was truly admirable.

547
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,910
You couldn't turn away...

548
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,220
from a student in trouble. Very impressive.

549
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,520
You didn't think a bit about the trouble it'd cause the school.

550
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:32,960
All you could think of was the student.

551
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:36,730
That is so wonderful. I'm amazed.

552
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,985
You're definitely a model teacher.

553

On that note,

555

I'd like to offer you...

a position that's just perfect for you.

There was a request from the Education Office.

00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,990
Following the recent incident,

563
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,930
they want us to provide our students with counseling more actively.

564
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:14,800
However, we can't afford to hire someone new for that.

That's why I'm asking you,

00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,930
Do you have a death wish?

658
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:52,275
Sorry.

659
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, it's the first day of the semester.

660
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:04,310
Let's finish early and go for dinner together.

661
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:07,080
It's a welcome party for Mr. Gi.

662
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:08,395
Thank you.

663
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,410
Mr. Gi, the thing I asked for earlier...

664
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,035
Oh, sure.

665
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,290
She got an excuse. How much will she torture us tonight?

666
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:20,705
Exactly.

667
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:23,030
She won't let us go home all night.

668
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,830
I'm going home after dinner. I have to feed my dog.

669
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,600
If you can't avoid it,

670
00:41:27,602 --> 00:41:30,955
enjoy it, eating as much meat as you can.

671
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:49,090
Well... Ms. Jun, I'm not feeling so well.

672
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,605
I think I should go home.

673
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,660
Ms. Jo.

674
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:57,330
You're a Grade Head. You shouldn't miss it.

675
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:58,690
How long are you going to go on like this?

676
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,400
You're ruining our work atmosphere.

677
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:01,945
I'm sorry.

678
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,255
You can go home today.

679
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,885
But be more careful in the future.

680
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,125
- Here you go. - Thanks.

681
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:16,280
Everyone, is your glass filled?

682
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,265
Let's make a toast.

683
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,120
If you drink up the whole shot,

684
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:24,490
I will adore you for the next semester.

685
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:26,420
Raise your glasses higher.

686
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:28,245
There you go.

687
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,930
To the accident-free semester!

688
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,885
- Cheers! - Cheers!

689
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,910
Ms. Ha.

690
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,310
It's hard to be a new counselor, right?

691
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,095
Let me pour you a drink.

692
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,165
Sure. Thank you, ma'am.

693
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,110
You're amazing.

694
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,320
I was really worried...

695
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,935
you might turn down the job.

696
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:03,445
It looks like you do care a lot about the students.

697
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:07,515
Of course, I do. I want to see my students graduate.

698
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:15,555
Drink up.

699
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,340
Let me pour you one too.

700
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,135
This is why I like you, Ms. Ha.

701
00:43:25,453 --> 00:43:26,780
Let me pour you one too.

702
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:30,775
I don't want you to get jealous because I didn't pour you drink.

703
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,360
Don't worry. I'm good.

704
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,660
Ms. Shin.

705
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:38,430
You should gratefully accept from your superior.

706
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:40,500
- Right. - Right?

707
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:44,330
Otherwise, my hands will be embarrassed.

708
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:45,785
Wait.

709
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,965
Here we go again. The awful infinite drink relay.

710
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:03,790
Awful? What is that, sir?

711
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,135
"Sir"?

712
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,345
Come on. You don't have to call me that.

713
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:13,100
She picks two people and keeps pouring drinks for them...

714
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,500
until one of them pass out.

715
00:44:14,502 --> 00:44:16,530
And if they come late to work the next day due to the hangover,

716
00:44:16,537 --> 00:44:19,015
she will pick on them saying things like they've got no spirit.

717
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,425
She's such a pervert.

718
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:25,710
Ms. Ha, if you trouble the school again...

719
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:28,765
under the pretense of counseling students,

720
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,750
I won't be smiling like this then.

721
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,320
You know what I mean, right?

722
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,090
Yes, of course.

723
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,905
Let's keep it up then. Please drink up.

724
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:42,915
Yes, ma'am.

725
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:48,300
Ms. Jun. I'd love to have a drink from you.

726
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:53,140
Goodness, of course. I need to pour you a drink too.

727
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,395
Here you go.

728
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:06,780
It tastes great.

729
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,780
- Let me pour you one too. - Okay.

730
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,460
I'll let this handsome single man pour me a drink then.

731
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,605
Wait. I have something for you.

732
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:19,130
May I pour you a drink of this?

733
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,600
Oh, my. What is this? It looks so pretty.

734
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:24,870
My cousin sent it to me,

735
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:27,640
saying this is a famous liquor for beauties.

736
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,755
I thought this would be a perfect drink for you, Ms. Jun.

737
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:35,680
Mr. Gi, you're such a smooth talker.

738
00:45:35,683 --> 00:45:37,150
Pour me some smoothly.

739
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,465
Yes, ma'am.

740
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:41,705
Here you go.

741
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:48,760
It even tastes beautiful.

742
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:51,545
You're beautiful too.

743
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,255
(Arranging goods)

744
00:46:07,882 --> 00:46:10,365
Is anybody in there?

745
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,820
Why is this convenience store locked?

746
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:17,775
Darn it. This is annoying.

747
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:33,440
We'll get going.

748
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,900
- Okay. - Okay. Have a safe ride home.

749
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:36,625
Make sure not to be late tomorrow.

750
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:41,740
- You need to go home. - Let's have another round.

751
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:43,850
Ms. Jun. There will be other days.

752
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:47,520
I will bring a much prettier liquor next time and invite you.

753
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:50,290
- You have to promise me. - I promise.

754
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:53,645
- Stamped and copied. - I'll go home then.

755
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,975
Gosh, you're adorable.

756
00:46:57,298 --> 00:46:59,215
Oh, no. Be careful.

757
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,585
Thank you, sir.

758
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:06,125
No, I don't want to.

759
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:11,755
This is unbelievable. She let us go after the first round.

760
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:15,140
Mr. Gi is pretty useful.

761
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,995
You're right. He saved us.

762
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,620
Mr. Kang! You need to go home.

763
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:23,935
Stop walking in place.

764
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,775
- There's a taxi. - I don't want to.

765
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:27,860
You take that one.

766
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:30,745
- Thank you. Have a safe trip home. - Take good care of him.

767
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,560
- Bye... - Why did you drink so much?

768
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,200
- See you tomorrow. - See you.

769
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,715
Goodness.

770
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,995
Finally, everyone is gone.

771
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,180
You did a great job on your first day.

772
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:49,995
You did a great job too.

773
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:52,920
Thanks to you, we didn't have another round.

774
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,565
Would you like to go grab a beer?

775
00:47:54,722 --> 00:47:58,150
Since I owe you from this morning, it's on me.

776
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:01,820
Starting from tomorrow morning I'm going to watch the students...

777
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:03,690
in front of the school entrance.

778
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:06,530
I'm sorry, but I'd like to go home now.

779
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,400
You're going to watch the students?

780
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:12,885
Yes. I want to start my day with the students.

781
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,725
There's a taxi.

782
00:48:16,343 --> 00:48:18,755
I called one using an app.

783
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,480
You can ride that. You'll have to come to work early tomorrow.

784
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,195
I'll take it then.

785
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,150
Good work today, ma'am. Have a good night.

786
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,005
- See you tomorrow, sir. - See you.

787
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:42,145
Mr. Gi really cares about the students.

788
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,255
All right. I should keep up too.

789
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:50,795
I'm going to run the counseling center properly.

790
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:52,395
I can do it.

791
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,935
I'd like to go to Cheonmyung High School, please.

792
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,055
Thank you, sir.

793
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:35,405
This school is really huge.

794
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,385
Where could it be?

795
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,465
The club room is open,

796
00:50:39,153 --> 00:50:41,605
but this door has a digital door lock.

797
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:57,915
Won Suk is so good at wasting his talent.

798
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:39,055
Jung Su Ah.

799
00:51:58,298 --> 00:51:59,675
Look at this.

800
00:52:00,134 --> 00:52:02,485
Do you see that gap?

801
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,715
Yes. What could that be?

802
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:10,110
Someone must have taken a picture of a photo with a smartphone.

803
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,810
Considering how clear the picture is,

804
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:14,665
the original photo might have been taken with a film camera.

805
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,050
A film camera in this day and age?

806
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,235
And a high school student has it?

807
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,580
I'd say it's definitely a rare hobby these days.

808
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:25,035
Not many places develop photos anymore.

809
00:52:27,027 --> 00:52:29,045
Would this be the only photo?

810
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:33,100
It's not a photo taken with a smartphone by chance.

811
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,500
Someone must have followed her around with a camera.

812
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:39,555
I doubt this is the only photo there is.

813
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,240
The other photos...

814
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,810
Might have some clues in them.

815
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:49,040
Some of them might even have...

816
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:50,365
faces of people.

817
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:55,820
You probably should start looking in the photography club.

818
00:52:55,822 --> 00:53:00,245
It's one of the rare places where a high school student can...

819
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:02,475
take an interest in film cameras.

820
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,285
What kind of lunatic...

821
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,935
(Ahn Byung Ho versus Kim Hyung Kyu)

822
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:40,160
(Kim Hyung Kyu)

823
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,875
I want to bet on him too.

824
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,745
- Smile. - Send it to me.

825
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,215
(I trust you, Hyung Kyu. Show them the power of a loser.)

826
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,785
Let's go.

827
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,825
Let's see who wins.

828
00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:58,710
Do you have any more?

829
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,740
All right. The betting is closed.

830
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:05,350
The title match of losers. The Shuttle Monster Championship.

831
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:10,935
"Shuttle Monster Fighter" starts now!

832
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,135
What is this?

833
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,545
A lunatics' party?

834
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:54,300
All right. The fighters will enter.

835
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:56,200
He reached the finals full of spirit.

836
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,870
One more win, and he won't be a minion anymore.

837
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,370
Also known as Porter,

838
00:56:00,374 --> 00:56:05,425
Ahn Byung Ho!

839
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,295
- Go! - Let's do this!

840
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:14,205
He's from my German class.

841
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:16,220
You can do this!

842
00:56:16,223 --> 00:56:17,490
Wait.

843
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:20,175
- You have no chance. - You'll lose.

844
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,930
His opponent is not going to be easy.

845
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:26,800
Forget the embarrassing past. He's not a minion anymore.

846
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,900
The winner of the first semester's Shuttle Monster Fighter.

847
00:56:28,902 --> 00:56:32,670
A minion turned into a member of the clique.

848
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:36,895
Kim Hyung Kyu!

849
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:40,680
- Kim Hyung Kyu! - Porter!

850
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,580
- Porter! - Porter!

851
00:56:42,582 --> 00:56:44,850
- Kim Hyung Kyu! - Kim Hyung Kyu!

852
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:48,165
- Kim Hyung Kyu! - Porter!

853
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:52,150
Everyone, please take a step back.

854
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,075
Ready.

855
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:57,875
Go!

856
00:56:58,398 --> 00:56:59,930
- Kim Hyung Kyu! - Porter!

857
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:02,945
You've been fighting well. Let's have a good match.

858
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,685
- What? Okay. - Kim Hyung Kyu!

859
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,140
- Gosh! - No!

860
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:10,325
- No! - Come on!

861
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:13,070
That was a good one.

862
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:14,380
(Porter is doomed. Porter is going to die.)

863
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:15,995
Byung Ho, come on.

864
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,735
- Come on! - Hey!

865
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,435
What...

866
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,960
Byung Ho, you can do this.

867
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,160
Well, let's see.

868
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:31,545
He's incredibly strong.

869
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,400
Look at that kick. Is he Son Heung Min?

870
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:36,870
You rat.

871
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,185
- Get up! - Come on!

872
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,640
He's still being kicked. He should get back up.

873
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:43,355
He's holding on to his legs.

874
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:47,625
Ahn Byung Ho should start fighting back.

875
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,465
He's just holding on to his opponent.

876
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,335
- What are you doing? - Get up!

877
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:54,920
- What is he doing? - Gosh.

878
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,820
- Come on! - Hey!

879
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,505
It must be his strategy.

880
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,945
- Gosh. - Seriously.

881
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:04,590
(I'm going to kill Porter. I paid to watch this.)

882
00:58:04,598 --> 00:58:07,145
- Come on! - Fight back!

883
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:09,285
This is ridiculous.

884
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,315
No.

885
00:58:11,938 --> 00:58:14,455
I'm not in the position to...

886
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:17,410
I'll let real teachers deal with this.

887
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,795
- Get up! - What?

888
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,795
Do you want to end up like Han Su?

889
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:38,875
I can't do this.

890
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:41,315
I can't do this anymore.

891
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:45,155
I don't want to do this!

892
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,855
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

893
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,895
I did as you said.

894
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:52,995
I even worked at a convenience store...

895
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,365
to get you drinks and cigarettes.

896
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:58,050
And I kept silent in the classroom.

897
00:58:58,051 --> 00:58:59,335
Why...

898
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,005
do you have to do this?

899
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,860
Why? Because I can.

900
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:09,475
That's why.

901
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,645
What? Do you want to die?

902
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,315
Die if you can! Do it!

903
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,555
- Where is he going? - What's going on?

904
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,880
Do I look easy because I played with you?

905
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,295
Do I? Answer me, Ahn Byung Ho.

906
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:34,235
I can make you end up like Kim Han Su.

907
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:37,805
You'll live if you're lucky. Don't you think?

908
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,305
Go in there, and he'll die.

909
00:59:57,611 --> 00:59:59,510
(Yu Beom Jin)

910
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,925
Yu Beom Jin.

911
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:05,265
- What did you... - If you go in there right now,

912
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,605
he really will die.

913
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,755
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

914
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:43,405
Did you allow it?

915
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:45,375
You guys gathered on the rooftop last night.

916
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,960
It seems like the new assistant teacher saw everything.

917
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,720
Is everything ready?

918
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,930
Yes, Manager Lee.

919
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:52,030
Should we get started?

920
01:00:52,032 --> 01:00:54,200
The first credential adjustment meeting.

921
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,000
Test the new temporary teacher.

922
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:58,570
- Seriously... - Irritate him to size him up.

923
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,270
What are you doing right now?

924
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:01,440
I heard there was an incident.

925
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:03,425
Don't talk about it that way...

926
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:04,870
without even knowing much about it.

927
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:07,840
Stop whining about such trivial things.

928
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:11,065
Someone who was obsessively stalking Jung Su Ah...

929
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,265
put all the blame on Kim Han Su.

930
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:16,005
Just you wait.

931
01:01:16,623 --> 01:01:19,675
I'll make sure you can't sleep at night.
