1
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,360
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,985
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,395
(Send in the 2nd batter.)

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,565
(Episode 9)

5
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,275
(Ahn Byung Ho)

6
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,755
Only 35 minutes left.

7
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,225
- What is this? - Mr. Gi.

8
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,380
Gosh, how annoying.

9
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:07,150
It's a math test. We have no time to lose.

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,180
Is it you? Darn it.

11
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:12,520
Focus on your test. You have more than 30 minutes left.

12
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,905
And I turned off the phone. Focus now.

13
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,005
Okay.

14
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:49,650
All right. Send in the third batter.

15
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,115
(Send in the 3rd batter.)

16
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,895
(Yu Beom Jin)

17
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,535
Mr. Gi.

18
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,050
Yes. What is it?

19
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,015
I'm done. Can I go out?

20
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:31,630
There's some time left. You'll have to wait.

21
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,070
Can I at least get my phone back?

22
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,785
I have nothing to do.

23
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:45,335
I can't give you your phone back until everyone is done.

24
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,550
What? Is there any reason why you need your phone right now?

25
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:58,745
Then is there any reason why I can't go out?

26
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,390
What?

27
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:04,360
Once a third of the time has passed, I can submit my answer sheet...

28
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,630
and study on my own according to the school rules.

29
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,685
Is there any special reason for you to stop me from doing that?

30
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,035
What's this?

31
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,375
What?

32
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,685
(Jung Su Ah)

33
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,155
This photo...

34
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,400
(Jung Su Ah)

35
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,025
Jung Su Ah?

36
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,145
Unbelievable.

37
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,290
I hit the jackpot.

38
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:10,685
(Jung Su Ah)

39
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,585
What's happening?

40
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:30,375
Jackpot.

41
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,535
Don't disconnect yet.

42
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,090
Why are you standing up? Stay seated.

43
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:41,730
I don't know what's with you.

44
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,155
It's not like I'm breaking any rules.

45
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:48,230
Mr. Gi, just give him his phone. It's distracting.

46
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,440
- Seriously. - What is this?

47
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,270
- Just let him go out. - I can't focus.

48
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,465
It's so distracting.

49
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,335
Darn it.

50
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,435
I'll submit my answer sheet anyway.

51
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,175
Didn't you hear me?

52
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,285
Stay seated.

53
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,760
That's strange.

54
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,630
You always make a point of sticking to the rules.

55
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,755
And why are you being so unreasonable now?

56
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,910
Suit yourself.

57
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,295
I'll just do what the rules say.

58
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:39,435
Let me check my phone in front of you and return it.

59
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,805
That's no problem, right?

60
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,980
Oh, come on!

61
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,880
- My phone's brand new! - Darn it.

62
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,380
- Give us more time for the test! - My phone.

63
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,905
I'm going to submit a complaint.

64
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,920
Sorry. I'll give you more time. Sorry.

65
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,045
Here it is. Yu Beom Jin.

66
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,185
Here.

67
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,625
What? You kept asking for it.

68
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,825
It's hot.

69
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,665
My phone's hot.

70
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,605
I turned it off before turning it in.

71
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,275
How could this be?

72
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:56,145
Well, maybe there's something wrong with the battery.

73
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,370
Maybe. I probably should have it checked.

74
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,555
To see if it's really a battery problem...

75
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,095
or if it's something else.

76
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,175
Gosh!

77
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:19,605
I said not to disconnect!

78
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,945
Good job.

79
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,385
You did a good job.

80
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,425
(Seoul, Friday, 29°C)

81
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:40,455
- Good job, everyone. - Thank you. Bye.

82
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,005
Good job.

83
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,645
Well done.

84
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,060
- Hey. - Hey!

85
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,700
Why did you disconnect it? I said I hit the jackpot!

86
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:09,770
What did you find?

87
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,700
There were pictures of Jung Su Ah on Yu Beom Jin's phone.

88
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,640
They were her profile pictures released by Lee Tae Seok's agency.

89
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,840
What?

90
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,180
It doesn't end there.

91
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,980
I also found a suspicious app on his phone.

92
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,705
Mr. Gi, what are you doing?

93
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,775
Ms. Shin.

94
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,320
Aren't you going to submit the answer sheets?

95
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,390
You'll get in trouble with Ms. Jun if you submit them late.

96
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,760
We're supposed to put them in the safe right away.

97
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,215
Right. I'm on my way to the teacher's office.

98
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,830
- Let's go. - Okay, let's go.

99
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,085
- Please. - All right.

100
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:50,395
(Gunyi General Hospital)

101
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:59,180
Father, I told you about it, right?

102
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:02,920
Woonam University will come into the hands of Cheonmyung Foundation.

103
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:06,815
And it's me, your son's accomplishment.

104
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,700
An education foundation is a business too.

105
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:17,255
It should be run by someone competent.

106
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,610
Instead of a rat who digs around for others' secrets.

107
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,740
What? A rat?

108
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,995
A general manager...

109
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,305
has more work than you think.

110
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,875
Even more than a director.

111
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,045
So please work hard.

112
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:36,905
Brother.

113
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:40,360
Know your place.

114
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,215
Who do you think you are?

115
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,340
Father, please wait just a little longer.

116
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,070
I'll make sure you get to see...

117
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:55,910
Woonam University in Cheonmyung Foundation's organization chart...

118
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,065
during your life.

119
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:21,900
Father, please stay healthy

120
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:25,395
Gosh, why is that idiot so stuck-up?

121
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,465
What?

122
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,405
This is Lee Tae Seok.

123
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,255
Yes. Thank you.

124
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,655
I'll come to you right now.

125
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,685
Okay.

126
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,525
Yes!

127
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,470
A spy app?

128
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:05,040
Why would a high school student have a spy app on his phone?

129
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,535
That's why it's a jackpot.

130
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:09,810
Daily Weather.

131
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,105
At a glance, it looks like an ordinary weather app.

132
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:18,420
But if you install this app on two phones,

133
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,690
you can monitor and access the messages, photos,

134
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:26,830
and internet browsing history on one phone from the other.

135
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:30,955
In other words, this app can do both hacking and monitoring.

136
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,910
Monitoring? But monitor who?

137
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,570
Exactly. That's the part we want to know.

138
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,180
Because you disconnected the phones in the middle of the process,

139
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:41,335
all the data got damaged.

140
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,105
I barely managed to save this one photo.

141
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,345
That's why he kept asking me to return his phone.

142
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:54,260
(Jung Su Ah)

143
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:57,060
Can you try to connect again?

144
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,385
No. That's too dangerous.

145
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,655
Anyway, we know one thing for sure.

146
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,595
That person has Jung Su Ah's profile pictures on his phone.

147
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:12,035
Lee Tae Seok. That makes sense.

148
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:16,105
But why would Yu Beom Jin want to monitor him?

149
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,705
What's their relation?

150
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:23,650
While Gi Hoon's phone surprisingly turned out to have nothing,

151
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,485
this gem just popped out from somewhere completely unexpected.

152
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:29,690
On Byung Ho's phone,

153
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,630
we found his messages with Lee Tae Seok, so that's not bad.

154
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,785
(Yu Beom Jin, Congressman Yu Yang Ki's son)

155
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,940
- Won Suk. - Yes?

156
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:42,210
Which standing committees does Yu Yang Ki belong too?

157
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:43,665
Hold on a second.

158
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
Let me see.

159
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,035
(Yu Yang Ki)

160
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,720
Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

161
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,620
National Defense Committee. Culture, Sports, and Tourism Committee.

162
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,245
And Education Committee.

163
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,075
He is the chairman of Education Committee.

164
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,215
(Yu Yang Ki)

165
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:04,700
Then he could play an important role...

166
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,225
in Lee Tae Seok taking over Woonam University.

167
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,795
What if Yu Yang Ki, not Lee Do Jin,

168
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,595
is Speed Dial Zero?

169
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,895
He might be the one...

170
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,005
who has pictures of Su Ah on his phone.

171
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,880
No way.

172
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,990
We must recover the data from Yu Beom Jin's phone.

173
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,945
That will reveal who Yu Beom Jin...

174
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,785
has been monitoring.

175
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:42,885
(Congressman Yu Yang Ki)

176
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,950
Here it is. Yu Beom Jin.

177
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,705
(Yu Beom Jin)

178
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:02,705
Here.

179
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,190
What? You kept asking for it.

180
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,915
(Yu Beom Jin)

181
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,755
Beom Jin.

182
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,470
Why are you concentrating so hard?

183
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,995
You'll be the top student anyway.

184
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:29,010
By the way, are you okay?

185
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,780
What? What do you mean?

186
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,575
Have you found Ms. Jo's replacement?

187
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,475
Yes, my mom hired a new teacher.

188
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:40,560
Who?

189
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:44,185
Who else? Our new homeroom teacher.

190
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:49,770
Why don't you find another one?

191
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,670
He keeps digging into the past.

192
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,855
He's unreasonably curious.

193
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,465
You must feel uncomfortable yourself...

194
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:01,305
leaving your future in that suspicious person's hands.

195
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,535
I have no choice. It's Mom's decision.

196
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,020
Why did Mom have to choose the temp?

197
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:11,690
I'm sure he was chosen by Butler Lee, not your mom,

198
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,875
because the temp suits his purpose.

199
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,915
His purpose?

200
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,385
What's that?

201
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:36,705
Yu Yang Ki's son had that photo on his phone.

202
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,275
Congressman Yu Yang Ki's son?

203
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:40,480
How did you find that out?

204
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,590
I hacked a few suspicious kids' phones.

205
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,920
There were some opportunities during the exams.

206
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:46,920
Mu Hyeok.

207
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,485
That's not the point.

208
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:56,000
Yu Yang Ki is the chairman of Education Committee.

209
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,925
He might have a relation with Lee Tae Seok.

210
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,140
In addition to Assistant Prosecutor General Yang and Lee Do Jin,

211
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,935
now a congressman?

212
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,375
How is the investigation going?

213
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:14,720
All investigations on Lee Tae Seok are on hold.

214
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,090
The circumstances clearly point to Kim Han Su.

215
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,260
There's absolutely no chance for a reinvestigation.

216
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,545
He was not only arrested at the scene...

217
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:26,215
but also caught on security cameras rushing into her apartment.

218
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,185
Security cameras...

219
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,785
Did you check the whole neighborhood?

220
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:35,565
No other outsiders entered that building around that time.

221
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,910
You should focus on interrogating Assistant Prosecutor General Yang.

222
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,005
I'll try to find the evidence needed for a reinvestigation.

223
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:49,620
(Namgang Office)

224
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,945
We must work together...

225
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,790
to never let our children...

226
00:16:55,798 --> 00:17:00,100
be sacrificed by excessive private education again.

227
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,500
We're going to cooperate with Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education...

228
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:04,770
and investigate every private academy...

229
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,570
in our district...

230
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,440
and carry out random checks at night.

231
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,880
Sir, I have a question.

232
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,810
After his speech, please.

233
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:17,875
It's okay. Please go ahead.

234
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm Reporter Han Da Hee from Education Journal.

235
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:21,750
Considering the Namgang-gu citizen's...

236
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:24,090
great zeal for education,

237
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:27,090
such a move can be seen as pressure on private education,

238
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:30,460
which will highly likely to lead to the drop of your approval ratings.

239
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,830
What do you think about this?

240
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,970
Are you saying sticking to the rules and normal operation of academies...

241
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,700
are pressure on private education?

242
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,070
Of course not.

243
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:43,370
But parents who send their children to the academies...

244
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,640
might have different opinions.

245
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,240
Are you saying the people can't understand...

246
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:51,005
what you and I think is normal?

247
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,790
I believe our people...

248
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,460
are insightful enough...

249
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:01,945
to make wise choices and decisions.

250
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,160
All academies that are caught during the investigation...

251
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,830
will be disqualified as an educational institution...

252
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,225
without exception. I give you my word.

253
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:17,410
I would like to ask you all a favor.

254
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:20,880
The education office and we are working together.

255
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:24,875
Please think of this matter as your own children's.

256
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:28,445
Your cooperation will be very much appreciated.

257
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,610
So this is the only entrance to the townhouse, right?

258
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,995
Yes, there's no other entrance.

259
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,910
Are those all the cameras that film the back of the building?

260
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,395
Yes, those are all.

261
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,135
(Pause, lap)

262
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,675
1 minute and 20 seconds.

263
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,915
It's so close.

264
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,570
What's the matter? What about this place?

265
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:03,240
I found another way to Su Ah's place.

266
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,835
Another way?

267
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:08,510
If you cut across here, it takes less than two minutes...

268
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,280
to Su Ah's place.

269
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,605
The police must have missed it.

270
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:16,290
We need to check the CCTVs around here again.

271
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,790
CCTVs?

272
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:20,090
But it was three months ago. The records must be gone.

273
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,685
What else can we do? Let's give it a try.

274
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:24,900
There must be private surveillance cameras...

275
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,700
in the stores and buildings nearby.

276
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,700
Are you saying you want me to hack all those cameras?

277
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,170
If that helps us catch the criminal, it will be worth it.

278
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:35,970
Check the CCTVs near the road.

279
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,235
I'll check if there are more cameras.

280
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,405
Seriously, this is nothing but a waste of time.

281
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:49,745
Gosh, you'd better pay me well for this.

282
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,695
(Won Suk)

283
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,235
Okay.

284
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,655
(Won Suk)

285
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,870
Why are there so many cameras?

286
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:13,425
Darn it.

287
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,270
Gi Mu Hyeok, that brat.

288
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:18,435
Where is this? Goodness.

289
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,650
- Hello, sir. - Good morning.

290
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,680
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

291
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:27,280
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

292
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,820
Nice. Morning.

293
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,890
- Hello, sir. - Hi. Good.

294
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,790
Could you smile a bit?

295
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:36,690
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

296
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,700
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

297
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Are you two dating again? Focus on your study.

298
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:43,970
- Hello, sir. - Hi. Keep it up.

299
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:47,640
Let's work hard. Move.

300
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,395
Let's kick Butler Lee out.

301
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,550
He doesn't suit our school.

302
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,280
He's been always bothering me.

303
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:59,150
And he even created a scene at Tae Ra's recital.

304
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:01,645
Kicking him out won't be enough.

305
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,445
We must destroy him.

306
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:15,425
Why do I still see them?

307
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,340
I told you to delete all of them.

308
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,400
Once I make my debut,

309
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,140
I will make you the president of my fan club or whatever you want.

310
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,880
Ye Ri, you'd better ask a digital undertaker...

311
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,680
rather than me.

312
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,880
I want to have a normal life again.

313
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,180
I can't let them handle that.

314
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:34,875
I'm almost a celebrity.

315
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:36,605
"Celebrity"?

316
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,790
I couldn't do my job because I had to help you.

317
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:42,660
And now I'm about to be fired.

318
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,515
Could you please set me free now?

319
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:50,755
Or how about you snitch on him?

320
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:53,425
Snitch?

321
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,040
How?

322
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:56,870
What do you mean by, "how"?

323
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:59,380
You said there's something fishy about that man.

324
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,310
Can't you just snitch on him to a reporter or something...

325
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:03,605
and kick him out?

326
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:40,775
Can we talk?

327
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,405
Sure.

328
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:04,965
Ms. Ha.

329
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,535
Where are we going now?

330
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:13,635
Somewhere you must go at least once.

331
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,975
And we have to take a taxi to get there?

332
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,325
(Prosecution Service)

333
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:38,980
Hey, what's up? You never call me out.

334
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:40,810
How about a cup of coffee?

335
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,705
Coffee is nice here.

336
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,290
Are you out of your mind?

337
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,945
Seriously.

338
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:51,460
Why are you so shocked?

339
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,560
I'm telling a prosecutor about corruption.

340
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,085
Hey, you...

341
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:00,200
You want to rat out Mr. Yang, your direct superior?

342
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,070
Even if he's my superior, he must be punished if he commits a crime.

343
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,800
You'll get fired first.

344
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:06,455
And Mr. Yang is...

345
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:10,210
He got there with no skills because of his connections.

346
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,740
He has connections at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office too.

347
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:15,610
Look. I'll worry about that.

348
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:19,075
You just do your job as the prosecutor of Insection Department.

349
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:22,745
Are you serious? I'm losing my mind here.

350
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,760
It's not my fault if something happens to you.

351
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:29,690
No one will take in a prosecutor who rats out a superior.

352
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,185
You know that, right?

353
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,800
Thanks.

354
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,755
It's nice to have a friend who worries about me.

355
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,155
Thanks for this. See you.

356
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:44,265
Hey...

357
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:49,505
Get out, you jerks!

358
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,820
Stop that.

359
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,805
Where is it?

360
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,850
I don't have it! I mean it!

361
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,920
Where is the money?

362
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,990
Here it is!

363
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:01,645
Stay still.

364
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:10,655
You're really making me mad.

365
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,470
- You have money, but you... - Don't hit him.

366
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:18,465
What? Why don't you wave a knife at us like last time?

367
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,735
You audacious little twerp.

368
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,480
Do you want to die?

369
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,035
Stay still.

370
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:34,545
What's this?

371
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,285
Beom Jin.

372
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:39,715
Is he your friend?

373
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:44,985
That's right. He's my friend.

374
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,595
He is?

375
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,610
That's good.

376
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,295
Friends are supposed to help each other in times of need.

377
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:56,450
You're decked out in designer clothes.

378
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,050
If we strip you now, that will be enough...

379
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:01,105
to pay your friend's interest.

380
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:04,945
Will you give me your business card?

381
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,590
Really?

382
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,990
Really? You want to pay?

What...

389
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:36,105
What are you doing?

390
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:39,590
I requested help with the police.

391
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:42,390
I said I'm being held hostage in your office and asked for help.

392
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:44,145
What? Hostage?

393
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,585
You brat.

394
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:52,895
That must be a confirmation call.

395
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:54,455
What should I do?

396
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,395
They'll think I'm really being held hostage if I don't answer.

397
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,195
You crazy little punk.

398
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,735
That should be the cops.

399
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,245
They're probably calling the number on the card.

400
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,705
Answer it.

401
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:14,115
I'll scream for help.

402
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,315
Darn it.

403
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,055
Shouldn't you go?

404
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,855
They're sending officers now.

405
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,200
Do you want to die?

406
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:29,665
Forget it. Let's go to the office.

407
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,995
Of all the bad luck.

408
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:37,850
Darn it.

409
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:41,875
Pay back the rest, got it?

410
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,275

411
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,255
Thanks for your help.

412
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,495
You want to come back...

413
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,865
to our school, right?

414
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:05,895
I will...

415
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:08,135
let you.

416
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,175
What's your relationship with Su Ah?

417
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:14,680
Tell me.

418
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,405
Were you really digging into her life?

419
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:22,990
Does that have anything to do with us?

420
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:25,755
Don't you just need to be taken care of?

421
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:33,755
I entered all the entries that were missing in your student records.

422
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:37,710
I removed the recital because they may ask during the interview.

423
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:41,065
Everything will go smoothly from now on.

Just take good care of my student record.

I don't want things to get awkward with the other kids because of you.

Don't worry. I look forward to working with you.

You said you wanted to know...

434
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,565
how Han Su was doing.

435
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,150
Ma'am.

436
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,375
Let's go in. Han Su's here.

437
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:23,265
Mr. Gi told me...

438
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,535
that you visited Han Su at the detention center.

439
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,045
How...

440
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,375
Mr. Gi...

441
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:35,985
is Han Su's attorney.

442
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,855
He came to our school to prove his innocence.

443
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:46,555
Is it true you visited Han Su?

444

Byung Ho.

445
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:56,010
Can you tell me...

446
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,680
what the two of you talked about that day?

447
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,475
I don't know anything.

448
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,375
It isn't your fault.

449
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,015
Whatever you talked about with Han Su,

450
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:12,355
it wasn't your fault that he attempted suicide.

451
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:16,700
So don't lower your head like that.

452
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,455
It's someone else who committed the crimes and should be punished.

453

for you, Byung Ho.

455
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,505
Ever since Han Su became like this,

456
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:38,475
it's been hard and torturous for you, too.

457
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:41,315
I wish you would...

458
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,455

She can recover, right?

They said it's your fault.

479
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:11,725
You're responsible for what happened to Su Ah.

480
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:12,940
What?

481
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:14,910
If you hadn't meddled in,

482
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,180
Su Ah wouldn't have gotten hurt.

483
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:20,975
They said it all depends on you...

484
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,450
whether Su Ah will die or recover.

485
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:27,345
What are you talking about? How does that depend on me?

Find it out yourself.

They said the book will let you know how to save Su Ah.

491
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,340
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,125
(Patient: Kim Han Su, Nurse in charge: Han Min Jung)

505
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,145
Are you okay?

506
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:07,275
Yes.

507
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,215
I visited...

508
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,115
Han Su in the prison.

509
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,285
I'll tell you everything...

510
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:22,095
what we talked about.

511
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:29,665
You surprised me, my son.

512
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:32,380
You wanted to have dinner with me.

513
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:35,120
You're too busy. I don't get to see you much.

514
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,520
Now that my exam is over,

515
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,145
I thought we should have dinner together.

516
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,845
All right.

517
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,445
Let's try to spend more time together from now on.

518
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,725
How was your exam?

519
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:51,700
Wasn't it hard?

520
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:54,070
It was fine. I think I did well.

521
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,625
I see.

522
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:58,940
I'm sure you knew the answer to every question.

523
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,510
If you got anything wrong, it must have been a mistake.

524
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:02,780
I do hope...

525
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:04,950
you'll come out on top.

526
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:06,405
Thanks.

527
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:16,960
I'm thinking of getting out and taking some photos soon.

528
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:18,490
To get some fresh air.

529
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,500
Photos?

530
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,400
Yes. I won a national contest last year...

531
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,230
with some photos I took outdoors.

532
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:28,140
Do you remember? The prizes were handed out at this hotel.

533
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,540
Of course. I remember that.

534
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:33,595
It's a shame you couldn't make it.

535
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,165
I really wanted you to be there when I received the prize.

536
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:39,320
I know.

537
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,950
Too bad I had an important appointment that day.

538
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:46,545
I would have loved to see my son receive that prize indeed.

539
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,900
How do you feel today?

540
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:01,395
What is it all of a sudden?

541
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:04,265
Why is Butler Lee...

542
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:25,515
By the way, why did Butler Lee do that to you?

543
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,555
How dare he speak to you that way?

544
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,655
You're not letting him get away with it, are you?

545
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:36,295
Consider it...

546
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,210
as a crazy dog's barking.

547
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:40,580
Don't worry about it.

548
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,610
How would I not?

549
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:46,750
My father, who I respect so much, got humiliated in front of everyone.

550
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,605
If you don't punish him, I will...

551
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,715
It's none of your business.

552
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,215
Focus on your studies.

553
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:06,525
Let grown-ups deal with it.

554
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,035
You were there.

555
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:16,810
What?

556
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:19,405
You were at the hotel that night.

557
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:22,405
Lee Tae Seok and Su Ah too.

558
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:26,660
Why are you lying to me?

559
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:30,145
What did you do at the hotel that night?

560
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:34,030
"It's none of your business. Let grown-ups deal with it."

561
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:37,085
Did you think that would make me let it go?

562
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,070
This is driving me crazy!

563
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:42,340
Who killed Su Ah?

564
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:45,465
What was her relationship with Lee Tae Seok?

565
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,965
And you.

566
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,435
What was going on...

567
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,945
between you and Su Ah?

568
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:57,575
You...

569
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,600
- Stop it! - Seriously.

570
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:46,425
Stop it right now!

571
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,795
Are you crazy?

572
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:54,495
You said you had something to tell me.

573
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:57,210
Never do this again.

574
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,635
I won't put up with it.

575
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,875
Will you tell Butler Lee or something?

576
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,900
What makes you so stuck-up?

577
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,895
You met old men at a hotel.

578
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:23,825
Darn it.

579
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,480
If you need money, go out with me instead of old men.

580
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:31,165
I can give you as much as you want.

581
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,375
You creep me out.

582
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:39,445
What?

583
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:43,615
Why does it matter to you?

584
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:47,715
Taking these photos secretly... You're disgusting.

585
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:49,600
Don't you understand?

586
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,600
Once I leak these photos...

587
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,125
Then everyone will find out that you took them secretly!

588
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,640
Will that be okay with you?

589
00:44:57,645 --> 00:45:00,495
Even if your father, the law firm president, finds out?

590
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,150
Are you serious?

591
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:11,050
What are you doing? Get off me!

592
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,790
Yes, you're right.

593
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,690
Neither of us wants this to get out.

594
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:17,215
Then why don't we make another secret while we're at it?

595
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,410
You jerk!

596
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:35,995
Darn it.

597
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,780
You crazy...

598
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:41,835
You little...

599
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,385
Stop it.

600
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,385
Stop it. I'm fine.

601
00:45:58,405 --> 00:45:59,955
Are you sure?

602
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,210
Birds of a feather flock together indeed.

603
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,505
You guys are amazing.

604
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:18,690
First, Butler Lee, and now a punk?

605
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,090
You brat.

606
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:23,545
Do you know she sees old guys in hotels?

607
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:25,715
What?

608
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,015
You didn't know.

609
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,385
Poor you.

610
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:33,855
The general manager of our school is her sponsor.

611
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,410
Do you want to die? Stop saying rubbish.

612
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,765
- You... - Seriously!

613
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,040
Here's the evidence.

614
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,965
The evidence that shows she sees Butler Lee.

615
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:53,715
It's not true, is it?

616
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:56,160
This is not you.

617
00:46:56,163 --> 00:46:57,260
It's a lie, right?

618
00:46:57,264 --> 00:46:58,630
He's just blackmailing...

619
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:00,885
I can't watch this. This is too sad.

620
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,925
She's so good at seducing men.

621
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:08,125
- How dare you! - Get off me!

622
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,710
Isn't this the only thing you're better at doing than me?

623
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:11,810
Getting physical.

624
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:13,140
I'm sorry,

625
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:15,140
but once my father finds out who did this to my face,

626
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:18,835
you'll be kicked out of school and rot in a reform school.

627
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:21,905
You're right.

628
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:24,045
If I'm going to be kicked out anyway,

629
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,375
I can do whatever I want.

630
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:40,455
Stop it.

631
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,395
He doesn't deserve it.

632
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:57,875
If something happens to Han Su because of this,

633
00:47:57,892 --> 00:47:59,745
I will sue you.

634
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:02,145
For illegal filming and attempted rape.

635
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:07,215
Let's go.

636
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:10,325
I don't want to be here any more.

637
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,915
Why did it have to turn out this way?

638
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,640
"The Little Mermaid"?

639
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,710
Yes. Byung Ho said the book would let him know...

640
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,765
how to save Su Ah.

641
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:55,040
How does it end?

642
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:57,850
Doesn't she live with the prince happily ever after?

643
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,880
That's how the animation ends.

644
00:49:00,888 --> 00:49:03,975
The original story has a totally different ending.

645
00:49:10,597 --> 00:49:13,485
Whatever you talked about with Han Su,

646
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:18,525
it wasn't your fault that he attempted suicide.

647
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:37,505
Why are you giving me such expensive shoes?

648
00:49:42,129 --> 00:49:44,115
It's like a scholarship.

649
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:48,800
It's a special present from the general manager...

650
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:52,585
to the student who works and studies hard.

651
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:54,940
Thank you, sir.

652
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,065
There's no need to.

653
00:49:57,378 --> 00:50:00,240
Would you like to go grab something to eat?

654
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,135
We can talk a bit too.

655
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:18,530
Take it easy.

656
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:21,700
If you finish all the food here, I'll order some more.

657
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:24,570
I've never been to a place like this before.

658
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:27,400
If there's anything that troubles you, tell me everything.

659
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:29,200
No matter what it is.

660
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:32,225
Okay, sir. Thank you very much.

661
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:33,835
You do?

662
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:39,150
If you're so thankful, would you like to run an errand?

663
00:50:39,153 --> 00:50:41,535
It's just a simple errand.

664
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,850
An errand, sir?

665
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:48,075
You're close friends with Kim Han Su, right?

666
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,290
Yes.

667
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,915
I need to say something to him...

668
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:56,685
and I want you to pass it on to him on my behalf.

669
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:00,655
With this picture.

670
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,495
That's Su Ah. Why do you want me to...

671
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,440
You don't need to know why.

672
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:09,710
If you do me this one favor,

673
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:13,405
you will never have any problem in school.

674
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,370
You're supposed to drink after clinking glasses.

675
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,885
Yes, sir.

676
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:43,465
We wasted time.

677
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:45,965
What do you mean?

678
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,380
It didn't have to be something like, "Jump out of the rooftop"...

679
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:50,890
or "Hang yourself on the window sill",

680
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:54,120
but we need a direct message that told him to commit suicide.

681
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:56,715
But "The Little Mermaid" is...

682
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:02,415
I don't think it's enough to prove Lee Tae Seok's crime.

683
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:07,295
Still, Byung Ho plucked up his courage to say that.

684
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:09,695
Don't say it was a waste of time.

685
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,140
This isn't the best situation, but what can we do?

686
00:52:13,147 --> 00:52:16,410
He's been dragging on and now he finally opened his mouth.

687
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,865
But none of what he said is helping.

688
00:52:20,988 --> 00:52:25,375
Thank you for making that stubborn boy talk.

689
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,175
Why are you...

690
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,385
always like that?

691
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,555
Only the results are important to you.

692
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:40,995
Don't you want to know why the kids had to make such decisions?

693
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,070
It's not like my curiosity can prove Han Su's innocence.

694
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,040
It might not prove his innocence,

695
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:50,805
but it will help you understand him better.

696
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:53,280
Have you ever genuinely wondered...

697
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,905
why Han Su tried to kill himself...

698
00:52:56,657 --> 00:52:59,875
and why Su Ah had to die?

699
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,215
Isn't it obvious?

700
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,185
Han Su was blackmailed to kill himself because of Su Ah.

701
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:09,770
Su Ah was used to entertain people...

702
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,370
and then got killed.

703
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:13,300
So anyone who gets blackmailed should kill themselves...

704
00:53:13,307 --> 00:53:16,055
and anyone who was used to entertain people should get killed?

705
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,370
Han Su and Su Ah must have had their own situations.

706
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:21,335
And Byung Ho too.

707
00:53:28,422 --> 00:53:31,150
To people like you and Prosecutor Cha,

708
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:33,745
results are probably all that matters.

709
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,120
But what matters more to me is to know...

710
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,345
why my students had to make such decisions.

711
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,460
I need to know that...

712
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,055
so I can keep them from making any more bad decisions.

713
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,255
That's what the teachers do.

714
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,270
When things are settled,

715
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:55,035
you'll go back to being an attorney,

716
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:59,735
but Byung Ho and the kids will have to stay in the mess, the school.

717
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,435
So please...

718
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:06,615
don't judge and hurt them so easily.

719
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:10,815
As long as you're teaching in school,

720
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:13,615
you're a teacher...

721
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:16,555
to the children.

722
00:54:41,228 --> 00:54:42,715
"The Little Mermaid"?

723
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:45,685
Why...

724
00:54:55,108 --> 00:54:58,465
(Misook Bookstore)

725
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:10,275
(The Little Mermaid)

726
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:16,115
"Haste, then."

727
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:18,645
"He or you must die..."

728
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,255
"before sunrise."

729
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,000
"The little mermaid, who sacrificed herself..."

730
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:30,470
"for the happiness of the prince whom she loved,"

731
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:33,635
turned into sea foam and disappeared.

732
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:37,835
No. It can't be.

733
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:49,315
I need to tell them.

734
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,715
I must tell them the truth.

735
00:55:57,537 --> 00:55:59,055
Byung Ho.

736
00:56:00,307 --> 00:56:01,925
Beom Jin.

737
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,610
I was worried.

738
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,995
You didn't look well all day today.

739
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:10,505
What's wrong? Is someone bullying you again?

740
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:23,375
Nothing.

741
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:26,585
Nothing.

742
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:30,030
I checked every surveillance video...

743
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:33,655
of every street and alley, but there's nothing left.

744
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:37,610
I don't think this is right.

745
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:41,040
We need at least straws to grasp at if we want to look for something.

746
00:56:41,047 --> 00:56:45,035
We're just wasting our time. There's nothing there.

747
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,275
"Special Law on Deregulation"?

748
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,920
What's that?

749
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:55,620
Did you find something?

750
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,285
Look here.

751
00:56:57,397 --> 00:56:59,590
"A Special Law on Deregulation for the structural reform..."

752
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,400
"and empowerment of failing universities."

753
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:04,730
Yu Yang Ki proposed this law.

754
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:07,700
Private foundations running middle or high schools...

755
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:11,670
can acquire failing colleges determined to require empowerment.

756
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,740
A high school can acquire a college?

757
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:18,035
That's right. The law simplifies the process and makes it easier.

758
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:22,780
But seeing as this was proposed to the National Assembly...

759
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:26,290
almost a year ago, but hasn't been passed yet,

760
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:28,345
something must have fallen through.

761
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:33,860
Anyway, why does a current assemblyman...

762
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,630
and someone who was rumored to be a presidential candidate...

763
00:57:36,636 --> 00:57:39,025
work with a dirtbag like Lee Tae Seok?

764
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,800
Maybe you're taking it too far.

765
00:57:41,808 --> 00:57:45,525
There's no evidence other than that he proposed a bill.

766
00:57:57,457 --> 00:57:58,490
The planner.

767
00:57:58,492 --> 00:57:59,550
Planner?

768
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,920
There's a safe in Lee Tae Seok's office.

769
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:05,330
There were a planner and a cell phone.

770
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:06,985
A safe...

771
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:11,230
Then the planner in there...

772
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,070
Probably has a list of people who received sexual favors,

773
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,155
and the cell phone has their numbers.

774
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:18,910
If we get those two items, we may have something...

775
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:23,035
more concrete than everything we have gathered so far.

776
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,880
Then... Don't tell me you...

777
00:58:27,888 --> 00:58:29,635
Get ready. Let's go.

778
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:32,150
Darn it.

779
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:33,815
Get ready!

780
00:58:41,368 --> 00:58:45,355
Yes. That's exactly it.

781
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,340
They have to give in.

782
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,410
How nice would it have been if they had done this sooner?

783
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,095
They wasted my precious time.

784
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,345
What...

785
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,475
What was that?

786
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:09,475
Who's there?

787
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:18,230
Know your place.

788
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:21,095
Who do you think you are?

789
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,740
First, you bug me and follow me,

790
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:29,395
and now, you come to me yourself?

791
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:37,250
Come at me! Come in, you jerk!

792
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:40,205
Let's put an end to this today!

793
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,995
Gi Hoon?

794
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,980
What are you doing here?

795
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,695
Why did you do it?

796
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:09,880
You must be doing this because of what happened that night.

797
01:00:09,889 --> 01:00:13,290
Darn it. It's okay!

798
01:00:13,293 --> 01:00:15,420
I made up with your father,

799
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:16,660
so put that down.

800
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:18,985
Why did you do that to Su Ah?

801
01:00:19,499 --> 01:00:20,500
What?

802
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,970
If you didn't make her do that, nothing would've happened.

803
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,170
If you had just left her alone,

804
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:28,755
no one would've gotten hurt.

805
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:38,250
Why are you suddenly playing the blame game?

806
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:41,080
You tried to make her yours and failed,

807
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:45,375
so you became her stalker taking pictures secretly.

808
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,585
What? Did you think I didn't know?

809
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,030
You punk.

810
01:00:57,037 --> 01:00:59,170
That awesome dad of yours...

811
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:02,800
came here and begged like mad...

812
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:06,825
to make sure his precious son's record isn't tarnished.

813
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,440
You punk.

814
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:11,710
It isn't me.

815
01:01:11,718 --> 01:01:15,180
You're the one holding your dad back!

816
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:18,590
Got that? You punk.

817
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,890
Now that you know,

818
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:23,120
shut your mouth and go to school diligently.

819
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:25,190
Darn it. Mr. Lee...

820
01:01:25,198 --> 01:01:29,415
couldn't keep his son under control and created this mess.

821
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:31,685
Why you!

822
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,880
Darn it.

823
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:42,940
You jerk.

824
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:48,835
Die.

825
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:52,590
You brat. You have no respect for your elders.

826
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:54,620
What? Butler Lee?

827
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,890
Did you think I didn't know, you punk?

828
01:01:56,896 --> 01:02:01,085
Die.

829
01:02:04,571 --> 01:02:06,485
Get over here, punk.

830
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:11,310
If it weren't for your father...

831
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,710
You're a lucky punk.

832
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:16,135
You lucked out with good parents, you rude punk.

833
01:02:18,218 --> 01:02:21,180
Hey. Scram. Got it?

834
01:02:21,187 --> 01:02:25,390
If you barge in here again, I'll really kill you. Got that?

835
01:02:25,391 --> 01:02:27,645
You punk.

836
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:32,185
You punk.

837
01:02:48,148 --> 01:02:49,895
I don't want to go to work.

838
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,810
I wish...

839
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:53,920
when I wake up tomorrow, the school would've exploded.

840
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,180
I agree with you.

841
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,590
It was sweet because it was exam time.

842
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:01,460
The students will flood into the office starting tomorrow...

843
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:02,860
to complain.

844
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,845
"Why is this answer wrong? Maybe there are two right answers."

845
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,925
They get their test papers checked by college professors.

846
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,430
Then why do they ask us to submit the questions?

847
01:03:13,439 --> 01:03:16,355
They should just get them from a professor.

848
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,910
Okay, let's drink.

849
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:20,425
Let's drink.

850
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:28,980
What is wrong with you?

851
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:30,950
We finally get to hang out now that exams are over,

852
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:33,375
but you're silent like you're in mourning.

853
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,815
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

854
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:39,845
This is unlike you.

855
01:03:41,601 --> 01:03:45,530
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say,

856
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:48,955
and answer me honestly.

857
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:53,410
Why are you getting so serious? You're scaring me.

858
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,440
Something really must be wrong.

859
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:59,205
What is it?

860
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,180
While you were working at the school,

861
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:03,950
were you instructed...

862
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:06,590
to manipulate a student record or to give awards...

863
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,615
or other recognition to certain students?

864
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:18,055
Please be honest with me. This is important.

865
01:04:19,873 --> 01:04:21,455
Well...

866
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:28,165
I don't know about manipulating them, but isn't giving awards...

867
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:30,705
to designated students a common practice?

868
01:04:30,717 --> 01:04:34,980
I'm a music teacher, so I need to look after the music students.

869
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:37,550
We have a few at our school...

870
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:39,875
Kids like Tae Ra.

871
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,490
Those awards were crucial for the kids to get into good colleges.

872
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:46,545
We had no choice.

873
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,355
Only school awards can be put in the student record.

874
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:53,755
But why are you asking that all of a sudden?

875
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:57,770
The prosecutors will investigate our school soon.

876
01:04:57,777 --> 01:05:01,340
Investigate? The prosecutors?

877
01:05:01,347 --> 01:05:05,010
All we did was make up a few awards. Is that really necessary?

878
01:05:05,018 --> 01:05:06,650
General Manager Lee...

879
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,320
tampered with Tae Ra's student record...

880
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,290
to fund the takeover of the university.

881
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,875
He also handed out awards exclusively to the Veritas kids.

882
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:15,520
When the investigation starts,

883
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:19,845
his other wrongdoings will be discovered as well.

884
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:24,455
My goodness. The whole school will be in chaos.

885
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:27,225
And the parents will go crazy.

886
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:29,900
Probably.

887
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:33,595
But this might be our chance.

888
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,465
Chance?

889
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:39,250
Our chance to solve the problems...

890
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:41,535
that we have been ignoring...

891
01:05:41,788 --> 01:05:45,745
and give the school back to our students.

892
01:06:20,259 --> 01:06:22,160
- Gosh. - Mu Hyeok.

893
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:24,015
Are you sure no one is here?

894
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:26,930
All the lights are off.

895
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:28,360
Today was the last exam day,

896
01:06:28,368 --> 01:06:30,015
so everyone has left. Come.

897
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:55,445
What are you doing? Come on.

898
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:30,545
Gosh.

899
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:32,990
What? What's wrong?

900
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:34,555
Hold on.

901
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:36,055
What is it?

902
01:07:41,908 --> 01:07:43,395
What?

903
01:07:59,459 --> 01:08:01,045
Lee Tae Seok?

904
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,355
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

905
01:08:29,288 --> 01:08:32,150
Someone murdered Lee Tae Seok and disguised it as suicide.

906
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,290
That's neat.

907
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:36,520
At this rate, the investigation will be wrapped up in no time.

908
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,590
We have concluded that Mr. Lee committed suicide.

909
01:08:38,598 --> 01:08:41,255
The investigation will be terminated here.

910
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:44,330
You're working on another Cheonmyung High School case.

911
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:46,230
Someone died this time too.

912
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:48,340
I hope this won't affect us.

913
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:50,725
How dare you talk that way about my dad?

914
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,240
Why did you hide it? Does that lawyer have something on you?

915
01:08:54,247 --> 01:08:56,140
I trust Beom Jin more than I trust anyone else.

916
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:58,410
That proves how oblivious you are.

917
01:08:58,417 --> 01:08:59,910
Could Beom Jin...

918
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:02,580
Who did he do that to?

919
01:09:02,588 --> 01:09:06,550
Everyone who was bullying me has disappeared from the school now.

920
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,815
He must have wanted to keep his mouth shut by all means.

921
01:09:09,929 --> 01:09:12,945
You don't have to say anything. Anything at all.
