(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,925
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,525
(Episode 13)

4
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,505
Hello.

5
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,950
Where's Han Su?

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,315
He went down to the treatment room.

7
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,415
Thank you.

8
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,435
What is it?

9
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,305
What did you want to tell me about Su Ah?

10
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:21,730
What happened to her? Did she wake up?

11
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:25,685
You stabbed her to kill her. Why do you care?

12
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:30,525
You confessed in court that you stabbed her.

13
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:35,565
Answer me. Did Su Ah wake up?

14
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,465
Figures.

15
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,480
What's wrong with me?

16
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:46,305
I tried to find out something I didn't need to know.

17
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,645
Whether you stabbed her or not,

18
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,945
the conclusion is the same.

19
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,385
Did she wake up or not?

20
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:24,645
Han Su!

21
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,185
Han Su, is that you?

22
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,195
Who are you?

23
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,540
Why are you here with Han Su?

24
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:47,335
I'm a detective. I was in charge of his case.

25
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:52,075
But who are you?

26
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,250
I'm his classmate.

27
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,945
You are?

28
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,690
Then can you excuse us for a minute?

29
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,985
We still need to talk.

30
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,585
Must it be right now?

31
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:09,355
The nurse said he still needs his rest.

32
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,865
It's very important for the case.

33
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:20,535
Can you wait downstairs? We'll be done soon.

34
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,385
Did you think it would be over if you killed him like Lee Tae Seok?

35
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:53,165
Don't do anything stupid and leave.

36
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,535
I'll take care of things here.

37
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,445
Please just leave for today.

38
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:08,915
Please, officer.

39
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:18,140
I'll take Han Su to his room.

40
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,725
Is that all right?

41
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,665
Yes. I want to rest.

42
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,415
Sure.

43
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,115
Okay.

44
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,905
Are you okay?

45
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,575
How did you know...

46
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,250
I was here?

47
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,445
I've been waiting for you to wake up.

48
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,060
I needed to tell you something.

49
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,815
And what's that?

50
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,295
Is it about Su Ah?

51
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,865
Did you know?

52
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,135
What happened...

53
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,535
to Su Ah?

54
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,375
It wasn't long after...

55
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,675
that happened to you.

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,815
I'm sorry. I really didn't want...

57
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,685
to tell you this.

58
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,325
No.

59
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,395
No.

60
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:03,535
Su Ah...

61
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,705
couldn't have died.

62
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,750
It's a lie, right? You're lying to me.

63
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,790
Right? She didn't die.

64
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,985
She's alive!

65
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,385
Han Su.

66
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,440
I... I couldn't protect her.

67
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,495
That's why she...

68
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,305
(Hospital room)

69
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,485
Where are you?

70
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:59,685
The roof.

71
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,445
Han Su!

72
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,455
Beom Jin.

73
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,365
You're late,

74
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,265
Mr. Lawyer.

75
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,740
What did you do to Han Su?

76
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,435
I simply told him the truth.

77
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,420
Tell me the truth.

78
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,050
What did you do to him?

79
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,775
Get lost!

80
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,490
Leave now.

81
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:03,385
I don't need a lawyer like you anymore,

82
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,655
so leave.

83
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,070
Han Su.

84
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,725
Beom Jin.

85
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,400
Take me to my room.

86
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,925
Okay.

87
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,275
Stay out...

88
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,475
of my life.

89
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,915
Or I'll kill you.

90
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,285
Stop right there!

91
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,395
Tell me, Han Su.

92
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,370
What did you want to tell me that day?

93
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,665
From whom did Su Ah want to escape so badly?

94
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:08,015
Let's go.

95
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,685
Tell me.

96
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,955
Han Su!

97
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,025
Han Su!

98
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,980
Remember what I said earlier.

99
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,645
We shouldn't let people kill Su Ah twice.

100
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,345
You are the only person who can protect Su Ah.

101
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,385
Okay.

102
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,665
I didn't ask you to do that, did I?

103
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,895
I'm sorry, sir.

104
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,135
By the way...

105
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,035
Did you think it would be over if you killed him like Lee Tae Seok?

106
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,675
Don't do anything stupid and leave.

107
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,945
I'll take care of things here.

108
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,315
Is there anything else you want to say?

109
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:19,985
No, sir.

110
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,270
I promise it won't happen again.

111
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,425
Don't contact me for the time being and just wait.

112
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,530
I'm afraid you can't see him now.

113
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,885
He just woke up, and he's done too much already.

114
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,830
If what happened today happens again,

115
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,755
it can be seriously dangerous. So please be careful.

116
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:58,825
Okay.

117
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,565
- Mu Hyeok. - Mr. Gi.

118
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,275
Wait.

119
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,375
What happened?

120
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,275
Yu Beom Jin...

121
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,015
came to the hospital to see Han Su.

122
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,490
What?

123
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,185
Yu Beom Jin?

124
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,685
Won Suk.

125
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,855
Can we check the video footages?

126
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:36,295
Actually, I set up some cameras in Han Su's ward...

127
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:40,935
and the hospital corridors just in case.

128
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,605
Lieutenant Oh?

129
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,815
He's taking Han Su somewhere.

130
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,415
It's the rooftop.

131
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,515
Rooftop?

132
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,585
Why rooftop, of all places?

133
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,525
Yu Beom Jin.

134
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,595
Lieutenant Oh...

135
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,965
came down alone.

136
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,945
Yu Beom Jin must have stopped Lieutenant Oh...

137
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,145
and said something to Han Su.

138
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,355
Something important...

139
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,285
that can keep Han Su's mouth shut.

140
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a lie, right? You're lying to me.

141
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:08,570
Right? She didn't die.

142
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,825
She's alive!

143
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,325
Han Su.

144
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,405
I... I couldn't protect her.

145
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,005
That's why she...

146
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,545
Others might not know it, but I know...

147
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,285
that you didn't kill Su Ah.

148
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,155
Byung Ho told me everything.

149
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,455
That he came to see you...

150
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:43,525
because Lee Tae Seok told him to.

151
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,780
Lee Tae Seok, that punk...

152
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,705
Where is he now?

153
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,705
Where is he?

154
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,805
Calm down.

155
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:02,675
He got punished too.

156
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:06,045
"Punished"?

157
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,785
He was found...

158
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,785
hanged in the school.

159
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:13,755
Lee Tae Seok...

160
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,225
killed himself?

161
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,225
His will was found too.

162
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,625
He has paid for what he did.

163
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,735
He has paid for killing Su Ah...

164
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,935
and framing you as a murderer.

165
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:31,150
The media has finally quieted down, but since Lee Tae Seok's death,

166
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,505
it started talking about Su Ah again.

167
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,675
Saying he was Su Ah's sponsor.

168
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,690
Do you remember...

169
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,215
the attorney that revealed your pictures at court...

170
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:46,755
and insisted there had been men that frequented her place?

171
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,255
Gi Mu Hyeok,

172
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:51,600
the attorney.

173
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,595
You risked your life to keep Su Ah's secret,

174
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,840
but he revealed everything.

175
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,565
At this rate,

176
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,135
people will...

177
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,905
defame her, saying she's immoral.

178
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,475
No way.

179
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:13,045
I will never let that happen.

180
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:14,985
Never.

181
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,625
But...

182
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:28,965
why are you...

183
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,435
doing this for me?

184
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,005
Because I liked her too.

185
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,915
I have always liked her ever since she transferred to our school.

186
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,185
That's why...

187
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,125
I wanted to protect her, just like you did.

188
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,395
We must protect her.

189
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,640
Once her relationship with Lee Tae Seok is revealed,

190
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:05,580
Su Ah will remain as an immoral working girl...

191
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,135
in people's memories.

192
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,990
Then what should I do?

193
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,890
Take back what you confessed at court...

194
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,020
and say you saw Lee Tae Seok escape from the window of Su Ah's place.

195
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,030
Say that I saw Lee Tae Seok?

196
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,130
Then it will be all over.

197
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,885
Lee Tae Seok is dead...

198
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,225
and people are only interested in his sin right now.

199
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:32,125
It will clear you of the false charge too.

200
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,570
I know how you feel.

201
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,935
In order to protect Su Ah from people attacking her,

202
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,405
you went to prison and even risked your life.

203
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,645
This is the only way to protect Su Ah.

204
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,245
And you are the only person who can do it.

205
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,915
You're late.

206
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,885
I was meeting a friend.

207
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,055
A friend...

208
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,755
that had been away for long came back.

209
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,065
What did you do with your friend?

210
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,695
We just...

211
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,665
talked.

212
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:50,435
We talked about his ex-girlfriend.

213
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,315
Don't do anything stupid.

214
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,995
"Stupid"?

215
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,555
Do you like this painting?

216
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,540
"Camouflaged Selves".

217
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,310
A camouflaged object may have camouflaged itself...

218
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:58,620
Or it can be camouflaged by someone else.

219
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:02,775
The woman with hollow eyes stares at her glamorous self...

220
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:07,145
and casts endless questions on her own identity.

221
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,115
It's an interesting description.

222
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,085
Identity.

223
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,255
Do you think that's something worth thinking over?

224
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,765
What people see and believe is...

225
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,810
my real self and my real identity.

226
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:28,235
Whether it's camouflaged or not is not important.

227
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,120
If you can't tell the difference,

228
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,675
it's not a camouflage anymore.

229
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,690
What's this painting?

230
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:46,085
It's cool for sure, but it could be scary to look at in the dark.

231
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,630
Are you okay with it?

232
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:50,655
Why? I love it.

233
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,140
So what's the painting about?

234
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,165
Does it mean something?

235
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,235
There's a way to figure it out.

236
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,245
Pop art.

237
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,990
Camouflaged Selves series.

238
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,330
It's a painting about identity.

239
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,160
It expresses the struggles between the camouflaged self...

240
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,655
seen by other people and the real self.

241
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:24,240
Identity? I see.

242
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,600
Don't act like you know.

243
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,240
Do you even think about such things?

244
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:30,295
You have a death wish, don't you?

245
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,965
What's there to think about?

246
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:39,305
What people see and believe is my real identity.

247
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,950
If you can't tell the difference,

248
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,750
it's not a camouflage anymore, right?

249
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,520
Look at you, Su Ah.

250
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,115
Su Ah.

251
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,715
Yes?

252
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,985
What makes you think that?

253
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,625
Does it sound strange?

254
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:00,195
Actually, that's what I heard from another person.

255
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:10,975
It's you, not me,

256
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,145
who's going around and doing stupid things.

257
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,825
(Donghan Hospital)

258
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,435
Su Ah.

259
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:21,245
What am I going to do now?

260
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:44,310
On the verge of passing the national petition...

261
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:47,080
for a reinvestigation of the Townhouse murder case,

262
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,350
Mr. Kim, the murder suspect, has recovered consciousness.

263
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,520
Since the Townhouse murder case has become...

264
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,020
such a big issue due to growing suspicions and speculations,

265
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,490
the news of the suspect's recovery...

266
00:22:57,493 --> 00:23:00,060
is drawing public attention...

267
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,190
to the resumption of the trial.

268
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:05,730
Meanwhile, the focus is now on whether Songha Law Firm,

269
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:09,930
which has been accused of having a plea bargain with the prosecution,

270
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:13,500
will take the case or not and also on what defense strategy...

271
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:15,595
they will choose.

(President Lee Do Jin)

273
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,665
Gosh, why now of all times?

274
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,405
Submit a resignation letter to the court.

275
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,250
Tell them we're resigning from Kim Han Su's case.

276
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:29,975
Yes, sir.

277
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,190
Convict him no matter what.

278
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:42,325
Whatever it takes, convict him of the murder of Jung Su Ah.

279
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:45,100
And give him a maximum sentence.

280
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,570
Otherwise, we'll have to take all the responsibility...

281
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,470
for his attempted suicide.

282
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:53,080
But right now, public opinion is...

283
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:55,735
What? Public opinion?

284
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,980
Is public opinion law?

285
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,350
You know I've been looking after you despite your incompetence.

286
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,885
How dare you whine at me?

287
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,390
- I'm sorry, sir. - Get yourself together.

288
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:09,515
- Got that? - Yes.

289
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,995
Last night, Mr. Gi came to the academy.

290
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,880
Why?

291
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,710
He's been asking what I was doing on the night of Su Ah's murder.

292
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,120
Last night, he took me near Su Ah's house...

293
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,150
and showed strange things.

294
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,075
Strange things?

295
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,345
That was...

296
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:42,260
a video of you getting out of a taxi.

297
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:45,055
And he said that was near Su Ah's house.

298
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:47,970
As if that means something.

299
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,155
He probably thinks you killed Su Ah.

300
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,600
We were watching a movie back then.

301
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,070
But he didn't believe that too.

302
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,440
Did you tell him we were watching a movie together on that day?

303
00:24:58,447 --> 00:24:59,880
I did.

304
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:03,935
I said it was total nonsense since we were together back then.

305
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:08,245
Don't worry.

306
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,875
I didn't say you went out.

307
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,915
How did you know?

308
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:21,425
Sorry?

309
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,925
The fact that I went out.

310
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,895
Have you known all along?

311
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:36,110
I woke up once in the middle.

312
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,875
You didn't come back for a long time,

313
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,075
so I got back to sleep.

00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:23,310
this is the most absurd thing that ever happened to me.

343
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,935
Ever.

344
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,575
Pack your things quietly and go.

345
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,420
Then I won't report you.

346
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:35,530
Since we've already got enough trouble,

347
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,955
I don't want to make a big deal. You should be thankful.

348
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,455
I don't want to.

349
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,525
- You don't? - Yes.

350
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:51,065
Why? How come?

351
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:56,210
Look at how you said that without batting an eye.

352
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,545
You are so brazen.

353
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,490
I may be brazen,

354
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,890
but I don't hold a candle to you.

355
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,445
What?

356
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:12,385
Mr. Gi.

357
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,900
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:17,225
I'm in a mood for coffee. Make me a cup.

359
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,700
(Voice file)

360
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,465
This smells nice.

361
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:27,510
A handsome man makes even instant coffee taste good.

362
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,035
Here.

363
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:32,875
What is that? When did you...

364
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:37,745
The most basic step to take in case of sexual harassment...

365
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:43,015
is to record everything and everywhere at all times.

366
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:46,360
I recorded all of our conversations...

367
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,425
in the pantry.

368
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,355
What?

369
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:51,600
What...

370
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,740
How could you do something so despicable...

371
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,470
You did much more despicable things.

372
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:57,670
Think of the times.

373
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,480
How could such improper things come out of your mouth all the time?

374
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,710
You took it all.

375
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,375
You played along, and now...

376
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,020
I was...

377
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:11,845
playing along because you are my superior.

378
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:15,560
So? Should I make this public...

379
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,815
and we both leave here?

380
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,725
Or should we just keep one secret each?

381
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:27,440
Thanks to you, I've lost all of my positions,

382
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:31,735
so I'll use my class times very freely.

383
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:39,405
If you're in the mood for coffee in the future,

384
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,875
make it yourself.

385
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,975
Like this.

386
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:05,180
What will happen now?

387
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,880
Because of the articles and the video,

388
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:09,235
everyone knows that it's our school now.

389
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,620
I'm so afraid the police may barge in at any moment,

390
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,605
that I can't teach my class.

391
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:17,150
And Ms. Jun is telling us to give an academic achievement award.

392
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,545
She's a total psycho.

393
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:22,185
Hang in there.

394
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,885
Things are headed in the right direction at least.

395
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,955
That's true.

396
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,295
That's right. I heard Han Su woke up. Did you see him?

397
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,565
No. He still needs his rest.

398
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,670
Still, he's alert...

399
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,680
and much better than I had feared.

400
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:42,410
That's a relief. I know you were very worried.

401
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,235
How is that a relief?

402
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,520
It'll just be a headache going forward.

403
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,845
The trial will start up again.

404
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,290
Plus, after what happened to Su Ah...

405
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:53,760
That's true.

406
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:57,585
It isn't over just because he woke up.

407
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:06,695
Townhouse...

408
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:10,665
murder case.

409
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:14,905
Hey.

410
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,750
This isn't your room.

411
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,680
How dare you come in here?

412
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,250
This is a school. No one owns any room.

413
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,420
Are you a dog?

414
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,620
Do you mark your territory here and there?

415
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:31,085
What? Why you... I'll kick you out.

416
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:34,855
Don't you think it's too late to kick me out?

417
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,000
Give it a rest. I'm not being nice because I like you.

418
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:39,270
Also, speak respectfully.

419
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:42,795
I'm more than a decade older than you, you rude punk.

420
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:48,750
(Townhouse murder case)

421
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,235
("The Suspect of the Townhouse Murder Points out Another Suspect")

422
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,290
Mr. Kim, the suspect of the Townhouse Murder,

423
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,790
which the entire nation has been following closely,

424
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:04,690
has retracted a part of his confession made in court.

425
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,460
What? Is that about Han Su?

426
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:07,830
The police state...

427
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:11,500
that Mr. Kim asserts he saw Mr. Lee,

428
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,740
general manager of a high school,

429
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,670
who was found dead last month, at the scene of the crime.

430
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,935
What gibberish is that? He saw Butler Lee?

431
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,210
Did he lose his mind from being in a coma?

432
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:25,480
Thus, the police are considering all possibilities...

433
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:29,045
and will reinvestigate the case accordingly.

434
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:45,495
(Donghan Hospital)

435
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:06,185
(Patient: Kim Han Su)

436
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:09,215
Explain in more detail.

437
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,955
You're saying you saw Lee Tae Seok flee from the scene, right?

438
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,140
Yes.

439
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,870
What was the situation? Explain from the beginning.

440
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:25,065
From the moment you walked into the victim's home.

441
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:40,515
Su Ah.

442
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,085
Su Ah.

443
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,155
Su Ah, are you in there?

444
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:00,235
Stop right there!

445
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,735
Su Ah.

446
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:16,515
He fled out the back door.

447
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:18,715
The back door?

448
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,325
I was too worried about Su Ah to run after him.

449
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:26,425
But I clearly saw Lee Tae Seok...

450
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,865
run out the back door.

451
00:35:32,614 --> 00:35:35,135
(At victim's house,)

452
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,845
(he saw Lee Tae Seok run out the back door.)

453
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,015
Why did you try to kill yourself?

454
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,000
Lee Tae Seok used a classmate...

455
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,655
to threaten him and tell him to kill himself.

456
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,625
So he's the culprit.

457
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:04,565
If he didn't stab Jung Su Ah,

458
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:06,640
he had no reason to threaten him to kill himself.

459
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:09,280
Yes. Kim Han Su was the sole witness,

460
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,035
so he tried to eliminate him.

461
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,250
Good work.

462
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:18,515
Okay. In that case, get the statement...

463
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,190
of the kid who brought Jung Su Ah's picture to Kim Han Su.

464
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:23,885
I will.

465
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,875
Are you here to see the suspect?

466
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,230
And you are?

467
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,185
I'm the detective in charge of the case.

468
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,385
You're the lawyer Gi Mu Hyeok, right?

469
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:03,330
What brings you here?

470
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,625
You're not a lawyer anymore, from what I've heard.

471
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,110
I'll be returning to work soon...

472
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:14,435
and I'll represent Kim Han Su again.

473
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:17,150
Is that right?

474
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,705
Yes.

475
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:22,005
That's why I'd like to see him.

476
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:27,145
Sure. Go ahead.

477
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:45,365
Let him in. He's here to see him.

478
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:46,935
Yes, sir.

479
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,420
Why did you come again?

480
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:02,345
I said I don't need you to defend me anymore.

481
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,515
Did you really see him?

482
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,955
Did you really see Lee Tae Seok...

483
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,555
in Su Ah's place?

484
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,495
Get out.

485
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:21,365
I don't have anything to say. So get lost.

486
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,935
Take him out!

487
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:26,175
(Police)

488
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,420
You must leave now.

489
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:29,045
Okay.

490
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,515
What else are you hiding?

491
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:37,085
Why don't you tell me the truth now?

492
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,630
What was the thing...

493
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:43,755
you tried to tell me that day?

494
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,310
Get out!

495
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,810
If you don't leave right now, we will have to arrest you.

496
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,365
Kim Han Su.

497
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:56,205
- Kim Han Su! - I warned you.

498
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,205
Stay out...

499
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,745
of my life.

500
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,545
Or...

501
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,845
I will really kill you.

502
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:15,255
Han Su.

503
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:18,425
Get lost!

504
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,575
Goodness. What are you going to do now?

505
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:42,390
Do you think...

506
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:45,515
you can be his attorney again?

507
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:51,500
From now on,

508
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:53,940
don't you think of seeing the suspect again.

509
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:57,710
What if he loses his mind and passes out...

510
00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,510
after seeing you?

511
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:03,135
That will put us in a difficult position.

512
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:06,005
Nurse?

513
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:07,720
Yes, sir.

514
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,490
If anything happens by letting him see the patient again,

515
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,315
the hospital will need to take full responsibility for it.

516
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:16,090
I see.

517
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,415
Okay. Thank you.

518
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,605
(President Lee Do Jin)

519
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,715
About the offer...

520
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:56,255
I'll come to you to give my answer.

521
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:11,735
(Memorandum of Agreement)

522
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,180
What is this?

523
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:16,120
It's a memorandum...

524
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,720
that says even after you get your license back,

525
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,160
you will not defend Kim Han Su's case...

526
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:23,390
and will not let out any information regarding it.

527
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,400
Lest it will be legally misinterpreted,

528
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,760
I reviewed the content myself,

529
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,925
so all you need to do is to sign on it.

530
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:36,610
- What are you waiting for? - Sir.

531
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:40,910
Do you by any chance remember what you said to me...

532
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,135
when you kicked me out of this firm?

533
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:46,520
You said I was a cog.

534
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:48,550
A cog that works...

535
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:52,020
stuck in the system you made.

536
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:55,630
You're nothing more than a cog.

537
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,300
You're stuck in a system I created, and you must turn...

538
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,325
until your teeth wear out.

539
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:06,325
You're just a cog.

540
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,035
- That's... - I'm afraid you have to...

541
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,305
be my cog now.

542
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:19,275
Me?

543
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,105
Your cog?

544
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:33,660
I feel hurt, President Lee.

545
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:37,130
This was the only way I could talk to you.

546
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,940
What is it? After cutting Yang Sang Bae off,

547
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:42,565
couldn't you bring yourself to face me?

548
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,995
Will you shut it?

549
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:47,365
Who are you trying to involve me with?

550
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:49,410
So you want to pretend to be innocent?

551
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:51,480
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office!

552
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,050
Assistant Prosecutor General Yang Sang Bae...

553
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:54,650
at Criminal Department Three.

554
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,875
It was your order, President Lee Do Jin!

555
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:00,845
What do you say?

556
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:03,815
Should we keep listening to it...

557
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,360
or tell him to get out?

558
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:08,285
Who do you think you are to say that?

559
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,055
Get out.

560
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:12,625
- Excuse me, sir? - You heard me.

561
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,725
Get out.

562
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,095
Yes, sir.

563
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,375
Now, shall we listen to the rest?

564
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:36,815
Watch what you say in front of Ms. Woo.

565
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:40,530
Give me something that will keep my mouth shut.

566
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,260
It was what you wanted, President Lee.

567
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:46,540
You wanted to frame Han Su for everything about Su Ah.

568
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,800
I think we have listened enough.

569
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:51,095
Shall we get back to our conversation?

570
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:56,635
Do you think you can threaten me with the illegal recording?

571
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:00,820
Of course I do.

572
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:04,420
The suspicions on the plea bargain between you and Yang Sang Bae are...

573
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:06,160
spread through the media already.

574
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,390
Now, with just a drop of oil, which is your voice,

575
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,155
the public will be outraged.

576
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:19,140
Tell me what you want.

577
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,470
I like that you are quick-witted.

578
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:25,210
For now, I want you to give my license back to me.

579
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:27,365
As soon as possible.

580
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:31,010
- I will. - And I want Songha...

581
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:34,005
to keep dealing with Kim Han Su's case.

582
00:44:34,622 --> 00:44:36,620
Look on the bright side.

583
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:40,020
If Songha manages to prove Han Su's innocence,

584
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:42,830
it'll help eliminate the suspicions on the plea bargain...

585
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,785
with Yang Sang Bae.

586
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,730
Okay. Is that all?

587
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:50,630
One more thing.

588
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:54,670
I want Songha to pay for all the costs.

589
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:57,010
Our client, Kim Han Su, has no money...

590
00:44:57,011 --> 00:44:59,605
and I'm quite short of money too these days.

591
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,205
Then...

592
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,610
(Memorandum of Agreement)

593
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,305
Let's forget about this.

594
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:17,015
Let's make a new one.

595
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm glad...

596
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:28,800
you got your license back...

597
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,395
and you can keep defending Han Su.

598
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:43,750
The problem is...

599
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:46,720
Han Su is refusing it.

600
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:50,515
No matter how willing I am, if the client doesn't want it,

601
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,530
there's nothing I can do.

602
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,385
What could Beom Jin have possibly said to him?

603
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,200
The bigger problem is...

604
00:45:57,204 --> 00:45:58,630
that Han Su stated to the police...

605
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,300
that he saw Lee Tae Seok at the crime scene.

606
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:05,740
He made a false confession at court last time.

607
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:09,265
If his statement turns out to be false again,

608
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,705
people won't believe him anymore, no matter what he says.

609
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:17,320
Do you think Beom Jin calculated that too?

610
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:19,475
I won't be surprised if he did.

611
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:22,630
Covering it up with Lee Tae Seok's death...

612
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,830
would keep his father, Yu Yang Ki safe,

613
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:27,855
and even if his statement turns out to be false,

614
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:31,255
it will be only Han Su that will be cornered.

615
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:36,025
Either way, it doesn't harm Yu Beom Jin.

616
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:39,865
Then what do we do now?

617
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:42,905
First,

618
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:47,180
since I can't visit him now, I want you to meet Han Su.

619
00:46:47,188 --> 00:46:50,190
We need to hear from him what he's hiding about the incident...

620
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:51,945
even though he knows it.

621
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:54,015
Okay.

622
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,390
Won Suk, did you check the theater?

623
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,385
Yes, I did.

624
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:02,630
Hey.

625
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:03,770
All right.

626
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:06,140
Now let's find out...

627
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,040
what is the thing that Han Su is hiding...

628
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:12,535
and if Yu Beom Jin really has an alibi.

629
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:29,460
Hey. What's wrong with you?

630
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,890
Do you not know it...

631
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:34,585
or do you pretend not to know it?

632
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:39,270
Listen.

633
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,770
Whether Lee Tae Seok is the murderer or not,

634
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,610
it has nothing to do with us.

635
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,295
You...

636
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,710
You said you'd give me an incentive.

637
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:48,710
Getting your license back...

638
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:52,205
and proving Kim Han Su's innocence. Aren't they all we need to do?

639
00:47:57,024 --> 00:47:58,545
No.

640
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:03,615
We need to find out who the real killer is.

641
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,430
Exactly. Why should we?

642
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,400
Too many people died and got hurt...

643
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:10,870
for it to end with just Han Su being acquitted.

644
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:12,895
Su Ah, Han Su,

645
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:15,995
and Hyun Jung.

646
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,040
If everything gets buried with Lee Tae Seok's death,

647
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:25,280
the killer will create a second Su Ah and Han Su.

648
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:26,650
He'll have no fear now.

649
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,245
Since he wasn't punished at all after committing a heinous crime.

650
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:36,015
We must prevent that from happening.

651
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:47,325
Are you...

652
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:50,365
the same Mu Hyeok I used to know?

653
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:07,045
(Yu Beom Jin)

654
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,900
That's it for today.

655
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:21,440
If there's a discrepancy with your grade, come to my office.

656
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:22,470
Okay.

657
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:23,540
Good work.

658
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,995
Thank you.

659
00:49:27,648 --> 00:49:29,950
The literature midterm was so difficult.

660
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,680
I wonder where I'll place.

661
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:33,380
If a certain someone came in first,

662
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,375
it would mean she has zero shame.

663
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:55,170
(Tae Ra)

664
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:56,665
I can't take it.

665
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:59,465
I really want to just die.

666
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,445
It's too hard to be in the classroom.

667
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,945
I feel like I'll go crazy.

668
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,915
Just today.

669
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,615
I'll talk to them again tomorrow during the joint class.

670
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:24,495
Would I be at peace...

671
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:26,495
if I admit it all?

672
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,370
People I don't know are calling me,

673
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:31,335
threatening, and cursing at me.

674
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:34,065
It's so scary.

675
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:37,035
I want to at least be at peace.

676
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,945
People don't stay interested in other people's lives for that long.

677
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:49,315
Once we graduate, let's go study abroad together.

678
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,485
Then everyone will forget.

679
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,900
Do you want to go somewhere after school?

680
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,200
Let's eat yummy food and go somewhere pretty.

681
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:03,895
I'll make your depression disappear.

682
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,505
Okay.

683
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,665
Thanks.

684
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,355
- What is it? - I warned you...

685
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:27,055
not to trust your boyfriend.

686
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:34,770
Did you decide to stick next to her and watch her closely...

687
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:37,640
so she can't talk about you?

688
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,465
Leave Tae Ra alone.

689
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,665
Talk to me if you need to.

690
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,805
I'm shocked.

691
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,905
You really sound like you're trying to protect her.

692
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:56,755
How did you silence Han Su?

693
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:59,215
Did you use Su Ah?

694
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:03,200
You're the one that should stop using Han Su.

695
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,795
Using him?

696
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,540
Me?

697
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,165
You don't care what he wants.

698
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:12,635
You just want to win in court.

699
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,040
I call that using him.

700
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,605
At least...

701
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:19,605
I try to give him what he wants.

702
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,805
Unlike you.

703
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:27,745
Let's go.

704
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:39,855
What he wants.

705
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,050
There are two theaters near Su Ah's place.

706
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:54,805
One of them...

707
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:59,415
was rented out for a screening.

708
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:01,520
Then that can't be it.

709
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:04,915
If he were going to sneak out, he wouldn't have picked a screening.

710
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,455
That's right. Then this is it.

711
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:11,625
The theater in a mall.

712
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:16,670
Han Su was arrested...

713
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:20,005
around 8:30pm Friday night.

714
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,610
A movie at the same time today as back then is...

715
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,380
(Screening schedule)

716
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:31,290
It starts at 7:55pm and ends at 10:10pm.

717
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,845
Theater four.

718
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:35,590
Today is Friday,

719
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:37,715
so it's a similar time, too.

720
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:40,900
Why do you look so sick?

721
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,800
You already look old, but you look jaundiced.

722
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,025
Your liver must have gotten worse.

723
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,325
This is my normal skin tone.

724
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:48,640
This is all your fault.

725
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,295
It's because you make me work night and day.

726
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:53,435
Okay. Sorry.

727
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,040
In light of that, let's go rest.

728
00:53:56,049 --> 00:53:58,035
Go buy the tickets.

729
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,380
Rest?

730
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:03,675
I got excited for a minute.

731
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,415
Where's the box office?

732
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,485
(Donghan Hospital)

733
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:14,855
I'm so glad...

734
00:54:16,136 --> 00:54:18,125
you're awake.

735
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,225
Sorry...

736
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,295
for worrying you.

737
00:54:24,578 --> 00:54:26,835
Then recover quickly.

738
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,850
That way, you can run in the schoolyard again...

739
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,075
and practice for the physical fitness test.

740
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,085
When you were asleep,

741
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:50,425
I brought Su Ah's things from the orphanage.

742
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:56,795
This is her diary.

743
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,965
She wrote a lot about you.

744
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,230
(They served sausages today at school.)

745
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,755
(I decided to tutor Han Su.)

746
00:55:33,347 --> 00:55:35,080
Early tomorrow morning,

747
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,335
my new parents will come get me.

748
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,975
I'm happy to have Mom and Dad,

749
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:44,475
but I'm worried about Han Su.

750
00:55:44,825 --> 00:55:49,515
I'm not sure if this silly boy will be all right when I'm gone.

751
00:55:49,863 --> 00:55:51,655
When I grow up...

752
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:53,985
and meet him again,

753
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:59,655
I will protect Han Su then.

754
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:03,425
(I will protect Han Su then.)

755
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:09,235
Su Ah...

756
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,275
wanted to protect you too.

757
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:15,875
She felt the same way you did.

758
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,915
Just as you wanted to become a gym teacher...

759
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:23,855
to live in the same world as her,

760
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:26,825
maybe she was doing the same.

761
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:30,795
Su Ah...

762
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:33,295
also...

763
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:35,425
Han Su.

764
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,335
I know it's hard for you,

765
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:42,610
but can you tell me...

766
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:44,735
what Su Ah was like?

767
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:53,785
Su Ah...

768
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,745
was abandoned twice.

769
00:56:57,364 --> 00:56:59,885
First by her birth parents,

770
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:02,800
and second by those jerks...

771
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:04,425
who adopted her.

772
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:10,070
Thank you.

773
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:11,440
More scallions, please.

774
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:13,265
Scallions? Okay.

775
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:16,580
Her adoptive parents were finally able to have kids.

776
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:19,050
Once their baby was born,

777
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:21,905
they treated Su Ah like a piece of baggage.

778
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,000
They emigrated with just their biological child,

779
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,260
and after Su Ah finished middle school,

780
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:38,625
they stopped supporting her financially too.

781
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:41,495
(Part-time job)

782
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,665
(Recruitment)

783
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,435
She couldn't pay her tuition,

784
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,975
so she dropped out of high school without completing a single year.

785
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:56,105
After then,

786
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:59,045
she worked multiple jobs to make money for tuition.

787
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:12,070
Our research facility is the only one...

788
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:17,070
in all of Korea conducting this study.

789
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:20,165
Please show us your support.

790
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:22,510
- Please. - Okay.

791
00:58:22,516 --> 00:58:25,610
I'd like to thank Pastor Kim for inviting me to speak...

792
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,445
The movie started 20 minutes ago.

793
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:39,985
I need your support and belief...

794
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:51,970
It takes about five minutes to leave the theater...

795
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:53,835
and walk to the taxi stand.

796
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:06,960
Get in a cab at the taxi stand and leave.

797
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,545
(Vacant)

798
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:21,465
Thank you.

799
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:33,705
It takes 15 minutes to get here from the theater.

800
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:54,640
20 minutes.

801
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:58,395
How long did it take from here?

802
01:01:02,175 --> 01:01:04,465
Am I too early?

803
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:07,805
Tae Ra!

804
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:11,405
Here, take this.

805
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,620
Is this for me?

806
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:16,690
Yes. A boy said...

807
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:20,375
to give it to the prettiest girl here.

808
01:01:21,061 --> 01:01:24,860
Really? Thanks for giving it to me.

809
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:26,815
My pleasure.

810
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:30,955
Enjoy your date. Bye.

811
01:01:36,076 --> 01:01:38,170
He said he'd make my depression disappear.

812
01:01:38,178 --> 01:01:40,335
Did he mean this balloon?

813
01:01:43,049 --> 01:01:44,675
A note?

814
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:50,250
(Come to the rooftop. I've prepared something.)

815
01:01:50,256 --> 01:01:54,185
"Come to the rooftop. I've prepared something."

816
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,555
What is it?

817
01:01:58,665 --> 01:02:02,255
He must have prepared a lot to cheer me up.

818
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:06,355
(5G Building)

819
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,625
40 minutes.

820
01:03:13,273 --> 01:03:15,170
You called a cab, right?

821
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:16,725
Yes.

822
01:03:20,246 --> 01:03:24,175
I'm sure he didn't leave any evidence.

823
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,575
Oh my gosh.

824
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:04,245
That scared me.

825
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:09,545
Are you awake?

826
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:11,455
Hey.

827
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,955
How is the movie?

828
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:17,770
Watch for yourself.

829
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:22,425
The climax is about to start.

830
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:31,935
It took 57 minutes.

831
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:35,220
A movie runs for about two hours,

832
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:37,450
so there's plenty of time to commit the crime...

833
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,915
and get back.

834
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,015
Then was it really Yu Beom Jin?

835
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,500
But...

836
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:50,970
there's no way to prove it.

837
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,755
Why not?

838
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,900
There's Tae Ra, who watched the movie with him.

839
01:04:55,909 --> 01:05:00,070
If he left for an hour for whatever reason,

840
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,575
there's no way she didn't notice.

841
01:05:05,752 --> 01:05:06,950
Then...

842
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:09,050
Only Tae Ra can attest to it.

843
01:05:09,055 --> 01:05:10,850
That Yu Beom Jin...

844
01:05:10,857 --> 01:05:14,315
had no alibi whatsoever that day when Su Ah...

845
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,345
was stabbed.

846
01:05:51,597 --> 01:05:54,655
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

847
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,665
(I will protect Han Su then.)

848
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,680
Beom Jin killed her.

849
01:06:11,684 --> 01:06:14,220
He faked it as a suicide and killed her.

850
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,550
It's over.

851
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,880
Tell it to me straight!

852
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:20,050
If you had done as I said, Tae Ra wouldn't have died.

853
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,060
Beom Jin!

854
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,120
We must stop him.

855
01:06:22,128 --> 01:06:24,460
I don't know how far he'll go.

856
01:06:24,464 --> 01:06:26,430
He manipulated the people around him...

857
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:28,630
and created situations that are most favorable to him.

858
01:06:28,634 --> 01:06:29,960
We have to make changes.

859
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:32,270
I saw the man Su Ah was seeing.

860
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:36,000
How long will you turn a blind eye and just watch?

861
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:37,010
Han Su!

862
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:41,180
He may be thorough, but he must have missed something.

863
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,340
Maybe Su Ah left behind evidence.

864
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:44,950
He made a mistake.

865
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:46,805
Beom Jim.

866
01:06:47,854 --> 01:06:49,780
It's nice to meet you.

867
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:50,790
(I will protect the people.)

868
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,520
Assemblyman Yu Yang Ki.

869
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:55,085
Thank you for your time.

870
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:57,215
In return, I will tell you...

871
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,485
who murdered Su Ah.
