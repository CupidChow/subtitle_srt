1
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,400
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:22,085
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,300
Normally, contrary to people's belief,

4
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:29,910
even writings posted online have a recognizable style.

5
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:33,210
Where they place the commas, the indentations,

6
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,750
how they separate paragraphs,

7
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:37,920
the number of periods they use for abbreviations.

8
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:40,590
If you analyze these little details,

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,515
you can find out who wrote what.

10
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,475
Just like this.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,100
According to my analysis,

12
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,570
one person continuously posted all the slanderous stories...

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,100
about Su Ah on the student community portal.

14
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:58,595
The person changed the writing style each time,

15
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,110
but you can't fool me.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,195
So? Who was it? Who posted those photos?

17
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,470
Stupid idiot.

18
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,765
She looked so angry because she was being wronged.

19
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,905
So? There's nothing she can do.

20
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,515
This is just the beginning. Once I make my debut,

21
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,700
no one can look down on me.

22
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,300
Not Gi Hoon, not Beom Jin,

23
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,595
and not that witch Tae Ra.

24
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,505
Mr. Gi?

25
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,705
I heard the news. You're making your debut.

26
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:35,160
Our CEO is so impatient.

27
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:36,830
Did he call the school already?

28
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,525
To cut me slack for missing classes because I'm debuting soon?

29
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:47,210
Did you buy a bouquet just for me?

30
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,940
I thought you were only superior physically, but you're sweet, too.

31
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:54,010
Once I make my debut, I'll send you my concert tickets.

32
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,635
Front row.

33
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,520
Hey. I didn't grab it yet.

34
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:09,885
Don't pick it up. You won't get to make your debut.

35
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,740
Not only now, but ever.

36
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,710
You'll never get a chance like that in your lifetime.

37
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,380
You will never debut and be happy.

38
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,995
Never.

39
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,435
What are you talking about?

40
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,420
Why can't I make my debut?

41
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,945
I waited so long for this.

42
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,645
Why did you do it?

43
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,445
I heard you used to be close.

44
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,060
It was you.

45
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,100
The source of the disgusting rumors surrounding Jung Su Ah.

46
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,625
Cheonmyung High's Student Community portal.

47
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,895
The secret sysop.

48
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,075
What are you talking about?

49
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,890
Rumors about Su Ah?

50
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,805
What rumors?

51
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,615
- What's this? - See for yourself.

52
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,555
I won't drop it this time.

53
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,525
(Girl Group Trainee's Disgusting Truth)

54
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,505
(Don't instigate us.)

55
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,930
Na Ye Ri? Are you sure about this?

56
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,490
100 percent.

57
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,830
Her address, IP address, cell phone, laptop MAC address,

58
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,770
and the WiFi routers of nearby internet cafes all match.

59
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,900
Conclusively,

60
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:01,065
the person who created the portal is Ye Ri's fan.

61
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,410
(Choi Kwang Shik)

62
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,310
The kids call this a tribute.

63
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,365
(Choi Kwang Shik)

64
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,575
Su Ah...

65
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:17,145
Poor Su Ah.

66
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:21,715
She should've gone into acting rather than singing.

67
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:25,660
Hi, YERIROOs!

68
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:29,000
I have great news today that I want to tell you...

69
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,700
before anyone else.

70
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,695
Finally...

71
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:39,335
I will be making my debut, which you've all been waiting for!

72
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:42,810
Posts on the student community portal,

73
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,445
various social media, and community sites.

74
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,690
It wasn't just a few kids...

75
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,715
whose lives were ruined because of you.

76
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,785
What did I do?

77
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:00,930
Is there proof?

78
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:04,600
Do you have proof that I posted these stories and pictures?

79
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:05,970
Proof?

80
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,310
Do you deserve to ask for that?

81
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,380
Did you target those girls because you had proof?

82
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,535
You wrote them carelessly.

83
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,450
Whether they die...

84
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:18,220
or become mangled trying to escape.

85
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,135
You just wrote them first.

86
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,545
Do you want to get fired?

87
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,930
You say that so easily.

88
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,430
It's someone's livelihood.

89
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:32,500
What do I care?

90
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,630
If you don't want that, get lost in silence.

91
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,430
You're just a temp.

92
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,740
How dare you try to lecture me?

93
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:42,540
One call from my dad can get you fired right away.

94
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,140
Do you want that?

95
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:47,950
Your great father got transferred to the India branch.

96
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,110
He assaulted a worker,

97
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,980
put pressure on a subsidiary, and got caught.

98
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:53,375
He won't get promoted anymore.

99
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,220
If this ends up online,

100
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,630
your debut won't be the issue.

101
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:04,330
It'll be about whether or not you can survive in Korea.

102
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,985
Can you handle that?

103
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,570
I'm just a temp who has nothing to lose but a job.

104
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,995
You'll have to quit training which was all you did for seven years...

105
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,935
and join your father in India.

106
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:25,620
Do they have girl groups there too?

107
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:28,175
I've never been there, so I don't know.

108
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,985
Is someone here?

109
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,455
Mr. Choi?

110
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:41,355
It's you, Ye Ri.

111
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,670
Who is this?

112
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,140
It's nice to meet you.

113
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,870
I'm a teacher at her school, Cheonmyung High School.

114
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,835
My name is Gi Kang Je.

115
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,810
Hello.

116
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,735
Why are you here at this time of night?

117
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,675
I don't know how to put this.

118
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,220
Why? What is it about?

119
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:08,985
There's an issue that could jeopardize Ye Ri's debut.

120
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,860
Would you mind if I tell him...

121
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,685
what I know?

122
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:22,495
Yes. He should know the truth.

123
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,150
Take a look at this. You'll see what I mean.

124
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,145
What Ye Ri tried to hide.

125
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,985
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,695
I'm sorry for everything.

127
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:56,240
Will you forgive me?

128
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,035
Do you admit...

129
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,235
that you did everything?

130
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,475
Yes, I admit to everything.

131
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:12,120
What on earth did she do?

132
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,860
She skipped class. Habitually.

133
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,660
What? She skipped class?

134
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,630
Yes. She disappeared...

135
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,700
just to practice too many times.

136
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,670
She's at risk of not attending the minimum number of school days,

137
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,840
so I came over out of concern.

138
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,380
Oh, I see.

139
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,710
I'm so sorry. We should've been more careful.

140
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,180
Fortunately though, Ye Ri admitted to her mistake,

141
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:41,605
so I'll let her off this time with just a warning.

142
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,275
Will you close it down?

143
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,115
The CHSC?

144
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,955
What?

145
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,455
The club you started.

146
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,670
Let's close it down for good.

147
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,825
You won't have time to run it anymore, will you?

148
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,995
Okay. I'll close it down.

149
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,350
Good. Let's discuss the rest of it at school.

150
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,120
I'll see you next time, Mr. Choi.

151
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,620
If need be.

152
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,245
Sure.

153
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,385
Goodbye.

154
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,305
You just skipped class?

155
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,550
- What? - Is there anything else?

156
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,450
Anything that could be risky for us?

157
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,045
No, there's nothing else.

158
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,945
I was worried. Pack up and leave.

159
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,040
That's all for today.

160
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,295
See you around at school.

161
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,605
(Cheonmyung High School)

162
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,145
It was you.

163
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:32,330
The source of the disgusting rumors surrounding Jung Su Ah.

164
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,585
Cheonmyung High's Student Community portal.

165
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:37,155
The secret sysop.

166
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,925
Darn it. Who does he think he is?

167
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,435
Why take it out on me?

168
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,545
Ye Ri, congratulations on your debut!

169
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,960
We saw what you uploaded yesterday.

170
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,560
Are you really making your debut?

171
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,085
Move.

172
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,660
Come on.

173
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,800
We prepared something to congratulate you.

174
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,200
- Yes. - That's right.

175
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,900
- Okay. 1, 2. - 1, 2.

176
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:13,040
- Congratulations on your debut - Congratulations on your debut

177
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,710
You'll never get a chance like that in your lifetime.

178
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,410
You will never debut and be happy.

179
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,380
- Happy debut, dear Ye Ri - Happy debut, dear Ye Ri

180
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,435
I told you to stop!

181
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,780
Darn it.

182
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:29,105
I said move. Why didn't you listen?

183
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,360
What's the matter with her?

184
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:35,615
Is something wrong?

185
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,930
What is it? Is something wrong?

186
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:42,330
They got here early to congratulate you.

187
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,155
It's nothing.

188
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,270
I'm just annoyed.

189
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,965
It's nothing to celebrate about.

190
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,235
- Hello. - Hi.

191
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,005
Hello.

192
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:09,485
Don't mind their glances too much.

193
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,760
What?

194
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,560
Reacting each time will only get them more excited.

195
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:16,755
So don't look around and walk confidently.

196
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,795
Why should we care when it's not even true?

197
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,340
Yes, well, I guess.

198
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,540
My goodness.

199
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,610
How can you two...

200
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,980
walk around together in this situation?

201
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,780
You're not thinking at all.

202
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,120
Hello.

203
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,205
What should they be thinking about?

204
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:40,875
I have no idea what she's talking about either.

205
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,730
Tell the truth.

206
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,060
You were at Mr. Gi's place until late at night.

207
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,970
Did something happen?

208
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,830
Don't get imaginative.

209
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,800
I was there because of work.

210
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,855
Oh, work?

211
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:56,440
Yes, that's how it usually starts.

212
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,710
You meet up because of work at first,

213
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,350
and then you meet up without any reason.

214
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,905
Let's not get carried away, Ms. Shin.

215
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:06,820
So, who is it?

216
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,375
The kid you caught during the self-study session.

217
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,785
Here she is.

218
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,200
Hand over your phone.

219
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,440
What for?

220
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,295
Why do you think?

221
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,140
I caught you...

222
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,835
peeking at photos of Ms. Ha during self-study.

223
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,650
Hand it over.

224
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,905
I'll let Ms. Ha see it for herself.

225
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,705
Hand it over.

226
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,720
That's enough.

227
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,575
This is illegal.

228
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,190
What? Illegal?

229
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,730
Unless it's an urgent matter,

230
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,430
you can't search or confiscate our belongings without consent.

231
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,830
You may be a teacher,

232
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,830
but taking a phone by force that contains personal information...

233
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:57,695
violates our rights.

234
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,570
I'm not taking anything by force.

235
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,010
I just want to have a look, okay?

236
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,795
- Wait, Ms. Shin. - What?

237
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:10,135
I'll talk to them. Can you excuse us?

238
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,445
Will you do that?

239
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,045
Show her that photo.

240
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,430
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:32,095
I should've explained and asked nicely.

242
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,695
If you don't want to,

243
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,640
you don't have to show me.

244
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,565
But to Mr. Gi and I,

245
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,635
it's important.

246
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,750
If you don't mind, can you help?

247
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,275
Please.

248
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,545
Let me show you.

249
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,830
Yun Ah, can you see the photo too?

250
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:59,230
I think most of the students here can see that.

251
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:02,230
Don't mind too much about the comments.

252
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,140
Don't worry. Those things won't hurt me.

253
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:07,025
Great, then.

Yes, I've been searching for it all this week.

258

But I have found nothing about that man, Gi Kang Je.

He doesn't seem to use any social media either.

There's no trace of him on the internet.

I have worked day and night for a month to make this.

264

No.

338
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:14,310
Let's meet outside. I feel uncomfortable in the school.

339

Who are you to decide that?

340
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,060
Come to the teachers' room before I go home.

343
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,325
Hi, Ms. Jun.

344
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,040
I want to have a cup of coffee. Why don't you make me one?

345
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,235
Sure. Here you go.

346
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,065
Great.

347
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:55,120
Could you make questions...

348
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,515
for the German language contest by next week?

349
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,720
Next week?

350
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:02,685
Why? Is there a problem?

351
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:07,255
No, I will do it. I can do it.

352
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:11,795
This is just between you and me.

353
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,795
Don't tell the students that there will be a contest.

354
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:25,135
Do we already have the contest winner?

355
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:29,590
I love that you're so quick-witted.

356
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,020
Please take care of it.

357
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,215
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,985

362
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,880
he came to me and asked for a favor.

363
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,610
We had to write a statement because of him.

364
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,110
A statement that says Kim Han Su stalked Jung Su Ah.

365
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,965
He's the only one who didn't write it.

No.

369

370
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,245
Okay.

Hey, what do we do now?

372
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:19,170
It looks like we can't use the rooftop any more.

373
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:22,310
We don't have any other option. We need to go somewhere else.

374
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:24,410
Somewhere else? Where?

375
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,065
Somewhere outside the school.

376
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:29,235
I don't want to do it in this stupid place any more.

377
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,080
Let's go start a real business.

378
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:35,005
No more commission and no more guarding.

379
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,320
Do whatever it takes to get all the interest back by this week.

380
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:42,215
We will need money to move out.

381
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,730
Hey, hold him tight. Or you will be beaten.

382
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,255
Okay.

Wait until I finish this round.

392
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:24,485
Why did you do that earlier?

393
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,340
What?

394
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:29,110
You humiliated Jun Jae at the hallway earlier.

395

He seems to have forgotten his place,

396
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,505
I trained the guard dog so he knows when to bark.

397
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:38,905
I get your intention, but you shouldn't do that again.

398
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:42,505
You don't want to show that to other kids.

399
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:47,945
Is that an order?

400
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,615
Is it?

401
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,125
Darn it.

402
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,525
Hey.

403
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,265
It's not like I have to listen to whatever you say. We're friends.

404
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,095
Am I wrong?

405
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,575
Sorry.

406
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,190
Of course I was asking you a favor.

407
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,730
You and I are friends, so I was just trying to be friendly.

408
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,415
Did I offend you?

409
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:34,610
- No. - We don't want...

410

to look like we're hanging out with the bullies like Son Jun Jae.

What's the big deal? They gave us what they had.

Is this all the police found in their investigation?

It's so little.

Well, yes. They pretty much stopped working on it too.

Jung Su Ah's fingerprints weren't.

That's right. That could happen.

00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:23,620
Calm down. I have an idea who it is.

504
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,820
Seriously. How can I calm down right now?

505
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,760
You said the investigation ended. Why was a prosecutor...

506
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:33,400
Regardless, they all work under me.

507
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:36,455
Furthermore, don't do anything stupid again.

508
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:39,095
Don't call me anymore today.

509
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,895
Hello? Deputy Manager Yang!

510
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,695
Darn it!

511
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,935
Did you forget how much money I paid you over the years?

512
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,905
Do you still meet separately?

513
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,590
What? No, of course not.

514
00:32:57,592 --> 00:33:01,175
You saw how I cut him off.

515
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,215
Watch it.

516
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,255
It won't help you to be associated with him.

517
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,555
Don't worry, sir.

518
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:25,935
Who was it? Who went to the scene of the crime?

519
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:29,020
Her name is Cha Hyun Jung.

520
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:30,890
She was in charge of the case.

521
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:33,645
She's a big troublemaker.

522
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,990
Get her to drop it quickly.

523
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,800
If not, send her elsewhere.

524
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,355
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

525
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,235
The lunch is so gross.

526
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:02,975
Where do they spend all the money we pay for our food?

527
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,645
I wonder.

528
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:09,060
It's all because of this twerp.

529
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:11,090
He goes to school for free.

530
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,000
He's bleeding us dry. Am I right?

531
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:16,455
What? Yes, that's right.

532
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,335
What's wrong? Don't you have an appetite?

533
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,545
What?

534
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:43,715
No, it's just... I'm on a diet, that's why.

535
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,085
I'm making my debut soon.

536
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:49,170
There's nothing to eat anyway.

537
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,355
I said let us go out to eat or order in.

538
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:56,495
It's nice eating school food once in a while.

539
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:58,510
The joy of a commoner.

540
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,310
Are you going to do politics like your dad?

541
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:03,405
What? Are you practicing eating market food already?

542
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,535
Hey, you.

543
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,145
It's so funny.

544
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:27,195
I'm sick of doing this now.

545
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,670
Hey. It's free food, which you love.

546
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,335
Eat it all.

547
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:35,780
Let's go to the snack shop.

548
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:39,305
Lucky you. You get to eat double.

549
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,735
Stop.

550
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,545
Please.

551
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:24,615
Please stop already. Stop.

552
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,725
Use this. It's clean.

553
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,965
Thanks.

554
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,095
Don't hold it in.

555
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:50,992
They bully you just as much as you can take.

556
00:36:50,992 --> 00:36:54,295
"This is how much he takes. We can keep bullying him this much."

557
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,464
"Shall we see how far we can go?"

558
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,903
When the moment comes that you've had enough,

559
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:04,205
it'll be too late.

560
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,742
Show them you won't take any more.

561
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:10,578
That's what they fear the most.

562
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:33,434
Cheonmyung High's Student Community Portal?

563
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:35,003
What's that?

564
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,605
The app where our photoshopped photo was posted.

565
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:40,608
Fortunately, no one can access it anymore,

566
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,611
but I saw Su Ah's photos on there too.

567
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:45,179
Su Ah?

568
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:48,283
Oh, that...

569
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,352
That dead girl from Class 2?

570
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,188
Yes. It wasn't just the photo.

571
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,992
The comments beneath it were shocking.

572
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,128
What did they say that was...

573
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:02,063
So, are you all...

574
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,300
paying attention to Tae Ra's piano recital?

575
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,802
It's a charity event for a good cause.

576
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:11,506
Come and help out voluntarily.

577
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:15,310
Give some extra performance assessment points...

578
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,513
and volunteer work hours to the students who attend the recital.

579
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:19,781
Sure.

580
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,816
- Okay. - I'll do that.

581
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,324
I'll come back later.

582
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,593
No, Ye Ri. Come on in.

583
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,399
What is it?

584
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,102
Are you here to see me?

585
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:43,838
Oh, well...

586
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:53,214
I want some career advice from Mr. Gi.

587
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:59,187
You need career advice, Ye Ri?

588
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,254
Yes.

589
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,491
Rather than talk to a temp like Mr. Gi, shouldn't you...

590
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,893
- talk to the chief administrator... - No.

591
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:09,964
I really want to talk to Mr. Gi.

592
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,600
Do you mind?

593
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,202
Gosh.

594
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:17,372
Why would I mind? Of course I don't.

595
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,040
Excuse us.

596
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,444
Let's talk a bit more after I'm done.

597
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,683
- Shall we go? - Yes.

598
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,291
Ye Ri wants to discuss her career? All of a sudden?

599
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,694
Doesn't she live only because she was born?

600
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,195
No, no.

601
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:43,631
He gave advice every morning.

602
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,867
I guess he got through to her.

603
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,804
I feel a bit disappointed.

604
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,573
I helped her come this far.

605
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,446
- Hello. - See you in class.

606
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:08,156
Hey, what's up?

607
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:13,861
- Shall we go? - Yes.

608
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,869
Are you in shock?

609
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,106
Because of what you saw on the student community portal.

610
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,874
Yes.

611
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:30,178
To be honest, I could barely eat.

612
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,146
I was in such shock.

613
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,752
But now I'm ready to listen.

614
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:42,123
Tell me every single thing you know.

615
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:46,994
Before I do, I want to check something.

616
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:50,264
What do you want to check?

617
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:54,602
You believe that Han Su didn't kill Su Ah, right?

618
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:57,839
That's why you went to the police station many times.

619
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:02,577
That's right. I think there's no way he did it.

620
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:05,079
That's why...

621
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,882
I'm only going to tell you.

622
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:10,852
The truth that I know.

623
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,288
What do you want from me?

624
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:19,894
You came to my agency to threaten me because you want something.

625
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,498
Tell me. I really need to make my debut.

626
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,666
I'm glad we're communicating.

627
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:29,904
Where did you get Su Ah's photos that you put on the portal?

628
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:35,376
From the photo club room. I took them with my phone.

629
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,314
Lee Gi Hoon, I told you not to do that to my...

630
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:44,585
Where is he? He used to be here all the time.

631
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,291
What's that?

632
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,638
What's this?

633
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,706
No way.

634
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:12,813
I thought he was a psycho, but he's a pervert?

635
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,484
Jung Su Ah?

636
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,492
Gosh.

637
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,435
What's that?

638
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,483
It was Butler Lee?

639
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:53,688
The man in the photo with her. Was it Butler Lee?

640
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:55,890
How do you know Butler Lee?

641
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,259
I know a bit more than you think I do.

642
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:03,097
So you just have to answer every question I ask.

643
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,335
Is Butler Lee our school's General Manager Lee Tae Seok?

644
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,770
Am I right?

645
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:17,812
I'm sure he's Butler Lee. Quite sure.

646
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:18,813
"Quite sure"?

647
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:20,181
If it hadn't been for Butler Lee,

648
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,584
how else could an orphan like Su Ah come to our school?

649
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,886
And with a general application, not a special one too.

650
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:28,356
Su Ah's parents are abroad.

651
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,891
What? You said you know a lot.

652
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:32,193
You didn't know this?

653
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,495
Su Ah was adopted.

654
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:37,298
Her adoptive parents moved abroad and left her.

655
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:39,200
How do you know that?

656
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,768
Because I heard her...

657
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:42,637
argue with Kim Han Su up here.

658
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:45,406
Yu Sun. Do you really not remember me?

659
00:43:45,406 --> 00:43:49,243
I'm Kim Han Su. We grew up in the same orphanage.

660
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:56,517
I was so worried when we lost touch after you got adopted.

661
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:00,221
I'm so glad. If you managed to transfer here,

662
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,490
then your parents must be good...

663
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:07,762
Don't touch me.

664
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:09,730
Don't act like you know me.

665
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:13,267
Yu Sun. How can you say...

666
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:15,336
Don't call me by that name.

667
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:17,204
If you do, I'll...

668
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,640
disappear forever.

669
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:21,842
From your sight.

670
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,760
She deceived us all.

671
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,762
She's two years older than us.

672
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,066
Her name, her age, her house, and her parents. Everything was fake.

673
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:49,236
Her existence itself was a lie.

674
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:53,708
She bullied Su Ah.

675
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:57,511
Very persistently, with the help of her gang.

676
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:01,449
Look at all this.

677
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,751
What's this?

678
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:06,120
Wow, Ye Ri. Look at this.

679
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,756
Gosh. What's all this?

680
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:11,125
Do you keep this for your work?

681
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,294
- Wow. - Oh, dear.

682
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:20,901
Oh, no. Looks like you can't work anymore.

683
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:23,037
What a pity.

684
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:27,141
Being dirty suits you.

685
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,376
You're wet, so you need to get wiped up.

686
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,445
I'll make you clean.

687
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:39,253
What are you doing?

688
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:42,490
Darn it. I told you not to let anyone in!

689
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,958
Turn a blind eye.

690
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,426
How can you say that?

691
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:49,063
Are you crazy? How can you do this to a classmate?

692
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,931
Classmate?

693
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:53,768
I don't have a courtesan as my classmate.

694
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:56,036
Ye Ri, you are...

695
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:57,738
You'd better make up your mind.

696
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,640
Will you be friends with us...

697
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,910
or get messy with that courtesan?

698
00:46:05,713 --> 00:46:07,281
Let's go.

699
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:14,121
Are you okay? How could they do that?

700
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:16,023
Wait here. I'll go find a teacher and...

701
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,625
Don't.

702
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,662
What do you mean? This is way over the line.

703
00:46:21,662 --> 00:46:23,430
It's okay.

704
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,432
I just got a bit wet. That's all.

705
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:30,437
But Su Ah didn't just sit and let them do that to her.

706
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,808
But if they keep bullying you like this...

707
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:36,443
I will not let them.

708
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:38,879
It's annoying.

709
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:43,250
Speaking of which, could you do me a favor?

710
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,686
A favor? What is it?

711
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,122
The broadcasting club is in charge...

712
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:50,291
of the school announcements, right?

713
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:51,992
- Yes. - Could you check...

714
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:54,161
on Tae Ra's award records?

715
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:57,031
All the awards she got since she entered the school.

716
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:59,466
What for?

717
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:09,710
You know how this school gives awards to students, right?

718
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,379
I do. If needed, they make up non-existent awards...

719
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,515
and give them to the students.

720
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:16,183
Right.

721
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:18,285
While comparing the list of awards Tae Ra received...

722
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:20,521
and the school announcement,

723
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,189
we found something strange.

724
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,724
"Something strange"?

725
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:26,293
Yes. There were some contests that weren't announced...

726
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:28,462
or they were announced very late...

727
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:31,232
and Tae Ra and a few other students received awards from them.

728
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:34,802
Are you saying certain students were specially treated?

729
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:36,036
Yes, I'm certain.

730
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:39,106
Since then, Tae Ra stopped bullying Su Ah.

731
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,243
When she bumped into her, she just ignored her as if she didn't exist.

732
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:44,511
But Ye Ri and other kids didn't stop.

733
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:47,514
There were weird posts about her on the student community portal...

734
00:47:47,848 --> 00:47:49,750
and the rumor slowly has spread.

735
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,152
But...

736
00:47:52,186 --> 00:47:55,055
why did Tae Ra bully Su Ah?

737
00:47:55,055 --> 00:47:56,924
They were friends.

738
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,762
I heard it started with a misunderstanding.

739
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:04,398
Su Ah, that witch, seduced him.

740
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,166
"Seduced"?

741
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:09,403
She not only hid her identity and fooled us...

742
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:12,106
but also did all kinds of tricks to Beom Jin.

743
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:13,240
If she considered Tae Ra as a friend,

744
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,608
she shouldn't have done that.

745
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:18,545
They were an official couple recognized by all the students.

746
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,450
How could she steal her friend's boyfriend?

747
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,054
It would have freaked me out too. I would have felt like killing her.

748
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,824
I don't know what your relationship with Su Ah is,

749
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,994
but she deserves to die.

750
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:38,465
(A privileged high school murder case)

751
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,502
I don't see anything.

752
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,636
But there were so many news articles about it...

753
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:45,306
just a few months ago.

754
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:47,308
They were all deleted.

755
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,810
(Townhouse high school student murder case)

756
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,980
Even if we search with different keywords, we can't find anything.

757
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,249
All we can find is useless information.

758
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,051
This is ridiculous.

759
00:48:57,051 --> 00:49:00,521
How can all the articles be deleted like this?

760
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,656
Don't be surprised yet.

761
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,391
This is just the beginning.

762
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,235
Look. They even blocked the foreign websites.

763
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:18,839
That the websites are censored so thoroughly...

764
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,076
means someone is trying to cover this up.

765
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,720
(Would you like to translate this page?)

766
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,390
It's opened. How did you do that?

767
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,658
I used a VPN program...

768
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:39,593
that changes our IP address into a foreign one.

769
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:42,730
This is a website about cold cases and its server is in the States.

770
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,632
There's an article that sums up Su Ah's case pretty well.

771
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,102
(An Evil Attorney Blinded by Desire for Victory)

772
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:50,237
"An evil attorney blinded by desire for victory..."

773
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,473
"takes the murder case at the privileged high school."

774
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:55,542
"A fabricated sponsor led to the victim's death"?

775
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,344
Han Su's attorney disclosed...

776
00:49:57,344 --> 00:50:01,315
the photos that were posted on the portal during the trial.

777
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:04,785
He said she got murdered while prostituting herself.

778
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:09,356
What? How could an attorney do that?

779
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:12,826
What if the attorney is someone we know?

780
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:15,562
What do you mean?

781
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,404
It was me! I did it!

782
00:50:23,404 --> 00:50:26,740
This is the video of Han Su's trial, right?

783
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,175
Yes.

784
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:31,045
Han Su is grabbing his attorney here.

785
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:33,180
Doesn't he look familiar?

786
00:50:41,522 --> 00:50:45,092
What if the attorney is someone we know?

787
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:47,761
What do you mean?

788
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:55,669
It was me! I did it!

789
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:58,806
This is the video of Han Su's trial, right?

790
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,374
Yes.

791
00:51:00,374 --> 00:51:03,210
Han Su is grabbing his attorney here.

792
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,145
Doesn't he look familiar?

793
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,025
No way. Mr. Gi?

794
00:51:20,094 --> 00:51:22,930
Wait. This doesn't make any sense.

795
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,233
Why is Han Su's attorney now a temporary teacher here?

796
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:31,171
His face doesn't look clear on the video. Mr. Gi...

797
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,940
I saw it.

798
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,775
What?

799
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:37,077
I saw Mr. Gi defending Han Su...

800
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:39,079
at the trial.

801
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,482
Shut your mouth!

802
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:45,152
- Oh, my. - What's going on?

803
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:48,222
It was me. I did it!

804
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:50,157
I stabbed Su Ah!

805
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:51,592
Get off me, you brat.

806
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,994
You're lying! It's all lie!

807
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:57,464
What do you know about Su Ah? You have no idea what you're saying!

808
00:51:57,464 --> 00:52:00,000
It was me! I did it!

809
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,301
Why did Han Su...

810
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:06,607
Get off me! I did it!

811
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:10,544
At first, I thought he might be just someone that looks like him.

812
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,346
But the more I see him, the surer I am.

813
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:13,347
It's weird, isn't it?

814
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:15,649
With such an impressive background, he's just a temporary teacher.

815
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:17,017
He's teaching politics and law.

816
00:52:17,017 --> 00:52:20,320
And he's the assistant teacher of Class 3, which is Han Su's class.

817
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,824
Why is he doing this? Why would he hide his identity,

818
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:26,560
change his name, and come to our school...

819
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,630
as a temporary teacher after doing that?

820
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:42,209
You should start working out from today.

821
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:44,077
We have a place for Shuttle Monster Fighter now.

822
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,579
It's a construction site near the school.

823
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,813
Aren't you excited?

824
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:50,584
It's better to beat someone than to be beaten, isn't it?

825
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:56,256
I told you I don't want to do that any more.

826
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,426
You brat. Can't you see we're trying to be nice?

827
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,499
Hey, Porter.

828
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,468
It looks like you have a sister that goes to middle school.

829
00:53:10,704 --> 00:53:13,440
If you mess up my streaming show again,

830
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:16,276
I will go find your sister.

831
00:53:21,048 --> 00:53:24,218
If you don't want that to happen, just shut it and fight.

832
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:27,988
You don't want your sister to be like you in school, do you?

833
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:31,191
And you're her only brother.

834
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,632
I can't stand this any more.

835
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,270
- What the... - What's going on?

836
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:44,638
I will not stand this any more.

837
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:48,475
What have I done? Why are you bullying me? Why?

838
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,377
Are you out of your mind?

839
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:55,515
Hey, did you see that? That scum hit me first.

840
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,918
This is self-defense.

841
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,551
Hey.

842
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:38,625
Her name, her age, her house, and her parents. Everything was fake.

843
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:42,095
Her existence itself was a lie.

844
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,233
Kim Han Su and Jung Su Ah...

845
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:49,936
They were from the same orphanage.

846
00:54:56,176 --> 00:54:59,980
Excuse me. Do you have a class right now?

847
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,382
About the photo of Su Ah that was posted on the portal.

848
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,485
I'd like to talk to you if you have time.

849
00:55:05,485 --> 00:55:07,654
You're sickening.

850
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:10,057
It gives me the chills.

851
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,362
What do you mean?

852
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:18,699
How could you say her name after doing something like that?

853
00:55:18,865 --> 00:55:21,435
You're Han Su's lawyer.

854
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:26,907
You drove him to suicide. How could you be so shameless?

855
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:38,085
What was that?

856
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,986
Did someone throw that?

857
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:41,855
- What happened? - It came from up there.

858
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:43,323
Ms. Ha.

859
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,892
My gosh.

860
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:58,638
That's it!

861
00:56:17,758 --> 00:56:19,259
I asked you.

862
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:22,162
I asked you over and over to stop!

863
00:56:22,763 --> 00:56:26,767
So why? Why are you doing this?

864
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,902
You crazy lunatic. Get off of me!

865
00:56:28,902 --> 00:56:30,904
It's because I just took it, right?

866
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:35,475
It's because I just took it. But not anymore.

867
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:36,810
So let's end this.

868
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,079
- Oh my gosh. - Byung Ho!

869
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:45,085
Calm down and put that down. Okay?

870
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:48,388
It's okay. Put that down and talk to me.

871
00:56:48,388 --> 00:56:50,924
- I'm sure there's a way... - I'm sorry.

872
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:56,329
I should've told you back then when you came.

873
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:59,766
Now, I can't take it anymore.

874
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:02,068
I can take being bullied myself,

875
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:06,072
but I won't let my little sister end up like me. Then I'd...

876
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:07,507
Then...

877
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,178
you'll become a criminal.

878
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,113
Mr. Gi.

879
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:16,483
The moment you stab him with that,

880
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:18,318
regardless of all the abuse you suffered,

881
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:19,986
you'd be the assailant,

882
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:22,722
and he'll become the victim. Isn't that worse?

883
00:57:22,722 --> 00:57:24,291
Then what?

884
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:26,960
Should I just keep taking the abuse?

885
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,528
Just holding it in until the day I die?

886
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,996
Why would you hold it in?

887
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:33,266
You should take it to court.

888
00:57:35,235 --> 00:57:36,636
I taught you.

889
00:57:36,636 --> 00:57:39,105
Saying you'll take someone to court means...

890
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:42,876
"I'm going to make your life miserable."

891
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:46,713
Byung Ho, you decide.

892
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:50,083
Will your life become miserable, or will you make...

893
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:53,553
that scumbag's life miserable for abusing you incessantly?

894
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:10,337
(Class of Lies)

895
00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:28,088
A murderer, a courtesan, and a thug.

896
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,290
I'm too ashamed to go to this school.

897
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,460
Can't I receive another punishment other than dropping out?

898
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,562
What right do you have?

899
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,199
How dare you try to negotiate?

900
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,468
Why must I just take it again?

901
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:45,105
Educated Moron came at us because of you and we almost lost everything!

902
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,440
Educated Moron? How did he know about this place?

903
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,077
I won't condone you approaching our students any longer.

904
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:53,613
We'll have to face off using what we gathered thus far.

905
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,115
Get it ready in two weeks,

906
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,817
or the branch in Busan will be canceled.

907
00:58:57,817 --> 00:58:59,686
Do you know how close I am with the CEO?

908
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:02,689
Weren't Butler Lee and Su Ah having an affair?

909
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:04,491
I warned you...

910
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:07,894
that if you run your mouth again, I won't stop with just your wrist.

911
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:10,030
It's a disgusting feeling...

912
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:12,165
being used by someone.

913
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:14,267
She said it was in that room.

914
00:59:14,267 --> 00:59:18,038
The picture of a guy going into Su Ah's home.
