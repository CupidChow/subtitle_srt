1
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:28,670
Her name, her age, her house, and her parents. Everything was fake.

2
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,835
Her existence itself was a lie.

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,075
Kim Han Su and Jung Su Ah...

4
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,445
They were from the same orphanage.

5
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,530
(Episode 6)

6
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,300
Excuse me. Do you have a class right now?

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,760
About the photo of Su Ah that was posted on the portal.

8
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,830
I'd like to talk to you if you have time.

9
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:58,025
You're sickening.

10
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,535
It gives me the chills.

11
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,680
What do you mean?

12
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:09,105
How could you say her name after doing something like that?

13
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,845
You're Han Su's lawyer.

14
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:17,285
You drove him to suicide. How could you be so shameless?

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,200
What was that?

16
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,835
Ms. Ha.

17
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,045
That's it!

18
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:09,570
I asked you.

19
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:12,635
I asked you over and over to stop!

20
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,280
So why? Why are you doing this?

21
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,280
You crazy lunatic. Get off of me!

22
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,275
It's because I just took it, right?

23
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:25,820
It's because I just took it. But not anymore.

24
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,190
So let's end this.

25
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,485
- Oh my gosh. - Byung Ho!

26
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:35,430
Calm down and put that down. Okay?

27
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:38,800
It's okay. Put that down and talk to me.

28
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,335
- I'm sure there's a way... - I'm sorry.

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,765
I should've told you back then when you came.

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,050
Now, I can't take it anymore.

31
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,320
I can take being bullied myself,

32
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:56,450
but I won't let my little sister end up like me. Then I'd...

33
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,015
Then...

34
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,555
you'll become a criminal.

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,455
Mr. Gi.

36
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,830
The moment you stab him with that,

37
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:08,530
regardless of all the abuse you suffered,

38
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,340
you'd be the assailant,

39
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,000
and he'll become the victim. Isn't that worse?

40
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,695
Then what?

41
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,240
Should I just keep taking the abuse?

42
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,840
Just holding it in until the day I die?

43
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,435
Why would you hold it in?

44
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,675
You should take it to court.

45
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:26,850
I taught you.

46
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:29,450
Saying you'll take someone to court means...

47
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,345
"I'm going to make your life miserable."

48
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,060
Byung Ho, you decide.

49
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,495
Will your life become miserable, or will you make...

50
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,825
that scumbag's life miserable for abusing you incessantly?

51
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,005
Ahn Byung Ho!

52
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,120
You said before that outside of school,

53
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,845
the weak and poor suffer.

54
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,460
Yes, that's right. That's reality.

55
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,270
But because of that, at least in school,

56
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,570
you can't be treated unfairly.

57
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,500
What you experience and feel here...

58
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,140
will change the reality you'll live in.

59
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,170
I can't do much, but I'll help you to the end.

60
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,780
I'm not perfect, but I'll do my best.

61
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,865
So that you won't suffer even more.

62
00:04:56,946 --> 00:05:00,235
I'll bully her that she'll wish to die.

63
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,235
If she kills herself, it's on you.

64
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,105
Your sister.

65
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:14,015
You jerk.

66
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,500
Mr. Gi.

67
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,965
It's okay. It's okay.

68
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,280
I put my arm in the way.

69
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,140
We can sort this out.

70
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,375
You just have to stop.

71
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:39,020
He said he'll torment my sister too.

72
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,945
If you become a criminal,

73
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,285
would your sister be happy?

74
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,755
If you truly care for her,

75
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,095
drop the cutter now.

76
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,295
Ruining their lives because they can't handle their emotions.

77
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,265
I'm sick of people like that.

78
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,525
Excuse me.

79
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,225
What is this mess?

80
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,635
Blood?

81
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,795
What happened?

82
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:54,990
What are you looking at?

83
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,615
That.

84
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,360
Hey.

85
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,155
What's that?

86
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,175
Ms. Ha.

87
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,910
So... Earlier on...

88
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,675
"Ms. Ha"?

89
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,375
Are you going to lie forever?

90
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:29,485
You must've been so amused when I visited you.

91
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,900
I said all sorts of things...

92
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,895
not knowing who you were.

93
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,400
Why did you come to our school?

94
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:41,970
To find a witness who'll tell you Su Ah had a sponsor?

95
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,740
The photos you submitted as evidence...

96
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,540
that Su Ah had a sponsor.

97
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,310
They were just like the fabricated photos of us.

98
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,880
If you hadn't faked the facts based on...

99
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,190
anonymous gossip the kids made up,

100
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,915
then Han Su...

101
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,920
He wouldn't have lied and confessed that he killed Su Ah.

102
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,790
I only did my job.

103
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:04,185
As Han Su's attorney.

104
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:09,070
No. You just wanted to win the case.

105
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,570
If you ever thought, even once,

106
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,335
what Su Ah meant to Han Su,

107
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:17,810
you'd have never done what you did.

108
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,640
Yes, I wanted to win.

109
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,735
And Han Su ruined it himself.

110
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,180
- What? - My only mistake...

111
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,220
during that whole trial...

112
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:30,490
was not knowing how stupid Han Su was.

113
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,890
If I'd known, I'd have let him admit the charge...

114
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,955
and rot in prison for a few years.

115
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:41,370
You sacrificed Su Ah so that you could win your trial.

116
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,855
Now you're blaming Han Su?

117
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,580
Where are you going?

118
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,610
I know who you are, so you're going to run away?

119
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,110
I have to go to Byung Ho.

120
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,750
He'll be really anxious now,

121
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,950
and it doesn't look like you care to see him.

122
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,290
How will you use Byung Ho then?

123
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,060
I don't need help from the likes of you,

124
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:09,390
so Byung Ho, Han Su, and Su Ah. Don't try to meddle with them.

125
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,785
I won't let you approach our students anymore.

126
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:29,835
Neither of them is of any help to us.

127
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,950
Let's use this to send them away...

128
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:35,975
and accept two new students through a parent interview.

129
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,890
It would be best to make them drop out.

130
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,830
If they refuse, we can have them expelled.

131
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,060
Will you take care of it yourself?

132
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:50,195
I have no time to waste on something like this.

133
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,570
My goodness. Look who's here.

134
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:57,195
It's Yu Beom Jin, the pride of our school.

135
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,580
How is practice for your recital going?

136
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,290
We expect a lot from you.

137
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,150
I plan to attend.

138
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:11,085
Okay...

139
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,960
Tell all the sophomore homeroom teachers to attend.

140
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,590
They can show people around...

141
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,260
and meet the parents.

142
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,860
Yes. I'll do that.

143
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,895
Were you invited?

144
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:25,740
Me?

145
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:28,910
It's a student's recital.

146
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:31,080
Do I need an invitation?

147
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,635
It's rude to attend without an invitation, whoever you are.

148
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,250
Don't force teachers to attend as if it's a school event.

149
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,845
If someone were to complain,

150
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,915
it'll be a nuisance to Tae Ra and her mother.

151
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,655
Bye.

152
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:55,995
Even the kids talk down to me now.

153
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,865
I've never seen you like that.

154
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,540
What do you mean?

155
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,250
You didn't have to say that.

156
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,335
He wasn't alone.

157
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,980
Why did you do that?

158
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,250
He looks out for us at school.

159
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,690
He'll take that much away from school.

160
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,545
From our parents.

161
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,060
Everything comes at a price.

162
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,290
- Yes, but... - I feel like a hostage...

163
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,285
whenever I see him, and I don't like it.

164
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,330
It's a rotten feeling to know someone's using you.

165
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,170
Still, you don't need Butler Lee's help.

166
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:35,010
You're already first in your year...

167
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:38,405
and you can win any award you want.

168
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,185
Do you feel nervous?

169
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,360
Don't worry.

170
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,470
No one was seriously hurt...

171
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,000
and I don't think Mr. Gi will make a fuss out of it.

172
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:07,665
I guess...

173
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,595
I'm being punished.

174
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,105
Punished?

175
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,235
For what?

176
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,105
Yes?

177
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,415
Ms. Ha, the chief administrator wants to see us all.

178
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,925
She has some instructions.

179
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,925
Okay. I'll be there.

180
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:43,940
We'll suspend both students from school.

181
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,340
Not only did one of them wield a box cutter,

182
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,435
but we can't ignore the fact that a chair was thrown out the window.

183
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,150
Call both their parents and make them...

184
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,850
pull their sons from school.

185
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,720
If they refuse, say their sons...

186
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,185
will otherwise be expelled.

187
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:04,700
Then will you not look into why this happened?

188
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,925
Why should we do that?

189
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,470
The facts are clear.

190
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:12,470
One of them threw a chair out a window...

191
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,870
and another waved a box cutter around...

192
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,910
and hurt a teacher.

193
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:20,910
Those facts alone show we can't keep either of them.

194
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,935
Isn't that obvious?

195
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:27,650
Byung Ho was assaulted and threatened in school.

196
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:29,975
By Jun Jae and others.

197
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,960
I'll talk to Byung Ho and Jun Jae...

198
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,560
and find out what happened.

199
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,830
Decide how to punish them afterwards.

200
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,900
What a dangerous thing to say.

201
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,670
Are you saying we should admit that a student...

202
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:52,280
was being bullied by a group of other students in our school?

203
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:56,075
Yes. We should, if it's true.

204
00:13:56,853 --> 00:14:00,180
Are you saying we should call all the parents over,

205
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,290
convene a committee, and brag...

206
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,720
that there was a stabbing incident in our school?

207
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,860
After we have barely managed...

208
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:10,115
to cover up the incident from the last semester?

209
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,900
Let me just get to the point.

210
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:17,940
If we just regard it as a fight between two boys,

211
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,870
it'll be better for the students.

212
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,135
It won't do any damage to the school either.

213
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,480
Then I guess we'll have to present a petition...

214
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,480
to the Education Office.

215
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:31,380
We should ask them to investigate the school violence...

216
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,315
in our school and reveal the truth.

217
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,290
What did you just say?

218
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,920
Since the school is not doing it,

219
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:41,090
I'll ask the Education Office for help.

220
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,790
If he's going to quit anyway,

221
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,700
wouldn't it be better for Byung Ho this way?

222
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,095
At least it won't be unfair for him this way.

223
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,900
Ms. Ha, can you take responsibility for what you just said now?

224
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,440
The Education Office?

225
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:56,270
How dare you threaten me like that.

226
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,010
"Threaten"?

227
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,480
I threatened you?

228
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,080
You did just now.

229
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:03,780
You said you'll present a petition to the Education Office...

230
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,650
so they investigate our school.

231
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,590
Byung Ho is the one who is being threatened.

232
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,650
He is being threatened that he should transfer to another school...

233
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,990
because he committed a crime.

234
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,990
And if what I said sounded like a threat to you,

235
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,360
I believe it's your fault, not mine.

236
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,490
What?

237
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,060
I have to leave now. I'm going to be pretty busy counselling students...

238
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,795
and writing a petition.

239
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,200
What the... Hey.

240
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,595
Ms. Ha. Hey. You stop there!

241
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:34,835
Goodness.

242
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,330
I'm sorry. The wound is burning and aching.

243
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:51,725
I think I will need to take a few days off.

244
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:54,370
You need to take a few days off for that?

245
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,370
I think I need to see a doctor.

246
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,070
Maybe it's tetanus. Should I ask for a doctor's note?

247
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:01,135
Could this be an industrial accident?

248
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,640
It looks like we have one more trouble here.

249
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:08,275
Take a day off then.

250
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,910
Seriously,

251
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,220
those young teachers...

252
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,715
seem to make a fuss over nothing.

253
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,855
Can we talk for a second?

254
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,725
Ms. Jo?

255
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,750
Sorry about that night.

256
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,075
You were just worried about me, but I was mean to you.

257
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:53,645
That's okay. You must have been frightened and flustered.

258
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,660
You're amazing, Ms. Ha.

259
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,955
And I feel bad for you too.

260
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,730
About what?

261
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:07,170
About what happened to Han Su, Byung Ho, and Jun Jae.

262
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:08,210
You always take the students' side,

263
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,365
fighting against the school and other teachers.

264
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,480
Isn't that just giving yourself a hard time?

265
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,380
It's not like you get credit for it.

266
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:21,045
You're right. It's really hard.

267
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,050
I don't even expect to get credit for it.

268
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:27,545
As long as I don't get criticized for being meddlesome, I'm happy.

269
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,590
Why are you trying so hard?

270
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,770
Honestly, Ms. Jun wasn't all wrong.

271
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,255
I'm not sure.

272
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:40,025
If there has to be a reason,

273
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,095
I guess it's because I want to take his side.

274
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,670
Take his side?

275
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,210
If I'm on the verge of being kicked out of the school...

276
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,750
and none of the teachers side with me,

277
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,545
I'll be really sad and hurt.

278
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,175
What? That's your reason?

279
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,885
I'll take your side too.

280
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,070
So feel free to talk to me...

281
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:13,340
anytime.

282
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,595
You don't have to call me out secretly like this.

283
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,350
And if I get in trouble,

284
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,105
you can take my side too.

285
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:37,155
Hey, Guard Dog will be so humiliated to come to school from now on.

286
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,000
He got seriously beaten by Porter.

287
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:45,025
Look. He must be so humiliated.

288
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:48,470
A murderer, a courtesan, and now a thug.

289
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:51,305
I'm too ashamed to go to this school.

290
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:56,180
He's become so full of himself since Kim Han Su is gone.

291
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,845
Is it because he's not under control?

292
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:02,775
Look at you getting on my nerves again.

293
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,860
Whatever the losers do, I don't care.

294
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,390
You said he's your guard dog.

295
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,755
Then you should have had him under control.

296
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:13,660
He fought with Kim Han Su and now he fought with Ahn Byung Ho?

297
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,755
Did you tell him to fight only with those who are poor?

298
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,810
I warned you.

299
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:25,810
I said if you talk rubbish one more time,

300
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,335
it won't be just your wrist that hurts.

301
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:34,990
You always become so sensitive whenever it comes to Kim Han Su.

302
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,660
Why is that? Have you gotten seriously beaten by him?

303
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,860
Watch your mouth.

304
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:42,090
Why would I be beaten up by a murderer?

305
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,460
See? You're losing it again. And you keep calling him murder.

306
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,430
He killed a person. What else should I call him?

307
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,370
Other than him, who else killed Jung Su Ah?

308
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:51,255
Butler Lee did.

309
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:58,380
Weren't Butler Lee and Su Ah having an affair?

310
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,535
It's possible that he killed her to shut her mouth.

311
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,205
And why are you suddenly curious about that?

312
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,390
Well, no reason.

313
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,390
We were talking about Kim Han Su, so...

314
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,020
We used to be friends with Su Ah once.

315
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,760
Don't you think it's not fair that we talk about her like that...

316
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,130
just based on rumors?

317
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,685
She's just a poor girl who got killed by the horrible incident.

318
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,570
"Friends"?

319
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,895
We didn't think of such a nasty girl...

320
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,725
as a friend.

321
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:32,365
Why do you always take her side whenever we talk about her?

322
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:43,075
You'd better keep your mouth shut. Or I will kill you.

323
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,755
Make sure no one comes into the band room.

324
00:20:58,941 --> 00:20:59,940
(Son Jun Jae)

325
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,495
Okay.

326
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:08,575
You will not talk about me, will you?

327
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,445
You keep your mouth shut.

328
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,200
Mr. Gi?

329
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,385
Hey, you're here.

330
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:31,155
What happened to your arm?

331
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,940
Well, it just happened.

332
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,840
Thanks to this, I have earned some time.

333
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:40,405
If this person comes to the law firm, let me know.

334
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:42,080
Who is this person?

335
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,450
The General Manager of Cheonmyung High School,

336
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:44,880
Lee Tae Seok.

337
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,220
He must be the one who asked President Lee Do Jin...

338
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,275
to defend the Kim Han Su case.

339
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,360
Lee Tae Seok?

340
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,945
What's wrong?

341
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,490
The police have contacted us earlier.

342
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:58,060
They said someone asked for compensation for the infringement...

343
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,625
of property rights on the house where Jung Su Ah was murdered.

344
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,800
The infringement of property rights? Wasn't that house empty?

345
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:04,940
Was it the construction firm?

346
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,495
No, the person you just mentioned, Lee Tae Seok, bought the house.

347
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,880
This is too obvious.

348
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,180
Does he really think it's all over?

349
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:19,120
Oh, and the son of the president you mentioned earlier,

350
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,850
visited Song Jae U's office a few days ago.

351
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,920
Lee Gi Hoon? Why would he?

352
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,960
I overheard him while leaving the office...

353
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:28,990
asking about the Kim Han Su case.

354
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:31,960
He said he wanted to get the lawsuit documents he requested.

355
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:35,330
These days, Attorney Song calls me often...

356
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,425
and asks me to join his team.

357
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:43,470
Why don't you join his team?

358
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,165
Excuse me?

359
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:46,980
Can I?

360
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:48,080
Why not?

361
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,910
Instead, ask him for a big raise.

362
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:54,005
Make sure you get all the incentives too.

363
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:03,355
What? You got busted?

364
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,730
I'm not eating this. You dirty jerk.

365
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:08,700
Does that matter now?

366
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:13,025
The person you see every day next to you now knows about you.

367
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,270
Once she snitches on you to the school, you're doomed.

368
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,740
What can I do?

369
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:21,080
I should make the best of what I have found until now.

370
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,380
But you don't have anything decisive yet.

371
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,880
Either it's a photo or a witness,

372
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,150
you need to find something that can prove...

373
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,580
that Lee Tae Seok was the sponsor.

374
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,375
I will.

375
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:34,285
First, I'll find the witness.

376
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,325
Do you see that boy on the right bottom?

377
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,525
(Son Jun Jae)

378
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,630
Follow him...

379
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:46,240
and see where he is and what he's doing.

380
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,965
How?

381
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,870
I have no idea what he's up to.

382
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:54,240
He says it's to find who killed Su Ah,

383
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,135
but do you think that's true?

384
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,080
We can't trust someone who lied about his identity,

385
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,350
but isn't it better to wait and see?

386
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,615
At least until we find out the real reason.

387
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:06,860
That's true.

388
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,655
But I can't let someone like him teach our students.

389
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,285
He even fabricated evidence that Su Ah was a courtesan.

390
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:20,795
Anyway, Su Ah's parents didn't come to her funeral, right?

391
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,380
No. Why do you ask?

392
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,410
Actually, there was a rumor that she was adopted.

393
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,350
I thought maybe that was why.

394
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:32,880
I only found out after the funeral myself.

395
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,590
She really was adopted.

396
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,150
Ms. Jo and I were at the funeral parlor the entire time,

397
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,785
but we didn't hear from them even when she was cremated.

398
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:44,015
Is that why she had a part-time job?

399
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,560
What job?

400
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,130
I only heard that it was at an entertainment agency.

401
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:51,500
But once she started there, she started wearing and carrying...

402
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,200
designer clothes, shoes, and bags.

403
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,035
You can't make that much money from a part-time job.

404
00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:00,105
Whatever. Why did she have so many secrets?

405
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,580
(Prosecutors' Office)

406
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,875
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

407
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,585
(Rightness, truth, justice, human rights, integrity)

408
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,030
You're not a prosecutor, are you?

409
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,655
I am.

410
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:22,470
Fine. If you say you are a prosecutor,

411
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:23,930
how could you request an arrest warrant...

412
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,640
and a confiscation warrant for destruction of evidence?

413
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,410
You punk. Do you think the government is omnipotent?

414
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:31,070
Do you think we can get any warrant we request?

415
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,765
I went a little overboard.

416
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,375
I apologize.

417
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,205
What?

418
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,780
However, is this something...

419
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,190
you need to call me in yourself and get angry over?

420
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:47,385
A low-level prosecutor went overboard with her warrant request.

421
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:50,030
What was that?

422
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:52,685
If you're done, I'll go now.

423
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:05,540
Ma'am. Did he chew you out?

424
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,280
Were you slammed?

425
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:09,535
It's just a small scratch.

426
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,380
I knew the warrants wouldn't go through,

427
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,490
but I didn't expect a response so quickly.

428
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,285
Seriously. You've got more guts than any prosecutor I've worked with.

429
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:24,130
Did you look into Lee Tae Seok and Cheonmyung Foundation?

430
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,555
- Let's talk as you look it over. - Okay.

431
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:29,030
The legal entity is Cheonmyung.

432
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,930
The founder is Lee Yoon Tae.

433
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:33,140
Including Cheonmyung High School,

434
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:36,470
they have five middle and high schools, three grade schools,

435
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,680
and one technical college.

436
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,480
Since Lee Yoon Tae was hospitalized due to his old age,

437
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,610
his eldest son, Lee Jung Suk,

438
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:44,050
will likely be the next foundation director.

439
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,220
The foundation owns so many schools.

440
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:49,050
Why is Lee Tae Seok just a lowly general manager?

441
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,750
You know how every family...

442
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,860
has a useless troublemaker.

443
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,490
He's the youngest. He has a brother and sister.

444
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,230
He was a troublemaker since he was young,

445
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,000
so his father wasn't fond of him.

446
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,060
He stays away intentionally, too.

447
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:03,370
He's a deadbeat that was pushed out of the group's successor.

448
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,200
He's just a deadbeat now,

449
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,670
but if he plays his cards right, he may become a big fish.

450
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:09,970
What do you mean?

451
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:13,465
He's the leading candidate to acquire Woonam University.

452
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:18,805
(Chancellor of Woonam University, Jung Jong Chul)

453
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,460
Those leaches.

454
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,860
That money was invested in developing the university,

455
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,385
but they want me to return the money before I leave.

456
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:34,725
They'd be utterly useless if not for the med school and pharmacy school.

457
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,170
They say a crab understands the woes of a lobster.

458
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:41,525
I understand how you feel, Chancellor.

459
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,410
You're leaving the school you worked all your life for.

460
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,705
I'll make sure to give you a fat severance.

461
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,075
I'd appreciate that,

462
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:58,075
but the money hasn't come in it.

463
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,620
You didn't forget, did you?

464
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:01,320
If you can't get it within two weeks,

465
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:04,115
you will no longer be the favored candidate.

466
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll have it soon.

467
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,770
Just ward off the flies for me,

468
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,200
so no one can weasel their way in.

469
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,810
Don't miss the deadline.

470
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,495
I won't be able to help then.

471
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,805
You'll be at the publication party next week, right?

472
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:25,505
Publication party? Whose?

473
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,845
Who else? Your brother.

474
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:34,520
I got a call that he's having a publication party next week.

475
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:35,690
Didn't you hear?

476
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:38,460
Well, of course I know about it.

477
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:42,295
But I'm so busy. I don't know whether I can make it.

478
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:56,110
I'll give it more attention.

479
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:57,210
Okay.

480
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:59,120
- Get it together. - Yes, sir. I will.

481
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:00,705
Good.

482
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,660
Goodnight.

483
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,585
Does he have savings for the acquisition?

484
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,930
Even if the embezzlement made it difficult to run Woonam University,

485
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:14,085
it isn't something Cheonmyung can handle.

486
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,855
Not unless they have a hidden slush fund.

487
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:21,610
I checked the flow of funds, and it's surprisingly clean.

488
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,495
Their financial structure is solid, too.

489
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,840
Based on what we found thus far,

490
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,150
there is no trace of a slush fund for the foundation.

491
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,105
That means Lee Tae Seok is doing it on his own.

492
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:35,050
Where is he getting tens of millions of dollars?

493
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,745
Well...

494
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,985
There is a place he can get money.

495
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:42,515
Here.

496
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,330
There are dozens of branches nationwide.

497
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:45,860
It has the highest sales both online and offline.

498
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,860
He owns an academy for college admission,

499
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,470
and his daughter goes to Cheonmyung High School.

500
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:51,230
She was in Jung Su Ah's class.

501
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,000
One of the parents is a high roller.

502
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,895
These are the real tycoon.

503
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,640
Yoo Yang Ki, an assemblyman in the Ministry of Education.

504
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:03,210
The CEO of Songha Law Firm, Lee Do Jin.

505
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,475
The president of Saehan Bank, Oh Kang Suk.

506
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,375
This is how many I found from my quick review.

507
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,645
So this school selects parents, not the students.

508
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,090
Get me the list.

509
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:20,200
Let's see which parents are needed to acquire Woonam University.

510
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:21,825
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:26,395
(Happy Correction, Happy People)

512
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,370
I told you before.

513
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,310
I can't show you the list of visitors.

514
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:31,840
I know, I do.

515
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:35,110
So just tell me if he is the person or not.

516
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,750
Was the person who visited him after me...

517
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,905
this student?

518
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,250
Why you...

519
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,860
We can't tell you, so stop bugging us.

520
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,260
This is all for Han Su.

521
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,330
I know you feel bad too.

522
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:53,955
A teenager inmate you were in charge of jumped from the roof.

523
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,930
He jumped because of you. Why should we feel bad?

524
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,295
You are so shameless.

525
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:02,570
It wasn't him.

526
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:05,265
- Sir! - It wasn't him.

527
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,635
He didn't look like that. I'm sure of it.

528
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:12,275
Then do you know what that visitor...

529
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,380
talked about with Han Su...

530
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:18,475
There's no way we can tell you what was discussed during a visit.

531
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:24,355
He looked very nervous.

532
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,825
He seemed nervous the entire way back to his cell after the visit.

533
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,195
That's all I can tell you.

534
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,280
Hey. Did you look into it?

535
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,840
Yes. I followed him,

536
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:43,205
and oh my gosh. He lives in the ghetto.

537
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,180
The ghetto?

538
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,780
Yes. His house is a real mess,

539
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,215
and a loan shark came by too.

540
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:53,060
His dad's business went bust...

541
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:54,960
and he fled abroad alone.

542
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:58,485
So Jun Jae and his mom are constantly being harassed.

543
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,825
- Get out. Get out now. - No!

544
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:04,830
No.

545
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,800
- Get out! - No.

546
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:09,370
Anyway, I don't know where he got it,

547
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,710
but he had a bag full of cash.

548
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:15,210
He was persistent. He never gave it up.

549
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:17,805
His family went bankrupt,

550
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,445
but he has a bag of cash and wears expensive sneakers.

551
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,550
We should dig into him.

552
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
Anyway, be careful.

553
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:29,915
He must owe the loan sharks a lot. He was carrying a knife.

554
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,255
Okay.

555
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,595
Excuse me. I need to change my destination.

556
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:53,045
Although he waved around a box cutter...

557
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:56,775
and injured a teacher...

558
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:02,615
No. I need to confirm this with that jerk first.

559
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,355
(Petition)

560
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:11,655
The indolent response of school...

561
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,595
The indolent response?

562
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,170
Cruel threats?

563
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,965
(The indolent response of school)

564
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,735
I have no experience filling one of these out.

565
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,850
Fill it out by the end of the day.

566
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,060
(Petition to Withdraw from School)

567
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,560
You're going to quit anyway.

568
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:36,685
It helps no one if you drag it out.

569
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,985
I was...

570
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:43,255
bullied by Jun Jae and Jung Tae.

571
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:47,495
They hit me every day and made me fight other kids.

572
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,065
They said they'd harass my sister if I refused.

573
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,635
I know what I did was wrong,

574
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:56,610
I did it because I couldn't take it any more.

575
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,280
Can you arrange for a penalty other than dropping out?

576
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,515
If you'll let me stay,

577
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,915
I'll do anything you want.

578
00:34:04,993 --> 00:34:07,060
You should've...

579
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:09,755
just held back.

580
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,130
This is why we shouldn't accept kids like you.

581
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,100
You don't know your place and you aren't grateful either.

582
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,400
You attend this great school for free.

583
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,595
Can't you take that much?

584
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,265
You know,

585
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,010
your tuition comes from the money those kids' parents pay.

586
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,520
You cause trouble when you should be grateful.

587
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,675
What makes you think...

588
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:38,315
you can negotiate?

589
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:42,685
Do whatever you want.

590
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,690
If you don't quit school,

591
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,100
you'll be expelled.

592
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:51,655
You know you can't even transfer if that happens, right?

593
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,805
Follow me.

594
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:14,120
How come...

595
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:16,390
What? Did you think you wouldn't have to...

596
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:18,500
pay me back if I got expelled?

597
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,225
Get your wallet.

598
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,035
Your watch too.

599
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,680
Is this it?

600
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:36,875
That's all I have.

601
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:44,790
Hey.

602
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,920
Then steal your mom's credit card...

603
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:51,615
or steal equipment from the broadcasting room and pay me.

604
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,025
Or do you want to work with me?

605
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,830
You can make more since you're a girl.

606
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,425
Well?

607
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,595
Wow. What an amazing criminal.

608
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,480
Ji Eun, get going or you'll be late for school.

609
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:11,675
I'll sort things out here.

610
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,650
Where are you going? We're not done.

611
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:18,150
Did you hide something important in the band room?

612
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,445
Something no one can take?

613
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:24,230
Let's talk without her, or do you want her to hear?

614
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:26,325
So the whole school finds out?

615
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:31,395
See you.

616
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:35,895
There's nothing. What are you playing at?

617
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:39,440
Did you think no one would find what you hid?

618
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,205
That tiny band room won't take long to search.

619
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,110
Touch it and you die.

620
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,880
Don't touch any of my things.

621
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,090
- Or I'll cut your other arm. - Okay.

622
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,220
Relax. I don't care if you take everything.

623
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:55,985
Will you just answer my question?

624
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,225
Where did you get...

625
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:02,725
the shoes you're wearing?

626
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:04,870
What?

627
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,600
They aren't yours.

628
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:10,235
Did you take it? Like the things in the band room?

should I hold back again?

634

Everyone's annoying me now.

635
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,700
Why do you want to know? What do you care?

636
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,870
What is it to you whether I took them or not?

637
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,970
Just answer my question.

638
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,580
Should I call the teacher's office?

639
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:23,510
To tell them to search the band room and find everything?

640
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,445
Darn you, scumbag.

641
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,890
- Darn it. - Isn't that unfair?

642
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:35,890
I got cut instead of you and you're attacking me again?

643
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,555

644
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:42,855
Fine.

645
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:45,625
I'll make the call.

646

What are you doing here?

652
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,855
You said nothing would happen.

653
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,755
What?

654
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,595
You just...

655
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:19,965
told me to give a message.

656
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:24,735
You said you'd stop Jun Jae from bullying me, but...

657
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,265
Why?

658

Are you sure? They're really Byung Ho's?

Yes. I took these from him.

00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:43,790
What about him? How did he have those shoes?

661
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,060
How would I know? Would he have bought them?

662
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,770
He must've stolen them.

663
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,530
If Porter stole them,

664
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:53,125
why can't I take them from him too?

665
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:56,870
Don't show up near the school again.

666
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,410
If you'll act like trash,

667
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:01,835
don't complicate things by letting me see you, okay?

668
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,485
What a jerk.

669
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,460
- Hello? - Get to the band room.

670
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,670
Right now? There'll be a roll call soon.

671
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,500
That's not the problem! They might search the band room!

672
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,365
Get there now!

673
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:32,295
Okay, I'll be there.

674
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,710
He's taking it out on me for what Porter did.

675
00:40:35,716 --> 00:40:39,345
I should stop being his friend.

676
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,780
Hey, Guard Dog's minion.

677
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:43,715
Who the heck...

678
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,620
Was that Guard Dog?

679
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,555
Where is he right now?

680
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,785
Darn that scumbag.

681
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,525
I told you to hurry!

682
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,325
What are you doing?

683
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:05,110
You always talked about Porter. Now, are you the porter?

684
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:07,480
Why did you cause trouble without my permission?

685
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:10,210
Do I have to put up with talk that I can't control my dog?

686
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,845
Watch it. Get lost.

687
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:17,175
Have you lost your mind because you dropped out of school?

688
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,160
Watch your language. I can beat you up without a problem.

689
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:22,990
Who got me in this mess?

690
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,290
- Are you crazy? - Yes, I am.

691
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:28,970
You got me involved with EM who might search this place!

692
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,470
Educated Moron? How does he know this place?

693
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:33,200
Ask him yourself.

694
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:36,065
Get lost before I hit you some more.

695
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,880
What are you doing?

696
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:44,110
Why are you here when you were suspended?

697
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:46,175
Darn it.

698
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:50,250
Hey. Where are you doing?

699
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:54,320
Educated Moron. Why is it always him?

700
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,830
Darn it.

Why did Ahn Byung Ho...

703
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:05,155
go after Kim Han Su?

704
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,335

(Noeul Orphanage)

706
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:14,105
Su Ah was adopted.

707
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,050
I'll play with that.

708

This is Yu Sun.

712
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:36,770
Did Han Su and Su Ah grow up together in this orphanage?

713
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:40,425
Yes. Until they were 10.

714
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:43,470
Why are you now...

715
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,680
asking about Yu Sun?

716
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,375
Nothing I tell you now will change anything.

717
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:54,105
Han Su is still innocent.

718
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:57,320
The trial isn't over and no verdict was given yet.

719
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,075
The relationship between Han Su and Su Ah...

720
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:03,915
can affect the verdict.

721
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,900
Please tell me...

722
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:11,555
so Han Su doesn't get framed...

723
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,525
for what he didn't do.

724
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,335
The two were...

725
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,605
very...

726
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:29,515
very close.

727
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:32,390
Whenever Yu Sun was bullied,

728
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:34,260
Han Su helped her.

729
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:36,890
She was bullied?

730
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:39,400
She was a bit different from other kids.

731
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,455
She was bold and smart.

732
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:48,025
Sometimes, even us adults were amazed by her.

Did other kids do that to you?

736
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:57,850
Let me see.

737
00:43:57,852 --> 00:43:59,320
I want to be adopted.

738
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,445
Adopt?

739
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,990
Look. I got a perfect score on every exam.

740
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,860
And I will get perfect scores in future exams too.

741
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,120
Yu Sun.

742
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:10,230
I heard kids that are older than 10 years old rarely get adopted.

743
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,430
So let me be adopted right now.

744
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:14,560
I will be a smart...

745
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:18,095
and nice daughter.

746
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:25,195
I was very surprised to hear that from the young girl.

747
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:28,105
That's how she got adopted.

748
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,335
Yes.

749
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,950
A married couple that has been failing to have a baby...

750
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:36,145
for a long time wanted to adopt a child.

751
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,475
I was glad they showed up at the right time.

752
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,885
They seemed nice too.

753
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:43,615
After they decided to adopt her,

754
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:47,060
Han Su cried a lot.

755
00:44:47,068 --> 00:44:51,155
As if he was losing his family.

756
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,635
Then you haven't seen her after that?

757
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,595
I haven't...

758
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,110
until she came to visit me...

759
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,035
two years ago.

760
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:26,965
How are you doing with your new family?

761
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,340
If there's any problem, you can tell me...

762
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:36,275
Can I talk to Han Su?

763
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:42,990
Han Su is not here now.

764
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,590
Since you left, he had a very hard time.

765
00:45:46,594 --> 00:45:49,045
He liked you very much.

766
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:53,160
After he entered middle school, he started to go astray...

767
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,500
and ran away from home very often.

768
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,870
Even I can't reach him now.

769
00:45:57,872 --> 00:46:00,525
I don't know when he will come back.

770
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,365
I should leave then.

771
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:05,140
You should leave your contact.

772
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:09,575
Then when Han Su is back, I'll hand it to him.

773
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,735
There's no need.

774
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,305
I came to see him for the last time.

775
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:17,675
Because I think I'm going to...

776
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:20,945
change a lot.

777
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:29,900
Han Su almost went to a reform school,

778
00:46:29,904 --> 00:46:32,495
but I brought him back.

779
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,965
Luckily, he got accepted in Cheonmyung High School...

780
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,765
as a minority applicant, so I was relieved,

781
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,535
but now this happened.

782
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:48,805
Under this tree,

783
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:52,075
the two used to spend much time together.

784
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:55,690
If they stayed here together,

785
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:59,455
Han Su and Yu Sun might not have ended up like this.

786

828
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:46,990
Giving him incredibly expensive sneakers...

829
00:50:46,994 --> 00:50:48,060
(Limited edition, Cheonmyung High School student)

830
00:50:48,062 --> 00:50:50,415
in return.

831
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:52,330
Goodness.

832
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:54,185
Is it Lee Tae Seok again?

833
00:50:54,535 --> 00:50:56,285
(General Manager Lee Tae Seok)

834
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,800
Did you check out the woman who met Deputy Manager Yang?

835
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,240
Yes.

836
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:06,180
She seems to belong to the entertainment agency...

837
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,205
Lee Tae Seok owns.

838
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:12,080
She's a freshman in a prestigious university.

839
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:14,580
I scared her a bit...

840
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:17,475
and she told me Su Ah was Speed Dial Zero.

841
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,015
Speed Dial Zero?

842
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:30,730
What is this?

843
00:51:30,737 --> 00:51:33,495
What's wrong with watching a movie together?

844
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:37,640
There's nothing wrong about it.

845
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,780
Once your college friends find out about this,

846
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,680
you will be pointed at,

847
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,480
and out of embarrassment and shame,

848
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:46,880
you will have to keep your head down at school all the time.

849
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:50,715
In the end, you'll have to quit the great university.

850
00:51:53,227 --> 00:51:55,045
There's nothing wrong about it.

851
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:56,890
Don't worry.

852
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:59,860
There are rules in this business.

853
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,760
We never...

854
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:05,055
mess with the snitches.

855
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:06,965
Okay?

856
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,335
You know this person, right?

857
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,305
Tell me what you know.

858
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:24,715
Then it will be over.

859
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,945
We will never have to see each other again.

860
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:30,255
Speed Dial Zero.

861
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:31,690
"Speed Dial Zero"?

862
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:33,960
She's the girl who dated the man...

863
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:36,425
whose number was saved as speed dial zero on Mr. Lee's phone.

864
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,055
What?

865
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:42,325
Jung Su Ah was a courtesan too?

866
00:52:42,442 --> 00:52:44,795
Yes, I'm sure.

867
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:50,475
This photo was on the model profile catalog.

868
00:52:56,557 --> 00:52:59,320
That means Lee Tae Seok wasn't her sponsor.

869
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:03,890
That means the man who frequented Su Ah's home was someone else.

870
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:05,590
That Speed Dial Zero.

871
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,325
Probably.

872
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:12,455
I feel like this is getting bigger and bigger.

873
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,970
The model who met Deputy Manager Yang...

874
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:16,810
said she met Speed Dial Three.

875
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:17,810
That means there's a Speed Dial One,

876
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,765
Speed Dial Two, and so on.

877
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,235
Then who is Speed Dial Zero?

878
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:32,475
Ms. Kim?

879
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:36,985
(Assistant Manager Kim)

880
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:42,970
(Assistant Manager Kim)

881
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,700
You scumbags. Why you...

882
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:47,570
Step aside, you jerks!

883
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:49,640
Do you know how close I am with the CEO?

884
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,510
I told you he isn't here. Please leave.

885
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:54,610
Get your hands off of me, punk. You're just a security rat.

886
00:53:54,615 --> 00:53:55,940
- You... - How dare you...

887
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:57,780
Get off of me, punk!

888
00:53:57,784 --> 00:53:59,580
Mr. Lee! You're in your office, right?

889
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:01,820
It's me, Lee Tae Seok! I need to talk to you!

890
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,515
Out of my way.

891
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,620
Make an appointment and come back.

892
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:08,285
If you keep causing a scene, I'll call the police.

893
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,715
Darn it!

894
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:16,825
(Assistant Manager Kim)

895
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,100
What's going on?

896
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:23,470
Aren't Lee Do Jin and Lee Tae Seok working together?

897
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:27,065
If things got sour between them, there's only one explanation.

898
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:31,035
Kim Han Su's trial and...

899
00:54:31,084 --> 00:54:32,835
Jung Su Ah.

900
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:34,620
You don't think...

901
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:36,205
Speed Dial Zero.

902
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:42,285
The girl that the son was stalking...

903
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:46,725
and the father...

(Lee Do Jin)

906
00:55:15,696 --> 00:55:18,390
Weren't Butler Lee and Su Ah having an affair?

907
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,725
It's possible that he killed her to shut her mouth.

908
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:24,355
Who was it?

909
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,570
Talk.

910
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,680
Your school's general manager was just here...

911
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,980
to meet with your father.

912
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:38,780
Butler Lee? So? Did he see him?

913
00:55:38,785 --> 00:55:41,320
No. He got kicked out.

914
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:43,620
Mr. Lee was here, but he refused to see him.

915
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:45,675
What about what I asked for?

916
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:47,190
I'm still looking.

917
00:55:47,194 --> 00:55:50,290
I still don't understand why you're worried about him.

918
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:53,500
I'm just curious. Why? Can't I be?

919
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,830
No, of course not.

920
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:59,655
Then I'll send you what we have at the firm first.

921
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:26,585
Gosh.

922
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:56,885
What...

923
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:30,430
Mom. I need a new page turner.

924
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,430
What? What are you talking about?

925
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,030
I thought Beom Jin was doing it.

926
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,130
I'm saying I want someone else, not Beom Jin.

927
00:57:38,138 --> 00:57:42,395
I feel like I'll ruin my recital if he's sitting next to me!

928
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:54,750
Keep looking!

929
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:58,320
Check the community, social media, portal sites, everything you can.

930
00:57:58,325 --> 00:58:00,360
There must be information somewhere.

931
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,820
I'm telling you, it's weird.

932
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:05,690
There's no trace of him anywhere. It's like he's a ghost.

933
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,230
Whatever! I don't know how to do it,

934
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,200
but do whatever it takes to find out. Got it?

935
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:13,055
That's the only way I can make my debut.

936
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,725
This is so annoying.

937
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:22,165
Beom Jin.

938
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:28,175
Why were you yelling on the phone? On an empty rooftop.

939
00:58:28,822 --> 00:58:31,975
No reason. It's just a friend.

940
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:35,015
Do you want my help?

941
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,115
What?

942
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:41,230
I'll help you, so tell me.

943
00:58:41,234 --> 00:58:43,525
What are you so upset about?

944

(Cheonmyung High School)

945
00:58:58,485 --> 00:59:01,875
(Lee Do Jin, father and son)

946
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:05,990
Do you really think Gi Hoon didn't know?

947
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:07,620
What? About what?

948
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,620
If Speed Dial Zero is Lee Do Jin,

949
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,630
everything that I was confused about falls into place.

950
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,630
From taking on Kim Han Su's case although we'd make no money on it,

951
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,130
to dumping everything on me as soon as it got messed up,

952
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,440
and having my law license revoked.

953
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:24,735
That's right. It all makes sense.

954
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:28,380
Gi Hoon asked a lawyer at Songha...

955
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:30,980
for the Kim Han Su and Jung Su Ah case file.

956
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,720
If by any chance he found out...

957
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,190
Su Ah was seeing his father while he was stalking her?

958
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,290
That made him question her death...

959
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:42,615
and he wanted to see the case file.

960
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:44,385
No way.

961
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,155
That would really be a soap opera.

Mr. Gi. I got huge information.

965
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:01,740
There's a picture in the photo club room...

966
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:04,580
of a man going into Su Ah's home.

967
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:06,205
A man?

968
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,750
Do you mean Lee Tae Seok?

969
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:11,850
No. They said it was someone else, not Butler Lee.

970

We should check it out tomorrow.

971

I'll fire you first from Cheonmyung High School.

You can't do that, sir. Director!
