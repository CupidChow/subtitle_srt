1
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,360
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:22,025
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:26,235
(Episode 7)

4
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,655
Where is it?

5
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,245
Why is this...

6
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,455
I smell something burning.

7
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,465
How dare you mess with me?

8
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,715
You.

9
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,285
Why were you in there?

10
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,675
Here you go.

11
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:10,000
What were you doing in the photo club room?

12
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,755
And how did the fire start?

13
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,830
I was told that it was in the room.

14
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,825
A photo of a man...

15
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,695
entering Su Ah's place.

16
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,235
A photo?

17
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,340
Are you still talking about that rumor?

18
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,640
It's not just a rumor.

19
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,950
There were dozens...

20
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:31,280
I mean, hundreds of her photos were displayed there.

21
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:34,190
As soon as I touched them, they started burning.

22
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,750
Who would do such a thing?

23
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,085
One of the students here, for sure.

24
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,315
The one who stalked Su Ah...

25
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:43,130
and framed Han Su for it.

26
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,125
"Framed"?

27
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,665
So who is that? Do you have any evidence?

28
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:56,305
I should definitely let others know...

29
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,640
who you are.

30
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:01,310
Who are you going to victimize after Su Ah?

31
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:05,220
How many students are you going to accuse without any evidence?

32
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,420
I have no reason to believe what you say.

33
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:10,585
I'll solve the problem right in front of me first.

34
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,785
Just 10 days.

35
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:19,530
Give me just 10 days.

36
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,100
I'll find and show you...

37
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,425
the evidence you can trust.

38
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,870
After that, if you still want to tell the school or the police,

39
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:30,810
go ahead.

40
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:32,375
Give me 10 days.

41
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,875
I'll figure everything out.

42
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,495
Gosh.

43
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,605
What happened? Why are you such a mess?

44
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,240
It was a trap.

45
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,880
All the photos got burned.

46
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,450
A trap? The photos got burned?

47
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,720
There's a student who knows who I am.

48
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,245
What?

49
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,425
Focus on Lee Tae Seok from now on.

50
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,295
I want to make sure if Lee Do Jin is his speed dial zero.

51
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,195
What are you going to do?

52
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
Hello.

53
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,580
Mr. Gi, aren't you coming?

54
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:47,290
What's the matter? There's time left until the morning assembly.

55
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,855
Hurry here. Ms. Jun wants all the sophomore teachers to gather.

56
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,315
Okay. I'll be right there.

57
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:58,095
Hey, don't go. Something doesn't feel right.

58
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:07,610
Gosh, this is not good.

59
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,940
It's not even half a month left...

60
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,375
until the disciplinary action revocation suit.

61
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,755
Why is this...

62
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,885
Hi, everyone.

63
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,985
Good morning.

64
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,760
What are you doing? Go to your seat.

65
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,955
Oh, okay.

66
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,540
I asked you all to gather...

67
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:21,705
because an unfortunate incident happened.

68
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:29,585
This morning, there was a small fire in the school.

69
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:34,190
Some flammable substances were left in the photo club room,

70
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,490
and they must have caught fire from a short circuit.

71
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,300
Films and photos burn up in no time...

72
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,025
as soon as they catch fire.

73
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,500
It's nothing serious.

74
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:49,635
Make sure no stupid rumors spread among students.

75
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,175
One more thing.

76
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,545
We decided to admit the fact...

77
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:02,115
that Ahn Byung Ho was being bullied.

78
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,185
He'll come back to school today.

79
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:10,025
On the other hand, we can reach neither Son Jun Jae nor his parents.

80
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,625
But he will eventually be expelled.

81
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,105
Look. He's back.

82
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,180
- Isn't that him? - What happened?

83
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,480
That's Ahn Byung Ho.

84
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,815
How can he be so shameless?

85
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,115
I can't believe him.

86
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,435
What?

87
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,735
Hey, Porter.

88
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:59,140
While you're back in school after hurting a teacher,

89
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,710
why can't poor Jun Jae come back?

90
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,510
This is tricky.

91
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,020
- Am I wrong? - You're right.

92
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,850
What is happening to this school?

93
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,015
Look at that kid's eyes. I'm too scared to...

94
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:24,795
I'm glad it worked out.

95
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,365
Thanks.

96
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,440
You all knew...

97
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:35,145
Byung Ho was being bullied by Jun Jae.

98
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,820
We're partly responsible for this situation.

99
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,615
We knew what was going on, and we just stood by and watched.

100
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:47,090
This tragedy should never be repeated in our class.

101
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:48,985
I'll work hard too.

102
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:56,125
Get ready. The first period is in another room.

103
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,165
Okay.

104
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,205
Hi.

105
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,015
Hi.

106
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,375
He is here.

107
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,835
Today, let's have some fun.

108
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,905
Now that we're back.

109
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:20,490
(A: Illegal photography, B: Victim of illegal photography)

110
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,820
Today,

111
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,715
we'll debate the illegal photography of a girl that actually happened...

112
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,885
at a high school and attracted a lot of attention.

113
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,800
A is a sophomore at a prestigious high school in Gangnam.

114
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,970
He took many secret photos of B,

115
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,465
a girl at his school, with his phone.

116
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,780
- Is he a stalker? - That's so perverted.

117
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:49,780
A, who had a crush on B, however,

118
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:53,715
never shared the photos with anyone.

119
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,360
But C, another girl at his school,

120
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,590
happened to find the photos of B on his phone...

121
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,360
and reported it to their homeroom teacher.

122
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,695
- That's good. - You should tell the teacher.

123
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
Of course.

124
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,640
So here's the first question.

125
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,670
Even though A took secret photos, he never shared them with anyone.

126
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:17,265
Is he guilty or not?

127
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,580
- Of course he is guilty. - Gosh, I can't believe it.

128
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:27,545
If you think he's guilty, go to the right. If not, go to the left.

129
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,385
Move.

130
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,595
Hey.

131
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,445
Gi Hoon.

132
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,985
Haven't you decided yet?

133
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:09,930
All photos that are taken without consent are covert photos,

134
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,155
but covert photography is not always illegal.

135
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:16,725
So what's your answer?

136
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,535
Has he lost his mind?

137
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,610
It looks like most of you think he's guilty.

138
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,910
Of course he is.

139
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,110
Now we even have a special act on photography.

140
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,720
That's right. We have to check the photos first,

141
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,450
but he's highly likely to be guilty.

142
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,120
Here comes the second quiz.

143
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,990
Before C tells her teacher about everything,

144
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,930
A deleted all the photos he had.

145
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:46,760
In other words, there's no evidence now.

146
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,030
There's no evidence?

147
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,230
Then what happens?

148
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:53,065
Is A still guilty now?

149
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,840
If you think he's guilty, go to the right.

150
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:59,440
If you think he's innocent, go to the left.

151
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,480
Is he guilty?

152
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,010
- What could be the answer? - I'm not sure.

153
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:03,110
Where should I stand?

154
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,145
I'll follow Beom Jin.

155
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:09,185
- I'm not sure, but... - There has to be evidence.

156
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,025
Beom Jin.

157
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,095
Why do you think he's innocent?

158
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:23,025
An action that can't be proved can't be a crime.

159
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,240
You're right.

160
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:26,740
It's a general principle of criminal law...

161
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,370
that trials are only conducted by evidence.

162
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,540
If he deleted all the photos,

163
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,980
it's impossible to prove A's crime.

164
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,205
What about the school regulations?

165
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,120
You said the teacher was informed.

166
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:42,090
If there's nothing they can do by law, shouldn't they at least...

167
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,550
kick him out of the school or have him transferred...

168
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,090
by the school regulations?

169
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,120
At least the school has to protect the victim.

170
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,490
That's an interesting point, but if his guilt can't be proved,

171
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,660
it will be awkward for the school to punish him too.

172
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,030
Plus, A can appeal against the punishment anytime.

173
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,995
Then what about the victim?

174
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,540
Who protects the victim?

175
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,270
If neither the law nor the school can do that...

176
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,165
Who is the victim?

177
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,750
What are you talking about? Of course it's B.

178
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,820
A watched the photos alone and then deleted.

179
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,015
How exactly did that damage B?

180
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,260
Isn't it rather bothersome to B...

181
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,560
that the school makes a fuss over it?

182
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,385
Nobody is going to see the photos anyway.

183
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,035
He has his point.

184
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,770
There's a twist here.

185
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:38,040
C, the girl who told everything to her teacher,

186
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:41,750
was actually bullying the victim, B.

187
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,280
She stole the photos from A's phone...

188
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:46,615
and spread them on the internet.

189
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,320
- Then it's C's fault. - C is the guilty one.

190
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,120
Hey, C is the worst person here.

191
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:52,120
And in the process,

192
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:55,825
it has turned out that A had secretly photographed B.

193
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,055
Now,

194
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,030
here's the last quiz.

195
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:04,500
The boy who secretly photographed B and then kept them to himself, A.

196
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:07,040
The girl who stole the photos from A's phone...

197
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,065
and spread the on the internet,

198
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:10,935
C.

199
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,880
Between the two, who committed a bigger crime...

200
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:16,245
against B?

201
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,015
I think it's C.

202
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:22,745
- Is it A? - I'm not sure.

203
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,190
If you think it's A, go to the right.

204
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:29,460
If you think it's C, go to the left.

205
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,085
You may move now.

206
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,425
Where should I go?

207
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,265
I'll go to the right.

208
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:51,845
Before I make a choice, can I ask you a question too?

209
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,020
Sure. Go ahead.

210
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:59,360
If the teacher that heard about the photos from C...

211
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,930
tries to steal A's photos...

212
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,695
to find out the truth and fails,

213
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,895
how will the teacher be punished?

214
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,510
If the photos were at A's place,

215
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,480
he'll be charged with housebreaking and attempted theft.

216
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:21,910
If the photos were at school,

217
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,610
he won't be punished...

218
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,145
because school is a public place.

219
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,245
Is that why you're so confident?

220
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,930
Look.

221
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:37,995
Hypothetically,

222
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:42,995
if A still have the original photos,

223
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,935
will the teacher come and steal the photos again?

224
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,015
I'm afraid I have to wrap it up here.

225
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:10,330
- Oh, no. - We want more, sir.

226
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:13,030
If you want to hear the answer to the last question,

227
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,695
come to me.

228
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,125
You're welcome anytime.

229
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:25,640
- Class dismissed. - Please tell us the answer.

230
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:26,810
I'm so curious.

231
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,110
I'm dying to know the answer.

232
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,615
What's the answer?

233
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,755
Sir.

234
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:41,955
Yes.

235
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:45,030
I'm sorry about your arm.

236
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:48,895
And thank you very much for helping me.

237
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,665
It's okay. I hurt myself by butting in.

238
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:57,835
By the way, can we talk?

239
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,135
Yes, sir.

240
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:23,395
Why did you want to see me on the rooftop?

241
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,535
It's nicer here than the small counseling center.

242
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,110
By the way,

243
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,875
did you get your things back from Jun Jae?

244
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:43,190
He only bullied me. He didn't take any of my things.

245
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,820
He didn't?

246
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,520
How strange.

247
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,585
He said they were your sneakers.

248
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,130
Excuse me?

249
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,930
He said he took them from you.

250
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:54,095
The sneakers he was wearing.

251
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,195
He must have lied to you.

252
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,735
You don't...

253
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:06,805
trust him, do you?

254
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,150
How can I own such expensive sneakers...

255
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,105
that are worth hundreds of dollars?

256
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,750
I didn't say they were expensive.

257
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:15,645
I just said they were sneakers.

258
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:20,720
I also wonder...

259
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,900
how you had such expensive sneakers.

260
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,355
I don't think you have bought them.

261
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,930
Did you really steal them or something?

262
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,140
No, I just got them from someone.

263
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,835
Lee Tae Seok.

264
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,835
Is it from the General Manager?

265
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,735
Is the person who gave you the sneakers...

266
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,045
and cancelled the expulsion...

267
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,945
Lee Tae Seok?

268
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,190
No. I have to go.

269
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,915
He will wake up soon.

270
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,855
Han Su.

271
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:55,985
It will be too late after he wakes up.

272
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,955
You need to confess it now to be excused.

273
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,225
Byung Ho.

274
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,770
At the meeting that day,

275
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:04,940
what did you talk about with Han Su...

276
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,465
I have to go.

277
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,915
It must be tough.

278
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,945
We have to do something about Mr. Gi.

279
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,985
"We have to do something"?

280
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,720
What do you mean?

281
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:29,190
He asked me about Kim Han Su on the first day he came to our school.

282
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:31,325
And now he brought up Su Ah.

283
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,325
He's going to make more trouble in the school.

284
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:36,770
It has finally settled...

285
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,670
and we can't let one teacher mess that up.

286
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,740
He's right. We should kick him out right away...

287
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:44,135
and keep him away from our school for good.

288
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,335
I don't think you're right.

289
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't think he was talking about Jung Su Ah.

290
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,445
Why do you think so? Do you know something?

291
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,190
Are you serious?

292
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:58,020
He was obviously talking about Jung Su Ah.

293
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,820
I told you that he asked me about Kim Han Su.

294
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,730
I'm sure he was just curious.

295
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:04,360
Don't you think you're a bit overreacting?

296
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,655
It was just a class.

297
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:07,900
What's up with you now?

298
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,630
You're the one who hates Mr. Gi the most.

299
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,940
I do hate him, but firing him is a different issue.

300
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,010
Plus, there's something I haven't received yet.

301
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,110
If you're talking about the award, you will get it.

302
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,035
The award from the German language contest.

303
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,310
You guys should stay away from him too.

304
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,845
It looks like he's very curious about Han Su and Su Ah.

305
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,585
There you go again, bossing around.

306
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:36,390
Do you think you're a good king ruling this school or something?

307
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,495
Snap out of it. You don't own this school.

308
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,940
I have never thought that way.

309
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,565
You haven't?

310
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:50,940
Good then.

311
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:53,010
Because I want to wait and see what's up with the Educated Moron.

312
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,875
I feel like things will get more interesting.

313
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,345
You're done talking, right?

314
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,765
What do you take me for?

315
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:24,235
I smile like everything's fine,

316
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,175
so you have no respect for me.

317
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:31,105
Do you really think I don't know what happened between you and Su Ah?

318
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:35,715
What do you mean? What about me and Su Ah?

319
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,485
I can't take it any longer.

320
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,890
Stay out of my life.

321
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,055
I'm going to get a new page turner.

322
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:02,375
Darn it. What do I do now?

323
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,385
You'll help me?

324
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:15,160
With what?

325
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,130
That's for you to tell me.

326
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,355
What kind of help do you need?

327
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:30,865
It's okay. It's nothing.

328
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:32,840
Thanks for the concern.

329
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,705
I'm going to head back in.

330
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,825
Maybe I should've told him.

331
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:01,965
No.

332
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,705
First...

333
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,790
Will this really work?

334
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,595
I saw it online that this will work.

335
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:29,365
What's that? What is wrong?

336
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:31,565
What are you doing?

337
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,495
- Gi Hoon. - What are you doing?

338
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,840
Were you trying to sneak in and take my picture again?

339
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,810
No. I was just...

340
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,650
I had something to tell you.

341
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,910
Why you... I caught you red-handed.

342
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,045
The temp knows everything.

343
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:48,485
What?

344
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,760
The temp knows everything about the picture of Su Ah...

345
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,460
and Butler Lee in here.

346
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,330
He's just acting dumb.

347
00:26:57,332 --> 00:26:59,360
He was asking me...

348
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:03,195
if the man in the picture with Su Ah was Lee Tae Seok.

349
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:11,065
Whom should I work with?

350
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,685
I heard you wanted to see me.

351
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,060
Yes.

352
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,290
I wondered if it was hard keeping up with the class...

353
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,725
since you were out for a few days.

354
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,195
It's okay. Beom Jin helped me.

355
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,435
I see.

356
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:44,410
Anyway, I'm glad things worked out better than I had thought.

357
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,775
You must have been very nervous.

358
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,980
Anyway, did you tell Ms. Jun...

359
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:55,145
about what happened with Jun Jae?

360
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,360
She suddenly said it was canceled, but wouldn't give me details.

361
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,055
I don't know.

362
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:05,625
I was just told to return to school.

363
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,825
I see.

364
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,965
But...

365
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,605
Yes? Go ahead. What is it?

366
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:19,205
Do you...

367
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,045
still go visit Han Su?

368
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,245
Why do you ask?

369
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:29,045
I was just wondering...

370
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:31,545
how he's doing.

371
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,485
I wonder...

372
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,085
if he can ever wake up.

373
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,265
He was moved?

374
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,970
When?

375
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,380
He was discharged about a month ago.

376
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,880
Do you know who had him moved?

377
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:57,205
That's his private information, so I can't tell you.

378
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,180
I'll tell you which hospital he went to.

379
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,045
Yes, please. Thank you.

380
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:12,995
(Donghan Hospital)

381
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,475
(Donghan Hospital)

382
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,410
How could you get into a fight? You barely started high school.

383
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:58,980
All three kids you fought are hospitalized.

384
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,440
Why did you do it?

385
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,610
The truth is...

386
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,745
Those jerks were harassing him.

387
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:09,020
They said he was annoying because he was a charity case on welfare.

388
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,490
Why would they say that?

389
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,485
He is a recipient of a basic livelihood.

390
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,425
And he was just taking it.

391
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:21,460
Even if you did it for your friend,

392
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,770
violence is never justified, Han Su.

393
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:25,665
We're not really friends.

394
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,765
It just made me feel cruddy...

395
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,035
since I'm a charity case too.

396
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,015
You.

397
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,925
Was it you?

398
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:00,135
Did you move Han Su here?

399
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:07,105
If he dies, so does the trial.

400
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,410
We were supposed to meet...

401
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,745
the day after he tried to commit suicide.

402
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,190
He said he'd tell me everything...

403
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:19,185
if I visited him after finding out how Su Ah was doing.

404
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:23,155
But he jumped that night.

405
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:27,895
Without hearing how Su Ah was doing, which he desperately wanted to know.

406
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,895
Why...

407
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,865
do you think he did that?

408
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,905
It was probably because of Lee Tae Seok.

409
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:41,435
Lee Tae Seok?

410
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,580
Do you mean the general manager?

411
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,050
The CEO of the law firm that had my law license revoked...

412
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:50,415
was hired by Lee Tae Seok...

413
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:52,160
to have Han Su found guilty...

414
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,355
and close the case quietly.

415
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,630
He's also the one who got Su Ah,

416
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,960
whom both of her parents abandoned, into Cheonmyung.

417
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:03,430
He supplied her with a home and everything she needed.

418
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:05,935
Very generously, too.

419
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:10,810
But once she started there, she started wearing and carrying...

420
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:12,735
designer clothes, shoes, and bags.

421
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:16,980
Su Ah's death and Han Su's suicide attempt.

422
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:19,620
Lee Tae Seok was behind them all.

423
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:21,580
But how...

424
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,085
He probably made it so that Han Su had no choice but to choose death.

425
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:28,490
A Cheonmyung student visited him after I left that day.

426
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,025
If...

427
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,755
that student...

428
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,255
was working with Lee Tae Seok...

429
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,965
And who was that?

430
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,975
Ahn Byung Ho from our class.

431
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:49,750
No way.

432
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:52,150
What would Byung Ho have to do with Mr. Lee?

433
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:54,820
How else can you explain why his punishment was suddenly canceled?

434
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:57,145
- That's... - I'm sure...

435
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:01,120
there's definitely something between Byung Ho and Lee Tae Seok.

436
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:02,630
We must make Byung Ho talk...

437
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,930
and tell us what he and Han Su talked about that day.

438
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:09,030
If Byung Ho gives crucial testimony against Lee Tae Seok in court,

439
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:10,470
we can win the trial...

440
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:13,035
and prove Han Su is innocent.

441
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:15,465
Then you...

442
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,305
will do whatever it takes to make Byung Ho talk,

443
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,305
as you did to Su Ah.

444
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:28,750
I'll find out...

445
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,150
whether there is really something with Mr. Lee.

446
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,120
And what he talked about with Han Su.

447
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:36,730
We don't have the time to wait for him to open up.

448
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,630
- Once Han Su wakes up... - All you care about...

449
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,830
is winning the trial,

450
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:45,295
but to me, Byung Ho is as precious as Han Su.

451
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:48,040
I won't condone a fake teacher like you...

452
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:50,065
hurting Byung Ho.

453
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,575
I'm not the one hurting him. Cheonmyung's teachers are.

454
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,750
What do you mean?

455
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:03,250
They accepted him as a charity case to look good.

456
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:04,990
They knew he was being bullied so badly he wanted to die,

457
00:34:04,993 --> 00:34:07,520
and all they cared about was their VIP students.

458
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,155
When he got in trouble, they couldn't wait to kick him out.

459
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,295
That's what the real teachers did.

460
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:19,195
It's too late to say I'm the one who is hurting Byung Ho.

461
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,595
I won't take it.

462
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:24,740
Su Ah, Byung Ho,

463
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,335
and Han Su, who is lying down before our eyes...

464
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,550
They're all products...

465
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:32,150
of monstrous Cheonmyung High School.

466
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,315
- But I'm... - Different, right?

467
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:37,385
That's why you're in the way.

468
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,160
You don't want to hurt anyone...

469
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,985
and want to do everything only in the right way.

470
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,260
Meanwhile, the people I'm dealing with...

471
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:47,555
don't hesitate to use students to cover up their sins.

472
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:53,895
10 days.

473
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,410
I'll keep my words.

474
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:59,275
But I'll do it my way.

475
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:02,905
So let's not get in each other's way.

476
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,915
(Songha Law Firm)

477
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,160
Oh, Gi Hoon.

478
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,320
Where are you going?

479
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,390
I told you to organize the materials.

480
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,790
You have to leave.

481
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:51,060
- Why? - Leave.

482
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,230
Gosh.

483
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,660
Let's go.

484
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,495
Stop it.

485
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:03,265
Father, I didn't know you were here.

486
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,050
Aren't you a lawyer?

487
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:19,390
Why do you let a kid boss you around?

488
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:23,255
There is a pile of delayed suits.

489
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,125
I'm sorry.

490
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:28,625
Follow me.

491
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:43,075
Do you call yourself a man?

492
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,605
Why aren't you over her yet?

493
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,050
- Father. - If you want to date,

494
00:36:49,057 --> 00:36:50,985
find another girl.

495
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,585
Instead of obsessing over a dead girl.

496
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:00,725
But we still don't know who really killed her.

497
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,600
Did Han Su really kill her?

498
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:06,465
What if...

499
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:14,935
Han Su killed her.

500
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,050
Certainly.

501
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:19,320
There's no doubt.

502
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,450
So stop questioning it already.

503
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,215
Understood?

504
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:28,285
Yes.

505
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:45,365
(Attorney Appointment Notification)

506
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:49,850
There were other cases that Lee Tae Seok filed than Han Su's.

507
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,650
Assault, DUI, obstruction of justice...

508
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:56,390
President Lee assigned them to Attorney Song personally.

509
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:57,420
When did it start?

510
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,860
Two years ago.

511
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,760
There were cases filed by other people...

512
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:03,030
at Cheonmyung High School and the foundation too.

513
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,290
What were they?

514
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,300
From what I found,

515
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:08,300
they were about the reinstatement of their independent position,

516
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:11,600
school violence, bribery of school inspectors, and so on.

517
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:13,400
Lee Tae Seok also referred...

518
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:15,810
the Education Ministry's administrative litigation cases...

519
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,565
and important private school foundation cases to the firm.

520
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:22,210
That's a heck of an exchange.

521
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,045
And then...

522
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,315
the tail was cut off.

523
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,790
Also, President Lee's son came to see Attorney Song again.

524
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:38,025
President Lee became furious.

525
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,695
(Cheonmyung High School)

526
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:54,840
This is no easy feat.

527
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,310
You got cut, put out a fire, and on top of all that,

528
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:58,150
you prepared the exam questions too.

529
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:00,050
This is nothing.

530
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:03,815
Someone went through more trouble than I did last night.

531
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,815
Too bad.

532
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:10,660
I don't need this anymore.

533
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,095
A prize from a fake teacher.

534
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,195
Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok.

535
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,835
This is so fun.

536
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:24,370
The temporary teacher who was getting on my nerves...

537
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,680
turns out to be an attorney who used to be under my dad.

538
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:29,280
Who gave you this absurd idea?

539
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,350
I heard you were the ace at the law firm.

540
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:33,780
Then who gave you the absurd idea...

541
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,350
to display those photos in the school?

542
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,150
From stalking to secret photography...

543
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,460
You must have been crazy in love...

544
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,125
with Jung Su Ah.

545
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,025
I displayed what?

547
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,995
There's no need to put on a show.

548
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,680
I'm not recording you or anything.

549
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:03,310
I could totally see your love for her in those pictures.

550
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,850
It's too bad that she wasn't a bit interested in you.

551
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:08,050
I'm disappointed in you.

552
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:09,850
Now that your identity has been revealed and your plan has failed,

553
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:12,015
is that how you try to feel better about yourself?

554
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,655
I'm not interested in beating you.

555
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:18,160
It's not you that killed Su Ah.

556
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,560
You're the same.

557
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:21,400
You could have revealed me way earlier,

558
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,070
but you didn't. Why?

559
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,225
Because you're curious.

560
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,595
You want to know who really killed Su Ah.

561
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:38,150
It's a cliche,

562
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,750
but there's a saying that fits us perfectly.

563
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:44,015
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

564
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,920
It's Lee Tae Seok, right?

565
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:50,985
The man in the picture with Su Ah on the student community portal.

566
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:58,025
I have a feeling that he killed Su Ah.

567
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:06,105
Yes, it's him.

568
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:09,135
I took that picture at the hotel.

569

("Capture the World", High School Photo Contest)

570
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:17,115
I just want the prize. What a hassle.

571
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,685
(Lee Gi Hoon)

572
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,595

Door closing.

34.

575
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,525
It's her.

576
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:55,020
Let me check your camera for a second.

577
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:57,085
What are you doing?

578
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:01,590
Kid, cooperate while I'm being nice.

579
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:05,455
It's theft if you take my camera away.

580
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:12,400
Fine. Let's talk outside.

581
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:14,965
- Get off me. - Let's go.

582
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:20,840
Now, give me your camera.

583
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,550
I have to check what you photographed.

584
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,905
This is a film camera, so you can't see it yet.

585
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,445
Kid, is this a joke?

586
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,085
Give me the film then. Give it to me.

587
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:37,390
This is a private place. You can't photograph here.

588
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:40,760
Gosh, I couldn't even take any photos because of you.

589
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:42,670
If you want to see my film, bring the manager.

590
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,440
I'm a customer here too, and you're getting on my nerves.

591
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,035
The manager?

592
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:50,535
The manager...

593
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:53,540
Butler Lee?

594
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,075
What?

595
00:43:57,652 --> 00:44:00,750
I'll never come back here, so just forget the whole thing.

596
00:44:00,755 --> 00:44:05,345
If we call the manager, you'll get in trouble, right?

597
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:07,855
I'll get going.

598
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,775
You still have them, right?

599
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,050
There's no way you burned all of them.

600
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:34,320
Because they're very important evidence that can prove...

601
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,585
the relationship between the two.

602
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,545
What if I have them?

603
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,585
Pass them to me.

604
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:42,560
Then I will find...

605
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,025
who the real criminal is.

606
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:49,355
You just said,

607
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,025
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

608
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:53,340
Yes, I did.

609
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,440
I heard the Persian prince who said that...

610
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,970
got his head chopped off,

611
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:59,875
betrayed by the servants he allied with.

612
00:45:01,482 --> 00:45:04,080
The enemy of your enemy is not your friend,

613
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:06,715
but another enemy.

614
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:10,820
I burned the photos...

615
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:14,955
to mess with you, as you didn't know your place and acted up.

616
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:18,485
Now my plan succeeded, I'm not interested in you any more.

617
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,665
What if your father is involved in this incident?

618
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,035
What rubbish are you talking about?

619
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:39,220
The person who asked me to defend the Kim Han Su case...

620
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,720
was President Lee Do Jin.

621
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:43,550
As soon as I revealed that Su Ah was a courtesan in court,

622
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:46,255
he even disbarred me.

623
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:47,760
Why do you think he did that?

624
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:48,890
Not sure.

625
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:52,655
Probably because he couldn't sit and watch your horrible performance.

626
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:55,755
That's possible.

627
00:45:58,205 --> 00:46:01,270
But what if Jung Su Ah wasn't a courtesan,

628
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,405
but forced to entertain people?

629
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:07,275
The people Lee Tae Seok need.

630
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,845
Who are they?

631
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,685
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

632
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,360
I told you enough. You need to find the answer yourself.

633
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:29,525
I will tell you if your answer is right or wrong.

634
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,850
She went to meet the psychologist,

635
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:48,850
but she got late because of the traffic.

636
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:50,020
What's with the pronunciation?

637
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:52,390
Her French is too poor to be a teacher.

638
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,855
Tae Ra could make a better teacher, as she studied abroad.

639
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:01,495
My ears are rotting.

640
00:47:07,942 --> 00:47:10,005
What did you just say, Tae Ra?

641
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:17,045
I said, my ears are rotting.

642
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:20,520
You're an old woman who can't even speak properly.

643
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,345
How are you supposed to teach us?

644
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,655
What?

645
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,425
What are you doing? Get off me.

646
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:39,170
Go back to your seat.

647
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:40,740
This is ridiculous.

648
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:43,805
You want to act like a teacher now?

649
00:47:43,978 --> 00:47:45,980
Don't you tell me what to do.

650
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,975
Do you want to get fired?

651
00:47:54,655 --> 00:47:57,020
You might not see me as a teacher,

652
00:47:57,024 --> 00:47:59,985
but I can't let you get away with this.

653
00:48:00,227 --> 00:48:01,290
Go back to your seat.

654
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,930
Even if I get fired today,

655
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,325
this is my class.

656
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,125
Let go of me.

657
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,300
- I said, let go! - I won't.

658
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,865
Let go!

659
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,705
Get off me!

660
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:20,680
Tae Ra, are you okay?

661
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,335
Oh, no.

662
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,445
My wrist.

663
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:38,155
(Gunyi General Hospital)

664
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:52,735
He's busy today as always.

Who is that?

00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:13,995
The chancellor of Woonam University visited me yesterday.

667
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:18,795
He asked me if I know you're planning to take over the school.

668
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,795
So?

669
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,470
Did you say you don't know me?

670
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:27,475
Did you say you don't care about that son?

671
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:32,345
Father.

672
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,080
I can do it.

673
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,590
I can take over your position and make Cheonmyung Foundation...

674
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:40,990
the best private school foundation in Korea.

675
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:42,785
What a fool.

676
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,200
You can't take over Woonam University with your passion alone.

677
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,360
I told you to stay out of trouble...

678
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:49,530
and keep the General Manager's position.

679
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:52,265
Know your place.

680
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,040
You have to give me a chance to see if I can do it.

681
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:59,210
What if I take over Woonam University?

682
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,580
Then will I qualified to take over this foundation...

683
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,610
like my brother?

684
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:04,345
You...

685
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:08,420
How dare you?

686
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,320
Why do you have to make all this fuss when Father is sick?

687
00:50:11,325 --> 00:50:13,060
Good. You stay in your place,

688
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,590
appreciating what you've already got.

689
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,360
I can never live like that.

690
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:19,360
What? How dare you...

691
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:22,060
I will take over Woonam University on my own.

692
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:24,170
Then you will have to admit...

693
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:27,435
that I'm more qualified to be the director than him.

694
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:36,750
When I become the director,

695
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,105
the first thing I'll do is to remove you from Cheonmyung High School.

696
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:42,720
It's the best high school in this country...

697
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:45,215
and it needs to be led by someone who deserves it.

698
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:48,485
Is that so?

699
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:52,925
When I become the director,

700
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,165
I will make you the General Manager of Woonam University.

701
00:50:57,204 --> 00:51:00,700
Then you will have to remember forever...

702
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:03,665
how I defeated you.

703
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,245
What?

704
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:18,115
What's up?

705
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,785
What? Tae Ra?

706
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,525
Ms. Jo.

707
00:51:29,403 --> 00:51:33,595
Don't worry. It was an accident.

708
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:44,375
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, ma'am.

709
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,550
I'm sorry. It's my bad.

710
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:49,515
Give me your hand.

711
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,690
Excuse me?

712
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,385
I said, give me your hand.

713
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,890
This hand is supposed to hold chalks,

714
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,625
but it hurt my daughter's hand.

715
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:05,365
How are you going to compensate?

716
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:08,070
Putting aside the money I spent for her recital,

717
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:12,505
the people who will be gathered there are important for her future.

718
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:16,040
It's my fault that Tae Ra got injured,

719
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,150
but she showed a poor attitude in class.

720
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:20,520
She tried to leave the classroom even if I stopped her,

721
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:22,275
so I tried to discipline...

722
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:27,215
What you have to do is to kneel down, not to make excuses.

723
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:29,090
I'm not making excuses...

724
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:32,925
How dare you bring up that witch in front of my daughter?

725
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,470
Shut your mouth and keep the secret.

726
00:52:39,473 --> 00:52:42,035
And stay out of my sight.

727
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:45,535
Stop it.

728
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,580
I know you're mad, but this is just too much.

729
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,110
Why are you looking at me?

730
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:51,450
I didn't slap her.

731
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:54,020
- You made her... - Ms. Lee.

732
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:56,015
Did I make you do that?

733
00:52:56,023 --> 00:52:57,050
No, ma'am.

734
00:52:57,057 --> 00:53:00,385
I got furious and I couldn't stand it.

735
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:03,155
I have had enough of this.

736
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,690
Do you think I'm stupid?

737
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:06,860
What did you say?

738
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:07,900
That's right.

739
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:10,770
All you have is money and no morals.

740
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,495
Why you...

741
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:16,170
You show no respect to teachers who teach your child.

742
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:18,965
I will not show you respect as well.

743
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Hey. Are you insane?

744
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,550
No.

745
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,220
If no one stops her in this situation, that'll be insane.

746
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,675
I can't just watch a colleague be insulted like this.

747
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:40,160
Calm down. You'll be overreacting again like last time.

748
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,700
What?

749
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,500
Get out of my way.

750
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:46,240
What's wrong with you? The person who was hit isn't saying anything.

751
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,195
Why you...

752
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,310
Hello, ma'am.

753
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,080
I know you must be very offended and upset,

754
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,080
but why don't you have your employees back off?

755
00:53:56,083 --> 00:54:00,020
If a fight ensues, it becomes a gang fight. That'll be big trouble.

756
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,945
Who are you?

757
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:05,750
Hello. I'm Class 2-3's assistant teacher starting this semester.

758
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:07,890
I teach German, political science, and law.

759
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:09,560
My name is Gi Kang Je.

760
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:11,590
- Political science and law? - Yes.

761
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:14,600
Is that why you're telling me what to do?

762
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:17,030
No. I would never do that. Never.

763
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:20,670
I just meant it would be a headache if things escalate.

764
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,040
We live in times...

765
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:25,835
when people talk way too much, as you know.

766
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,080
Where's Mr. Lee?

767
00:54:31,084 --> 00:54:32,580
He's coming.

768
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:34,475
Let's go to his office.

769
00:54:34,588 --> 00:54:37,085
I don't want to look at them anymore.

770
00:54:47,267 --> 00:54:49,125
Are you all right?

771
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,465
I'm sorry. I should've stopped her sooner.

772
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:02,980
How could you let a teacher...

773
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:06,320
that brought up that dirty girl in front of my Tae Ra...

774
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,620
still teach at the school?

775
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:10,720
If you had kicked her out,

776
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,755
my Tae Ra wouldn't have gotten hurt.

777
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:15,490
I'm sorry.

778
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:18,855
This happened while I was away from school.

779
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,030
I will fire Ms. Jo immediately...

780
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:25,270
and hire a replacement immediately...

781
00:55:25,272 --> 00:55:27,700
so Tae Ra won't have any problem.

782
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,670
Let's forget what we discussed...

783
00:55:29,676 --> 00:55:31,835
about the investment in Woonam University.

784
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,410
What? Ma'am.

785
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,410
I can't trust a loser who can't control his employee...

786
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,515
and invest such a large sum of money.

787
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:43,315
I don't think...

788
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,685
you were meant to run Woonam University.

789
00:55:49,863 --> 00:55:51,760
No, ma'am.

790
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,430
I... I need that money.

791
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,130
You promised...

792
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:58,130
that if I provided Tae Ra with a perfect record,

793
00:55:58,138 --> 00:55:59,670
you'd invest in Woonam.

794
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:01,365
Exactly.

795
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:05,770
It isn't perfect.

796
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,175
That settles it, doesn't it?

797
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:12,645
Ma'am.

798
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,465
Are you sure you're okay?

799
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:34,740
Shouldn't we call the police?

800
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:38,740
No. I paid for my sins, that's all.

801
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:40,575
Ms. Jo.

802
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:44,745
I'll go home. Go back in.

803
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:50,345
Thank you. I mean it.

804
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:04,130
A knife fight, a fire, and an assault of a teacher.

805
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:06,200
I'm too scared to work here.

806
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,840
The problem is money, not people.

807
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,110
At least we won't be forced to go to the recital...

808
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:12,210
given the mood.

809
00:57:12,212 --> 00:57:13,740
That's one good thing.

810
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:16,880
I got body aches after I went there last time.

811
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:17,950
Me too.

812
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:19,350
Body aches? Why?

813
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,320
Isn't that just a charity performance?

814
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:23,750
Charity? What a joke.

815
00:57:23,757 --> 00:57:26,920
It's a gathering of our school's VIP parents.

816
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:28,960
There's nowhere for us to even sit.

817
00:57:28,962 --> 00:57:31,830
We have to look after the kids and listen to the parents' complaints.

818
00:57:31,832 --> 00:57:34,230
They even make us do grunt work if they're short-staffed.

819
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:37,230
Then will Mr. Lee be unable to attend as well?

820
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:38,600
Him? Unable to attend? Never.

821
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:40,370
All the Veritas parents will be there.

822
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,370
That's right.

823
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,410
Veritas? Isn't that our school's debate club?

824
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:46,140
It isn't just a debate club.

825
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:47,980
It's our school's inner circle.

826
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,375
It's a gathering of alpha dogs.

827
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:53,880
Beom Jin is the president and Gi Hoon is the vice president.

828
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,945
That says it all.

829
00:58:04,865 --> 00:58:06,525
Look at this.

830
00:58:11,972 --> 00:58:13,170
This person...

831
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:14,240
Do you know him?

832
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,640
I saw him at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

833
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:17,940
The prosecutors' office?

834
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:21,205
Then what? Did they get a whiff of it too?

835
00:58:25,352 --> 00:58:28,150
Why are you here instead of following Lee Tae Seok?

836
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:29,550
I'm not the head of police investigators.

837
00:58:29,556 --> 00:58:31,745
I'm not following him 24 hours a day.

838
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:35,260
I planted a tracker on his car.

839
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,885
If he moves, it'll show right here.

840
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,330
That's good. Get dressed.

841
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:42,600
What? Why?

842
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,195
We have an opportunity...

843
00:58:45,372 --> 00:58:49,035
to confirm that Lee Do Jin is Speed Dial Zero.

844
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,105
(Lee Do Jin, President of Songha)

845
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:25,710
Right?

846
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:27,875
You must be so proud.

847
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,275
You look great.

848
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:34,115
Hi there.

849
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,175
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

850
00:59:37,891 --> 00:59:40,360
Everyone is fretting about.

851
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,085
The recital didn't even start.

852
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:47,230
So? Will you really do it without Mr. Lee?

853
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:49,000
You saw it last time.

854
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,025
I invited him, and he acted like the star.

855
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,440
I need to use this opportunity to teach him some manners...

856
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:56,865
if I want to keep using him next year.

857
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:57,910
Hello.

858
00:59:57,911 --> 01:00:00,135
- Hello. - Hello.

859
01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:05,550
When I become the director,

860
01:00:05,552 --> 01:00:07,220
the first thing I'll do is to remove you from Cheonmyung High School.

861
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,345
I don't think you were meant to run Woonam University.

862
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:14,220
Darn it!

863
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:15,860
You dirtbags.

864
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,685
After all I did for you!

865
01:00:22,736 --> 01:00:24,465
He's on the move.

866
01:00:27,507 --> 01:00:29,770
It's as you said. He's really coming.

867
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:31,965
(Sorae-dong)

868
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:45,645
Keep an eye on him until he arrives.

869
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:53,895
Lee Do Jin is going up.

870
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:06,035
Please put it in here. Thank you.

871
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,680
Come to the table after the recital to say hi.

872
01:01:08,682 --> 01:01:10,375
Okay.

873
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:13,975
- Hello. - Hello.

874
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:21,715
Tae Ra will do well, right?

875
01:01:33,073 --> 01:01:34,540
It's been a while,

876
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,470
both of you.

877
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:39,940
Thank you for making time in your busy schedule to come.

878
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,580
Thank you for inviting me.

879
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:44,310
I can't wait to see Tae Ra's recital.

880
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:46,045
Thank you.

881
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:48,275
Please, have a seat.

882
01:01:57,731 --> 01:02:00,385
Why did you say that to Beom Jin?

883
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:03,500
What the temp did during class...

884
01:02:03,503 --> 01:02:05,070
It's about Jung Su Ah.

885
01:02:05,071 --> 01:02:06,770
Why did you pretend to be oblivious?

886
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,240
Shouldn't we have discussed?

887
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:10,970
Did you want to announce that we're A and C?

888
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,335
That's not what I mean.

889
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:19,150
You said you had something on him.

890
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,320
You said you'd kick him out and keep him quiet.

891
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,320
Why are you going back on your words?

892
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,515
Just keep quiet for now.

893
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,615
Then I'll make sure you can make your debut.

894
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,830
Do you even know anything?

895
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,525
Can you really keep him quiet?

896
01:02:57,157 --> 01:02:59,545
This is so annoying.

897
01:03:12,906 --> 01:03:14,595
Are you okay?

898
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,310
What is it? What are you doing here?

899
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:20,335
I asked your mom...

900
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:23,105
that I want to be your page turner.

901
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,405
Let me see.

902
01:03:26,853 --> 01:03:29,715
Didn't I say I don't need you?

903
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:34,120
We've been practicing together all this time.

904
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:36,515
If you ask someone else now,

905
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:39,525
do you think you can play well?

906
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,770
Don't worry about a thing.

907
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:50,195
I'll be by your side until you finish playing.

908
01:04:09,495 --> 01:04:11,855
Lee Tae Seok arrived.

909
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,200
Let's do this well.

910
01:04:48,201 --> 01:04:50,055
We've been working hard.

911
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:53,130
Gosh.

912
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:54,795
What is this?

913
01:05:58,404 --> 01:06:00,695
Where are you even from?

914
01:06:03,443 --> 01:06:05,735
I'm from Korea, you idiot.

915
01:06:06,412 --> 01:06:08,905
Okay. It's planted.

916
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:14,475
Okay. Stand by in the lobby.

917
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:30,400
You want to abandon me after taking advantage of me?

918
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,365
Darn it! That's not going to happen.

919
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:16,880
- Who are you? You can't enter. - Move, you jerk.

920
01:07:16,883 --> 01:07:18,950
- You can't enter right now. - Are you both out of your minds?

921
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:19,950
Move!

922
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:20,980
You can't enter.

923
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:23,150
Have you lost your mind? Get lost!

924
01:07:23,156 --> 01:07:25,415
- You have to wait... - Hey!

925
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:40,935
Are you okay?

926
01:08:10,436 --> 01:08:12,470
Where is she going?

927
01:08:12,472 --> 01:08:13,800
- It's not finished yet. - What's wrong?

928
01:08:13,806 --> 01:08:15,765
What is going on?

929
01:08:17,243 --> 01:08:19,065
- My goodness. - Unbelievable.

930
01:08:31,157 --> 01:08:33,985
- How is this... - Stay seated.

931
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:38,090
If you rush out right now, it'll only make people talk more.

932
01:08:38,097 --> 01:08:40,660
So sit down and wait.

933
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:43,725
Beom Jin will calm her down. Come on.

934
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,700
- Get off me! - You can't enter.

935
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:47,940
Seriously!

936
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:50,095
Oh, my.

937
01:08:50,243 --> 01:08:54,205
There you are, our dear parents.

938
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:56,705
Hello.

939
01:08:57,016 --> 01:08:59,275
- Hello. - Mr. Lee?

940
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:01,450
What are you doing now?

941
01:09:01,454 --> 01:09:03,415
What am I doing?

942
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:07,460
I wanted to see the party thrown by the woman who messed with me.

943
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:11,255
What? Have you completely lost your mind?

944
01:09:13,032 --> 01:09:15,130
I feel hurt, President Lee.

945
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:18,300
This was the only way I could talk to you.

946
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:22,035
What is it? After cutting Yang Sang Bae off,

947
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:25,105
couldn't you bring yourself to face me?

948
01:09:26,012 --> 01:09:27,975
Will you shut it?

949
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:30,535
Who are you trying to involve me with?

950
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,345
So you want to pretend to be innocent?

951
01:09:35,521 --> 01:09:37,350
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

952
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:38,820
Assistant Prosecutor General Yang Sang Bae...

953
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:40,290
at Criminal Department Three.

954
01:09:40,293 --> 01:09:43,315
It was your order, President Lee Do Jin!

955
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:54,170
Keep it down.

956
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:56,240
If you want to save yourself.

957
01:09:56,242 --> 01:09:57,765
Exactly.

958
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,510
Why couldn't you listen when I was talking nicely?

959
01:10:00,513 --> 01:10:04,235
Why do you make me a rude person?

960
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:06,175
Gosh.

961
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:12,590
That's...

962
01:10:12,592 --> 01:10:14,560
Tell Yang Sang Bae...

963
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,555
to drop Woonam University's Chancellor's embezzlement charges.

964
01:10:18,664 --> 01:10:21,555
Also, Ms. Woo.

965
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:25,125
Make your investment right now.

966
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:27,670
Do you think my investment...

967
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:30,140
will make Woonam University yours?

968
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:31,940
Know your place.

969
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:34,535
Your dreams will only hurt you.

970
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:38,045
If I get hurt,

971
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,305
so will you two.

972
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:47,620
Hey! The prosecutor is here!

973
01:10:47,627 --> 01:10:49,215
What?

974
01:10:49,895 --> 01:10:53,455
Stop her. Stop her by all means.

975
01:11:00,873 --> 01:11:03,365
Stop her?

976
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,535
Gosh.

977
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:11,850
Darn it.

978
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,420
Hey! Watch where you're going.

979
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,920
Do you know how expensive this suit is?

980
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:17,320
You bumped into me.

981
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:18,390
What? Hold on.

982
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:21,660
I mean... Why did you have to walk in front of me?

983
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:23,760
Hold on. Wait!

984
01:11:23,763 --> 01:11:25,330
Hey! Get off me. Just a second!

985
01:11:25,331 --> 01:11:26,530
Stop! Hey!

986
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,055
Stop right there! Ma'am!

987
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:35,995
Let's talk somewhere else.

988
01:11:36,142 --> 01:11:37,695
Darn it.

989
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,035
Gi Mu Hyeok?

990
01:12:24,857 --> 01:12:26,290
What are you doing here?

991
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:27,955
You're here to arrest him, right?

992
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:29,955
Lee Tae Seok.

993
01:12:30,896 --> 01:12:33,460
Not yet. He's just the tail.

994
01:12:33,466 --> 01:12:35,600
If you arrest him now, you'll miss the head and the body.

995
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,600
Tail?

996
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,170
Why did you show up here and what are you talking about?

997
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:41,100
It was what you wanted, President Lee.

998
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:45,205
You wanted to frame Han Su for everything about Su Ah.

999
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:47,105
Get him out of the way.

1000
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:50,335
Wait. Cha Hyun Jung! Cha Hyun Jung!

1001
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:00,790
What are you up to now?

1002
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,385
Lee Tae Seok...

1003
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:05,185
was not Jung Su Ah's sponsor.

1004
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:08,795
He just used her to entertain people.

1005
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,565
Someone is behind him.

1006
01:13:12,705 --> 01:13:15,570
That's the one who killed Su Ah and framed Han Su for it.

1007
01:13:15,574 --> 01:13:18,240
Even if you arrest Lee Tae Seok now, he'll be released soon.

1008
01:13:18,244 --> 01:13:21,475
We have to find the hard evidence and the person behind him.

1009
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:28,275
Is that why you're eavesdropping? With this?

1010
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:31,815
I have to listen in to find the person behind...

1011
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:49,265
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

1012
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:07,390
Lee Tae Seok, VIP parents,

1013
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:10,760
and students. They're all tangled in a web.

1014
01:14:10,763 --> 01:14:12,630
Let's find a way together.

1015
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:13,930
I found a replacement.

1016
01:14:13,933 --> 01:14:15,800
He'll pay more attention to you.

1017
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:16,800
Gosh.

1018
01:14:16,802 --> 01:14:19,670
The temp threatened me that I wouldn't be able to debut.

1019
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:22,140
It was not a request but a warning.

1020
01:14:22,141 --> 01:14:23,840
Do you want to get exposed and kicked out?

1021
01:14:23,843 --> 01:14:26,210
Get lost right now!

1022
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,580
What? A tracker?

1023
01:14:28,581 --> 01:14:32,405
Does the government pay for you to do this useless investigation?

1024
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:35,215
What? You want to hack the phone?

1025
01:14:35,254 --> 01:14:39,145
These kids made me sneak into this school.

1026
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:41,660
What's their secret?

1027
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,390
- Gosh. - What is it?

1028
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,455
What are they hiding?
