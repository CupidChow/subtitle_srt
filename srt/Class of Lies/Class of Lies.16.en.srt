00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,269
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,638
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,782
(Final Episode)

4
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,157
Do you think you've won?

5
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,797
No.

6
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:49,966
You lost, Gi Mu Hyeok.

7
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,470
You're an attorney, but you couldn't win in court,

8
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,806
so you used the media to beat me.

9
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,974
That in itself shows you lost to me.

10
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:03,680
Who said I wanted to win?

11
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:09,820
You must only know about the law, and nothing about the real game.

12
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,824
The best attorney in this industry...

13
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,959
is someone who doesn't step foot in court.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,528
The attorney who gets...

15
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,331
what he wants without going to trial.

16
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,133
He's the best of his kind.

17
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,770
And what I want...

18
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,806
is just ending you.

19
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,275
Not winning.

20
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,046
Got that?

21
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,916
You're already finished even without going to court.

22
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,253
You can get angry,

23
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,989
but people will not act as you wish,

24
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,958
nor believe what you say, or follow you.

25
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,226
Shut it.

26
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:50,994
As much as they envied you,

27
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:54,731
they'll be excited to mock you, criticize you, and curse at you.

28
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:58,201
That's human nature. People enjoy seeing a hero fall...

29
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,737
more than seeing a hero succeed.

30
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,140
The fact that you are Yu Yang Ki's son...

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,542
will follow you until the day you die.

32
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,044
No matter what you do,

33
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,514
that will always get in your way.

34
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,817
Shut it! Shut it, you jerk!

35
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:23,026
You won't be able to decide any future ever again.

36
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,196
Because you won't be Yu Beom Jin.

37
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:29,299
You'll be the hypocrite who fooled the entire nation.

38
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,636
You'll always be the son...

39
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,572
of the sex offender and murderer, Yu Yang Ki.

40
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,507
You...

41
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,949
Until you die.

42
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,519
No.

43
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,655
It'll follow you for life.

44
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,757
What?

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,435
When you think things finally quieted down,

46
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,504
someone will dig it up all again.

47
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,839
Whenever something similar happens,

48
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,209
the media will talk about you.

49
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:15,111
You'll be stigmatized for the rest of your life...

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,682
and never be forgotten.

51
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:21,885
Until you die.

52
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,293
Darn you.

53
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,398
In that case,

54
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,236
where would you suffer more?

55
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,644
In prison or in this world?

56
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,853
Do you think you will be okay?

57
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,956
If you can't prove it's true after all this fuss,

58
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:04,027
you will lose your hard-earned license again.

59
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:09,332
Do you want to fall further down?

60
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,201
Further down...

61
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,037
than Han Su?

62
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:23,880
(Cha Hyun Jung)

63
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,018
Did you find anything?

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,953
No, it's not that.

65
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,324
Lieutenant Oh turned himself in.

66
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:36,760
Did he turn himself in?

67
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,901
He just came to the prosecutors' office...

68
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,304
and said he will say everything.

69
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:49,939
Keep him.

70
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,341
I'll be right there.

71
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,909
What are you doing?

72
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,351
How dare you touch my case.

73
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,820
I didn't touch it. He came to me, saying he'd turn himself in.

74
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,522
Don't talk back to me.

75
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,326
You were ordered to stay out...

76
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,162
of anything related to Kim Han Su and Lee Tae Seok.

77
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,030
I won't follow unreasonable orders.

78
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,600
Look at you challenging me in my face.

79
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,705
What's your plan? Are you going to push him...

80
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,707
and make him kill himself again?

81
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,309
Get out of here right now!

82
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,248
It looks like Lieutenant Oh turned himself in.

83
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:39,222
I wonder what will happen when he confesses everything he did.

84
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,861
You framed murder on a congressman and his underage son...

85
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,697
with false information.

86
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,433
You'll be the one that will end up in the fiery pit.

87
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,806
After everything that happened,

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,709
you're trying to bailout the ocean with a bucket.

89
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,011
I don't have to.

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,783
I just have to make people see somewhere else.

91
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:15,658
Fine. Do whatever you like.

92
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,161
Who will end up in the fiery pit...

93
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,563
between you and me?

94
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,899
We'll find it out in the end.

95
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,274
(Prosecutors' Office)

96
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,927
He's in the interrogation room now.

97
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,830
I'll get his statement right away,

98
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,033
prosecute him, and wrap it up.

99
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,501
Good.

100
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,638
You will have a lot to do on behalf of Yang Sang Bae.

101
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,574
You can count on me, sir.

102
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,576
I'll call you back.

103
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,547
(Aide Jung)

104
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:15,285
Get a press conference ready. Don't ask me why.

105
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,159
Lieutenant Oh's confession will let the whole world know...

106
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,795
that what Attorney Gi said...

107
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,697
was all false.

108
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:29,799
No, not like this.

109
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,136
The attorney fooled not only me,

110
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:36,639
but also the whole nation. People...

111
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,546
Get out of my house!

112
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:48,518
I don't want to have you as my child.

113
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,687
Go study abroad or do whatever you want...

114
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,189
and get out of my sight forever.

115
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,126
Do you think you can still order me around like that?

116
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:00,029
You'd better worry about the Lieutenant Oh matter.

117
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,998
- You... - I saw how he dealt with things...

118
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,666
and he didn't look reliable.

119
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,136
Don't let suspicions grow as you did at the press conference.

120
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,525
Hey!

121
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,029
Get lost.

122
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,370
Look who this is.

123
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,639
Isn't it the good old Gi Mu Hyeok...

124
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,674
whom I beat up to pieces?

125
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,476
Lieutenant Oh.

126
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:48,678
He's inside, right?

127
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,517
Is that why you came here, being all anxious?

128
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,855
Why did you have to spread false information...

129
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:01,524
about a congressman?

130
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,060
What if you lose your lawyer's license again...

131
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,796
when you barely managed to get it back?

132
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,599
Don't you think you should listen to his statement to see...

133
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,801
if what I said was false information or not?

134
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,172
Of course.

135
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:19,709
Then shall we listen to it together?

136
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,377
Let's see what he has to say.

137
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,912
Let's go.

138
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,066
You should have come to me if you wanted to turn yourself in.

139
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,068
You don't want to get confused with the address...

140
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,370
when it comes to such an important matter.

141
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,110
Let's quickly get things done.

142
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:10,893
I damaged the crime scene of Jung Su Ah's case...

143
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,896
and fabricated Kim Han Su's fingerprint.

144
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,472
I killed Lee Tae Seok too.

145
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,376
I fabricated his will and disguised his death as a suicide.

146
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,251
This is just as I expected. He's cutting off the tail.

147
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:46,629
All right. So you confessed you committed the crime.

148
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,234
Take him out.

149
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,975
Wait.

150
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,110
Get off me.

151
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,845
Just a second.

152
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,384
There's something I forgot to say.

153
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,020
All this was ordered by someone.

154
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,490
What?

155
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,160
I was only following orders.

156
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,129
From Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

157
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,104
What are you talking about?

158
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,673
Hey, cut! Cut right now!

159
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:35,445
Come on. You can't stop when his testimony isn't finished.

160
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,714
It's illegal.

161
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:42,085
It'd be such a disgrace to the prosecution.

162
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,851
Wait for me!

163
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,564
You must be very concerned.

164
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,534
Your daughter is just adorable.

165
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:33,669
And you have to leave her behind.

166
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,974
Hey.

167
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,677
I'm sure Yu Yang Ki already made you an offer.

168
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:45,348
Did he promise to take full care of your daughter's future...

169
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,685
if you took all the blame and went to prison?

170
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,458
Get lost. You're being absurd.

171
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,594
Do you think...

172
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:02,665
Yu Yang Ki will leave you alone once you go to prison?

173
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,136
You must know it from experience.

174
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,972
He gets rid of anyone...

175
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,974
who might get in the way...

176
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:13,676
of his future.

177
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,948
Think of your daughter's future.

178
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,618
What do you mean by that?

179
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,587
I'm the one who saved her.

180
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,589
And I'll keep supporting her.

181
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,291
If both of us get arrested,

182
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,259
who will take care of her future?

183
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,260
Still...

184
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,764
Didn't you promise to follow my orders no matter what?

185
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,533
Then...

186
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,735
please give me some time.

187
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,270
Let me spend a few days with my daughter...

188
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,573
What if you can't see...

189
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,008
your precious daughter ever again?

190
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,516
Congressman Yu.

191
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:56,085
I'm the one who made your daughter's heartbeat again,

192
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,387
and I can make it stop again too.

193
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:01,791
Cut the nonsense and turn yourself in right now,

194
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,060
or your daughter's life will be taken away by me,

195
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,828
who saved it in the first place.

196
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,331
(We will protect the people. We will stay with the people.)

197
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:27,316
At this rate, not only you,

198
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,518
but also your daughter will be in danger.

199
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,026
Testify that it was all ordered by Yu Yang Ki.

200
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,897
Cooperate with the investigation, and your sentence will be commuted.

201
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,466
Think carefully.

202
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,935
As long as Yu Yang Ki stays in power,

203
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:49,071
neither you nor your daughter...

204
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,207
will ever be safe.

205
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,696
It was Congressman Yu Yang Ki!

206
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:17,099
He had me fabricate the Jung Su Ah case and frame Kim Han Su.

207
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:20,336
He had me kill Lee Tae Seok and disguise it as suicide!

208
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:25,207
It was all ordered by him.

209
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,542
Understood?

210
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,547
Darn it.

211
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,316
Do you have evidence?

212
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,719
Is there any way...

213
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,422
you can prove what you just said?

214
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,857
Yes, there is a way...

215
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,326
I can prove it.

216
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,595
I recorded my last phone call with Congressman Yu.

217
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,801
He threatened me using my daughter...

218
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:55,771
and told me to take the fall for him.

219
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,985
Prosecutor Park, you did a great job.

220
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,319
Thanks.

221
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,489
Don't even dream about destroying evidence.

222
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,624
His whole testimony was recorded.

223
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,363
One more thing. All of you over there are witnesses now.

224
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,702
You little punk!

225
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:29,071
Darn it!

226
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,675
Gosh, he'll lose his voice.

227
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:47,623
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

228
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,091
Is this the place?

229
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,659
Yes, it is.

230
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:54,363
Say, should I pick the lock for you?

231
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,265
Gosh.

232
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,138
Coming.

233
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,841
Are you Mr. Choi Seung Yoon?

234
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,511
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Department Three.

235
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,380
Your home will be searched and seized...

236
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,949
for installing hidden cameras and distributing pornography.

237
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:15,618
I didn't do any of that.

238
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,653
- We're coming in. - Gosh, seriously. Wait.

239
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,458
Governmental authority. It's so cool.

240
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,261
Hey, Thimble, didn't I tell you?

241
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,431
What you do is spying, and what I do is execution.

242
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,935
"Thimble"?

243
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:36,205
Also, "spying"? How dare you...

244
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,112
It's my taste in fashion.

245
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,962
Do you recognize this man?

246
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,101
I know you do, so answer me.

247
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:06,702
I do.

248
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:10,139
Have you installed hidden cameras after being paid by this man?

249
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,577
Whether you admit it or not affects your sentence.

250
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:15,711
Have you or not?

251
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,848
Yes, I have.

252
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,983
Did you only install the cameras or did you save any footage too?

253
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,818
All I did was install the cameras.

254
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,321
My client kept the memory cards.

255
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,229
You're lying!

256
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,331
I know you're keeping it somewhere.

257
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,398
What do you mean?

258
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,734
I know exactly...

259
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,337
how perverts like him think.

260
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:45,040
I have a lot of experience with people like them.

261
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:47,877
His hard drive is clean though.

262
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,880
See? They can't find anything.

263
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,650
Do you want me to take a look?

264
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,619
- Why would you take a look? - Gosh.

265
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,121
How long will the forensics take?

266
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,357
- About a month. - What?

267
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,160
A month?

268
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,596
In that time, the trial will be over,

269
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:12,067
and the culprit will run away, I bet.

270
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,204
Hey, Thimble. You're good with computers, right?

271
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,139
Give it a try then.

272
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,614
Then...

273
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,651
why don't you ask me properly?

274
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,354
Be polite.

275
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:43,666
Please do us a favor, Mr. Thimble.

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,602
I mean Won Suk.

277
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,807
You just asked me a favor, right?

278
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,077
The South Korean prosecution just asked me a favor...

279
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,512
officially.

280
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,315
Yes, please do us a favor.

281
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,786
Sure.

282
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,354
Consider it done.

283
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,022
Good. Well then...

284
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:08,457
Hold on.

285
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,192
Please.

286
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,601
All right.

287
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,803
- Please go ahead. - Here we go.

288
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,820
These punks usually...

289
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,023
have their servers abroad to elude the police.

290
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,668
What happened? Did it work?

291
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,781
Yes.

292
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,182
Nice.

293
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:14,156
I... I really didn't watch it.

294
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,492
I had it upload onto the server automatically.

295
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:20,763
So I don't know what it is you're looking for.

296
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,631
I mean it.

297
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,168
You can find it, right?

298
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,471
Well, I'll have to try.

299
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:30,939
Okay.

300
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:33,609
More respectfully.

301
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,121
After Lieutenant Oh Ki Hwan's confession,

302
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,424
the Ministry of Justice sent the National Assembly...

303
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:50,726
a request for the arrest of Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

304
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,761
All eyes are on the National Assembly...

305
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,731
to see what they decide on, and whether it'll be a chance...

306
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,167
to clean up the National Assembly's image.

307
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,104
Cancel the press conference and everything.

308
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,472
Yes, sir.

309
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:12,114
The people are distrusting the investigation...

310
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:14,183
because of the many suspicions raised thereon.

311
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:16,852
Thus, the investigation will be...

312
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,896
How dare you betray me?

313
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:30,766
Fire that wretched lawyer...

314
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,202
and find a way to get him disbarred.

315
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:34,870
Where are you?

316
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,406
Let's talk in person.

317
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,319
That Gi Mu Hyeok.

318
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,355
You said he lost his license before...

319
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,825
for granting illegal favors and lobbying, right?

320
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:01,997
Give me everything you have on him.

321
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:06,402
And announce that everything said at the press conferences...

322
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,604
in Songha's name were false.

323
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:15,210
And if Songha represents me,

324
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:18,680
I'll let bygones be bygones and forgive you.

325
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,754
First, I need to confirm something with you.

326
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:30,426
Did you really not have a relationship with that Su Ah girl?

327
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,395
Did you really not kill her?

328
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,336
Does that matter right now?

329
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,374
If Songha is going to represent you,

330
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:48,043
you can't keep anything from me.

331
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:51,547
I don't want to be stabbed in the back by a client...

332
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,248
who hides his crimes from me.

333
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,554
If you called because you needed help,

334
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:00,756
tell me everything honestly.

335
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:03,792
Then I'll give you advice as an attorney.

336
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,068
It's true. I was seeing her.

337
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:15,771
Did you meet her through Lee Tae Seok?

338
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,374
He was...

339
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,945
set on hooking me up with a girl.

340
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:25,180
I fell for it briefly.

341
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,686
However, I did not kill her.

342
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,423
What about Lee Tae Seok?

343
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:37,960
Answer me.

344
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,930
Did you order that Lee Tae Seok be killed?

345
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:48,871
I had no choice.

346
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:53,108
If I let him live, he would've bled me dry...

347
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,011
incessantly and aggressively.

348
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,968
What's so funny?

349
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,737
Nothing.

350
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,342
I was just reminded of the warnings you gave me in the past.

351
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:31,380
"Be careful with whom you associate."

352
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,850
"Stay away from things that may cause problems."

353
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,919
There were so many.

354
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,359
But what is this?

355
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,697
You're a politician, but you didn't keep your word,

356
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,366
and are going through this humiliation.

357
00:25:57,272 --> 00:26:00,309
You've given me a lot of good advice over the years,

358
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,311
so let me return the favor.

359
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,483
Give it up.

360
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:12,688
It's over for you already.

361
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:14,923
What?

362
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,272
I'm Seoul Central District Court's prosecutor Cha Hyun Jung.

363
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,743
You are under arrest for murder-for-hire...

364
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:37,813
and violating the Special Law on Sex Trade.

365
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,015
You have the right to an attorney.

366
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,783
You have the right to remain silent.

367
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,251
Keep that in mind.

368
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:51,093
Lee Do Jin, you louse.

369
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,428
Thanks.

370
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,400
They were things I've always wanted to say to you at some point.

371
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:00,502
Thanks for giving me the opportunity.

372
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,238
You should find yourself a lawyer right away.

373
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,140
Our law firm...

374
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:07,676
will not represent you.

375
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,256
The National Assembly consented to Congressman Yu Yang Ki's arrest.

376
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:25,160
Prosecution Services was able to beat the odds...

377
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,096
and receive the National Assembly's consent and arrest Congressman Yu...

378
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:30,298
for murder-for-hire and sex trafficking...

379
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,734
because of the confession by Lieutenant Oh,

380
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,103
who described the crimes committed...

381
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,471
- by Congressman Yu. - How...

382
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:37,873
Lieutenant Oh asserts...

383
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,975
- How could this happen? - that Congressman Yu...

384
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:43,311
wanted to hide his relationship with the victim J,

385
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:44,880
and thus...

386
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,150
contaminated the crime scene and ordered...

387
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,119
the murder of Lee Tae Seok, her high school's general manager.

388
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:54,790
A murder charge against an active Congressman...

389
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,564
Son, run away. Quickly.

390
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,000
They arrested your dad.

391
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:07,502
You can't get arrested too.

392
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:11,373
I... I won't let that happen.

393
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,277
Please, get it together.

394
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,250
I will not run away.

395
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:27,355
I can put everything perfectly back to the way it was before.

396
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,758
For good.

397
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,537
- Hey. - Did you hear?

398
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:45,674
- Did you hear the news? - It's him?

399
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:48,276
- No way. - It's real.

400
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:50,512
It was him all along.

401
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,749
Can you believe that?

402
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,985
- I know, right? - It's insane.

403
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,057
Yes, I just can't believe it.

404
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:04,826
Are you following Su Ah's trial?

405
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,997
- Of course. - Everyone's talking about it.

406
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:16,605
- What's going to happen? - I don't know.

407
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:20,075
Guys, can we talk for a minute?

408
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:29,985
Ms. Ha! Is everything Mr. Gi said at the press conference...

409
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:31,219
true?

410
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,722
He's a lawyer. A lawyer.

411
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:35,824
So? He's the same person.

412
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,493
Yes,

413
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:40,462
it's all true.

414
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,499
I'm sure all of you saw and heard,

415
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,102
but terrible things which never should've happened, happened.

416
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:50,205
Mr. Gi tried to set them right.

417
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:55,243
Although he had to deceive you in the process,

418
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,280
he had no choice if he wanted to uncover the truth.

419
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:03,351
And it's my fault that I didn't tell you although I knew it.

420
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,659
As your teacher,

421
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,296
I offer my sincere apology.

422
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,932
I'm sorry.

423
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:26,708
It's okay.

424
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:33,315
If it weren't for that attorney...

425
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:36,985
I mean, that teacher,

426
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,487
we wouldn't have known how horrible Yu Beom Jin is...

427
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,489
and would've been fooled by him.

428
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:42,657
- Right. - He's right.

429
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:44,392
He's the one who really fooled us.

430
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:45,794
- Right. - Gosh.

431
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:47,028
Just thinking about it give me the chills.

432
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,496
Right. It does.

433
00:30:48,496 --> 00:30:50,131
- He was wrong. - He did wrong really bad.

434
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:52,167
- Right. - He's the one at fault.

435
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,170
Thank you for understanding.

436
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:59,074
I and other teachers will do our best...

437
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,743
to bring the school back to normal.

438
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,112
So you should help us too.

439
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,981
And...

440
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:09,217
let's all keep our eyes on the truth that will be revealed...

441
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,187
during Han Su's trial.

442
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,925
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

443
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:27,969
(Court)

444
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,639
(2nd trial of the Kim Han Su murder case)

445
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,875
Han Su should...

446
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,411
be freed today, right?

447
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,281
Don't worry about that.

448
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,984
With everything we have found and Lieutenant Oh's statement,

449
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,687
he will definitely be acquitted.

450
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,890
The problem is Yu Beom Jin.

451
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,726
We need to prove that he killed Su Ah.

452
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:54,396
Don't you think we don't have enough evidence?

453
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:05,573
I would like to have Congressman Yu Yang Ki as a witness.

454
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:07,242
(Judge)

455
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:09,878
Does the prosecution agree?

456
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:12,948
(Prosecution)

457
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:15,283
Yes.

458
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:21,056
(Witness)

459
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:23,758
Is it true...

460
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:27,495
that you ordered Lieutenant Oh, the officer in charge,

461
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:31,399
to fabricate the crime scene?

462
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:35,637
(Witness)

463
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:41,843
(Counsel, witness)

464
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,580
Yes.

465
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:49,517
- Really? - It was fabricated?

466
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,656
Is it also true...

467
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:57,859
that you ordered Lieutenant Oh to kill Lee Tae Seok,

468
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,595
the general manager of Cheonmyung High School,

469
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,163
and disguise it as suicide?

470
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,300
(Witness)

471
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,940
Yes, it's true.

472
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,650
Now let me ask.

473
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:27,455
Why did you give such orders?

474
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,427
To cover up my child's crime...

475
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,963
as a father.

476
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,664
When you said "my child",

477
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:38,933
are you referring to Yu Beom Jin?

478
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,602
Yes.

479
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,538
When I found out that my son killed the victim,

480
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,540
I ordered Lieutenant Oh...

481
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,344
to fabricate the crime scene to cover my son's crime.

482
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:51,813
Oh, my goodness.

483
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:55,483
This is unbelievable.

484
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,592
Order in the court!

485
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:07,295
Be quiet, or you will be ordered to leave.

486
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:14,936
What was your relationship with the victim?

487
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,705
I...

488
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,176
was the victim's guardian.

489
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,345
I didn't tell anyone about it,

490
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:29,050
but I financially supported and took care of the poor girl.

491
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,352
But...

492
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,122
my son misunderstood that...

493
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:37,492
and did such a horrible thing.

494
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,633
This is all because of me,

495
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,635
who tried to cover up...

496
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:50,538
my son's crime with inappropriate paternal love.

497
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:52,507
However,

498
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,843
I did all that...

499
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:57,011
to protect...

500
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,214
my son, Beom Jin.

501
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:04,786
- What? - What's going on?

502
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,823
- It's him. - Yu Beom Jin is here.

503
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:13,294
- What's going on? - He can't come here.

504
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,630
You can't come in.

505
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,774
Everything my father said about me...

506
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,043
is all a lie.

507
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,813
- What? - What is he saying?

508
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:40,655
I'll be a witness.

509
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,326
I'll reveal the truth...

510
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:47,462
and prove my innocence.

511
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,999
- What? - What's going on?

512
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:57,572
- He said it's not true. - I'm confused.

513
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,040
I request...

514
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,743
that Yu Beom Jin be selected as a witness.

515
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:06,181
The witness testified he committed the crime because of his son.

516
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:09,851
So Yu Beom Jin has the right to make his position clear...

517
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,085
as a witness.

518
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,821
(Judge)

519
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:17,258
Sustained. He is selected as a witness.

520
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,964
(Counsel, witness)

521
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,936
Who is right? The father or the son?

522
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,512
You said...

523
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,481
everything your father said about you...

524
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:42,784
was a lie.

525
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,920
Yes, I did.

526
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,825
Then on the day of the incident, May 3, 2019,

527
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,994
where were you and what were you doing?

528
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,729
I was watching a movie...

529
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,198
with my girlfriend.

530
00:36:57,565 --> 00:37:00,568
Did you really sit through the whole movie?

531
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,237
Did you never leave your seat?

532
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:04,205
No.

533
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,241
I didn't leave my seat...

534
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,043
once.

535
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,248
Can you prove it?

536
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:21,990
The girl who watched the movie with the witness...

537
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,260
jumped to her death from a building.

538
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,262
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

539
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:28,796
Let me ask you again.

540
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:32,233
Can you prove...

541
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,969
that you have never left your seat...

542
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,071
and sat through the whole movie?

543
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,349
Attorney.

544
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:54,689
The investigative agency is in charge of proving alibis.

545
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,991
The witness doesn't have to answer the question.

546
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:00,628
Are you going to frame an innocent person...

547
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,699
without any evidence again?

548
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:11,072
Do you have any idea how much I'm suffering...

549
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,708
because of all the ridiculous rumors you have spread?

550
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:16,377
Please stop harassing people with groundless rumors.

551
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:18,146
On that day,

552
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,550
I didn't go to Su Ah's place...

553
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:25,653
nor did I meet her.

554
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,661
Who is telling the truth?

555
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:39,334
Attorney, do you have any further questions?

556
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:44,972
No, Your Honor.

557
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:47,175
The witness is excused.

558
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:49,777
The witness may leave the court.

559
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:52,814
- Goodness, what's going on? - What is going on?

560
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:54,782
I don't understand.

561
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:57,218
- Is he really the criminal? - Is this it?

562
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,320
I have the evidence.

563
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,491
- Evidence? - He has the evidence?

564
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:13,901
I have a video clip that will prove that the witness' testimony...

565
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,503
was all an absolute lie.

566
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:22,276
Your Honor, may I play...

567
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,580
this video in this courtroom?

568
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,350
(Court)

569
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,387
I'll allow it. Let's check the video.

570
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,104
You said...

571
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,573
you were not with the victim...

572
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,076
when the incident happened.

573
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:06,120
This was filmed on May 3, 2019, at 8:17pm,

574
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:10,491
10 minutes before the victim was stabbed with a knife.

575
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,206
(Judge)

576
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,681
- What's going on? - He was there.

577
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,518
What is he doing there?

578
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:47,762
My goodness.

579
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,530
I can't believe it.

580
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,022
Why are you here?

581
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,524
I have something to tell you.

582
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:21,362
About you and my father's relationship.

583
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:33,541
How...

584
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,276
did you know...

585
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:37,011
Does that really matter?

586
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,514
What's important is that I know.

587
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,287
Who else knows...

588
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,856
that you're seeing my father?

589
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,234
No one...

590
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,937
except me.

591
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:06,407
You're lying.

592
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,277
Someone else knows.

593
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,850
General Manager Lee Tae Seok.

594
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,620
What?

595
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,290
Did you think I wouldn't know?

596
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:30,264
I won't tell anyone as long as I can be free...

597
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:32,033
That's just what you say.

598
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,468
I know you're going to use it against my father.

599
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:39,774
Like this.

600
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,958
Defense attorney.

601
00:42:57,925 --> 00:43:00,394
Does the footage end here?

602
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:01,762
Yes.

603
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:05,299
As you can see, the witness destroyed the camera,

604
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,268
so there is no more footage.

605
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:12,106
This can only show that the witness committed perjury.

606
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:15,676
But it does not prove that he stabbed the victim.

607
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,414
I am aware of that.

608
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,750
However, this footage...

609
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,755
reveals that the witness was blatantly lying...

610
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:32,126
when he pleaded his innocence in this court.

611
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,537
You're right. We can't prove his crime with this.

612
00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:46,307
It does not show him stabbing Su Ah,

613
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:47,942
so it's not valid evidence.

614
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,078
Still, once we reveal this footage,

615
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:56,984
people will believe that Su Ah was killed by Beom Jin.

616
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,226
In the past,

617
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:08,062
I believed...

618
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:11,132
winning mattered more than the truth.

619
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,067
However,

620
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,904
I realized something while preparing for this trial.

621
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:19,140
What's truly valuable...

622
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:22,076
than winning, is finding the truth...

623
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,813
of a case.

624
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,917
Who's the real culprit that killed Su Ah...

625
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,621
and framed Han Su for it?

626
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:38,325
I ask you to decide what the truth is.

627
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,231
I sincerely hope...

628
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:48,469
that everyone in this court felt the same thing as I did.

629
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,544
- Unbelievable. - Goodness.

630
00:45:10,725 --> 00:45:13,728
(Ministry of Justice)

631
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,372
Let's take a break.

632
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:40,121
You dirty rat.

633
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:44,391
How could you mess around with a girl as young as your child?

634
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,965
What's wrong with you? How insolent.

635
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:57,571
You idiot. Do you think you're still a congressman?

636
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,675
You'll rot in prison for the rest of your life.

637
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,848
Thanks to you, I won't be bored for the time being.

638
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,619
Let's do this.

639
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,155
Mr. Ex-Congressman.

640
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:20,628
Guys, shall we give him a little taste?

641
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:22,062
That sounds good.

642
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,233
Guard!

643
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:28,202
Guard!

644
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,204
Guard!

645
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:43,611
Tell me.

646
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:46,447
What were you going to do with this?

647
00:47:48,983 --> 00:47:50,417
Were you going...

648
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:52,620
to blackmail my father if he didn't let you go?

649
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,221
Is that why you hid it?

650
00:47:55,656 --> 00:47:56,991
No.

651
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:58,759
I really didn't know...

652
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,161
Fine, I get you.

653
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,198
I'd do the same.

654
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,568
And I do know...

655
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,372
you wouldn't tell anyone about the relationship for now.

656
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:13,807
But will you...

657
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:19,346
really be able to keep the secret all your life?

658
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,949
I'm ashamed of it myself.

659
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,252
I'll never tell anyone about it.

660
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,056
For now, I guess.

661
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:33,894
You're young, beautiful‚ and full of potential.

662
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:36,630
Of course, you'd be ashamed to talk about it.

663
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:40,200
You're scared the stigma will ruin your whole life.

664
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:42,736
But with time,

665
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,239
you'll feel less and less ashamed.

666
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,975
You'll only feel resentment.

667
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,347
That's human nature.

668
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:12,199
I want to trust you.

669
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,168
However,

670
00:49:14,268 --> 00:49:16,036
I don't have assurance...

671
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:18,372
that you'll keep the secret 20 years from now.

672
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:27,448
Let's end it all here.

673
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,321
Don't do something you'll regret.

674
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:12,226
If you stop now, I'll pretend none of this happened.

675
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,961
You, your dad, everything.

676
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:15,796
I want to believe you.

677
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:17,998
I mean it.

678
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,435
To be honest, I don't want to commit murder.

679
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,803
Beom Jin.

680
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:30,544
But you know as well...

681
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,714
that killing you right now...

682
00:50:34,148 --> 00:50:36,283
is the best option for me.

683
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:41,388
You've become too big of a burden for me.

684
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:44,224
You understand, right?

685
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:20,094
What are you looking at?

686
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:22,129
What's his deal?

687
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:24,465
What is he doing?

688
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:25,866
What is it?

689
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,135
He must be crazy.

690
00:51:35,943 --> 00:51:37,478
What?

691
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,247
Are you not done with me yet?

692
00:51:40,414 --> 00:51:41,782
What is it?

693
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,419
Am I doing much better than you expected?

694
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:47,521
Are you disappointed?

695
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,428
You poor thing.

696
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:57,865
Do you still think you're perfect?

697
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,803
Look at yourself flailing around in quicksand.

698
00:52:03,837 --> 00:52:05,239
What do you think?

699
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,875
Stop talking garbage.

700
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,511
I'm innocent!

701
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,448
That's right.

702
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:17,451
You have...

703
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:19,253
no friends nor family.

704
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:22,789
Who will listen to and believe what you say anymore?

705
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,160
You made it that way.

706
00:52:29,263 --> 00:52:30,564
Are you happy?

707
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,466
Darn you.

708
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:35,769
Shut your trap before I kill you.

709
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:41,175
That's so you.

710
00:52:48,782 --> 00:52:51,818
These were from the security video showing you...

711
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:54,087
enter the building where you killed Tae Ra.

712
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:03,163
I will find the evidence...

713
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:07,434
that Tae Ra did not commit suicide,

714
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:10,604
but was murdered by you.

715
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:15,142
Just wait...

716
00:53:15,742 --> 00:53:17,377
in your world of torment.

717
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:29,323
I...

718
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,326
can't...

719
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,261
lose like this.

720
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:36,430
I'll make it perfect like before.

721
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:38,799
Why you...

722
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:44,404
Darn it.

723
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:02,189
- Is he okay? - Darn it.

724
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,178
Oh my gosh.

725
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:26,980
No.

726
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:29,449
- Are you okay? - What's wrong with him?

727
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,771
Han Su.

728
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:10,650
Thank you...

729
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:12,753
for coming back.

730
00:56:15,255 --> 00:56:16,690
And...

731
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,194
I'm really sorry.

732
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,370
It's okay. We're friends.

733
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,673
Just help me readjust being back in school.

734
00:56:36,343 --> 00:56:39,112
Help me with my studies too.

735
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,250
Okay. I'll do that.

736
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:50,090
Han Su.

737
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:12,012
I'm sorry...

738
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:17,083
for everything involving Su Ah.

739
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:24,724
You should...

740
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,195
ask Su Ah for forgiveness,

741
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:30,130
not me.

742
00:57:30,797 --> 00:57:32,666
Go and apologize to her yourself.

743
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:37,571
I'm sure she'd want to hear it directly from you.

744
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,311
How'd you do?

745
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:45,312
I don't know.

746
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:47,914
- I didn't finish it. - We're done.

747
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,449
Whatever.

748
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,653
Let's go.

749
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:26,253
Ye Ri.

750
00:58:27,554 --> 00:58:29,389
Hi, Yun Ah.

751
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:31,892
Aren't you going to class?

752
00:58:38,198 --> 00:58:41,801
You can't become a singer anymore, so you should study hard.

753
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:55,148
Come on. The others went already.

754
00:58:57,684 --> 00:59:00,287
Okay. I'm coming.

755
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:14,334
(Chief Administrator Jun Young Hye)

756
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:19,873
(Chief Administrator Jun Young Hye)

757
01:00:28,074 --> 01:00:30,944
This place finally feels like a school.

758
01:00:32,312 --> 01:00:33,480
The Veritas...

759
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,449
and the people who tampered with the student records are gone now.

760
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:41,554
Our students will finally be able to compete fairly.

761
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:45,492
I'm not sure. Will that really be possible?

762
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:48,628
It's still easier for rich kids...

763
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:50,330
to win credentials.

764
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,500
I think things will get better.

765
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,236
Both we and the students are working hard.

766
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:01,574
Let's do this.

767
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:07,247
Oh, right. About Mr. Gi...

768
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:09,349
I mean...

769
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:11,718
What will happen to Attorney Gi?

770
01:01:26,299 --> 01:01:29,669
You all know the finals are next week, right?

771
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:32,072
- Oh, no. - I hate it.

772
01:01:32,072 --> 01:01:35,075
There's nothing you can do about it. You'll be seniors soon.

773
01:01:35,475 --> 01:01:37,744
Study hard for the exams, okay?

774
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:38,845
- Okay. - Okay.

775
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:42,048
Ms. Ha, it feels so weird to hear you say that.

776
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:44,884
He's right.

777
01:01:45,485 --> 01:01:49,622
Before we wrap up, let me introduce someone to you.

778
01:01:50,557 --> 01:01:53,493
Whenever you experience trouble in your school life,

779
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,895
he'll help you as much as he can.

780
01:01:56,663 --> 01:01:57,797
Come in.

781
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,767
- What's going on? - Who is it?

782
01:02:03,069 --> 01:02:04,571
- What? - Mr. Gi?

783
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:06,806
- Isn't that Mr. Gi? - No way.

784
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:07,974
- Mr. Gi? - Unbelievable.

785
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,710
- Is he back? - What's going on?

786
01:02:12,378 --> 01:02:15,815
- What is he doing here? - Why is he here?

787
01:02:16,616 --> 01:02:18,118
I can't believe it.

788
01:02:18,118 --> 01:02:20,286
- Mr. Gi is back. - I don't think so.

789
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:23,323
- No way. - It's him.

790
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,924
It's Mr. Gi.

791
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:27,026
Can you take off your sunglasses when you're in the classroom?

792
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:28,595
I think it's him.

793
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:30,797
- It's Mr. Gi. - It's him.

794
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:32,265
It's been a while.

795
01:02:32,632 --> 01:02:34,067
I feel shy.

796
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:40,406
- It's him! - Unbelievable.

797
01:02:42,308 --> 01:02:45,345
- What's going on? - Is he back?

798
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:51,251
Nice to see you all again. It's been a while.

799
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:57,423
I'll be a consulting attorney for you guys and the school.

800
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,025
I'm the temporary teacher...

801
01:03:00,627 --> 01:03:02,061
That came out wrong.

802
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:05,865
I'm Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok.

803
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:07,834
Let's do this, guys.

804
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:11,871
- What did he say? - An attorney?

805
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:16,643
Welcome back, Mr. Gi.

806
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:20,380
- Welcome back. - Welcome back.

807
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:32,759
What are you doing?

808
01:04:02,522 --> 01:04:07,160
I'm Applicant Number 138, Park Won Suk.

809
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,229
(Interviewer)

810
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:11,931
- Next. - Wait, sir.

811
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:15,068
Dear interviewers.

812
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,669
Aren't you going to ask me anything?

813
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:18,638
Take that thimble off first.

814
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,673
You don't have the right attitude.

815
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,175
You said I could wear anything.

816
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:23,676
Next.

817
01:04:27,046 --> 01:04:30,917
I'm Applicant Number 139, Gi In Don.

818
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:33,653
With your credentials,

819
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:36,289
you wouldn't need to work as an intern here.

820
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,725
Why did you apply here?

821
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:41,160
Exactly. Shouldn't you apply for a position...

822
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,763
where you can use your experience?

823
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:49,936
Before answering your question, may I drink some tea first?

824
01:04:58,945 --> 01:05:00,346
Gosh.

825
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:04,384
There's something I must do at this company.

826
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:20,833
Thank you...

827
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,835
For watching Class of Lies so far.

828
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,370
- Thank you. - Thank you.
