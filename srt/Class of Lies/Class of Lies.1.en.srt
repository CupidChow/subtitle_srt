What the heck?

168
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,390
Ta-da!

169

Aren't you relieved?

170
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,605
There would've been no turning back if this were real.

171

This country is known for IT.

173
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:55,275
It was so easy to copy the website.

174
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:57,500
You...

175
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,240
Hey! Are you really a lawyer?

176
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,970
How could you scam?

177
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,040
You're doomed now. You know that?

178

Aigoo, aigoo!

179
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,380
Don't be so upset!

180
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,280
You tricked my client with the fine print first.

181
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,820
I just did the same thing to you.

182

If you still can't accept it,

183
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,890
I'll go ahead and post the petition then.

- I won't walk you out. - Bye!

191
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,195
It was an ethics violation!

192
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,050
Not only that he stole my client,

193
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,420
he scammed them using the popular sentiment law.

194
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,690
He violated the attorney law.

195
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,160
He should be punished!

196
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,290
Since when defending incapable lawyers...

197
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,960
was part of the attorney law?

198
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,700
Enough is enough.

199
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,500
The only ethic lawyers need to follow is...

200
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,670
to work for their clients' benefit.

201
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,740
You almost lost Yongdory then.

202
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,970
But I stopped that.

203
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:09,355

204

Sir!

207
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:19,320
Instead, you'll give 20% of the fee to Attorney Song.

208
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,050
That's not a bad deal, is it?

Of course not, I should help him.

Alright.

Don't you think 20% is too much?

221

Yes.

335
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,060
But if you visit her late at night,

336
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,000
wouldn't her parents have said something?

337
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:49,315
Soo Ah lives alone.

338
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,140
Her parents are abroad.

339
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:53,515
Alone?

340
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,540
So you two were...

341
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:58,985
alone at her house without her parents' supervision?

342
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,820
According to the police's investigation report,

343
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:09,065
the victim was stabbed in the abdomen and...

344
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,705
was unconscious.

345
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,330
I promised her...

346
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:21,145
to meet her then.

347
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,130
But...

348
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,470
But she was already stabbed when you arrived?

349
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,485
She was unconscious too?

350
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,455
Yes.

351
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,165
Just do seven years.

352
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:44,590
- What? - Even an attempted murder can...

353
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:47,520
get you a lifetime or a death sentence based on the nature of the crime.

354
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,660
Insisting that you were in a relationship with the victim

355
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,730
doesn't help to prove your innocence either.

356
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:55,430
Actually, it would worsen things.

357
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,470
Most of the crimes against women are

358
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,985
committed by their significant others.

359
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,740
Did you even hear what I was saying?

360
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,410
I said I didn't do it.

361
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,320
It's not about whether you did it or not.

362
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,120
What's important is...

363
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:16,095
whether the judge can relate to your story.

364
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,820
And you...

365
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,960
technically aren't a minor.

366
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,260
You were born in 2000.

367
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:24,605
You're 20 years old. Not protected by the juvenile law.

368
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:28,200
But it doesn't mean that we're hopeless.

369
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,240
If you admit to the assault and insist that you didn't mean to kill her...

370
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,200
we could reduce the sentence to seven years.

371
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,210
And if I do my best...

372
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,785
- we could reduce it even more...- I thought you were a lawyer.

373
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,840
I thought you were going to fight for me.

374
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,950
Shouldn't you believe me no matter what I say...

375
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,950
and what other people say about me?

376
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:47,365
What if I believed you?

377
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:51,035
Would you become not guilty if I did?

378
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,165
I'd definitely believe you then.

379
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,430
If you don't want to waste your youth in jail...

380
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,730
you'd better follow my lead.

381
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,770
If you do, I'll make sure...

382
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,645
you spend your 20s outside of jail.

383
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:30,730
Aigoo, what's the point of making a deal with the prosecution?

384
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,260
The defendant won't listen to me.

385
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,130
He's an orphan and from an orphanage.

386
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:39,270
He got suspended by the school for an assault too.

387
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,455
You're a big problem. Seriously.

388
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,225
Come on in.

389
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:52,280
It's the edits the law firm sent regarding Yongdory's copyright.

390
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,420
I sent them one page and they sent back an encyclopedia.

391
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,760
Attorney Song sent the case file too.

392
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,790
Do you want it?

393
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,360
- You can shred that.- Yes.

394
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,430
Please look into the defendant of this case.

395
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,060
His relationship with the victim...

396
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,930
and his classmates.

397
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:08,700
What he likes and what he doesn't like.

398
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:11,970
Whether he has any weaknesses or stories he can't tell.

399
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,970
- Got it. - Right. Also...

400
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,010
Please do a background check on the prosecutor too.

401
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:19,780
It's important to know what school he went to and stuff like that.

402
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:21,580
Figure out whether he's my senior or junior.

403
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,680
He apparently is your classmate.

404
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:24,980
The same school as well.

405
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,320
It'd be easier to talk to him then.

406
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,250
- What's his name?- Prosecutor Cha Hyun Jung.

407
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,305
Criminal investigation department of the District Prosecutors' Office.

408
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,805
Cha Hyun Jung?

409
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:36,675
[ Deputy Chief Prosecutor Yang Sang Bae ]

410
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:47,440
Why are you taking so long to prosecute?

411
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:50,870
Just give him a 10-year sentence and wrap it up.

412
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:53,980
Join me at the special force and work on big cases.

413
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm not done with the investigation yet.

414
00:23:57,252 --> 00:24:00,650
Don't you know how things are these days?

415
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,450
The police do the investigation...

416
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,120
and we do the prosecution.

417
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,660
If the police asked you to prosecute...

418
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:08,690
you should respect that and proceed with it.

419
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,260
It's not that great of a case. Why hold on to it?

420
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:14,770
There are other things to further investigate including the motive.

421
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,745
I'll proceed in my own pace since it was assigned to me.

422
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:29,010
Geez, what an idiot...

423
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:31,925
Why was it assigned to her anyway?

424
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,390
Prosecutor Cha.

425
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,920
Are you having more ice?

426
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,230
I know how stressed you are, but...

427
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,800
you might ruin your teeth.

428
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,400
My dentist will take care of my teeth.

429
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,270
Did you get the witness for Jung Soo Ah's case?

430
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:52,340
The thing is... I couldn't do it.

431
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:55,770
Their parents won't agree to it since they're minors.

432
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:59,525
Also, that school is known for high security too.

433
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,910
So I...

434
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:08,520
got the written testimonies from Kim Han Soo's classmates.

435
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:12,320
Aigoo, it was so hard to get those few pages.

436
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:13,420
[ Written testimonies for Kim Han Soo's case ]What did they say?

437
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,190
Could you summarize it for me?

438
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:18,300
Kim Han Soo is the most problematic student in the school

439
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,070
and he's been constantly stalking Jung Soo Ah, a popular model student.

440
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,770
That clears things up. Thank you.

441
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,700
Don't mention it.

442
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:27,500
It's all thanks to my ability.

443
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,770
This explains the motive.

444
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,480
A problem student stalked her, went into her house, and stabbed her.

445
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:34,340
Yes.

446
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:36,950
Also, Kim Han Soo's lawyer is...

447
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,980
someone from Songha Law Firm, apparently.

448
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:41,435
Songha?

449
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:45,990
They're known for only representing wealthy and powerful people.

450
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:48,390
Am I missing something about the defendant's background?

451
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:49,930
There's no way.

452
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:51,730
He basically has no background.

453
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:53,030
Who's the lawyer?

454
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:54,870
It's Attorney Ki Moo Hyeok.

455
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,830
- Ki Moo Hyeok?- Yes.

456
00:25:56,838 --> 00:26:00,640
He's apparently the ace lawyer at Songha Law Firm.

457
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,140
Ace my foot.

458
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,610
He's a scam artist.

459
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:06,280
He's a scam artist with a lawyer's license.

460
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:08,255
Hello!

461
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,920
Aigoo, the legal circle in this country is so small, isn't it?

462
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,620
Hello.

463
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,520
Good to see you again.

464
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:19,460
Ice Witch, Prosecutor Cha Hyun Jung.

465
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:23,130
What made you take on this case? It's not worth any money.

466
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:24,830
What do you mean?

467
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,770
It's a rewarding case where I could save a boy with a bright future.

468
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,670
I guess a cold-blooded person like you...

469
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,000
wouldn't understand a sense of reward like that.

470
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,140
A sense of reward?

471
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,140
You?

472
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,255
Did you even wet your lips before you lied?

473
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,850
Why would I wet my lips?

474
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,425
I have this nice thing.

475
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:50,420
I'll leave you two alone then.

476
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,405
Yes, thank you.

477
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,460
Did you hear that?

478
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:03,600
You'll ask for a 10-year sentence. We'll reduce it moderately.

479
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:05,070
We'll end it there without a rematch.

480
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,940
A rematch?

481
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:10,210
Of course. A dog isn't a dog if he stops eating poop.

482
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,440
Yes, it's Deputy Yang who's feeding us poop.

483
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:16,780
We're both eating poop. Let's not fight each other too much.

484
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,050
Feel free to eat it as much as you want.

485
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,620
He stalked her and planned it. 10 years isn't enough.

486
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:23,450
At least double that. 20 years.

487
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,960
Let's not get so emotional.

488
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:28,830
He's not a minor, but he's still a high school student.

489
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,730
He's an orphan, who deserves a lot of pity.

490
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,030
And you say 20 years?

491
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:35,700
Don't get too excited. Even 10 years is too much.

492
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:38,415
Do you want to be humiliated again like three years ago?

493
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,780
Whether the sentence is excessive or not

494
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:47,710
isn't up to you or me.

495
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,950
If you're that confident, insist in court.

496
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:52,450

He sat on top of her and...

635

649
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,280

00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,065
That's all.

662
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:01,790
Defense, would you like to continue?

663
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,475
Yes.

664
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:11,970
Before I start, I apologize to everyone in this court

665
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:15,385
as the defense attorney.

666
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,940
The defendant who's sitting right here...

667
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:25,450
almost committed perjury just now.

668
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,380
Since he's not done testifying...

669
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,350
I'd like to clarify things as his attorney.

670
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,090
What's he trying to pull?

671
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,360
I'd like to clarify that the defendant's relationship with...

672
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:39,630
the victim is based on his opinion and memories.

673
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,800
The defendant considered the victim as his girlfriend,

674
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:46,140
but I recognize that the victim might think differently.

675
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,710
Are you playing word games in court right now?

676
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,940
No way.

677
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:52,640
I'm just trying to establish the truth.

678
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:55,880
If you insist that he's a stalker...

679
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:58,550
That's fine. I acknowledge that too.

680
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,480
But before I do...

681
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:04,165
there's something I need to reveal in the court today.

682
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,260
What? What?

683
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,005
What is that?

684
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,855
There's something I need to reveal in the court today.

685
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,450
What? What?

686
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,165
What is that?

687
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,105
Jung Soo Ah?

688
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:01,940
Victim Jung Soo Ah has been getting paid by men for dates.

689
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:04,950
In other words, she's been...

690
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:06,965
working as a prostitute.

691
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:12,960
Your Honor.

692
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,790
The defense is making things up right now.

693
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:19,160
No, I'm trying to figure out the truth based on facts.

694
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,660
Let's hear him out.

695
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,000
Defense, you may continue.

696
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,430
Thank you.

697
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:25,230
Victim Jung Soo Ah...

698
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,900
is known as a model student, but...

699
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,640
there's a hidden side of her.

700
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:35,450
Such as having a private meeting with a man at a hotel.

701
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,125
My goodness...

702
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:43,220
Of course, this doesn't make Soo Ah less of a victim.

703
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:46,420
Regardless of her character, we still need to find the culprit.

704
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:48,560
And they need to be punished.

705
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:52,700
But is the one who needs to be punished...

706
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,275
really the defendant who's sitting here?

707
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,640
The victim's house where the crime took place

708
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,615
isn't a normal apartment we know of.

709
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:10,950
It'd be more appropriate to call it...

710
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:13,425
a luxury townhouse.

711
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,590
There was a CCTV, but...

712
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:19,920
the tenants wanted to protect their privacy.

713
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,860
It was for real-time surveillance.

714
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:23,690
So nothing was recorded.

715
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:27,530
I'm sure the prosecution is aware of that too.

716
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:30,815
But I guess you weren't aware of this.

717
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,800
The footage is unrelated to this case.

718
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:04,300
Defense, was it recorded on the day of the crime?

719
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:05,100
No.

720
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,340
But you can't say it's unrelated.

721
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:10,310
This proves that there were men...

722
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,010
visiting the victim's house.

723
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:13,510
Who was the victim...

724
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:17,125
planning to meet at her house on the day of the crime?

725
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:20,050
The defendant who's sitting right here?

726
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:22,820
Would she have volunteered to let a stalker...

727
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:25,290
into her house?

728
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,860
That doesn't make sense, does it?

729
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:28,460
As you can see...

730
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:32,230
the victim has been having secret meetings with countless men

731
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,160
inside and outside her house.

732
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:35,700
It's highly likely that...

733
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:38,745
the real culprit is one of them.

734
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:43,840
"Proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is required for conviction."

735
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:46,240
It's stated in the Criminal Procedure Law.

736
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,780
According to that...

737
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:50,450
the prosecution should immediately withdraw the indictment

738
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,780
and restart the investigation from the beginning.

739
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:56,790
Who was the victim meeting in her house?

740
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,390
What was their purpose of the visit?

741
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:00,890
Was there only one or more? How long and how frequent?

742
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:02,760
We should figure that out and find the real culprit...

743
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:05,105
Shut up!

744
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:08,905
What is he doing?

745
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,600
I... I did everything.

746
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:12,870
It was me!

747
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:15,115
I stabbed Soo Ah!

748
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,710
It's a lie. It's all a lie!

749
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:20,440
What do you know about Soo Ah?

750
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:22,110
You don't know anything!

751
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:24,110
It was me! I did it!

752
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:25,920
I did everything!

753
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,220
Let go! Let go!

754
00:43:28,222 --> 00:43:29,720
Let go of me!

755
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:31,495
Let go!

756
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,055
How's your neck?

757
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:57,310
It's okay.

758
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:00,520
I'll schedule the next trial and let you know.

759
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:04,190
It'd be difficult to put the defendant back in court.

760
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,020
That works for me.

761
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:07,620
Works for me too.

762
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:10,960
Also, come to a consensus and settle down.

763
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:16,275
I won't allow something like this in my trials anymore.

764
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:28,480
It's too late to worry about that now.

765
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:31,025
He already wet his pants out of anger.

766
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:37,120
Forget acquittal. Focus on reducing the sentence.

767
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,520
You never know.

768
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:41,705
She might lessen his sentence since he admitted the crime.

769
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,610
You crazy bastard.

770
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,280
I tried to get you acquitted. How dare you throw a fit in court.

771
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:04,010
Why didn't you just punch me? That would've been more entertaining.

772
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:05,720
Did you want to rot in jail that much?

773
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,850
Good job.

774
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:09,750
Everyone in court witnessed how violent and...

775
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:12,395
emotionally unstable you are!

776
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,700
It was our chance to make them focus on prostitution instead of you.

777
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:23,200
And you ruined everything. Understand?

778
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:25,115
I never asked you to do that.

779
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,600
- What?- You planned all that on your own.

780
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:30,870
You didn't do that for me.

781
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:33,285
You shouldn't have messed with Soo Ah.

782
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,810
You don't know how tough her life is.

783
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,695
You ruined everything!

784
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,320
You're insane.

785
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,835
You weren't a stalker, but a follower.

786
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:51,575
You knew that she had sponsors, didn't you?

787
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,945
Why didn't you tell me then?

788
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,415
And you expect me to...

789
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,300
believe what you have to say?

790
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:04,255
No one would believe that stupid lie.

791
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,840
What?

792
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,455
You think it's unfair?

793
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:11,750
Did you even try to do something then?

794
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:15,520
The prosecution is trying their best to prove that you're guilty, but...

795
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,850
what did you do to prove your innocence?

796
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,460
You strangled me in court instead.

797
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,260
You lied to me and covered up the facts.

798
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:26,205
- And all you do is whine!- Stop!

799
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:34,200
You have nice parents and...

800
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,940
haven't suffered your whole life.

801
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:39,155
You're a privileged lawyer!

802
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,055
Do you even know...

803
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,595
how much I suffer?

804
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,425
Can you even imagine?

805
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:56,035
What?

806
00:46:57,031 --> 00:47:00,445
- Do you think I'm funny?- I can't believe what you're saying.

807
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:04,870
Did I look that privileged to you?

808
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:07,515
I grew up in an orphanage like you.

809
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:09,810
What?

810
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,810
My parents died when I was eight.

811
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:16,155
Hit by a drunk driver on the wrong lane and died together.

812
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:19,550
I got expelled from high school too.

813
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:22,280
I got into a fight with a senior who was mugging a classmate.

814
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:25,465
I was framed for everything, and I flipped out.

815
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:28,505
Just like what you did in court today.

816
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,330
That's why I became a lawyer too.

817
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,105
Because I'd be able to defend myself

818
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,915
if something bad happens to me.

819
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,310
Not all orphans...

820
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,210
give up everything in life.

821
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:48,640
It's too s***ty.

822
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:50,880
You only have one life.

823
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:53,325
You can't die a victim.

824
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:59,565
She wanted to be free.

825
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,475
That's what Soo Ah told me.

826
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:08,945
She said she wants to be free now.

827
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,130
What does that mean?

828
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,640

Please confirm that first.

What's Soo Ah's condition right now?

- Can she wake up or...- Which is it?

834
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:31,735
What condition does she have to be in for you to tell the truth?

835
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:35,465
Should she be recovering?

836
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,645
Or not being able to wake up?

Please find that out first.

Yes, sir. I'm at the detention center.

I'll be right there.

848

You insisted that he's not guilty?

849
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,470
I told you to reduce his sentence.

850
00:49:56,477 --> 00:50:00,010
But you revealed a dirty scandal instead?

851
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:02,540
The prosecutor demanded a 20-year sentence first.

852
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:04,510
Kim Han Soo insisted that he's not guilty...

853
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:06,150
I gave you that case because...

854
00:50:06,153 --> 00:50:08,795
I thought you could handle that easily.

855
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,560
He admitted to the crime.

856
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,320
Finish it up during the next trial.

857
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:18,030
Don't worry about reducing his sentence.

858
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:20,830
I can still win the case. If I give up now...

Our client is Chunmyung Foundation.

863
00:50:34,048 --> 00:50:36,195
It's not Kim Han Soo.

864
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,450
It's not something you should worry about.

What's going on?

871

He's been having a stomachache for a while.

872
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,440
It must be an appendix if it's the lower right side.

873
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:05,355
Please call 911.

Look how much he's sweating.

875
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:32,300
Looking at his symptoms, I think it's acute appendicitis.

We need to do an ultrasound test to be sure.

The police found out that Kim, the prime suspect of attempted murder of a high school student,

Why is it my fault that he jumped off a building?

Why do I have to be suspended?

Who are you kidding?

993
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:00,620
You don't think I know you?

994
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,220
Why are you trying to be all sentimental all of a sudden?

995
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:04,550
Yes.

996
00:59:04,558 --> 00:59:07,490
I understand why you don't believe me. But...

997
00:59:07,494 --> 00:59:09,890
let's think about it with our feelings set aside.

998
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:12,690
There are a lot of strange things about this case.

999
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:14,175
You acknowledge that too, right?

1000
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:19,300
I've been thinking for the past few days.

1001
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,540
Why is CEO Lee Do Jin doing this to me?

1002
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:24,110
If it's not for loyalty or justice...

1003
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,210
I was the one who was best at satisfying him.

1004
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:28,940
Not only that he suspended me,

1005
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:30,480
but he also contacted my VIP clients.

1006
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,095
He left me all alone.

1007
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,065
Why do you think that is?

1008
00:59:35,922 --> 00:59:37,520
What did I stumble upon that

1009
00:59:37,524 --> 00:59:39,995
he's dragging me down like this?

1010
00:59:45,131 --> 00:59:46,945
It was empty.

1011
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:51,145
The townhouse Jung Soo Ah was living in.

1012
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:53,745
Empty?

1013
00:59:54,874 --> 00:59:57,410
She lived in an apartment nobody owns?

1014
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,010
It has an owner.

1015
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,880
Since the construction company owns it.

1016
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,840
The apartment Jung Soo Ah was living in was...

1017
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,595
never for lease to begin with.

1018
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,950
So...

1019
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:12,320
a high school student lived alone in a luxury townhouse

1020
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:14,790
owned by a construction company?

1021
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:17,730
And there were men who frequented that place.

1022
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:20,130
The more I hear about it, the weirder it sounds.

1023
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:21,960
Why can't we keep investigating?

1024
01:00:21,968 --> 01:00:23,770
Because Kim Han Soo confessed.

1025
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:26,045
He confessed in court himself.

1026
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:30,540
The photos and videos with unknown sources

1027
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,055
aren't enough to prove the prostitution.

1028
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:36,280
And one more thing.

1029
01:00:36,282 --> 01:00:39,750
This might not be related to the case.

1030
01:00:39,753 --> 01:00:41,920
Lee Ki Hoon.

1031
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:46,590
Your law firm CEO's son attends the same school as Jung Soo Ah.

1032
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:50,260
He wrote a written testimony that Kim Han Soo stalked Soo Ah.

1033
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:53,230
I don't think it's a coincidence that Kim Han Soo's case

1034
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:56,330
was handed to you and

1035
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:58,370
is Jung Soo Ah's classmate.

1036
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,415
If what you say is true.

1037
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,885
Yes, this is Cha Hyun Jung.

1038
01:01:11,785 --> 01:01:14,925
Yes, got it. I'll call you back.

1039
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:19,450
What is it?

1040
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:22,735
It's from the hospital Soo Ah's at.

1041
01:01:27,634 --> 01:01:30,000
He just became a murder suspect.

1042
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:31,845
Kim Han Soo.

1043
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,290
Ms. Jo.

1044
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,990
- Are you okay?- I'm okay.

1045
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:58,575
I need to be here. She was my student.

1046
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:02,360
Thank you for keeping me company.

1047
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:04,170
Don't mention it.

1048
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,415
My student was involved too.

1049
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:14,580
Soo Ah lives alone.

1050
01:02:14,581 --> 01:02:16,655
Her parents are abroad.

1051
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:31,005
Your name is?

1052
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,130
Please say Kim Han Soo.

1053
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:41,145
I'm here on his behalf.

1054
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,950
You'll sleep well tonight since Jung Soo Ah died.

1055
01:02:56,956 --> 01:02:58,450
What? Do you want to die too?

1056
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,705
What? You want to kill me too?

1057
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:23,755
You'll sleep well tonight since Jung Soo Ah died.

1058
01:03:25,785 --> 01:03:27,195
Hey!

1059
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,335
[ Mr. Temporary ]

1060
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:56,710
You won't get caught.

1061
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:58,650
It's a pefect copy.

1062
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:01,020
I have great eyesight and sense of justice.

1063
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,350
You almost got arrested for assault.

1064
01:04:03,356 --> 01:04:06,090
Let's work together as the homeroom teacher and the assistant homeroom teacher.

1065
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,090
How did you become a teacher anyway?

1066
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,460
A temporary teacher to be specific.

1067
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:11,130
They're dummies.

1068
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,960
They're supposed to be on top in the country.

1069
01:04:12,966 --> 01:04:15,330
The trial is suspended until he can...

1070
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:17,000
make decisions himself.

1071
01:04:17,003 --> 01:04:19,300
I'm saying there might be evidence.

1072
01:04:19,305 --> 01:04:20,470
You want to end up like Han Soo?

1073
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:22,100
No, I won't!

1074
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,040
Try it if you can. Try it!

1075
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:25,610
Wait for me.

1076
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,925
I'll make sure they won't sleep at night.
