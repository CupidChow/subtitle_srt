Yes.

Yes. That's exactly it.

6
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:35,710
They have to give in.

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,780
How nice would it have been if they had done this sooner?

8
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,305
They wasted my precious time.

9
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:56,000
Father, please stay healthy

10
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,855
Gosh, why is that idiot so stuck-up?

11
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,005
This is Lee Tae Seok.

12
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,230
Yes. Thank you.

13
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,655
I'll come to you right now.

14
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,825
Okay.

15
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:36,555
Yes!

18
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,845
Thank you for calling.

19
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,955
What...

20
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,055
What was that?

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,325
Who's there?

22
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,120
Know your place.

23
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,905
Who do you think you are?

24
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,390
First, you bug me and follow me,

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,115
and now, you come to me yourself?

26
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:40,110
Come at me! Come in, you jerk!

27
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,055
Let's put an end to this today!

28
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,645
Gi Hoon?

29
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:02,830
What are you doing here?

30
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,445
Why did you do it?

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,770
You must be doing this because of what happened that night.

32
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,140
Darn it. It's okay!

33
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:19,440
I made up with your father, so put that down.

34
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,765
Why did you do that to Su Ah?

35
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,250
What?

36
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:26,790
If you didn't make her do that, nothing would've happened.

37
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,990
If you had just left her alone,

38
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,375
no one would've gotten hurt.

39
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,855
Why are you suddenly playing the blame game?

40
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,940
You tried to make her yours and failed,

41
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,995
so you became her stalker taking pictures secretly.

42
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:56,235
What? Did you think I didn't know?

43
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,805
You punk.

44
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,990
That awesome dad of yours...

45
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,620
came here and begged like mad...

46
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,445
to make sure his precious son's record isn't tarnished.

47
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,015
You punk.

48
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,500
It isn't me.

49
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,070
You're the one holding your dad back!

50
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,410
Got that? You punk.

51
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,540
Now that you know,

52
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:25,940
shut your mouth and go to school diligently.

53
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,010
Darn it. Mr. Lee...

54
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,250
couldn't keep his son under control and created this mess.

55
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:34,275
Why you!

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,600
Darn it. You jerk.

57
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:51,555
Die.

58
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,340
You brat.

59
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:57,440
You have no respect for your elders. What? Butler Lee?

60
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,680
Did you think I didn't know, you punk?

61
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:03,705
Die.

62
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,235
Get over here, punk.

63
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:15,445
If it weren't for your father... You're a lucky punk.

64
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:18,615
You lucked out with good parents, you rude punk.

65
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey. Scram. Got it?

66
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:28,295
If you barge in here again, I'll really kill you. Got that?

67
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,435
You punk.

68
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,120
- Gosh. - Mu Hyeok.

69
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,820
Are you sure no one is here?

70
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,050
What's with you?

71
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,905
All the lights are off.

72
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,875
Today was the last exam day, so everyone has left. Come.

73
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,265
What are you doing? Come on.

74
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,565
Gosh.

75
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,050
What? What's wrong?

76
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,435
Hold on.

77
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,045
What is it?

78
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,515
What?

79
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,965
Lee Tae Seok?

80
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,415
Come in.

81
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,425
We have to open his safe.

82
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,900
Hey!

83
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,940
Are you crazy? Does the safe really matter right now?

84
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,625
We came all the way here.

85
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,895
Do you want to go back after just seeing a corpse?

86
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,365
We have to check his safe.

87
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,635
Come right in.

88
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,535
This is driving me crazy.

89
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,275
I am sincerely sorry, Father.

90
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:12,785
I really wanted to take over Woonam University for your sake.

91
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,530
I have committed wrongdoings for that purpose,

92
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:16,915
and they are being discovered now.

93
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,855
I am extremely frightened.

94
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,655
The investigation is getting too aggressive for me to bear.

95
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:28,495
Please forgive your foolish son.

96
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,135
"I admit my guilt."

97
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:32,935
"Please..."

98
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:36,275
"cremate my body without a funeral."

99
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,715
That crazy idiot.

100
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,655
It's open.

101
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:06,905
They're not here.

102
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,735
His cell phone and notebook.

103
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:12,075
Could they be...

104
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,375
He didn't kill himself.

105
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,445
He was murdered.

106
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,785
Clean up.

107
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,385
We have to leave.

108
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's go.

109
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,135
Hey.

110
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,235
What about that?

111
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:19,805
We have no choice.

112
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,845
If we make a report, we'll be suspected.

113
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,500
We won't be able to explain...

114
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,100
what we were doing here at this hour.

115
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,315
- Still... - No.

116
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,085
We can't.

117
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,185
We have to get out of here.

118
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,495
Over here too.

119
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:25,345
(Forensic Science)

120
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,590
(I am sincerely sorry, Father.)

121
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,245
This is neat.

122
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,630
Is this a photo shoot?

123
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,170
You've taken enough pictures now.

124
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,970
It's a suicide case. There's no need to sweat.

125
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,595
Okay.

126
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,280
What do you need?

127
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,210
You can't enter here right now.

128
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,635
I'm a prosecutor.

129
00:12:58,494 --> 00:12:59,560
Who are you?

130
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,260
I'm a prosecutor at Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

131
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:03,315
I'd like to check the scene.

132
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,560
The case hasn't even been reported yet.

133
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,915
How did you know about it?

134
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,670
A person I've been investigating has died.

135
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,470
I should find out why.

136
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,570
I mean...

137
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:17,295
How did you even find out?

138
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,935
All cases under investigation are confidential.

139
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,605
What's your name and position?

140
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:30,475
I'm Lieutenant Oh Ki Hwan at the regional investigation unit.

141
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,975
Lieutenant Oh.

142
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:35,930
I know a teacher at this school. He let me know.

143
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,785
Do you have a problem with that?

144
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,100
Of course not.

145
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:45,240
I was just curious.

146
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,510
If you're done asking questions, will you step aside?

147
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,270
You're wasting my time.

148
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,895
Am I in your way?

149
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,735
I'm sorry. Come on in.

150
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,360
(Please cremate my body without a funeral.)

151
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,690
Lieutenant Oh, what about fingerprints?

152
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,130
I'm starving to death.

153
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,930
- Let's wrap it up and go for lunch. - Pardon?

154
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,970
Skipping a meal is not a good idea.

155
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,540
Hold on.

156
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,825
Have you checked the scene thoroughly?

157
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,795
That's really not necessary.

158
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:32,205
As you can see here, he left a note.

159
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,975
I actually think he even mentioned you...

160
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,645
in it.

161
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,730
Let's go grab some lunch.

162
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,845
- Sure. - What should we get?

163
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:01,310
Why would General Manager Lee...

164
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,695
Someone died in the school.

165
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:07,250
Ms. Ha, do you think this has anything to do...

166
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,405
with the things we talked about yesterday?

167
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:29,595
What do you want to talk about at this hour?

168
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,625
Lee...

169
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,395
Lee Tae Seok died.

170
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,535
I just saw it with my own eyes.

171
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,235
I saw him...

172
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,875
hanged in his office.

173
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,715
Are you saying...

174
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:51,160
you were at a murder scene just now?

175
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,430
Why did you go there?

176
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,670
The evidence on Speed Dial Zero...

177
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,970
was inside the safe in his office.

178
00:15:56,973 --> 00:16:00,640
But Lee Tae Seok is dead and all the evidence is gone now.

179
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,055
Someone killed Lee Tae Seok...

180
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,280
and made it look like he committed suicide.

181
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:08,665
Who would have possibly done that?

182
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,835
I can't go in there any more.

183
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,450
So please go check for me...

184
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,150
if there is...

185
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,745
any other trace of the criminal.

186
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,385
What's wrong with Butler Lee?

187
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,870
He promised to take better care of things from now on.

188
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,455
Why did he suddenly hang himself in the school?

189
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,540
What if we get implicated too?

190
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:41,665
Don't worry. I'll make sure that won't happen.

191
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,405
Did he really kill himself though?

192
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,420
Yesterday, he was walking around the school, all excited.

193
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,990
Why would he suddenly hang himself?

194
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,515
And at Tae Ra's recital, he was acting like he cared about nothing.

195
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,685
What about it?

196
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,815
Maybe he went crazy because he wanted to die.

197
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,670
You're right. He almost acted like he wanted to be killed.

198
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,870
He usually crawled to your father,

199
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,995
but he talked up to him too.

200
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,240
And now he actually died.

201
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,065
What does that mean?

202
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,195
What about my father?

203
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,720
Now he can rest easy at night...

204
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:23,020
because Butler Lee died.

205
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,520
How dare you...

206
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,460
- Stop it. - Stop what?

207
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,260
Didn't you hear what she just said?

208
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,775
How dare you talk about my father like that?

209
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,285
What are you doing? Get off me!

210
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,270
Why didn't you tell us...

211
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:44,625
that the temp was an attorney who used to work in your dad's law firm?

212
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,240
You knew it, right?

213
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,450
What? What does that mean?

214
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:50,450
That man...

215
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:51,920
is the attorney who defended Kim Han Su in court,

216
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,905
the murderer who killed Su Ah.

217
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,305
He hid it and came to our school.

218
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,460
What the...

219
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,345
You knew it all this time and yet haven't told us?

220
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:04,015
Why did you hide it from us?

221
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,900
Is he holding something over you?

222
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:09,855
No, there's nothing.

223
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,000
Then what should we do now?

224
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,470
Since he's Kim Han Su's attorney, we will kick him out, right?

225
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,740
What if he spits out everything?

226
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:21,150
I set him up with my mother because Butler Lee hired him.

227
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,150
This means he knows everything about our meeting too.

228
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,250
And my student record...

229
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:27,280
Does that matter to you now?

230
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,290
How could you worry about your student record now?

231
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,805
Excuse me?

232
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:36,060
You also think only about your debut.

233
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,915
And I'm not the only one who got the benefits.

234
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,600
Just because you didn't get any made-up prizes,

235
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,070
you don't care about us, do you?

236
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,930
Use your brain.

237
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,370
If we kick him out now, he won't just sit and stay quiet.

238
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,870
The moment he talks about how you bullied Su Ah,

239
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,865
you'll be doomed and you won't get to debut or anything.

240
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,510
The same goes for you.

241
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:56,450
Once the temp brings to light that you stalked and filmed Su Ah,

242
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,850
you will have to be transferred to another school in disgrace.

243
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:01,035
- You... - Stop!

244
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:10,560
It wouldn't have come this far if you listened to me...

245
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,030
and kept your mouth shut from the beginning.

246
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,345
So from now on, just do as I say.

247
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,155
If you don't want to make this worse.

248
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,585
Ye Ri.

249
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,770
Don't mind about this and focus on your training for now.

250
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:26,195
I'll keep the temp's mouth shut.

251
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,765
Tae Ra.

252
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,450
Talk your mother into changing the teacher...

253
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,050
that is in charge of the student record.

254
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,080
Now Butler Lee is dead, who set him up with her,

255
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,405
I'm sure she will change her mind too.

256
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,645
Okay. I will take care of it.

257
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,245
And you.

258
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,245
You're not hiding anything else, are you?

259
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm not.

260
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,525
If you find out anything, tell us immediately.

261
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,525
Okay?

262
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,735
Whatever.

263
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,760
What's wrong with him? He's the one who did wrong.

264
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:15,115
Don't worry.

265
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,415
I'll talk to him.

266
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,260
From now on,

267
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,155
watch your mouth and behavior in front of the temp.

268
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,855
Do you understand?

269
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,165
Darn it.

270
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,620
That awesome dad of yours...

271
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,820
came here and begged like mad...

272
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,090
to make sure his precious son's record isn't tarnished.

273
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:48,560
You punk. It isn't me.

274
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:52,100
You're the one holding your dad back!

275
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,745
Got that? You punk.

276
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,255
No. No way.

277
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:03,555
It's safe here, so you don't need to worry.

278
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:06,465
- Yes, I'm sorry. Okay, bye. - I'm sorry.

279
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:07,710
Hello.

280
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:08,780
I just...

281
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,850
Hello, teachers' office.

282
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,420
There's nothing to worry about.

283
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,350
There will be supplementary lessons too.

284
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,190
- Please don't worry. - I know.

285
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,660
All the students are safe, so don't worry.

286
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:22,915
- Yes, we will send them home now. - Thank you, bye.

287
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:25,660
- This is crazy. - Yes, ma'am.

288
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,770
- We apologize. - Hello?

289
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,470
- Yes, sir. - Hello, Young Hoon's mother.

290
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:32,585
- I will do it right now. - I'm sorry.

291
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,440
- Everything is fine. - Hello.

292
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:37,040
- Everyone. - We are taking care of it now.

293
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,665
- Listen to me first. - Yes.

294
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,910
We've got instructions from the board of the foundation.

295
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:46,720
From this day forward, the school will be closed until the next week.

296
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,605
Never answer reporters' questions...

297
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:53,960
and send the students home first.

298
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:57,360
And if you post anything about this matter on the internet,

299
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,160
social media, or anything,

300
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,870
you will be fired right away.

301
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,355
Answer me!

302
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:06,085
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

303
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,295
Yes.

304
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,335
Don't worry.

305
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,505
Hello, Cheonmyung High School.

306
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,065
Can't you trust me?

307
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:24,820
Come on, Captain. I'm telling you. This is a big scoop.

308
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:27,020
It hasn't been long since a student died here.

309
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,430
And now the general manager of the school is found dead, hanged.

310
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,830
Do you think it's just a coincidence?

311
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:36,485
Do you think this happens often in normal schools?

312
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,525
Hold on.

313
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,495
Okay. I'll hang up.

314
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,520
Gosh. What now?

315
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,750
Long time no see, Lieutenant Oh.

316
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:56,250
Looks like you're in charge of another Cheonmyung High School case.

317
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,360
And it's again about a person's death.

318
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,005
This one is different. It's suicide.

319
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:02,560
Suicide.

320
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:05,030
We have just found the body...

321
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:07,560
and we already know the cause of death?

322
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:08,955
What's your reason?

323
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:11,740
A hand-written will was found at the scene...

324
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,855
and he had reasons to commit suicide.

325
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,240
Don't you think of writing a novel this time.

326
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:21,650
That's why I'm telling you this.

327
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,150
How nice of you.

328
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,980
You removed...

329
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,775
the novel I wrote anyway, so no one could see it.

330
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,605
Are you going to do that again this time?

331
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:36,430
If you're so curious, why don't you go ahead and write one?

332
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:38,115
Then you'll see what happens.

333
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,585
Let's go.

334
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,635
The same school and the same investigation squad.

335
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,975
Fine. I'll write one interesting novel.

336
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,675
You hacked Beom Jin's phone?

337
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,660
Why?

338
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,545
Yu Beom Jin.

339
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,370
He may look like a perfect model student,

340
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,300
but he's the hardest to read...

341
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:19,770
among the four.

342
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:24,025
His classmates seem to be under his control too.

343
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,340
He knows something about the incident too,

344
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:29,050
but he keeps trying to cover it up.

345
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,995
But...

346
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:36,175
This is what I found...

347
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,305
from Beom Jin's phone.

348
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,630
This is Su Ah.

349
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,260
This is the profile photo she took in Lee Tae Seok's agency.

350
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,070
Beom Jin hacked someone's phone that had this picture...

351
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,155
using a spy app and has been surveilling it.

352
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,155
A spy app?

353
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,825
Beom Jin wouldn't do that.

354
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,565
To whom?

355
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,650
Af first, I thought it'd be Lee Tae Seok.

356
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:06,920
He's the person who is the most likely...

357
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,175
to have Su Ah's profile photo.

358
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,360
If it isn't him,

359
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,705
it must be Speed Dial Zero.

360
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:18,245
The person who Lee Tae Seok introduced Su Ah.

361
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,545
Speed Dial Zero?

362
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,315
The person most likely to be Speed Dial Zero...

363
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,125
is Beom Jin's father.

364
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,955
Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

365
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:35,210
Are you saying he was monitoring his own father's phone?

366
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:37,195
It's just speculation for now.

367
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:39,965
We need...

368
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:44,845
to get the documents we got from Beom Jin's phone to know for sure.

369
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:47,020
Last time, you said...

370
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,260
Gi Hoon's father kicked you out of the law firm...

371
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:51,645
and framed Han Su.

372
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:55,515
But this time, you say Beom Jin's father is Speed Dial Zero.

373
00:25:57,005 --> 00:26:00,225
And Lee Tae Seok, whom we had suspected...

374
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,655
was found dead.

375
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,995
Just how much of it is connected?

376
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:14,805
Won't Byung Ho be in danger too?

377
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,790
He visited Han Su because he was instructed by Lee Tae Seok,

378
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:19,445
so if they found out,

379
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:22,715
whoever Speed Dial Zero is may try to harm him.

380
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,515
Well...

381
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,155
I can't deny it.

382
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,595
If they killed Lee Tae Seok to shut him up,

383
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,125
they may...

384
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,265
go after Byung Ho...

385
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,135
(Student Counseling Center)

386
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:56,215
They cleaned everything out, so there was nothing left.

387
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,330
Even if they found a suicide note,

388
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,430
how could they do that to a crime scene?

389
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,955
I'm sure someone gave the orders.

390
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:04,970
If they investigated properly and found evidence...

391
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:06,785
that it wasn't suicide,

392
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,395
it would be a headache.

393
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:12,725
At this rate, the case will be closed before we can do anything.

394
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:16,995
Did you find anything else from Beom Jin's phone?

395
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,435
Not yet.

396
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,720
It'll take time to recover the files.

397
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,890
Let me know once you get anything.

398
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,090
I'll meet with the bereaved family and try to persuade them.

399
00:27:26,094 --> 00:27:29,515
We may find evidence of foul play if we do an autopsy.

400
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,545
Okay.

401
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,625
With the police and National Forensic Service...

402
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:48,110
I thought these things only happened in the movies.

403
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:49,450
Hurry up.

404
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,135
I'm going to ask my mom to transfer me out.

405
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,205
I can't go to a school where someone died.

406
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:55,935
Wait for me.

407
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:12,570
Now that they know who he really is, they should kick him out already.

408
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:14,340
I can't trust anyone.

409
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:18,025
I said I don't know anything!

410
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,950
I doubt that. I know how close you two were.

411
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,980
Even with the Jung Su Ah case,

412
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:28,105
you took the fall for Lee Tae Seok.

413
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,160
This is why they call you trash.

414
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,160
You attack innocent people!

415
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,930
If I see you again tomorrow,

416
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,830
I will press charges for defamation.

417
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,400
Got that?

418
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:44,355
This is a school.

419
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,480
You said there's something fishy about that man.

420
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,580
Can't you just snitch on him to a reporter or something...

421
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,535
and kick him out?

422
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,035
Reporter?

423
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,575
Yes. I can be an anonymous source.

424
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,085
Excuse me. Are you a reporter?

425
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,925
Yes, I am. Why?

426
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:24,370
There's a lot of strange things happening at our school.

427
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,210
There's a suspicious teacher too.

428
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:27,725
A suspicious teacher?

429
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:29,210
Who is it?

430
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:31,550
You'll keep my identity a secret, right?

431
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,950
I can't have my name or anything in the article.

432
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,190
Of course. Don't worry.

433
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,935
I'll keep it a secret.

434
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:41,305
Well...

435
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:44,800
Our homeroom teacher is a bit...

436
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,415
Who are you?

437
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,315
Beom Jin.

438
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,955
Is he your friend?

439
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,155
Yes, he is, but...

440
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:57,655
You're a reporter, right?

441
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,010
What are you harassing my friend about this time?

442
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,610
I'm not harassing her.

443
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:05,020
She said there was a suspicious teacher.

444
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,835
I did not.

445
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,905
I know something that would be much bigger news than that.

446
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:14,520
Do you want to know?

447
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:17,045
Bigger news? What?

448
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,615
What should I do, Ye Ri?

449
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,545
Should I tell him?

450
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,055
If we tell him everything, you wouldn't have to worry.

451
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,225
No, don't tell him anything.

452
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,625
Sorry. I was being stupid.

453
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,295
Let's go.

454
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,465
We'll go now. My friend doesn't seem to want to tell you.

455
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,875
Okay.

456
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,390
If you feel the need to tell me later,

457
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:46,790
call me here.

458
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,615
I'm Kang Ji Ho of Prime Journal.

459
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,645
It's okay. Goodbye.

460
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:54,315
Let's go.

461
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:09,080
I said I'd handle it.

462
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,265
So why are you blabbing?

463
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,050
So when will you handle it?

464
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,320
I'm making my debut soon.

465
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,360
I'm too nervous to even practice.

466
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:20,790
Then tell them everything...

467
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,975
including what you did to Su Ah.

468
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,985
Are you threatening me?

469
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,685
I'm making you choose.

470
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:31,230
Because if you don't listen to me,

471
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,625
I can't help you anymore.

472
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:37,570
Then I'll tell everything too.

473
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,780
I'll tell about how Tae Ra bullied Su Ah.

474
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,580
You and Tae Ra are different.

475
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,580
Tae Ra isn't joining a girl group.

476
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,120
People will be interested only in you.

477
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,380
Even if words get around,

478
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:50,675
everyone will forget if she leaves the country for a few years.

479
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,275
I can protect her thereafter.

480
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:55,375
But will you...

481
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,045
be okay?

482
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:05,015
Choose.

483
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:07,555
Will you do as I say, or...

484
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,695
will you do as you wish?

485
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:18,235
I'll... I'll do as you say.

486
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:22,005
I won't tell anyone about that lawyer.

487
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:26,045
But you have to keep your promise...

488
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,020
to shut him up.

489
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,275
Have I ever gone back on my word?

490
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,600
Don't worry. Just prepare for your debut.

491
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,585
I'll take care of everything.

(Suspicions Surrounding the Murder of an Elite High School Student)

493
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:45,410
Everyone else handled Su Ah's case like a piece of gossip,

494
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:49,035
but this discussed the possibility that Han Su didn't kill her.

495
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:52,005
It raised suspicion regarding his suicide attempt too.

(Reporter Kang Ji Ho)

499
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:05,600
He's famous for investigative journalism.

Once he starts something, he digs until he finds the truth.

00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,585
Should we ask?

503
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,080
I heard you're Han Su's lawyer.

504
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,465
How are you so shameless?

505
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:25,705
How could you hide that?

506
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,705
Did Gi Hoon tell you?

507
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:34,120
You really must be hiding something.

508
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,830
Now that you've been found out,

509
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,145
don't touch my student record...

510
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,585
and stay out of my life...

511
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,055
before I expose you.

512
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:53,225
Go ahead.

513
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,675
Tell people...

514
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:08,605
that Han Su's lawyer hid his identity and came to the school.

515
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,515
Then you won't need to tell me to stop handling your student record.

516
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,815
I'll be fired from the school anyway.

517
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,340
Then again,

518
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:26,040
quite a few things must stop you from revealing everything.

519
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,040
Your student record has been tampered with.

520

Butler Lee, who worked for you, is dead.

521
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,220
On top of that,

522
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,535
Su Ah was bullied to death by you.

523
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:39,390
What are you talking about? What are you accusing me of?

524
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,120
Ye Ri told me everything.

525
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:42,560
You bullied Su Ah because you were jealous...

526
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:44,715
about her relationship with Beom Jin.

527
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,930
Love is a scary thing.

528
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:52,455
It can even destroy friendship overnight.

529
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:57,655
When Su Ah was stabbed,

530
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,925
where were you and what did you do?

531
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:04,835
Did you have a fight with Su Ah over your student record by any chance?

532
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,120
And did you end up killing her?

533
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:08,550
You're being ridiculous.

534
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:10,835
That day, I...

535
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:39,835
Beom Jin.

536
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:43,675
You woke up. This movie is hilarious.

537
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:47,505
I slept through it.

538
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,030
I'm still sleepy.

539
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:54,415
Sleep some more. We can watch it again sometime.

540

What's going on?

541
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,125
There's a burning smell.

542
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,105
"That day, I..."

543
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,175
And?

544
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,975
What did you do?

545
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:26,860
Anyway, I made myself clear.

546
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:30,500
Stay away from my student record or anything related to me.

547
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:33,025
And keep your mouth shut.

548
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:54,575
After making that ugly scene, that idiot, in the end...

549
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,815
I hope it won't affect us.

550
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:02,630
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

551
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,570

and my law firm took a case, and that's all.

Mr. Lee, who recently died,

567
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:58,220
bribed the board of directors and key players at Woonam University...

568

in order to be selected...

569

as the preferred bidder for the takeover of the university.

570

When the prosecution started an investigation,

571
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:10,400
he became extremely anxious according to his family's testimony.

Lee Jung Suk, the eldest son of the Cheonmyung Foundation's founder.

583
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,500
He was competing with Lee Tae Seok for the director position.

584
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,810
The two were on bad terms.

585
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:53,540
Lee Jung Suk has a solid alibi.

586

They made a scene with Lee Tae Seok at the hotel.

592

They have a solid motive for murder.

But their fight was witnessed by everyone.

594
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,630
They must have known they'd be suspected...

595
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:21,040
once his death turns out not to be a suicide.

596
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,340
In addition,

597
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,340
they did come to an agreement.

598
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:26,295
Why would he put himself in danger by committing murder?

599

602

She wouldn't have dared to.

603
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:38,650
Killing Lee Tae Seok could reveal...

604
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,975
that her daughter's student record has been manipulated.

605
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,315
Also, Assistant Prosecutor General Yang definitely didn't do it.

606
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,845
He just doesn't have the guts.

607
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:52,485
Okay.

608
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:55,285
That leaves us...

with Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

610
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:01,340
He even introduced a special bill that could help Lee Tae Seok...

611
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:02,680
take over the university.

612
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,810
For now, Yu Yang Ki is most likely to be...

613
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,480
both Speed Dial Zero and the person who murdered...

614

Jung Su Ah and Lee Tae Seok.

615
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,375
That changes everything.

616
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:16,930
However, with all the power he has,

617
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,885
he would have been able to cover up everything quietly.

618
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,300
Why would he commit murder?

619
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,655
That can also mean...

620
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:28,040
things must have become impossible to cover up quietly.

621
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:32,095
What if Yu Yang Ki found out what Lee Tae Seok had done...

622
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:34,840
to Lee Do Jin and Woo Eun Hye at the recital?

623
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,135
He would have wanted to keep Lee Tae Seok quiet by all means.

624
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:42,065
Even if that meant Lee Tae Seok needed to be killed.

When you found out that I love this artist,

628
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,820
you gave me his painting as a present.

629
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:54,920
Do you remember that?

630
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,630
Of course. I remember everything...

631
00:41:57,632 --> 00:42:00,585
that has ever happened between you and me clearly.

632
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,755
Did you feel hurt...

633
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:06,125
when I kept a distance from you for a while?

634
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:09,795
Not at all.

635
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,965
I just feel sorry.

636
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:17,795
You were fond of Su Ah.

637
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,665

By the way,

639
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,445
I'm wondering about the special bill.

640
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:30,190
When will it be passed...

641
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:32,275
The time is not right yet.

642

But I'll be sure to pass it,

643
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,600
so wait just a little longer.

644
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:38,670
I can wait,

645
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:40,940
but when taking over a university,

646
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:42,940
timing is important.

647
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:45,340
The funds and lawsuits are all in place.

648
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:47,495
It's just the law that's missing.

649

You must be aware...

650
00:42:50,952 --> 00:42:54,965
what I did just to protect you.

651
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:05,475
By the way,

652
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,585
did you really not meet Su Ah that day?

653
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:12,670
I'm just wondering.

654
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,970
Why did that incident happen...

655
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:18,825
on the day when you were supposed to visit her?

656
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,835
I'll give you what you want.

657
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:32,760
Congressman Yu.

658
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,605
You're right.

659
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,690
You've done so much for me.

660
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,030
I should show my gratitude.

661

Wait just a little longer.

662
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:43,355
I'll reintroduce the bill in the next session.

668
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:01,625
Who is it?

669
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:05,495
Ms. Ha. What brings you here?

670
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,475
I came to check on you because I was worried.

671
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:11,375
Worried?

672
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,505
Why?

673
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:16,115
Well...

674
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:19,245
Can I come in first?

675
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,300
Sure. Come in.

676
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,655
Thanks.

677
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:33,465
I know the general manager committed suicide.

678
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:38,695
And you're okay with it?

679
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,435
Of course I am. It's not like it's my fault.

680
00:45:43,724 --> 00:45:45,475
Are you here because of that?

681
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,005
Were you worried I might be anxious?

682
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:50,945
Yes.

683
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:55,515
I'm glad you're fine though.

684
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,185
Actually,

685
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,025
since I told you that I visited Han Su,

686
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,425
I have been a bit confused.

687
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,595
But then Beom Jin visited me.

688
00:46:08,315 --> 00:46:10,035
He said he was worried about me.

689
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:12,565
Beom Jin did?

690
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:14,835
Yes.

691
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:17,705
He's been always nice to me.

692
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,445
I need to tell them.

693
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,655
I must tell them the truth.

694
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:38,225
Byung Ho.

695
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,065
Beom Jin.

696
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:43,565
I was worried.

697
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:45,535
You didn't look well all day today.

698
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,165
What's wrong? Is someone bullying you again?

699
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,605
I...

700
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:56,415
I don't know what to do.

701
00:46:57,765 --> 00:47:01,515
I just want to tell them the truth and be forgiven by Han Su.

702
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:03,655
But now I know Mr. Gi...

703
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:06,385
is an attorney, I'm so scared.

704
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:09,595
I heard Mr. Gi...

705
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,395
was Han Su's attorney.

706
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,565
He once called me to the rooftop once...

707
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,065
and told me to tell him everything I know.

708
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:21,935
He even knows that I went to meet Han Su...

709
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:24,235
under the instructions of the General Manager.

710
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,975
What do I do? Do you think I should just tell him?

711
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:35,785
You don't have to tell him.

712
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:38,215
You don't have to tell him anything.

713
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,700
Beom Jin.

714
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,955
You don't have to do if you don't want.

715
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:45,625
No matter what others say, don't listen to them.

716
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:47,895
If something happens,

717
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:50,065
I will help you.

718
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:58,475
Then did you tell Beom Jin that Mr. Gi is Han Su's attorney...

719
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:02,945
and you met Han Su under the General Manager's instruction?

720
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:07,385
Yes. But it's okay.

721
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,285
Beom Jin is a really nice guy.

722
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:12,815
If it weren't for him,

723
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:17,595
I would be still getting bullied by Jun Jae.

724
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,680
What do you mean?

725
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,965
When Jun Jae was bullying me,

726
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,165
Beom Jin told me...

727
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:29,635
not to stand it any more.

728
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:33,805
He said I will get bullied just as much as I bare with it.

729
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:37,375
And when the moment comes where I can't stand it any more,

730
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,115
it'll be too late.

731
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:42,955
Beom Jin...

732
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,255
said that to you.

733
00:48:46,707 --> 00:48:48,055
Yes.

734
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,695
That's how I could stand up to him.

735
00:48:51,245 --> 00:48:54,795
It was my fault that I brandished a knife...

736
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,495
and I'm still reflecting on myself, though.

737
00:48:58,252 --> 00:48:59,765
But if I didn't do it,

738
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:03,105
nothing would have changed.

739
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:06,375
I would have been still Porter...

740
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:08,575
who gets bullied by Jun Jae.

741
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,945
So I don't regret listening to Beom Jin.

742
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,085
Now,

743
00:49:16,904 --> 00:49:20,285
no one is bullying me at school.

744
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:23,525
Now I don't have to worry about anything in school...

745
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:26,495
and focus on my study.

746
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,555
This is Yu Beom Jin, right?

747
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:56,395
Right. What about it though?

748
00:49:58,445 --> 00:50:02,440
From here to the byroad that connects to Su Ah's place,

749
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,135
it takes a couple of minutes on foot.

750
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,905
If you run, it'll take only one minute.

751
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,690
How did you find this?

752
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,220
I looked into every single incident...

753
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:17,160
that happened on the roads near Su Ah's place.

754
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:20,630
And there was a hit-and-run accident on the three-way junction here.

755
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:24,385
They left this footage to track the hit-and-run driver.

756
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:29,755
And it was filmed on April 27, 2019.

757
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,565
That's a week before Su Ah got killed.

758
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,295
Isn't it suspicious?

759
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,665
Why was he there at that hour?

760
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:43,175
When do we have the data from Beom Jin's phone restored?

761
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,905
The program is still running.

762
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,345
It should be done by today or tomorrow.

763
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,785
We don't know if it will be restored until we see the result though.

764
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:02,985
If Yu Beom Jin did surveil his father's phone...

765
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,080
and there's something in the phone that can prove the relationship...

766
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,195
between Yu Yang Ki and Lee Tae Seok...

767
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,865
Then that would be a jackpot.

768
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:16,405
Then we know for sure Speed Dial Zero is Yu Yang Ki.

769
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:29,470
These are the rules that must be strictly followed in school.

770
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,785
Memorize every single of them...

771
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,125
so we won't trouble the school.

772
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,240
As we're going through a hard time,

773
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:41,240
we must work hard to protect the school and the foundation.

774
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:42,950
Don't you think?

775
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,835
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

776

(Special Provisions During the Emergency Period)

777
00:51:58,398 --> 00:51:59,760
What's going on?

778
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,130
Why is she leading the meeting when we have...

779
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,530
both the Principal and Vice-principal here?

780
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,130
Keep it down.

781
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:06,625
Now is the time you have to be the most careful.

782
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,010
Can't you feel it?

783
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,225
She's trying to show that she wants to be the next boss.

784
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,750
Starting from tomorrow, all classes...

785
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:21,905
and extracurricular activities will be done normally.

786
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:24,675
Stay alert...

787
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,420
and make sure to create an academic atmosphere...

788
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:30,575
so the students won't get distracted.

789
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:32,645
Do you understand?

790
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:34,485
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

791
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:36,385
Ms. Jun.

792
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:40,470
Many students are still in shock and didn't come to school.

793
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:42,800
What if the parents say...

794
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:47,125
That is why we have to push it through.

795
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,980
The parents would do anything...

796
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:53,020
to send their children to good colleges.

797
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,190
Will they keep their children at home...

798
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,120
when other kids...

799
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:01,505
are coming to school?

800
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:04,430
No way.

801
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,415
But still...

802
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:10,415
Sir.

(Cheonmyung High School)

804
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:20,010
Sir.

805
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:21,840
You didn't say you were coming.

806
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:26,035
Thank you for coming, sir.

807
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:33,190
Can classes resume and go back to normal tomorrow?

808
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:36,390
Of course. You do not need to worry about a thing.

809
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:39,560
I will be your hands and feet...

810
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:43,715
and give myself to normalize Cheonmyung High School.

811
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:01,265
Let's talk.

812
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,705
What is it? I have to go to practice.

813
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,115
Come with me.

814
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:24,595
- What's wrong with them? - Are they going to fight?

815
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,390
What's your deal?

816
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:38,520
What?

817
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,790
I heard you told the temp...

818
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:43,660
that I bullied Su Ah because I was jealous of her and Beom Jin.

819
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:46,130
So? I didn't make it up.

820
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:47,945
It's true.

821
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,500
You're the one who was jealous.

822
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:52,870
In case Su Ah would push you out.

823
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,370
Are you kidding me?

824
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,510
How dare you compare me to that witch?

825
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,940
What? You whined to me every day because you were nervous...

826
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:02,640
because Gi Hoon showed an interest in her.

827
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,650
"You like me more than Su Ah, right?"

828
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,650
"You're closer to me, right?"

829
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:08,165
That's what you said.

830
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,175
But then again,

831
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:15,920
you're way too inferior to get along with us.

832
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:19,915
You hung in there because you were a girl group trainee,

833
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,760
but once people find out you bullied Su Ah with me,

834
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:26,825
you'll get cut and become a total loser.

835
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,225
What? Loser?

836
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:35,825
You're nothing without Beom Jin.

837
00:55:37,784 --> 00:55:41,320
You've lost your mind because Beom Jin's been good to you lately.

838
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:42,920
Don't trust him too much.

839
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,920
He isn't as good as you think.

840
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,520
What are you talking about?

841
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,790
If I don't trust Beom Jin, who would I trust?

842
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:51,115
You are so dense.

843
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:53,300
Couldn't you tell all this time...

844
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,200
how he gets eerily cold every so often?

845
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,800
Do you know what he said when he threatened me?

846
00:55:58,805 --> 00:56:00,840
He said he doesn't care if people find out...

847
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:02,770
that you and I bullied Su Ah.

848
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,840
He was going to tell a reporter in front of me.

849
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:06,210
To ruin our lives.

850
00:56:06,213 --> 00:56:07,880
Stop lying.

851
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:10,650
He'd never do something that would hurt me.

852
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,635
That's why I'm saying you're clueless.

853
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:17,335
Watch your back.

854
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:21,020
At least Gi Hoon is transparent. But with Beom Jin,

855
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:24,145
I just can't tell what he's thinking.

856
00:56:25,399 --> 00:56:29,415
Who knows? He may be deceiving you.

857
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:47,805
Beom Jin?

858
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:50,835
Byung Ho waved the knife around...

859
00:56:51,124 --> 00:56:53,405
because of Beom Jin?

860
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:57,360
Yes. He told Byung Ho not to take it anymore.

861
00:56:57,364 --> 00:57:01,745
I think Byung Ho depends on and follows Beom Jin a lot.

862
00:57:02,702 --> 00:57:04,630
Maybe you're right.

863
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:07,225
Maybe he's controlling him.

864
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:11,955
Beom Jin again.

865
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:14,395
Again?

866
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,595
Was there something else?

867
00:57:18,485 --> 00:57:20,920
Beom Jin was caught on a surveillance video...

868
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:25,005
near Su Ah's place a week before the incident.

869
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,805
If he was there that day...

870
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:30,815
because of Su Ah...

871
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:35,885
Excuse me.

872
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:41,270
Hello?

873
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:44,670
Is this Mr. Gi Kang Je's phone?

874
00:57:44,678 --> 00:57:46,310
Yes. Who is this?

875
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:49,280
I'm the student that you saved...

876
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:52,510
from Jun Jae in the alley.

877
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:54,220
Or do you want to work with me?

878
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,450
You can make more since you're a girl.

879
00:57:57,457 --> 00:58:02,805
Gosh. What an amazing criminal.

880
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:05,030
Ji Eun, get going or you'll be late for school.

881
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:08,015
I'll sort things out here.

882
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,700
Yes, that student from back then.

883
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:16,385
Yes. I couldn't even thank you back then.

884
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:20,680
It's okay. I only did what I should as a teacher.

885
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,210
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy right now.

886
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:26,665
I have something to say about Su Ah.

887
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,905
About Jung Su Ah?

888
00:58:30,023 --> 00:58:33,520
Yes. Please come to the broadcasting room right now.

889
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:36,190
You have to come alone. I'll be waiting.

890
00:58:36,196 --> 00:58:39,245
Wait. What... Hello?

891
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,245
Hello?

892
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,270
What's wrong?

893
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,585
Lee Ji Eun...

894
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:49,425
It's a girl that I saved before from Jun Jae.

895
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,255
She just said...

896
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,095
she wants to see me in the broadcasting room.

897
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:58,410
She said she wanted to tell me something about Su Ah.

898
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,165
Su Ah?

899
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,835
Who is she that...

900
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,190
I don't know either.

901
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:09,305
I only saw her that one time.

902
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:12,975
I'll find out once I go see her.

903
00:59:14,267 --> 00:59:15,900
I'll be right back.

904
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:17,415
Okay.

905
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:37,005
Please open.

906
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:39,475
Please.

907
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:43,675
Please open.

908
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:47,260
Yes! All right!

909
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:51,415
I really am a genius. Park Won Suk, you rock.

910
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,040
Okay.

911
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:03,025
Let's see.

912
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,320
Hello.

913
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:10,635
- Hello. - Hello.

914
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:13,275
Hello.

915
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,735
Why are you so jumpy?

916
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:43,735
You asked me to meet you here.

917
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:02,555
(Won Suk)

918
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,545
What is it?

919
01:01:22,128 --> 01:01:26,515
What did you want to tell me about Su Ah?

920
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:34,755
But...

921
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:38,825
how did you know...

922
01:01:39,145 --> 01:01:41,925
I was curious about Su Ah?

923
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:45,995
I'm sorry.

924
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,105
You're sorry? For what?

925
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:03,755
I'm... I'm really sorry, Mr. Gi.

926
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:07,085
You helped me, but...

927
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:32,345
I'm sorry. But if I don't do this,

928
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:34,915
I'll die for real.

929
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:49,095
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

930
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,360
- Ji Eun! - No one...

931
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,760
will believe a word he says.

932
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:11,715
Did the temp do something to her that we can't know about?

933
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,540
He came to my place with another boy.

934
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,140
It's Beom Jin every time.

935
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:20,010
Tell me. What happens next?

936
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:22,980
Beom Jin was monitoring his father's phone.

937
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,750
Beom Jin and Su Ah had a fight last semester.

938
01:03:25,752 --> 01:03:27,420
Jung Su Ah and Lee Tae Seok.

939
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,820
Their deaths are related.

940
01:03:29,823 --> 01:03:30,920
Is it this person?

941
01:03:30,924 --> 01:03:32,590
Who met Su Ah?

942
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:35,460
The person who wants you to stop questioning Su Ah's death...

943
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:39,330
and hide the truth of the incident...

944
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:41,845
Quit our school and keep your mouth shut,

945
01:03:42,702 --> 01:03:44,685
and nothing more will happen.

946
01:03:45,205 --> 01:03:49,070
Confess and ask forgiveness for what you did.

947
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,940
I warned you, Attorney Gi.

948
01:03:51,945 --> 01:03:53,295
Hyun Jung!
