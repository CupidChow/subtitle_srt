Hello.

(Episode 11)

4
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,035
Hello.

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,205
Who on earth wants to talk about Su Ah?

6
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,315
Hi. What are you doing?

7
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:42,590
Yun Ah. Is there Ji Eun...

8
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:45,490
in the broadcasting club?

9
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,755
Yes. She's a sophomore. Why?

10
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,170
Mr. Gi just received a call from her saying...

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,465
she wanted to talk about Su Ah and to come to the broadcasting room.

12
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:01,635
She did? How does Ji Eun know Su Ah?

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,680
She was acting weird this morning.

14
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:11,345
She was out of it and didn't hear me call her.

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,185
Hey. Ji Eun!

16
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:26,870
She was always active in the club,

17
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,125
but she hardly comes anymore, so I've been worried.

18
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:34,110
But how does Mr. Gi know her?

19
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,680
He said that he saved her from Jun Jae before...

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,340
and that it was the only time he met her.

21
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,150
Son Jun Jae from your class?

22
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,805
Yes.

23
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:46,790
Then is it the IT Pawn Shop?

24
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,750
IT Pawn Shop? What's that?

25
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,060
He takes smartphones and other expensive items as collateral...

26
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:54,860
and lends money at high interest.

27
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,660
That's pretty much like a loan shark.

28
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,025
Are you saying Jun Jae does that?

29
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:03,695
I heard he does it with Jung Tae at their club room.

30
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:09,335
But does Ji Eun...

31
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,985
Why are you so jumpy?

32
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,955
You asked me to meet you here.

33
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,585
(Won Suk)

34
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,365
What is it?

35
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,265
What did you want to tell me about Su Ah?

36
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,490
But...

37
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,790
how did you know...

38
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,615
I was curious about Su Ah?

39
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,685
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,255
You're sorry? For what?

41
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:56,005
I'm... I'm really sorry, Mr. Gi.

42
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,005
You helped me, but...

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,215
(Korean Youth Expo)

44
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,365
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,035
But if I don't do this, I'll die for real.

46
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,585
What was that?

47
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:38,890
Did you hear that?

48
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,130
What was that?

49
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,730
What's going on?

50
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,525
What was that?

51
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,795
Ji Eun...

52
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,580
Oh my gosh.

53
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,135
Ji Eun.

54
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,250
What's going on?

55
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't come closer!

56
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,790
Stay away from me. Don't come any closer!

57
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,290
What's going on?

58
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:14,055
- What happened? - What's happening?

59
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:17,285
- Oh my gosh. - What's going on?

60
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,730
Calm down.

61
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,795
I understand, so calm down.

62
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,470
Why are you doing this?

63
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,670
You're the one who called me in to talk to me.

64
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,265
So why are you doing this to me?

65
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:32,805
Oh my gosh.

66
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:38,405
- Mr. Gi. - Ji Eun.

67
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,915
- Are you okay? - What's wrong? What happened?

68
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,730
What happened?

69
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:57,040
She suddenly grabbed her shirt and ripped it open.

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,165
Then she screamed and ran out.

71
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,340
We need to deal with the kids first.

72
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,065
Yes, but...

73
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,580
given the situation...

74
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,480
I'll explain.

75
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,750
Okay, everyone. Go into your classrooms.

76
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,050
We'll take care of things here.

77
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,060
- What happened? - What's going on?

78
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,220
What happened?

79
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,430
Kids.

80
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,515
What happened?

81
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:33,865
You need to tell us why she's like this.

82
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,680
Did something happen to her that we can't know about?

83
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
By that Temp Gi?

84
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,905
- That's absurd. - What?

85
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,750
What happened?

86
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:48,250
Oh my gosh.

87
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,615
I can't believe this.

88
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:51,760
How could he?

89
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,390
I guess so, seeing as you can't respond.

90
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,860
Why? Do you plan to bury it because there have been...

91
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,760
so many incidents lately at our school?

92
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,795
We can't let that happen.

93
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,795
Oh my gosh.

94
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:12,410
I'm too scared to go to a school with teachers who touch students.

95
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,475
We should call the cops and kick him out.

96
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,480
No cops.

97
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,480
Why not?

98
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:21,320
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

99
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:24,145
I'll make sure he never steps foot in the school again.

100
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:29,185
The person who did something the kids can't know...

101
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,325
is you, Ye Ri.

102
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,855
- What was that? - What did she say?

103
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,125
What?

104
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,570
I know too...

105
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,895
that you bullied Su Ah...

106
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,840
and used the student community portal...

107
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,875
to spread nasty rumors about our students.

108
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:54,575
If you don't want all the kids here to find out,

109
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,485
stay down.

110
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:01,915
Then I'll consult you separately regarding that matter.

111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,655
What is she talking about?

112
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:11,425
Darn it. You're so annoying.

113
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:17,265
What's going on now?

114
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,980
Did anyone else here borrow money...

115
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:27,490
from the band kids using your phone or something as collateral?

116
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,615
What?

117
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,530
I'm sure some of you...

118
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,390
are struggling because you borrowed money from Jun Jae,

119
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,725
suffering alone, and unable to tell anyone.

120
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,770
Ji Eun is having a hard time and is terrified because of that,

121
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,265
which is why she made a momentary mistake.

122
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,195
Right, Ji Eun?

123
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:09,015
Ji Eun. If you tell the truth,

124
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:11,525
I won't make a big deal of this.

125
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,885
I don't know.

126
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,255
I just...

127
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,340
If you pull open...

128
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:26,310
your uniform shirt with your hands,

129
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,950
fine particles of it will remain under your nails.

130
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,675
The police will find it not on me,

131
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,290
but on you.

132
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,060
I'm not planning to report to the police.

133
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,860
The police will be here regardless.

134
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,430
As you're a minor,

135
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,785
they will also contact your parents.

136
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,460
Do you see?

137
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:49,025
This is not as simple as you might think.

138
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,565
Tell the truth,

139
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,405
and I'll forgive you.

140
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:02,175
It's okay.

141
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,915
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,525
It's...

143
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,795
It's all my fault.

144
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:29,295
Jun Jae threatened me to do as he said after lending me money.

145
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,635
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,105
I did it because I was scared.

147
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,705
I'm so sorry.

148
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:56,070
Take Ji Eun to the Counseling Center.

149
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,895
- Mr. Gi and I will be there soon. - Okay.

150
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,340
It's okay.

151
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:03,895
Jun Jae?

152
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,105
What about other kids?

153
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,115
Like Ji Eun,

154
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:17,720
if any of you are suffering because of Jun Jae or any other problems,

155
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,015
don't keep it to yourself and come to the Counseling Center anytime.

156
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,525
We can...

157
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,095
discuss and try to find a solution together.

158
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:35,465
- Gosh. - Hey. What is it?

159
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:08,735
How long are you going to remain silent?

160
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,665
I'm really sorry.

161
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,735
You've apologized enough already.

162
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,405
Tell us everything you know.

163
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,555
Mr. Gi, could you excuse us for a moment?

164
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,485
Pardon?

165
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,910
You couldn't tell Ji Eun...

166
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,565
everything either.

167
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,680
Her senior Yun Ah is here too,

168
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,775
so let me try to talk to her.

169
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,475
All right.

170
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,445
Thank you.

00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,135
I hope it goes well.

173
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,860
Hi. What's the matter?

174
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,985
Beom Jin's phone...

175
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,225
has been recovered.

176
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,625
Okay. I'll be right there.

177
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,875
Ji Eun.

178
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,745
Is it about the camera?

179
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,285
Yun Ah, how did you...

180
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:09,085
I had been aware that the camera was missing for a long time.

181
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,730
Where's the UHD camera?

182
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,230
The one we bought last semester.

183
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:17,725
Ji Eun took it saying she needed it for something.

184
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,970
If it's been bothering you, it's fine now.

185
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:24,705
Mr. Kang brought it back recently.

186
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,120
Did Jun Jae take you guys' stuff away...

187
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,945
and bully you?

188
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,120
Don't worry.

189
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,385
Everything he has done in school will be revealed.

190
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:48,795
He came to my place...

191
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,825
with another boy.

192
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,995
He said, if I didn't do as he said,

193
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,065
I'd be broadcast too.

194
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,335
"Broadcast"?

195
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,835
What does that mean?

196
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,375
An internet broadcast.

197
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,245
I've paid him back the money I borrowed,

198
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,015
but the interest has become too big.

199
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,890
How did you find out where I live?

200
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,615
Didn't I tell you?

201
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,955
I'll make you pay me back by all means.

202
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,695
He said he'd come every day.

203
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,835
He even figured out the passcode of my place.

204
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,465
He said he'd tell my parents too.

205
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,005
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,245
I only did it...

207
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,815
because I was terrified.

208
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,515
Son Jun Jae, that jerk...

209
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,255
Ji Eun.

210
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,230
You can relax now.

211
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,755
I'll make sure Jun Jae can't bully you...

212
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:31,765
ever again.

213
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,660
"From now on, I'll contact you with this number."

214
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,830
"July 17, 2018".

215
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:04,170
He changed his contact number every now and then.

216
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,965
It was a burner phone too.

217
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,210
A burner phone?

218
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,605
Yes. I looked it up,

219
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,935
and it belonged to a person who's been dead for two years.

220
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,620
Wait, that means...

221
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,790
we can't prove these messages were sent to Yu Yang Ki.

222
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,745
You're right.

223
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,255
But look what else I found.

224
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,055
"I will come to you..."

225
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:36,795
"later today, Congressman Yu."

226
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:41,835
It's not "President Yu" or "Director Yu", but "Congressman Yu".

227
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,735
Also, here's a reply Yu Yang Ki sent.

228
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,505
"Not bad."

229
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,290
"Let's continue."

230
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,475
Our guess was right. Beom Jin was monitoring...

231
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,115
his father's phone.

232
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,525
He must have been aware...

233
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,185
that his father was...

234
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,925
seeing Su Ah.

235
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,965
(Not bad. Let's continue.)

236
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,580
(Prosecutors' Office)

237
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,850
What are you doing?

238
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,820
Take back the information about Assistant Prosecutor General Yang.

239
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,050
- Hey. - Chief Prosecutor told me off...

240
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,290
for showing this to him.

241
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,760
He said this wouldn't justify stabbing our colleague in the back.

242
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,590
Have you checked his bank account and call history?

243
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:37,190
I checked it thoroughly even though I knew I'd be criticized.

244
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,725
But the thing is,

245
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,970
all that has ever entered his bank account was his salary,

246
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,455
and he has never called any number that's even close to Lee Tae Seok's.

247
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,670
Anyway, this isn't enough to go on.

248
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:50,370
Anyone at his level would have this much dirt.

249
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,465
Take it back. Come on.

250
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,035
(Attorney Con Artist)

251
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,645
Just a second.

252
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:00,850
What is it?

253
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,515
Lee Tae Seok...

254
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:06,745
contacted people from a burner phone.

255
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:09,660
What?

256
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,100
Let's meet right now.

257
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,770
The data downloaded from Beom Jin's phone has been recovered.

258
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,395
Okay.

259
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,765
What was that? An informant?

260
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,140
Keep that in a safe place.

261
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,910
We can't do anything with this.

262
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,110
Don't worry. If I can't find anything, I'll make something up.

263
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,775
Hyun Jung, wait! Hey!

264
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,445
Gosh, she's one persistent woman.

265
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:38,360
"I have prepared it how you wanted."

266
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,690
They exchanged a few messages at first to set time and place.

267
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,900
But later, they didn't even exchange those.

268
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,060
Yu Yang Ki didn't send him anything.

269
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:50,300
But every Friday evening,

270
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:53,195
Lee Tae Seok sent a message to Yu Yang Ki.

271
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:59,610
"Sir, thank you..."

272
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,150
"for coming"?

273
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,005
This means he visited him every Friday.

274
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,315
And May 3, the day Su Ah got stabbed,

275
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,715
was also Friday.

276
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,520
We need to check...

277
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,815
where Congressman Yu was and what he did that day.

278
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,830
Since then, they didn't exchange any messages...

279
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,430
until Han Su's trial started.

280
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,425
Lee Tae Seok sent him several messages.

281
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,300
"Don't worry."

282
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,310
"It's all taken care of."

283
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,040
"When will the bill pass?"

284
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,835
"I'll be looking forward to your answer, sir."

285
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,710
Look how desperate he is.

286
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,720
And then Yu Yang Ki...

287
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:41,790
sent one last message to Lee Tae Seok.

288
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,545
"Wait..."

289
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,620
"until I contact you."

290
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:49,885
But he couldn't wait.

291
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:53,230
Because he was about to take over Woonam University.

292
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:58,125
Now we know Yu Yang Ki is Speed Dial Zero for sure.

293
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,725
But we still have one more doubt.

294
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,295
Why did he kill Su Ah?

295
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,375
They had been successfully having secret dates.

296
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,205
But why?

297
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:26,130
How's school? Things are not so good there, right?

298
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,800
It's okay, thanks to the teachers.

299
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:32,800
He might as well have killed himself quietly.

300
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:37,070
I'm glad we're not involved in his matter in any way.

301
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,535
Quite a lot of parents must be anxious right now.

302
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:52,185
This makes me think...

303
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:56,215
it's really important who you hang out with.

304
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,095
You told me once...

305
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:05,400
that every single thing I say...

306
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,695
will affect how people see my father.

307
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,005
But no matter how hard I try,

308
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,475
it won't do anything if I hang out with a wrong person.

309
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:23,245
I'm going to be more careful from now on.

310
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,445
So I won't trouble you.

311
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:40,525
Yu Beom Jin was there.

312
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:45,440
He was caught by a CCTV near Su Ah's place.

313
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,210
From there, you can run to her place within five minutes.

314
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:52,005
Why did Yu Beom Jin come here?

315
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,590
I'm not sure. This alone doesn't tell...

316
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:58,120
what he has in his mind.

317
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,360
The very idea...

318
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,990
of spying your own father's phone...

319
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,100
is five trillion light years far different...

320
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:10,295
from normal students'.

321
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:17,665
Do you think Congressman Yu would have known...

322
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,110
that his date, Su Ah,

323
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,805
was going to the school his son goes to?

324
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,075
School...

325
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,120
If he didn't,

326
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,415
that means Yu Yang Ki was fooled by Lee Tae Seok too.

327
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,185
That might be why he killed Su Ah and Lee Tae Seok.

328
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,665
(Ms. Ha So Hyun)

329
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,695
Excuse me for a second.

330
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,710
- Yes, Ms. Ha. - Mr. Gi.

331
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:57,005
Jun Jae did threaten her.

332
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,020
Ji Eun told me everything...

333
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,320
that Jun Jae and Jung Tae came to her place and threatened her.

334
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:04,190
So I'm on my way to see him.

335
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,420
What? To see him? Where?

336
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,930
I heard he's working at a lender office.

337
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,800
He was running IT Pawn Shop because of his father's debt.

338
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,970
A lender? You're going there by yourself?

339
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:19,300
Don't worry. We'll talk it out.

340
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:20,670
I'll call you later then.

341
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:23,940
Wait, Ms. Ha. Hello?

342
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,465
Hello?

343
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:29,475
Goodness. She might get in trouble.

344
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,625
"Youth Loan"?

345
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,430
How did he end up here?

346
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:52,900
You can't even run a cigarette errand?

347
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,400
They don't sell cigarettes to me.

348
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,180
Then just steal it!

349
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,680
You useless brat.

350
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:03,510
You can't even run a simple errand.

351
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,645
Darn it.

352
00:25:09,825 --> 00:25:11,685
Jun Jae.

353
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,315
Darn it.

354
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:18,500
Jun Jae, what are you doing here?

355
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,885
What are you doing here? You're embarrassing me.

356
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:24,895
Embarrassing? Is that what matters to you?

357
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,595
Did you really do it?

358
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,140
Did you take the camera and money from Ji Eun,

359
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,180
went to her place, and threatened her...

360
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,710
to do that to Mr. Gi?

361
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,210
I didn't take anything from her.

362
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:40,405
I earned those things by lending my money.

363
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:43,450
Seriously, what are you going to do?

364
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,090
You might not be able to come back to school forever.

365
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:48,630
- Do you know that? - It's none of your business.

366
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,930
Beom Jin said he'll let me go to school again.

367
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,830
What does that mean?

368
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,570
How can he let you go to school again?

369
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:57,800
What are you going to do if you know that?

370
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,595
You can't help me anyway.

371
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,610
Just leave me alone.

372
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:06,605
Mind your own business.

373
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:08,510
Don't act up...

374
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:11,605
if you don't want to fall out of Beom Jin's favor like Mr. Gi did.

375
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,675
You might get hurt too.

376
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:22,355
Jun Jae.

377
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:40,735
Pay back the rest, got it?

378
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,950
Darn it.

379
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,505
Gosh.

380
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,190
Thanks for your help.

381
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,115
You want to come back...

382
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,485
to our school, right?

383
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:05,765
I will let you.

384
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:09,935
I can let you use the rooftop without Gi Hoon's permission.

385
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,635
Really?

386
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,510
Can you really do that?

387
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:15,275
But you have to...

388
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:18,035
do me a favor too.

389
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,580
Sure. I'll do anything.

390
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,515
Anything you want me to do.

391
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,670
He went there by himself.

392
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,770
That beat-up car looks like it will fall apart any second.

393
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,795
You wanted to watch this that much?

394
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:44,935
Yes, I slept through it.

395
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,210
And you watched everything.

396
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:50,450
Do you know how miserable...

397
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:52,020
I felt?

398
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,050
Do you?

399
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,350
What happens after this?

400
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:58,460
30 dollars...

401
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,645
The main character goes undercover.

402
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,085
Does he get caught?

403
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:07,025
Come on. I don't do spoilers.

404
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,965
It's okay. I like it when I know what's going to happen.

405
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:14,595
Tell me.

406
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:19,005
What happens after this?

407
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,275
Their business goes so successful...

408
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,285
that the police forgets about the investigation.

409
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,830
They sell a chicken at 36 dollars to have fewer customers,

410
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:38,725
but the business goes even more successful.

411
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,970
At the end, they get caught, but it's not important.

412
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,125
And it ends in a boring happy ending.

413
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:53,205
Really? That sounds fun.

414
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:56,605
Then I'll keep watching.

415
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:08,715
I'm having a miserable time cooking chickens here.

416
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,670
So I don't regret listening to Beom Jin.

417
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:22,010
Now, no one is bullying me at school.

418
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,670
Mind your own business.

419
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,540
Don't act up...

420
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,405
if you don't want to fall out of Beom Jin's favor like Mr. Gi did.

421
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,975
You might get hurt too.

422
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,915
Why is everyone...

423
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,300
It's too difficult to teach with everything going on.

424
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,295
What's wrong now?

425
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:53,825
The part of the book we were reading in class today...

426
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,335
was about the main character committing suicide.

427
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:59,210
The kids said it was scary and that they'll be traumatized.

428
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,705
They caused a big ruckus.

429
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:06,520
What could we do? The break was too short.

430
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:09,290
We only got past it because Beom Jin calmed them down.

431
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:12,515
It looked like we'd be getting complaints from parents soon.

432
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,230
He is such a great kid.

433
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,025
I'm the teacher, but he controls the kids better than I do.

434
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,930
Did you ever notice anything strange about Beom Jin?

435
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,465
What?

436
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,840
What do you mean?

437
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:31,235
Well, you know how he's different from other kids.

438
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:33,805
I wondered if you knew something.

439
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:37,275
What is it? Why are you suddenly asking something weird?

440
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,680
Is there something behind this too?

441
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,945
Like Mr. Lee Tae Seok?

442
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,175
It's just that something is bothering me.

443
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,755
Actually,

444
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,000
I did see something.

445
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,155
It may be nothing though.

446
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:58,840
What was it?

447
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,465
Last semester, I saw Beom Jin fighting with Su Ah.

448
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,305
They were talking about each other's transferring.

449
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,705
I'm so stiff.

450
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,875
I shouldn't have agreed to do the evaluations.

451
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:15,945
Why should I transfer out?

452
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:22,085
Su Ah and Beom Jin?

453
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,325
Just disappear quietly.

454
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,425
Then there won't be any problems.

455
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:32,965
Exactly. Why must I do that?

456
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,240
If you don't want to see me, you leave.

457
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:38,035
Or explain so I can understand.

458
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:42,905
What's this? Why are they telling each other to transfer at this hour?

459
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:01,385
I didn't know what it was about, so I left,

460
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,170
but it was odd.

461
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,430
I wonder why they fought.

462
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,900
Was there anything else after that?

463
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,425
No.

464
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,480
In class, they acted like nothing happened.

465
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,075
So I brushed it aside as just an argument.

466
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:20,845
But not long after that, Su Ah...

467
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,285
When was that?

468
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:32,625
I think it was around the first semester's midterms.

469
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,535
How could that happen?

470
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,880
My gosh.

471
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,745
I was nice to him, but Mr. Gi is terrible.

472
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,880
Thank you for telling me.

473
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,390
I'll call him in right away and kick him out of the school.

474
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,860
No.

475
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,885
With Mr. Lee Tae Seok committing suicide in the school,

476
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,255
that may draw more attention.

477
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,900
He won't back down easily.

478
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,070
Then what should we do?

479
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,855
First, confirm...

480
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,765
whether he is qualified to teach or not.

481
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,935
See if he's really a teacher.

482
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,140
He wouldn't have lied about that.

483
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,805
Do it.

484
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,035
It's very important.

485
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,915
If he lied about being a teacher,

486
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:33,385
no one will believe anything he says.

487
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,935
I was surprised yesterday.

488
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:02,715
You said I'd get hurt if I find out anything more.

489
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:05,515
I guess you had planned to get rid of me completely.

490
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:09,630
If not that, perhaps you were anxious...

491
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,530
because I found out too much.

492
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,625
That's why I warned you,

493
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,925
Mr. Gi Mu Hyeok.

494
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:18,865
I'll give you one last chance.

495
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:22,025
Leave our school quietly and keep your mouth shut.

496
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:25,135
Then nothing else will happen.

497
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,265
A chance...

498
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,135
I'll give you...

499
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,115
that chance as well.

500
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:41,545
If you sinned, let it all go and ask for forgiveness.

501
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,115
Then...

502
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,000
I may be willing to represent you. What do you say?

503
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,695
Just like a fraud to lie.

504
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,725
You lost your law license. How can you represent me?

505
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,735
Think it over. This really is your last chance.

506
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:20,185
Why did you do that to Su Ah?

507
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:21,460
What?

508
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:24,955
If you didn't make her do that, nothing would've happened.

509
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,260
If you had just left her alone,

510
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,270
no one would've gotten hurt.

511
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,970
You tried to make her yours and failed,

512
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:35,710
so you became her stalker taking pictures secretly.

513
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,405
That awesome dad of yours came here and begged like mad...

514
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,175
to make sure his precious son's record isn't tarnished.

515
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:47,945
You punk.

516
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:50,215
It isn't me.

517
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:55,345
You're the one holding your dad back! Got that?

518
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,085
It's okay. He just...

519
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,495
He just committed suicide.

520
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:06,165
He deserved to die anyway.

521
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:21,745
Why are you back? It's over now.

522
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:24,950
We all know you're Han Su's lawyer,

523
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:28,385
and Butler Lee is dead, so it's all over.

524
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,955
Beom Jin was right.

525
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:34,725
We should've kicked you out from the get-go.

526
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:36,270
Get out.

527
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:39,240
I have nothing to say to you, so get out of my sight!

528
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,965
The man Su Ah was seeing wasn't Lee Do Jin.

529
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:46,480
What?

530
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:49,050
I initially thought it was your father too, but it wasn't.

531
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,450
He handled some of Lee Tae Seok's cases,

532
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,745
but he wasn't seeing Su Ah.

533
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:01,785
Then? Then who was the jerk that was seeing Su Ah?

534
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,100
Don't just ask me everything, and think for yourself.

535
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:11,070
Who shut you up when you were suspicious of Su Ah's death,

536
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:14,225
and prevented me from uncovering the truth?

537
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,035
Who was it?

538
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,480
Han Su wouldn't have said anything stupid, right?

539
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:24,435
Who cares if he did?

540
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,020
Who'd listen to him anyway?

541
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,680
Everyone thinks he's Su Ah's stalker...

542
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,615
Let's stop talking about this.

543
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,160
We're at a funeral.

544
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:36,030
Something was going on between Butler Lee and Su Ah, right?

545
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,430
Then he could have killed her to keep her quiet.

546
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,525
Why are you suddenly so curious about that?

547
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,030
You and Su Ah were friends once.

548
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,000
Is it really okay to say about her like that based on some rumor?

549
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,710
Especially when she died in such a horrible way?

550
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:54,005
I have to stop him. Our assistant teacher.

551
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:55,705
Our assistant teacher?

552
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,410
What about him?

553
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,750
He asked me about Han Su on his first day at school.

554
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,020
This time, he brought up Su Ah.

555
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:05,015
He'll cause more trouble for our school.

556
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,460
Things are finally starting to settle.

557
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:10,290
I don't want a teacher to mess everything up again.

558
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:12,230
You guys should stay away from him.

559
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:16,370
He's obviously very curious about Han Su and Su Ah.

560
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:19,770
You should have listened to me and remained silent.

561
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,265
So do as I say from now on...

562
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,035
if you don't want to complicate things.

563
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,965
Yu Beom Jin.

564
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,545
No way.

565
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,875
Was Su Ah seeing Beom Jin's father?

566
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:40,720
That's right.

567
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:43,530
All the students and teachers at this school...

568
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:47,025
have been played by Beom Jin.

569
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,410
He is hiding something about Su Ah's death.

570
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:03,105
If you want to know who killed Su Ah and why,

571
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:06,545
find out what he's hiding.

572
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,915
Nothing is over yet.

573
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,370
All the students and teachers at this school...

574
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:28,925
have been played by Beom Jin.

575
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:40,345
Hi, Gi Hoon.

576
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:43,645
Meet me at Veritas right now.

577
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,230
What's the matter?

578
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,830
You said I should tell you...

579
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:54,925
everything I find out about Educated Moron.

580
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:56,795
So what did you find out?

581
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,410
He said the culprit who killed Su Ah must have killed Butler Lee too.

582
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,740
And it's a man who met Su Ah through Lee Tae Seok's introduction.

583
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:08,405
And the man is...

584
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,805
either your father or my father.

585
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,990
What should we do?

586
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:21,985
What if he's right?

587
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,090
That's impossible.

588
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:26,700
Now that he's being kicked out, he's making up that nonsense...

589
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:28,725
to confuse us.

590
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:32,295
- But what if... - No!

591
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,335
It can't be true.

592
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:42,750
So never bring up this absurd idea in front of anyone again,

593
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,475
or I won't sit back.

594
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,915
Okay.

595
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:08,065
I guess it's true that he's hiding something.

596
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,840
Just like Byung Ho did,

597
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,350
Jun Jae believed Beom Jin would solve everything for him.

598
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:20,645
Beom Jin promised to make sure Jun Jae can come back to school.

599
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,790
That's really strange.

600
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,520
Beom Jin told Byung Ho to stop putting up with Jun Jae.

601
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:29,430
That's why Byung Ho swung a cutter.

602
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,685
But Beom Jin also promised Jun Jae that he can come back to school?

603
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,825
What kind of image does Beom Jin have among the kids?

604
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:41,240
He's righteous and rational.

605
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:44,840
He's almost perfect, but he never brags.

606
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:47,340
That's why he's so popular with the kids,

607
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:49,250
but I don't really like him.

608
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,445
He's just too perfect. As if he's calculated everything.

609
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:58,575
Even though I saw them every day at school,

610
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,085
I knew absolutely nothing...

611
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:03,955
about Beom Jin...

612
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:07,225
or Su Ah.

613
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,640
I was pretty close to Su Ah, but I had no idea what was going on.

614
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,110
At school,

615
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:20,105
she just seemed to be one of those smart and rich kids.

616
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:28,320
I've been keeping it just in case.

617
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,990
It was a good idea not to throw it away.

618
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:34,220
Sorry, I suddenly dropped in. Thank you for helping me.

619
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:37,430
You're Han Su and Yu Sun's teacher.

620
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,685
I'm the one who should thank you.

621
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:43,330
Here's some stuff from their childhood.

622
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:46,625
It's mostly their study materials and books.

623
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:03,845
There's a notebook.

624
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:06,260
It's Yu Sun's diary.

625
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,360
No one told her to keep a diary,

626
00:44:08,362 --> 00:44:11,285
but she was pretty serious about it.

627
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:13,630
Is this her diary?

628
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:16,025
(Park Yu Sun)

629
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,970
Could I take a look at it?

630
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:22,195
Of course.

631
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,645
Han Su saved me from the other kids again today.

632
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:38,220
Yu Sun, who do you think you are? Stop studying.

633
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:39,520
Give that to me.

634
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:42,515
No. I want to study.

635
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:44,490
You're probably too little to understand.

636
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:47,360
There's no point in unfortunate people like us studying.

637
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:49,430
We'll lose everything to lucky guys in the end.

638
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,430
Give that to me.

639
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:54,000
No! I'll study hard and become successful.

640
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:56,895
Are you serious? Take it away from her!

641
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:59,140
Give it to us.

642
00:44:59,146 --> 00:45:01,080
- No! - You don't need it.

643
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:02,240
- Stop! - Let go!

644
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:04,210
- No! - Let go!

645
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:06,175
Get your hands off it!

646
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:09,220
Han Su, what are you doing?

647
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:12,090
I'm a fighter for justice, here to clean up the trash!

648
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,990
What? "Trash"?

649
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:16,155
Guys, get him!

650
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:33,440
It hurts.

651
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:36,775
Stop being such a crybaby. Stay still.

652
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:38,910
This is embarrassing.

653
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:41,920
I prefer tigers to rabbits.

654
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:43,120
They're stronger.

655
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:46,420
What did you just say? This was my favorite band-aid.

656
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:49,655
Do you know how hard it is to come by these here?

657
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:52,655
There you go.

658
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,755
By the way, why do you study so hard?

659
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,800
Kids bully you so much for that.

660
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:00,540
I want to be successful.

661
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,010
I'll study hard to enter a good university.

662
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,340
I'll make a ton of money, buy expensive cars and clothes,

663
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,535
and live in a fabulous house.

664
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:12,005
I see. I'm sure you can do that.

665
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,950
You're the first person...

666
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:17,875
who didn't tease me when I said that.

667
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,885
Why would I tease you? You just sounded so cool.

668
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:27,100
When I become successful, you can be my driver.

669
00:46:27,101 --> 00:46:28,100
Your driver?

670
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:30,970
Yes. You can drive my expensive car.

671
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:34,370
You can also live with me in my gorgeous house.

672
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:38,135
Okay. That sounds fantastic. I'll be your driver.

673
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,145
(I promised to let Han Su drive my car when I become successful.)

674
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:50,815
Since they were little kids,

675
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:53,815
Han Su protected Su Ah.

676
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:58,930
They must have relied on each other.

677
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:02,085
The two were very close.

678
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:07,270
There are many notebooks. Are they all her diaries?

679
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:08,970
Yes.

680
00:47:08,976 --> 00:47:11,270
You can take them if you need them.

681
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,180
The last time she was here,

682
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,135
she asked me to dispose of them.

683
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:25,520
In Su Ah's case, only Han Su's fingerprints were planted.

684
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:28,520
The murder of Lee Tae Seok was disguised as a suicide.

685
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:31,090
Although Yu Yang Ki is powerful,

686
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,700
he needs someone's help to make such a thing happen.

687
00:47:34,702 --> 00:47:36,470
The investigations on both cases were led...

688
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,255
by Lieutenant Oh Ki Hwan from the regional investigation unit.

689
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,340
Su Ah's case was big in the media, so it's understandable.

690
00:47:42,343 --> 00:47:45,270
But it's strange that the regional investigation unit wrapped up...

691
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,935
even Lee Tae Seok's case.

692
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:51,275
And they insisted it was a suicide, not a murder.

693
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,950
Jung Su Ah and Lee Tae Seok.

694
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,215
There is a connection between the death of the two.

695
00:47:58,826 --> 00:48:02,185
I have no access to the police,

696
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,755
so please do some research on that.

697
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:09,530
(Lieutenant Oh Ki Hwan)

698
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:12,355
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

699
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:17,270
It's been already months since Jung Su Ah case was closed.

700
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:19,710
You have received the case file too, haven't you?

701
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:23,150
We reported what we found from the on-the-spot inspection.

702
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,350
I know.

703
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:28,175
My question is why the inspection was done after two days.

704
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:31,150
There was a big fire at a residence in the district we're in charge of.

705
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,715
And there were over 10 casualties.

706
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:35,190
When an attempted murder...

707
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:36,390
and a fatal accident happen simultaneously,

708
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:38,030
where should we go first?

709
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:41,560
Is it our fault that we were told to go to the scene of a fire first?

710
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,270
No other fingerprints were found from the inspection...

711
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,300
than the suspect, Kim Han Su's.

712
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:46,940
Didn't you find that strange?

713
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:48,500
We found it strange, of course.

714
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,210
But our job is to inspect,

715
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,935
not to come to a conclusion of an investigation.

716
00:48:58,385 --> 00:48:59,650
(Regional Investigation Unit)

717
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,305
He got discharged.

718
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:02,550
"Discharged"?

719
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:05,650
Yes. The night before the forensics came to the scene,

720
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:08,060
only a conscripted policeman was watching the scene.

721
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:09,790
He was almost finished with his duty then.

722
00:49:09,797 --> 00:49:11,630
I'm sure he got discharged last month.

723
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:14,160
Could you give me his contact and address?

724
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,685
What?

725
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:19,940
He's not a conscripted policeman. He's just a regular citizen now.

726
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,170
I don't think I can give you his personal information.

727
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,610
He's not just a regular citizen.

728
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,605
There's a chance that he was involved in the damage of the scene.

729
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,905
Give me his contact. If anything happens, I'm in charge.

730
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:33,305
Goodness.

731
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,820
Many people are interested in and supporting...

732
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:41,320
the law on the reduction of private academies' business hours...

733
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:43,990
that you have suggested to the National Assembly.

734
00:49:43,998 --> 00:49:46,330
Did you expect it would be so highly supported?

735
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,700
Reducing the business hours of private academies...

736
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:52,295
have always been my political goal and pledge.

737
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:54,470
All I did was to keep my word.

738
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:57,495
I'm grateful to receive all the support.

739
00:49:57,511 --> 00:50:00,380
I also heard some from your party see it as a dangerous policy...

740
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:04,835
that sways your approval ratings in Namgang-gu.

741
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:06,780
I think a good politician...

742
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:09,675
must not concern too much about the party's opinion.

743
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:15,020
Luckily, I have a lot of supporters who encourage me.

744
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:16,955
I'll cheer for you, sir.

745
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:24,325
I can see people support you enthusiastically.

746
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,270
Some say this is your groundwork...

747
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,470
in order to run for the next President.

748
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,610
Could you say a few words about it?

749
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:37,035
I think it's too early to discuss things like that.

750
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:40,720
First, I wish this bill will be passed...

751
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:43,950
so our children can be both physically and mentally healthy.

752
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,015
That's good enough for me for now.

753
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:57,195
(The best single party, Single Light)

754
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,770
Excuse me.

755
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:05,610
Is this a club?

756
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:08,210
It says, "Single Light" on the sign.

757
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,750
I contacted the conscripted policeman...

758
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,610
who was at the scene of Jung Su Ah's case...

759
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,250
and he said he's working here.

760
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:15,820
He just got discharged from his duty and he's working hard.

761
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,090
Wait.

762
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:21,785
Sir and ma'am. No couples are allowed.

763
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:25,360
Couple? We look like a couple to you?

764
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:29,060
Couple? That's so offensive. I'm single.

765
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:30,600
You're still not allowed.

766
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:33,340
Anyone that was born before 1995 can't come in.

767
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,240
You look obviously old.

768
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:38,070
You'd better go party somewhere else.

769
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:39,810
1995? How old is that?

770
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:42,810
Forget it. I'm a prosecutor.

771
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:45,075
I need to talk to a staff here.

772
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,145
You're a prosecutor.

773
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,250
Which staff?

774
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:52,175
There's a man named Hwang Gi Taek, right?

775
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:54,860
They hired him about a month ago.

776
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,890
Right.

777
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,190
Take me to him.

778
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,885
This way, please.

779
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:03,330
Governmental authority. "I'm a prosecutor."

780
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:05,025
Well, I'm a teacher.

781
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:09,970
Of course I remember.

782
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:12,335
I was just idling until I got dragged there.

783
00:52:12,513 --> 00:52:14,680
And it was quite a shocking incident too.

784
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:17,010
I heard from the police station...

785
00:52:17,017 --> 00:52:19,875
that you were guarding the police line alone.

786
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,845
Have you by any chance left the scene for a while?

787
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:26,985
Well...

788
00:52:29,263 --> 00:52:31,790
We're not trying to blame you or anything.

789
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:34,300
It's an important clue that helps us find...

790
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:37,925
why the poor girl got murdered.

791
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:41,765
I didn't just leave the scene.

792
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:46,165
I was told to leave the scene by a superior authority.

793
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,065
Gosh, look at the breasts.

794
00:52:49,983 --> 00:52:52,075
Na na na na

795
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:55,845
Is she a doll? How can a person be so pretty?

796
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,345
The second I get discharged, I'll make a girlfriend like this.

797
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,245
You're working hard, all alone.

798
00:53:02,362 --> 00:53:04,355
Salute.

799
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,655
I was told to go out and take a break.

800
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,460
I was caught while using my phone, which I brought illegally,

801
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:10,570
so I felt guilty.

802
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:13,470
I was almost finished with my duty, so I didn't want to work.

803
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,665
Besides, I can't disobey the high-level executive.

804
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:17,335
"High-level executive"?

805
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:20,165
Who was that?

806
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,410
I don't know his name.

807
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,335
I got so flustered so I even forgot to check the entry log.

808
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,645
He looked like he was in in his 40s.

809
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:31,375
Right. He said he was a detective of the regional investigation unit.

810
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,685
Was he...

811
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,985
this man?

812
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,565
You're working hard, all alone.

813
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,795
Salute.

814
00:53:57,084 --> 00:53:59,510
It's him. I'm sure.

815
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:00,920
He told me to go outside.

816
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:02,520
He said that it was okay since he'd be leading the investigation...

817
00:54:02,522 --> 00:54:04,315
from the next day.

818
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:26,735
Okay.

819
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:30,175
Take care of it.

820
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:37,690
I wonder what's his relationship with Yu Yang Ki.

821
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,990
He planted a fingerprint at the Su Ah's murder scene,

822
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:42,615
and the murder of Lee Tae Seok was disguised as a suicide.

823
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,855
I don't understand.

824
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:46,600
Why did he do that?

825
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,200
He must have received something from him.

826
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,225
Or maybe he's got something held over.

827
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,255
It could be both.

828
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:54,995
We need to know this...

829
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:57,740
to prove that Yu Yang Ki is behind this.

830
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:00,410
To investigate Lieutenant Oh and Yu Yang Ki properly,

831
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:02,980
we need to remove Yang Sang Bae first,

832
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:06,335
but even Supreme Prosecutors' Office doesn't want to touch him.

833
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:09,505
So if anything, I will get fired first.

834
00:55:10,857 --> 00:55:12,515
Then...

835
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:17,015
Still, we must do everything we can.

836
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:20,625
Crazy Bulldog. You gave me that nickname.

837
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:24,195
Once I bite something, I never let it go.

838
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:28,365
You're right.

839
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:32,170
Let's get some benefit from governmental power.

840
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:34,835
I'll pay you back one day.

841
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:38,235
What are you talking about? This is my case.

842
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,120
To me, finding the criminal that murdered Su Ah...

843
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:46,785
would be repaying my debt to Han Su.

844
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,725
Good luck then. I'll call you.

845
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,155
Okay. Bye.

846
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,435
The criminal.

847
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,635
We will catch the criminal.

848
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:17,415
Could you drive more nicely?

849
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,795
Hyun Jung!

850
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,915
Hyun Jung!

851
00:56:57,464 --> 00:57:00,425
Hyun Jung!

852
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,255
Hyun Jung!

853
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,585
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

854
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:51,280
How could they do that to a prosecutor?

855
00:57:51,284 --> 00:57:53,110
Hyun Jung!

856
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,020
If there's a bad bud, you need to nip it right away...

857
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,190
before it can branch out.

858
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:01,620
Do you think there's anything that happens at our school...

859
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:03,790
that Beom Jin doesn't know about?

860
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:06,800
You and Ms. Ha are being used by that lawyer.

861
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,930
How could anyone be that brazen?

862
00:58:08,935 --> 00:58:12,700
We can share everything we know with the outside world.

863
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:14,440
- Who would dare... - Take it down!

864
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:16,810
If this gets out, we're not the only ones who will be hurt.

865
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,040
Get over here quickly.

866
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:20,880
If the police come first and prevent you from seeing him,

867
00:58:20,881 --> 00:58:23,310
we'll never know what Han Su tried to say that day.

868
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:27,480
Whether or not you ratted me out, the result is predetermined.

869
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:29,175
Han Su!

870
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:33,960
I'll help you...

871
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,015
get your law license back.

872
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:41,755
You really are quick.

873
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:46,125
What will it cost me?
