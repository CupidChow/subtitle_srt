1
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,500
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:22,085
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,965
(Episode 3)

4
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,725
Me too.

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,495
(Ahn Byung Ho versus Kim Hyung Kyu)

6
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:00,225
(Ahn Byung Ho versus Kim Hyung Kyu)

7
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:03,410
(Kim Hyung Kyu)

8
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,980
I want to bet on him too.

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,410
- Hello. - Smile.

10
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,235
- Send it to me. - One second.

11
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:14,645
(I trust you, Hyung Kyu. Show them the power of a loser.)

12
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:18,215
Let's go.

13
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,015
Let's see who wins.

14
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:21,990
Do you have any more?

15
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,060
All right. The betting is closed.

16
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:28,770
The title match of losers. The Shuttle Monster Championship.

17
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,400
"Shuttle Monster Fighter"...

18
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:34,365
starts now!

19
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,625
What is this?

20
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:12,035
A lunatics' party?

21
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,650
All right. The fighters will enter.

22
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,550
He reached the finals full of spirit.

23
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,190
One more win, and he won't be a minion anymore.

24
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,690
Also known as Porter,

25
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:28,585
Ahn Byung Ho!

26
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,785
- Go! - Let's do this!

27
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,695
He's from my German class.

28
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,500
You can do this!

29
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,870
Wait.

30
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:43,880
- You have no chance. - You'll lose.

31
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,250
His opponent is not going to be easy.

32
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,080
Forget the embarrassing past. He's not a minion anymore.

33
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,250
The winner of the first semester's Shuttle Monster Fighter.

34
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,050
A minion turned into a member of the clique.

35
00:02:56,059 --> 00:03:00,385
Kim Hyung Kyu!

36
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,660
- Kim Hyung Kyu! - Porter!

37
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,760
- Porter! - Porter!

38
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,515
Porter!

39
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:10,325
- Kim Hyung Kyu! - Porter!

40
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,640
Everyone, please take a step back.

41
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,435
Here we go. Ready.

42
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,305
Fight!

43
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,375
You've been fighting well. Let's have a good match.

44
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,105
- What? Okay. - Kim Hyung Kyu!

45
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,520
- Gosh! - No!

46
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,145
- No! - Come on!

47
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:36,330
That was a good one.

48
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,500
(Porter is doomed. Porter is going to die.)

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,555
Byung Ho, come on.

50
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,595
- Come on! - Hey!

51
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,770
What...

52
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:50,280
Byung Ho, you can do this.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,510
Well, let's see.

54
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,610
He's incredibly strong.

55
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:57,675
Look at that kick. Is he Son Heung Min?

56
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,150
You rat.

57
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,420
- Get up! - Come on!

58
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,920
He's still being kicked. He should get back up.

59
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,675
He's holding on to his legs.

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,260
Ahn Byung Ho should start fighting back.

61
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:12,900
He's just holding on to his opponent.

62
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:14,070
- What are you doing? - Get up!

63
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,330
What is he doing?

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,040
- Come on! - Hey!

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,240
- Get up! - Hey!

66
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,240
Come on!

67
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,070
It must be his strategy.

68
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,695
What...

69
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,780
Seriously.

70
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,780
(I'm going to kill Porter. I paid to watch this.)

71
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,635
- Come on! - Fight back!

72
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,775
This is ridiculous.

73
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,775
No.

74
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,975
I'm not in the position to...

75
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,790
I'll let real teachers deal with this.

76
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,285
- Get up! - What?

77
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,385
Do you want to end up like Han Su?

78
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,405
I can't do this.

79
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,835
I can't do this anymore.

80
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,575
I don't want to do this!

81
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:12,260
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

82
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,290
I did as you said.

83
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,185
I even worked at a convenience store...

84
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,800
to get you drinks and cigarettes.

85
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,370
And I kept silent in the classroom.

86
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,025
Why...

87
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,425
do you have to do this?

88
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,070
Why?

89
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,180
Because I can.

90
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,895
That's why.

91
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:37,105
What? Do you want to die?

92
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:40,745
Die if you can. Do it!

93
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:47,045
- Where is he going? - What's going on?

94
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,060
Do I look easy because I played with you?

95
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,785
Do I? Answer me, Ahn Byung Ho.

96
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:58,755
I can make you end up like Kim Han Su.

97
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:02,295
You'll live if you're lucky. Don't you think?

98
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,665
Go in there, and he'll die.

99
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,660
(Yu Beom Jin)

100
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,185
Yu Beom Jin.

101
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:29,555
- What did you... - If you go in there right now,

102
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:33,425
he really will die.

103
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,895
You're in my class too, right?

104
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,295
Class 2-3.

105
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,505
You may not know because you don't come to school,

106
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,890
but I'm the new assistant teacher,

107
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:52,660
and those kids talking about whether or not he lives...

108
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,160
are students in my class.

109
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,860
That makes it more dangerous.

110
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:59,515
At least he isn't bullied in the classroom right now.

111
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,500
If you step in, you can save him right now,

112
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,855
but true misery will begin for Byung Ho.

113
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,895
You won't stick to him...

114
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,665
and protect him 24 hours a day.

115
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:13,395
Hey!

116
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,310
- Where are you going? - I can't just let them be.

117
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,075
There's a way to help him without going out there.

118
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,645
Hey. What...

119
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,145
Darn it.

120
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,745
Hey.

121
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,985
Hey. Wait for me.

122
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,270
Hey. Look. See what?

123
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:42,995
Over 10,000 punks logged in to watch you fight.

124
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,010
But what? You refuse?

125
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,810
Then just die!

126
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,605
At least let them see you die.

127
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,220
Who knows?

128
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,950
You may survive like that rat Han Su.

129
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:57,145
No.

130
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,415
Hey. Wait.

131
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,555
Wait for me.

132
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,325
Hey, you can't...

133
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,635
Open the window.

134
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:18,810
What?

135
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,250
Hurry!

136
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,735
Darn it.

137
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,150
You jerk.

138
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:29,290
Isn't that dangerous?

139
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,090
Look at him. He has lost his mind.

140
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,145
- You'll die if you try to stop him. - You jerk.

141
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,085
Hey!

142
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,370
Okay. Now get out.

143
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:44,740
What? Is that all?

144
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,770
Don't worry. This will end the party tonight.

145
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,495
- Hey. How do you know... - Hurry!

146
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,135
Who is that? Which punk...

147
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:02,050
Hey, come with me.

148
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,545
Okay.

149
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,430
Where are they going?

150
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,945
- This sucks. - Seriously.

151
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,655
What's is going on?

152
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:42,645
Why is there no one here?

153
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,060
He must have run.

154
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,585
Check to see if the goods are safe.

155
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:51,655
Darn it!

156
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,335
Goodness.

157
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,350
Hey. Should we go out?

158
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,835
Should we? Where should we go?

159
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:07,475
I'll go back now.

160
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,720
Have a good night.

161
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,075
Wait. Hold on.

162
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,420
What was that earlier?

163
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:17,160
That lunatics' party where they almost killed a person.

164
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,615
It's a show that Jun Jae airs after gathering the kids.

165
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,485
A show?

166
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,025
He airs that craziness?

167
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,565
Did you come at this hour to watch that too?

168
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,940
I came to pick up something I left behind...

169
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,935
and went up when I heard the noise.

170
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,780
May I go now?

171
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,765
My driver is coming for me.

172
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,345
Kim Han Su.

173
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,985
Who's Kim Han Su?

174
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,505
I heard back at the rooftop.

175
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,605
"Do you want to end up like Han Su?"

176
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,260
Who is that? It didn't sound like anyone from our class.

177
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,085
Is he in another class?

178
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,915
He was in our class...

179
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,685
until last semester.

180
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,525
- Last semester? - Yes.

181
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,325
Something bad happened.

182
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,770
Is that it?

183
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,265
The one where a male student killed a female student?

184
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,680
I saw it on the news.

185
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,950
They used initials for the school name,

186
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,275
but it was such a big case.

187
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:50,960
A female student from a prestigious high school...

188
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,715
- was killed by a male stalker... - It's a wound...

189
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,185
for us.

190
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,355
Our friends who sat with us in our classroom,

191
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,425
studied with us,

192
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,125
ate with us, and spent nearly half the day with us had that happen.

193
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,710
The entire class received counseling,

194
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,650
and some refused to come to school due to the trauma and transferred.

195
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,175
And those who remained tried...

196
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,675
to forget and move on.

197
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,945
Even now.

198
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,360
It may be an interesting story to some,

199
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:29,845
but it's a wound...

200
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,785
for us.

201
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:38,095
Never talk about anything related to those two kids.

202
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:42,040
That's the unwritten rule among the students here.

203
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:44,640
Many of the kids are still struggling with it.

204
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,165
Of course,

205
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,865
punks like Jun Jae don't care.

206
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,720
I see.

207
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,090
Thanks for telling me.

208
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,490
I'll be more sensitive going forward.

209
00:12:58,494 --> 00:12:59,975
I'd appreciate that.

210
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:03,060
Please act like we haven't met when you see me in class.

211
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,330
If Jun Jae finds out I told him about you,

212
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,500
he may make my life miserable as well.

213
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,930
Of course. That's a given. Don't worry.

214
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,455
Your secret's safe with me.

215
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,730
Darn it. It was about to get good.

216
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,355
That moron Porter is dead.

217
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,170
They're demanding to get their stars back.

218
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,395
Over 1,000 followers unfollowed us.

219
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,070
What now?

220
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,965
What else? We need to schedule the next fight.

221
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,910
Post a notice that there will be a rematch a week from now.

222
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,640
Appease the crowd in the meantime...

223
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,265
so no one riots.

224
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,535
Okay.

225
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,345
What's this?

226
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,590
This buffoon.

227
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,090
Hey. Get moving! Don't you want to go home?

228
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,685
Yes. I'll finish cleaning soon.

229
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,315
Forget it.

230
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,985
We're leaving, so clean all of this up before you go.

231
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,825
You weak punk. You couldn't even beat Porter.

232
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,215
Why that...

233
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:02,750
Pour the broth when the Congressman is here.

234
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,505
We don't want it to get cold.

235
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,475
Get the traditional drink for the aperitif.

236
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:12,445
Son! Son. Son. You came just in time.

237
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,090
Your father's here. Go say hi. He's in his study.

238
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,745
Okay, Mom.

239
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,025
No, no. Not that.

240
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:27,355
Seriously. Nothing gets done without me.

241
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,610
So you think it should remain in force...

242
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,880
since it reflects family rights in Korea.

243
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:34,580
Are you saying laws against patricide...

244
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,250
and matricide will correct our society's perception...

245
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:38,950
toward family and filial piety?

246
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:39,980
Naturally.

247
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,250
Laws are bound to change people's perceptions.

248
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,690
The law changes people's perceptions.

249
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,330
That sounds to me like the government...

250
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,785
is forcing its values onto the people.

251
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,330
What do you mean, "force"?

252
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:57,840
Being angry about a child murdering their parent...

253
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,270
is a natural emotion all human beings must feel.

254
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:02,440
You're right.

255
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:05,340
However, that emotion should not control the law.

256
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:06,840
Legally speaking...

257
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,480
Were you watching that?

258
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,280
You should've watched it live.

259
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:12,350
It's an achievement the parents acquired by choice.

260
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,320
A patricide law that increases punishment...

261
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,250
for someone who had no choice...

262
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,490
is unfair and unconstitutional.

263
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,230
However, this law...

264
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,560
reflects the ethics held by our society.

265
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,860
Over 40 percent of the murderers...

266
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,330
who killed their parents were physically, mentally,

267
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,230
or sexually victimized by their parents.

268
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,170
In contrast, only seven percent were immoral murders.

269
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:33,800
Do you still believe this law...

270
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,795
corrects the perception of family and filial piety...

271
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,780
Hello, sir.

272
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:46,780
Prevent the most recent debate battle from being viewed.

273
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,890
Have an investigator delete all downloads...

274
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:51,615
and the program information from the homepage.

275
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm disappointed. You still don't know any better.

276
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:02,330
- Father... - Everything you say and do...

277
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,525
affects the people's opinions of me.

278
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,940
You might think that you won that debate.

279
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,840
But the only thing people will remember is...

280
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,180
that Congressman Yu Yang Ki's son...

281
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:16,435
defended immoral crimes.

282
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,845
I'm sorry. That was careless of me.

283
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,500
Remember...

284
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,185
that you're my son at all times.

285
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,895
It may be for my best interest,

286
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,455
but it will also be for yours.

287
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,800
(Jung Su Ah)

288
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,585
(Kim Han Su, Stalking)

289
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,735
Someone who was obsessively stalking Jung Su Ah...

290
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,105
put all the blame on Kim Han Su.

291
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,390
(Limited-edition collaboration)

292
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,985
Detention center.

293
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,455
Hoodie.

294
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,795
Sneakers from a streetwear brand.

295
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,270
The last Cheonmyung High School student...

296
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,895
that visited Kim Han Su before his suicide.

297
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,935
(Na Ye Ri, Idol Trainee)

298
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,150
As soon as Kim Han Su's trial was put on hold,

299
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:03,150
all the media went silent at once,

300
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,220
and all the articles disappeared.

301
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,645
As if they'd been waiting for it.

302
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,055
Just you wait.

303
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,765
I'll make sure you can't sleep at night.

304
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,405
- Good morning. - Good morning.

305
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,990
- Hi. - Hurry up.

306
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,675
Hey, are you two in the same class?

307
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,345
Did you do your homework?

308
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,900
You should run. You're late.

309
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:55,410
Gosh, here we go again. The school turns into a hospital.

310
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,370
Both for the students and us.

311
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,635
I know. It's all starting again.

312
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,875
Wait.

313
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,480
What's going on here?

314
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,320
- Good morning. - Good morning.

315
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,190
Hi. Good morning.

316
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,190
What is this?

317
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:15,390
What he's doing is too appropriate to the point that it annoys me.

318
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,700
There was a time when I was like him too.

319
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,070
I was absolutely full of enthusiasm.

320
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,970
But I wonder how long that would last.

321
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:27,095
Overzealous teachers get burned out faster too.

322
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:28,440
Based on what I've seen.

323
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:32,035
What's with you two? I think what he's doing is nice.

324
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,280
"Nice"? Is she serious?

325
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,750
Hi. Good morning.

326
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,835
Hi.

327
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,245
Let's go.

328
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,660
- Hi. - You're actually doing it.

329
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,100
Oh, hi.

330
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,330
I would have joined you, but I failed to get up early.

331
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,570
I thought you drank a lot last night.

332
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,200
Your liver must still be young.

333
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,370
No. I just live close from here.

334
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,325
- Hi. - Hi.

335
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,495
Jun Jae.

336
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:13,280
Carry your own bag. Don't make your friend carry it.

337
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:16,475
No. It's just a game.

338
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,275
A game?

339
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,860
What game?

340
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,585
Well...

341
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,495
We played rock-paper-scissors.

342
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,440
The loser carries the winner's bag.

343
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,880
That's right. Rock-paper-scissors.

344
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,365
I lost. It's true.

345
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,035
I see. You three must be quite close.

346
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,850
Still, you're at school now. Carry your bag yourself.

347
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:52,415
Other teachers might get the wrong idea.

348
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,655
Are you happy now?

349
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,900
Yes. That's much better.

350
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,495
Go in. See you at the morning assembly.

351
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,880
Before, I would have let it go.

352
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,590
But all kinds of things bother me these days.

353
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,090
Who knows if they really played rock-paper-scissors...

354
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,615
or he just forced the kid to carry his bag.

355
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,985
I know.

356
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,440
- Good morning. - Good morning.

357
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,870
What are our young teachers doing here in pairs?

358
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,495
Are you on a date or something?

359
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:53,650
Oh, my. That hurts me.

360
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:57,590
Since yesterday, you're my only soulmate.

361
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,475
Here's a heart for you.

362
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:03,990
Mr. Gi, why are you so sweet?

363
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,500
Have a cup of coffee with me after the morning assembly.

364
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:08,800
I have something to tell you.

365
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,400
Coffee sounds nice. See you in a while.

366
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:13,595
- See you. - Please.

367
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,880
Are you okay?

368
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,180
How can he be so shameless?

369
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:22,210
- He's sucking up to... - Stop.

370
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,405
You're a Korean teacher. Watch your language.

371
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,990
But I guess he is a little obnoxious.

372
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,775
Very.

373
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:34,445
Everyone's personality is made up of various facets.

374
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:36,990
"Various"?

375
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,855
See you in a bit.

376
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,770
"Various"?

377
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,770
"Various facets"?

378
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:44,300
- I guess. - I'm not sure.

379
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:45,925
Let's just go.

380
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,465
- Shin Ji Ho. - Yes.

381
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,135
- Yun Kyung Min. - Yes.

382
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,710
- Jung Do Yun. - Yes.

383
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,535
Ahn Byung Ho.

384
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,205
Isn't Byung Ho here yet?

385
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,620
Byung Ho, be on time.

386
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,915
If you're late again, you'll get a penalty point.

387
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,230
Byung Ho, what happened to your face?

388
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:15,270
Nothing.

389
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,170
Nothing? Let me see.

390
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:21,155
What happened? Did you fight with someone?

391
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:25,195
Look at those bruises.

392
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,810
I fell off my bike yesterday.

393
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:31,335
That's how I got hurt. I'm fine now.

394
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,075
Are you sure?

395
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:45,630
Ms. Ha, let's finish attendance first.

396
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,955
He says he's fine.

397
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,525
Okay.

398
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,565
Those bruises can't be from falling off a bike.

399
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,210
I've fallen off my bike many times,

400
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,710
but I've never gotten bruises like his.

401
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:06,635
Were there fists on the ground or something?

402
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,220
Calm down.

403
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:09,790
He says that's not what happened.

404
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,120
That makes it even more serious.

405
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:15,245
He can't say anything after being beaten up so bad.

406
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:21,455
Could it be that he's being bullied by a group?

407
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,970
It happened on the second day of the semester.

408
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,670
It might mean that it's been going on for a while.

409
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,195
Hold on. Just a second.

410
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:32,140
Let's say he really didn't fall off his bike.

411
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,880
Still, it might have been just an ordinary fight.

412
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:38,080
Or maybe he ran into a thug on his way to school.

413
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:41,775
We should not jump to a conclusion before finding out more.

414
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:46,320
Even if he is being bullied,

415
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:48,460
if we try to help him without thinking it out,

416
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,945
it might only make things harder for him.

417
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,270
I have an appointment with Ms. Jun.

418
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:00,840
I'll see you at lunch.

419
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:02,395
Okay.

420
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,460
You did a good job.

421
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,285
Continue with that from now on too, okay?

422
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,340
You'll have another chance.

423
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,325
If you mess up again,

424
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:37,125
I don't know what I'll do to you.

425
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:56,415
- Here you go. - Thank you.

426
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:03,785
I want you to be in charge of the school's discipline.

427
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,070
School discipline?

428
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:09,370
The official title would be disciplinary teacher.

429
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,110
Your job will be basically be to just keep the students...

430
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:13,665
from causing any trouble.

431
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,080
Was it called dean of students back in the days?

432
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:21,205
Yes, exactly. You're quick-witted.

433
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:25,720
Since you're a young and healthy single man,

434
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,615
students will listen to you well.

435
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:31,960
You can count on me.

436
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:35,555
I'll do my best to keep the students in line.

437
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,355
You're one trustworthy man.

438
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:40,300
Then I will leave it up to you.

439
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:41,765
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,095
This smells nice.

441
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:49,980
A handsome man makes even instant coffee taste good.

442
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:52,405
Ma'am. Cheers.

443
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,975
Now things are surely going to get tough.

444
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,530
Gosh, being a disciplinary teacher isn't an easy task.

445
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,715
It will kill you.

446
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,300
Didn't you see the news recently?

447
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:10,230
A high school teacher committed suicide due to work stress.

448
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,670
It turned out the stress was from disciplining students.

449
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,540
School violence.

450
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:18,710
Both the victim and the perpetrator are our students.

451
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:20,710
This can't be worse.

452
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:23,880
We can't just say, "Be nice to your friends" like back in the old days.

453
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:25,680
That's going to cause big trouble.

454
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,975
Parents these days hire lawyers for their children's fights.

455
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:33,690
How scary is that?

456
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:34,830
If you get unlucky,

457
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,045
you'll have to stand in the court instead of in the classroom.

458
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm scared.

459
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,885
I never want to end up in court because I'm too scared.

460
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:48,340
Actually, court is not such a scary...

461
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:51,610
I heard there are so many scandalous attorneys these days.

462
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,110
One teacher I know said...

463
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:56,980
that his attorney told him to say anything he knows, so he did it.

464
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,450
But the second he's put on the stand,

465
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:01,520
the attorney changed his attitude and started to attack him.

466
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:04,760
Both the prosecutor and the attorney attacked him.

467
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,660
Mr. Gi, you should spare yourself from now on.

468
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,560
So you don't have to be dragged into court needlessly.

469
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,955
Especially Class 3 is...

470
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:22,840
I heard there was an incident.

471
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,740
A boy stabbed a girl and then attempted suicide...

472
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:27,365
Mr. Gi.

473
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,505
You'd better watch your mouth.

474
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:35,605
Don't say anything when you don't know the whole story.

475
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,815
We don't know yet.

476
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,645
We don't know who did it yet.

477
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:56,125
(Occupied)

478
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,665
When will you pay me back?

479
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,735
Do you want your parents to know about this?

480
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,975
If you don't pay back the interest by today,

481
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,845
you'll be streamed too.

482
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:20,185
Goodness. This is for professionals.

483
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,025
Where did you get this?

484
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:29,395
Does that matter?

485
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:31,695
No.

486
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,865
As long as it's in good condition, we don't care.

487
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,780
This will pay back all the interest and the principal, 300 dollars.

488
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:40,305
What do you say?

489
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:44,020
I'm being generous since this is your first deal with us.

490
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,320
There's no commission either.

491
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,475
If you've got more of these, bring them.

492
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,715
Okay.

493
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:54,500
Then can I borrow some more?

494
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:55,955
I mean, money.

495
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,355
- How much do you need? - 300.

496
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:03,465
No, 500. I need that money.

497
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:08,680
Okay. Since you paid back the principal,

498
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:10,465
I will do you a favor.

499
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,750
But if your payment is late again,

500
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:16,375
we'll sell that thing right away.

501
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:18,175
Okay.

502
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,785
I'll make sure to repay the interest.

503
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,315
I'm starting a part-time job next week.

504
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:35,025
Next is the embezzlement of Moobang Construction.

505
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,365
Prosecutor Park, you take care of it.

506
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:46,020
The public is greatly interested in this case, so be extra careful.

507
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,835
Okay, sir. You can count on me.

508
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,605
Next is...

509
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:53,220
a sexual assault in a bar.

510
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,530
A police officer assaulted by a drunk man.

511
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,460
Theft at a convenience store.

512
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,615
CCTV hacking.

513
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,585
I'll give all these four...

514
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,000
to Prosecutor Cha.

515
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,455
What?

516
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:08,310
What's the matter? You don't want to work?

517
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,440
Well, that's not it.

518
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:13,410
But you've been giving me only these kinds of cases the past months.

519
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,635
"These kinds of cases"?

520
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:17,910
Prosecutors don't choose what they want to work on.

521
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,980
Are you saying you want to only work on cases that get attention...

522
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:23,005
like a murder case at a prestigious high school?

523
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,415
No. I'll take these.

524
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:39,770
Are you bullying her all right?

525
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:41,070
Of course, I am.

526
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:43,440
The biggest frustration you experience at work...

527
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:46,410
is when your hard work doesn't pay off.

528
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:48,750
I'm sure she's having a horrible time.

529
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,235
Good.

530
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:53,280
Keep pushing her until she wants to quit herself.

531
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:54,820
I don't care if she starts her own business...

532
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:55,950
or goes to a different region.

533
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,950
Just make sure I don't see that witch around.

534
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,575
Yes, sir.

535
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:06,600
Prosecutor Cha, what are all these?

536
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:09,655
I was just assigned some trivial cases...

537
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:12,270
I can't call them that.

538
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,825
All cases are evenly important.

539
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:17,970
These are precious cases I was just assigned.

540
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,310
All of them?

541
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,750
But you're still working on other cases.

542
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,550
You might die from overwork.

543
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,280
They're saying I will never get...

544
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:27,605
to investigate the Kim Han Su case.

545
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,875
Mr. Kim.

546
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,215
You know what my dream is, right?

547
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,020
Yes, I do.

548
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:36,445
The first female Prosecutor General.

549
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:41,015
Until that dream comes true, I will never leave.

550
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,655
We'll see.

551
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,855
I will fight this through and crawl back up.

552
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,310
I hate when we have to change classrooms.

553
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:54,010
Why are we the ones that have to move?

554
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,310
Isn't this sex discrimination?

555
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:56,880
What's wrong? I like it.

556
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:59,180
We get to look inside a girls' classroom.

557
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,820
Not only that.

558
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:05,175
We naturally get the opportunity to build relationships...

559
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,545
I didn't bring my book.

560
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:09,615
What's there to worry about?

561
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:11,915
We have Porter.

562
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,915
Porter!

563
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:23,395
Let me borrow it.

564
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,365
Thanks.

565
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:49,500
If someone says, "Let's take it to court" to you,

566
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,855
what do you think that means?

567
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,200
As we're sensible citizens of a constitutional state,

568
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:56,240
let's not use violence and insult,

569
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,495
and let the law resolve the dispute?

570
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,865
No way.

571
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,250
In Korea... I mean, in countries all around the world,

572
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:07,650
"Let's take it to court" means...

573
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:11,005
"I'm going to give you..."

574
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:13,745
"a serious problem."

575
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,645
That's what it means.

576
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,400
It's fair if there's something you actually did wrong.

577
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:26,940
Sometimes,

578
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:29,425
you're forced to pay for what you didn't do.

579
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:32,110
Why are you taking that?

580
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,610
This is your homework.

581
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:35,980
Explain why I have to give this phone back to him...

582
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:37,665
using the law.

583
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,050
What in the world are you doing?

584
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,020
Don't get physical. We'll take this to court.

585
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:45,960
- You... - Article 329 of the Criminal Act.

586
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,460
A person who steals another's property...

587
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:49,960
shall be punished by imprisonment...

588
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:53,355
for not more than six years or by a fine not exceeding 10,000 dollars.

589
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:02,570
Where did he find that?

590
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,565
But it was a disciplinary action based on school regulation.

591
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,150
School regulations are internal regulations set by the school.

592
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:13,505
So it's not valid when conflicted with the Criminal Act.

593
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:16,905
You can give him some penalty points at best.

594
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,675
Wrong answer.

595
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,060
Well, not everything was wrong.

596
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,030
If that's your answer,

597
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,800
I'll give you 50 points.

598
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:29,030
Since I don't intend to possess this phone illegally,

599
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:30,570
it doesn't constitute theft.

600
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:34,800
Plus, I was going to give this phone back to him after class.

601
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:37,525
Will it still be considered a crime?

602
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,135
Section 2 of Article 37 of the Constitution.

603
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:52,960
No one may invade another's privacy, which is a fundamental right,

604
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,475
but it may be restricted by law.

605
00:36:57,065 --> 00:36:59,360
Elementary and Secondary Education Act section 18.4 states...

606
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,800
a teacher must protect the rights of a student identified by law.

607
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,000
According to the law on student rights in Seoul,

608
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:08,370
a teacher may not inspect or seize...

609
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:13,140
a student's personal property unless necessary for safety.

610
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,880
However, according to section 12 of the Fundamentals of Education Act,

611
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:18,280
as per the school rules and the student's duties to follow them,

612
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:22,205
you should be able to tell him to turn it off and put it away.

613
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,715
Perfect. That's correct.

614
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,985
You get a 100.

615
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:38,070
Do you understand why you must pay attention in my class now?

616
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,725
If you don't know the law,

617
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:42,425
you will be wronged.

618
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:47,395
Of course, you had a stellar attorney this time.

619
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,710
Why must you learn the law?

620
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,050
It's simple.

621
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:54,150
It's a guideline to tell you whether you or the other person...

622
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:55,850
will be the one in trouble.

623
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,520
As you know, you don't get a trial run in life.

624
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,190
To make sure you are not wronged,

625
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,360
let's learn this thing call "the law" closely...

626
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,860
with me from now on. Okay?

627
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,985
- Okay. - Okay.

628
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,470
Die.

629
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:16,170
Die. Die already. Die. All of you, die!

630
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,170
Darn it! Die already!

631
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,050
Seriously. You die too. Die. Die. Darn it.

632
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,610
- Seriously. - Gi Hoon.

633
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:25,210
Do you play with your mouth?

634
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,105
That's enough already.

635
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:28,920
Darn it!

636
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:32,175
I died. Darn it.

637
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,030
Darn it.

638
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:42,330
How dare a temp judge me?

639
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:46,370
Hey, even if he is a temp, he went to Hanguk Law.

640
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:47,440
So what?

641
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:50,640
How much could a loser who didn't pass the bar exam know?

642
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:54,565
I like that he isn't an old geezer. He's fun, too.

643
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:58,610
Let's go. We have to get to class.

644
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,105
Okay.

645
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,260
Did you give permission?

646
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,485
They gathered at the rooftop yesterday.

647
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,330
Oh, that?

648
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:21,825
It was the first day and all, so I let them play. Why?

649
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:25,895
The new assistant teacher was at the door to the rooftop.

650
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,610
I think he saw everything.

651
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,280
Everything Jun Jae did at the rooftop.

652
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,765
What?

653
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:34,150
Then he knew everything and played dumb during attendance?

654
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:35,520
Even during class, too.

655
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:38,375
He pretended not to know what happened to Byung Ho.

656
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:44,015
This is amusing.

657
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,655
Mess with the new temp.

658
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,270
Mess with him?

659
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:59,140
I thought he saw us air the Shuttle Monster Fight.

660
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,340
Exactly.

661
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,650
We need to know what he's made of.

662
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,105
You need to get revenge for how humiliated you were today.

663
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,375
Forget it if you're scared.

664
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,645
But in exchange, I'm shutting this place down today.

665
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:17,815
Choose. I won't force you.

666
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,480
A high schooler sold handmade items to collect money to donate...

667
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,180
to youths outside of school has been the talk of the town.

668
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,610
Let's meet with the student with a heart of gold.

669
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,635
Hello. Please introduce yourself.

670
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:46,190
Hello, I'm Han Tae Ra, a junior at Cheonmyung High School.

671
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,060
It's particularly shocking that you accomplished something...

672
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:51,490
that's difficult for even adults to do.

673
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:54,960
Please tell us how you started and the process.

674
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:58,670
I was always sad that there were kids my age...

675
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,240
who weren't being protected at school or at home.

676
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:04,710
I thought rather than simply collecting money,

677
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,110
it would be more meaningful to give them money...

678
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:11,110
that I made by selling items that I made by hand.

679
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:13,180
She is very thoughtful...

680
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:15,220
and equally talented.

681
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,705
From Cheonmyung High School, with TNC, I am Ko Ah Jin.

682
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:21,290
You were great!

683
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,530
- You did great, Tae Ra. - You were great.

684
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,700
It usually takes multiple takes.

685
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,030
You're meant for TV.

686
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:29,770
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

687
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,470
That's right. You're delivering the donation next week, right?

688
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:35,240
Yes. I'm having a charity party as well,

689
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,940
so please come.

690
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:38,240
I will.

691
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,580
You're so pretty.

692
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,405
You're the best.

693
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:46,920
It's so pretty.

694
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,090
Can I really have this?

695
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,120
Yes. Everyone can have one.

696
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,020
I bought one for everyone in our class.

697
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:55,420
- Thank you! - Oh my gosh.

698
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:59,230
Tae Ra, you are incredible. You designed this yourself too.

699
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,315
You're so amazing.

700
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:04,985
No, no. This.

701
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:18,280
What is this?

702
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,605
Take it. It's for you.

703
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:23,120
I never bought this.

704
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:26,220
I know. I bought one for everyone in our class.

705
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,560
So take it. Don't feel bad.

706
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:31,145
It'll be used for a good cause anyway.

707
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,600
A good cause?

708
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:36,155
Your extracurricular activities for your college applications?

709
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:45,110
You've got issues. You don't know how to receive kindness from others.

710
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:48,340
I don't need kindness. I'll pay for it myself.

711
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,005
How much is it?

712
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,505
Really? It's 300 dollars.

713
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:02,730
I know I bought it to donate,

714
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,700
but I couldn't use cheap material. We're going to wear them after all.

715
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:09,330
I used amethyst on a rose gold base.

716
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,525
It's not expensive when you consider the materials.

717
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:16,665
Here. I'll give you the rest tomorrow.

718
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,240
Forget it.

719
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:22,680
Just take a nice video of me performing at the charity party.

720
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,705
I don't know about anything else, but you take really good videos.

721
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:29,320
Tae Ra.

722
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:30,850
- This is so pretty. - It is.

723
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,720
- This is real? - So pretty.

724
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:35,275
- Look. - You can put it on your hair.

725
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,960
(Ahn Byung Ho, Son Jun Jae, Hyung Kyu, bag)

726
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:42,415
(Ahn Byung Ho, face wound)

727
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:50,195
Byung Ho!

728
00:43:51,112 --> 00:43:52,540
- Hey. - Give me one too.

729
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,340
- This will last a week. - I want one.

730
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:55,340
- You've got three of them. - Why don't you give me back...

731
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,105
Look at those bruises.

732
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:59,550
I fell off my bike yesterday.

733
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,550
That's how I got hurt. I'm fine now.

734
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,750
If we try to help him without thinking it out,

735
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:07,175
it might only make things harder for him.

736
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:10,660
(Son Jun Jae)

737
00:44:10,665 --> 00:44:12,915
(Ahn Byung Ho, face wound)

738
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,055
That's right.

739
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:20,155
As long as I don't make things harder for him, right?

740
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,395
Hey!

741
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:02,650
You punk.

742
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,880
What is he...

743
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:06,480
Did I or did I not say to come half an hour earlier...

744
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:09,090
because we have to take inventory?

745
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,120
Are you deaf? Have you no respect for your boss?

746
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,190
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:14,720
Sorry? Do you think sorry cuts it?

748
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:16,185
Excuse me.

749
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:21,030
- What is it? - What are you doing to a child?

750
00:45:21,035 --> 00:45:22,715
What?

751
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,455
What is it? Why did you stop talking?

752
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,125
Well...

753
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,435
I want a lottery ticket right this instant.

754
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,195
What?

755
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:37,065
Lottery ticket?

756
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:41,220
I had a really good dream last night.

757
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,390
It was of a big fat pig with a nasty temper.

758
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:46,020
Of all the...

759
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:49,360
If you had dreamed of a dragon,

760
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:51,585
you would be out gobbling people up, right?

761
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,930
If the balance doesn't add up,

762
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:57,625
the deficiency will be covered by your salary.

763
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,225
Good luck with the lottery.

764
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:18,575
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

765
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:21,960
What brings you here?

766
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:24,085
I was worried about you, so I followed you.

767
00:46:24,298 --> 00:46:26,255
The bruises on your face too.

768
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,600
I thought you wouldn't want to talk about it in the classroom.

769
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:31,655
Don't mind about it. It's not a big deal.

770
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:33,725
Byung Ho.

771
00:46:33,908 --> 00:46:35,770
It's because you're scared, right?

772
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:39,325
Are you worried they might bully you even more if you tell me?

773
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,495
- If so, I can help... - What can you do?

774
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:45,705
What?

775
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:50,145
You're right. I'm being bullied.

776
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,705
So what?

777
00:46:53,627 --> 00:46:55,775
You just saw it.

778
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,185
I get bullied outside of school too.

779
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:03,470
We hear about this on the news all the time.

780
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,925
At work, in armies,

781
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:09,055
in hospitals, in colleges. It happens everywhere.

782
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:12,195
Even if you graduate high school...

783
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,935
and go out into the world,

784
00:47:15,316 --> 00:47:18,410
if you don't have power, money,

785
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,580
and connections, you get bullied.

786
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,075
Am I wrong?

787
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:26,315
Do you think I have never thought about it?

788
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:30,045
I considered every option.

789
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:33,715
Telling you.

790
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,330
Reporting to the police.

791
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:38,130
I even considered fighting back as if I've got nothing to lose.

792
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:39,625
But you know what?

793
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,155
I can't afford that.

794
00:47:44,678 --> 00:47:47,265
I'm busy enough studying while working a part-time job.

795
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:49,910
I don't have time to prove who assaulted me and how.

796
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,435
So...

797
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,305
just leave.

798
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:57,645
I need to work.

799
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,475
Byung Ho.

800
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:15,995
What can you do?

801
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,310
if you don't have power, money,

802
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,440
and connections, you get bullied.

803
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:22,895
Am I wrong?

804
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,760
Sorry. Didn't you go home yet?

805
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:44,000
No, I have some work to do.

806
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,170
What's up?

807
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,325
I would like to use this room for career counseling.

808
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:49,870
Can I?

809
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:53,535
Of course. You can use it as much as you like.

810
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,445
(Student Counseling Center)

811
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:22,325
What was that?

812
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:24,895
She looked somewhat...

813
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:33,275
Have a seat. I have a lesson after this.

814
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,775
Please follow this schedule starting from tomorrow.

815
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,300
Make sure to update the schedule with the exact dates...

816
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,030
and keep it confidential.

817
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:50,330
This paper can't be copied or photographed,

818
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:52,300
so as long as you don't mess up, it'll be fine.

819
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:55,125
We've been doing this for two years, so I'm sure you can take care...

820
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:02,165
What does that mean?

821
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:05,665
I want to quit.

822
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,605
I have been thinking a lot...

823
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:11,475
since that happened to Su Ah.

824
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,090
I know it's been hard for you too, but...

825
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,615
Hard?

826
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,745
For me?

827
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:20,515
Forget it.

828
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:22,715
How are you going to quit?

829
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,125
Did you think I would say,

830
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,340
"Okay. You can quit."

831
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:30,510
"Thank you for everything."

832
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:32,465
and just let you go?

833
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:35,580
Of course, you can't just quit.

834
00:50:35,582 --> 00:50:38,705
Tell me. You don't really want to quit, right?

835
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,675
You're just trying to lessen your guilt.

836
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,520
"I tried to quit, but she wouldn't let me."

837
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:49,345
"There was nothing I could do. I did everything I could do."

838
00:50:49,596 --> 00:50:51,590
- Like this. - No.

839
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:53,415
I really...

840
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:55,630
Could you have some responsibility?

841
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,830
Once you start it, you have to finish it.

842
00:50:57,838 --> 00:50:59,625
You're an adult.

843
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:04,065
Stop whining over nothing.

849
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:34,755
What? What's wrong with this?

850
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:42,135
Ms. Ha.

851
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,480
Yes, go ahead.

852
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:47,120
Do the assistant teachers have no access...

853
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:49,535
to the student record?

854
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:51,890
No. Only the homeroom teachers...

855
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:54,345
are supposed to have access to the student record.

856
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,890
But an assistant teacher is half a homeroom teacher.

857
00:51:57,898 --> 00:52:00,630
I need to know about the students in order to guide them...

858
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:02,085
Why?

859
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:06,270
You weren't interested in who beat up your student...

860
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:08,225
and where it happened.

861
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:10,370
What are you so curious about?

862
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,040
It's not like I want to know a certain thing.

863
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,450
I just thought it would be nice to learn about the students in general.

864
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,350
Why don't you...

865
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:20,780
try learning that by talking to each one of them?

866
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:23,035
Don't try to cut corners.

867
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:27,290
Now, I'll go supervise the self-study session.

868
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:28,745
Okay.

869
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:52,150
(Lee Gi Hoon)

870
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:53,635

(Formed a photography club)

874
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,645
Photography club?

875
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:06,300
Then he...

876
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,455
What are you doing now?

877
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:14,355
I was just turning off the laptop for you.

878
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,870
The electricity we use at school is paid by the citizens,

879
00:53:17,878 --> 00:53:20,935
so I think we should save the energy...

880
00:53:23,884 --> 00:53:26,080
I guess I should make sure I log out from now on.

881
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:28,180
If you have nothing to do, just go home, Mr. Gi.

882
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:29,635
Okay.

883
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:36,830
I must be traumatized by what I saw the other day.

884
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,585
My body was reacting before I knew.

885
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,515
What's the big deal about the student record?

886
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:46,085
She's so scary.

887
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:49,770
Oh, my. Mr. Gi.

888
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:51,610
You haven't gone home yet.

889
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:54,735
I'm glad you haven't. I want to talk to you.

890
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:57,080
Sure. Let's talk.

891
00:53:57,084 --> 00:53:58,565
Sure.

892
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:06,460
Why aren't you telling me?

893
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,720
Gi Hoon, where have you been?

894
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:09,160
Just leave me alone.

895
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,815
Okay, sorry.

896
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,115
And what did she say?

897
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:17,225
I went to many places, but...

898
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:18,830
Beom Jin is here.

899
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,100
- Beom Jin. - Hi.

900
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:21,725
- Long time no see. - Hey.

901
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,565
All right.

902
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:26,395
Now, shall we begin?

903
00:54:26,747 --> 00:54:30,265
Our 1st adjustment meeting of the 2nd semester of the junior year.

904
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,750
Why would so many cars pass through the back gate...

905
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,965
at this hour?

906
00:55:12,426 --> 00:55:14,660
Is everything ready?

907
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:16,090
Yes, Mr. Lee.

908
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:19,545
All the parents have arrived for the interview.

909
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,125
Do not let anyone in here. No one can see our guests.

910
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,750
What are they doing in there...

911
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,005
while having me guard the corridor?

912
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:52,985
Ms. Jo, what brings you here...

913
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:56,755
Hold on.

914
00:55:56,803 --> 00:55:59,740
Ms. Jun told me I shouldn't let anyone in.

915
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,225
It's Mr. Lee's order.

916
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:05,640
You're fast.

917
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:08,810
After only a few days here, you've already sided with them?

918
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:12,305
Pardon? I've sided with them?

919
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:15,635
Then again, I'm not in the position to criticize you.

920
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:25,515
Good luck. I'm sick of it.

921
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:29,055
Well...

922
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:39,270
I can't give up the math contest top prize to anyone.

923
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,365
It has to be mine.

924
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,480
Are you kidding?

925
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,110
First semester's Science Olympiad was yours too.

926
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,320
If you take all the important prizes in natural sciences,

927
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,620
are we supposed to give up on our GPA and take the entrance exam?

928
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:52,820
What's past is past. If you think it's unfair, let's compete for real.

929
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,090
When it comes to math, I'm second to none.

930
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:55,890
Even if we compete for real, the top prize will be...

931
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:57,545
Are you really that confident?

932
00:57:03,136 --> 00:57:07,355
Then should I participate in the school math contest too?

933
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:11,370
If we compete for real, I might win the top prize in every subject.

934
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:13,480
How would you like that?

935
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,410
Beom Jin, what I mean is...

936
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:18,310
Don't forget why we started this meeting in the first place.

937
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:20,720
Predators should not attack each other.

938
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,375
There are enough deer for all of us to feed on anyway.

939
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:34,830
All right. Let's get back to our discussion.

940
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:38,000
Who needs which credential?

941
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:41,525
Be considerate of each other.

942
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,480
Attention, everyone. All of you might...

943
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:51,910
already know this.

944
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:54,920
At Cheonmyung High School, in an effort to maintain...

945
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:58,345
the high quality of our classes and the academic atmosphere,

946
00:57:58,492 --> 00:58:02,015
we strictly control the number of students we accept every year.

947
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,830
Please feel free to tell me why you would like your child...

948
00:58:08,835 --> 00:58:11,400
to study at this school.

949
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:16,000
There's no way my child can get into a prestigious university.

950
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:18,010
Still, once he graduates from Cheonmyung High School,

951
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:20,435
no one will look down on him.

952
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:25,950
Of course. You're absolutely right.

953
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:28,520
In that case,

954
00:58:28,522 --> 00:58:33,405
what contributions can you make to this school?

955
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,730
I'll soon be promoted to dean of medical school.

956
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,860
I'll make sure the students here receive...

957
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:42,515
exclusive entrance counseling.

958
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:44,400
That sounds excellent.

959
00:58:44,404 --> 00:58:47,400
Would you be interested in making a donation as well?

960
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:50,010
I can donate 500,000 dollars.

961
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,910
In return for that, please start a rugby club.

962
00:58:51,912 --> 00:58:55,510
It'll help my son get into an Ivy League school.

963
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:58,850
Considering the cost of building a rugby field and hiring coaches...

964
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:01,875
in addition to other operating expenses,

965
00:59:01,922 --> 00:59:04,920
500,000 dollars wouldn't last us even a year.

966
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,260
How much more do you need?

967
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,690
Well...

968
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:11,130
That's all I can say.

969
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,860
The rest depends on your willingness.

970
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:17,630
How much are you willing to invest...

971
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,595
for your child's future?

His grades have been falling since last semester.

979
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:51,755
He's been late or absent a lot more than before.

980
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:54,625
It can't be just because of his part-time job...

981
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:58,025
I can't do this anymore!

982
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,110
- Who is it? - What was that?

983
01:00:00,113 --> 01:00:01,610
- Isn't it Ms. Jo? - That was so loud.

984
01:00:01,615 --> 01:00:05,535
Guys, be quiet. Go back to studying.

985
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:08,420
I'll go and take a look. Study, okay?

986
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:10,745
- Okay. - Okay.

987
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:16,490
I can't stand it anymore.

988
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:19,045
It's been hard enough so far.

01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:50,315
You found him? Who is he?

995
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:55,460
There was a reason why I couldn't find him anywhere.

996
01:00:55,468 --> 01:00:56,900
He's a chauffeur.

997
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,170
He isn't employed by any company but works alone.

998
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:01,600
A chauffeur? A high school student hired a chauffeur?

999
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:05,065
It's not Jung Su Ah who hired him.

1000
01:01:06,713 --> 01:01:08,210
Don't be surprised.

1001
01:01:08,214 --> 01:01:10,505
The owner of the car is...

1002
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:29,060
Don't be surprised.

1003
01:01:29,069 --> 01:01:31,355
The owner of the car is...

1004
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:34,900
Lee Tae Seok, General Manager of Cheonmyung High School.

1005
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:37,425
(Cheonmyung Foundation General Manager)

1006
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:40,880
General Manager and a girl from his school?

1007
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
Why?

1008
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:45,450
Gosh, you're completely out of your mind.

1009
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,975
You ignorant wench!

1010
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:54,360
I mean...

1011
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,460
Why did you have to show up and say such a thing today, of all days?

1012
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,630
Do you want to get sacked?

1013
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,800
Do you think I'll go down alone?

1014
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,030
You're the one who made me do all those things!

1015
01:02:04,037 --> 01:02:06,455
- Shut your mouth, will you? - Get off me!

1016
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:10,665
Gosh.

1017
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:14,295
Darn it.

1018
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:19,005
Ms. Jo.

1019
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,505
What made you want to put me through all this trouble?

1020
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:29,290
I just don't want to have anything to do with Tae Ra anymore.

1021
01:02:29,295 --> 01:02:33,285
Exactly! That gives me trouble!

1022
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,380
What's the reason?

1023
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:55,220
You've been doing exactly I say so far.

1024
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:58,750
After enjoying all those advantages, why do you suddenly...

1025
01:02:58,758 --> 01:02:59,820
stab me in the back?

1026
01:02:59,826 --> 01:03:01,945
I've been blackmailed.

1027
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,685
You've been blackmailed?

1028
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:15,995
- By who? - Su Ah. Jung Su Ah.

1029
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,910
What are you talking about? Explain.

1030
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,980
She came to me.

1031
01:03:24,984 --> 01:03:28,035
She said she knew everything about Tae Ra.

1032
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:48,725
She knew? How?

1033
01:03:49,175 --> 01:03:50,895
I don't know.

1034
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:53,725
But she definitely knew.

1035
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,180
She threatened that she'd reveal everything...

1036
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:59,205
unless I stop Tae Ra's bullying.

1037
01:03:59,819 --> 01:04:01,605
And I failed.

1038
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:03,750
I tried my best,

1039
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,575
but Tae Rae would never listen to me.

1040
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:10,690
On the contrary, her bullying got worse and worse.

1041
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:12,145
In the end...

1042
01:04:15,468 --> 01:04:18,785
She died! Su Ah died!

1043
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:47,215
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

1044
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:05,350
There's no way Han Su killed Su Ah.

1045
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:07,880
Is the investigation on Jung Su Ah...

1046
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:09,350
over yet?

1047
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:12,075
It'll be fine as long as no new suspects turn up.

1048
01:05:12,225 --> 01:05:14,890
Are you scared other kids will find out what you did?

1049
01:05:14,894 --> 01:05:18,990
There's only one person who repeatedly slandered Su Ah.

1050
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,300
Forget about the rooftop until you humiliate the temp big time.

1051
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:25,000
Guys, have you seen our student community?

1052
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,170
Who uploaded the picture on the student community?

1053
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:31,195
Fine. I'll make a total fool of you.

1054
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:35,265
The beginning of the filthy rumors about the late Jung Su Ah.

1055
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,765
It's you.
