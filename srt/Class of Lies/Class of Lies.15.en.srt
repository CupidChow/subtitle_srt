00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,965
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:27,235
(Episode 15)

4
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,975
"Camouflaged Selves".

5
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,790
What a great painting.

6
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:19,055
It suits well with you too.

7
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,885
Do you know who killed her?

8
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,530
So, do you admit you were seeing her?

9
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,170
Answer me.

10
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,325
Who killed her?

11
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:31,970
But first,

12
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,705
shouldn't you ask how I found out about it?

13
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,975
Shouldn't that come first?

14
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,675
I found out about it through your son.

15
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,090
He's very interested in his father.

16
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:51,120
Interested enough to install a spy app on your phone...

17
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:53,155
and monitor you.

18
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:58,895
He was using that to look at everything on your phone.

19
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,165
Do you get it now?

20
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,665
Your son knew that you were seeing a girl...

21
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,275
who went to his high school. He knew everything.

22
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:20,290
If you don't trust me, why don't you check now?

23
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,660
If he saw the texts that you and I exchanged,

24
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:26,290
wouldn't he show up here?

25
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:30,185
Because he'll be very curious about our conversation.

26
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,770
I'm warning you.

27
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,965
Don't try anything funny.

28
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,910
Answer me.

29
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,275
Who killed her?

30
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:49,045
I thought I made myself clear, but you still don't get it.

31
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,615
Then...

32
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:55,085
why don't you see for yourself?

33
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,695
Do you see it now?

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,840
Congratulations.

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,805
You've found out one more thing about your son.

36
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,675
You...

37
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,145
I'm disappointed.

38
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,005
Father.

39
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:58,880
You're pretty good,

40
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,985
Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok.

41
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,160
You came sooner than I expected.

42
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,330
We didn't get to the heart of our conversation yet.

43
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,530
What do you plan to do?

44
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:13,630
What else?

45
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:16,970
I planned to tell him about Su Ah's killer,

46
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,095
and you showed up.

47
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:23,005
Thanks to you, I don't need to bother with a long explanation.

48
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,035
Congressman Yu.

49
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,945
Su Ah's killer came...

50
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,715
here...

51
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,915
right now.

52
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,755
Gi Mu Hyeok.

53
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,585
What are you doing now?

54
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,700
Your father didn't seem to know much about his son,

55
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,865
I just tried to give you two a chance to talk to each other.

56
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,995
What's there to be so upset about?

57
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,105
You're acting as if you met someone you're not supposed to meet.

58
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,010
You'd better watch what you say.

59
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,315
If I don't watch what I say,

60
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,545
will you kill me like you killed Lee Tae Seok?

61
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,090
Or will you hit me from the back...

62
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,915
like you did to Prosecutor Cha Hyun Jung?

63
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,325
Bang.

64
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,125
Like this?

65
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,995
What's the point of killing everyone to shut their mouths?

66
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,565
Can you kill your son too?

67
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,605
Stop talking nonsense...

68
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:32,975
and get lost.

69
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,880
I was going to anyway.

70
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:41,085
I'm sure the father and son will have a lot to ask each other.

71
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,985
I hope you have a good time.

72
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,285
Gosh.

73
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,460
How did it go?

74
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,500
I poured a lot of oil between them.

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,230
So hopefully there will be a big fire.

76
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,855
Yes!

77
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:31,700
Mu Hyeok, are you sure about this? Aren't you being too reckless?

78
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,705
If we don't gamble this much, we could die.

79
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,605
Is it ready?

80
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,745
- Let's go. - Okay.

81
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,085
Did you really...

82
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,655
kill that girl?

83
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,425
That's right.

84
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,055
I did it.

85
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,065
Why? Why on earth did you do that?

86
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,010
What if I didn't?

87
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,065
What do you think would've happened if I didn't kill her?

88
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:13,650
A politician who dated a girl from his son's school.

89
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,210
Even if he was lucky enough not to get caught and become the President,

90
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,915
what next?

91
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,950
The more power you gained,

92
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,220
the more Lee Tae Seok would have wanted things from you.

93
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,455
After Woonam University, who knows what he would have asked for next?

94
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,990
Do you think he would have kept his mouth shut about Jung Su Ah?

95
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:31,995
If he wanted, he could have asked you for money and everything.

96
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,065
So you did that...

97
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,535
for me?

98
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,135
I can't keep listening to your nonsense.

99
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,750
I said I killed her for my own sake, not for you.

100
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,915
For my future!

101
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,615
Do you get it?

102
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,490
Why? Now that you know your son is a murderer, are you worried?

103
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,160
Come clean with me. You were more worried...

104
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,185
about yourself than me, right?

105
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:04,125
I did too.

106
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,895
Once this gets out,

107
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:10,625
I will be pointed at and stigmatized as a son...

108
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,610
of a congressman who was dating his son's friend.

109
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,605
So why?

110
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,175
Why do I have to lose face because of you?

111
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:21,805
Still,

112
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,415
how could you kill a person because of that?

113
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,315
You killed Lee Tae Seok too.

114
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,145
For your own sake.

115
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,090
"No matter when and where you are,"

116
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,725
"don't forget that you are my son."

117
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,630
No matter when and where you are,

118
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,900
don't forget that you are my son.

119
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,800
It's for my good...

120
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,900
and it will be eventually for your good too.

121
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,205
You should have kept that in mind too.

122
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,975
No matter when and where you are,

123
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,845
you shouldn't forget that you are my father.

124
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,255
You know how critical it is for politicians to have failed kids.

125
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:15,325
You don't have time to do this to me now.

126
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,935
Stop the attorney before he makes problems. That's your job.

127
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,905
If you want to keep that lame congressman position.

128
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,645

130
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,065
Let me take a look.

131

May 3, 2019.

132
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,405
A post that doesn't have a sender's address...

133
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,580
Here it is.

134
00:09:58,581 --> 00:09:59,910
(Delivered)

135
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,445
It says it's delivered.

136
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,380
We went to the orphanage,

137
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,415
but they said they didn't get it.

138
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,885
Could it be...

139
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:15,825
Actually, there's another orphanage near that one.

140
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:19,000
Sometimes, some posts get misdelivered.

141
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:20,655
Where is it?

142
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,075
This looks serious.

143
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,085
Are you confident?

144
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,520
Don't worry.

145
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:48,060
Could you check Lee Tae Seok's credit card record?

146
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,930
Check if there's anything suspicious.

147
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:50,930
Why?

148
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,130
He was dealing with a big shot like Yu Yang Ki.

149
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,900
He must have had a plan B.

150
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,200
Find something that's not ambiguous like a notepad.

151
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,995
There must be something solid than that.

152
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,065
Okay.

153
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,675
I'm going.

160
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:01,165
to become Congressman Yu's enemy?

161
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,435
Why not?

162
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,305
Are you afraid?

163
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,310
Even if you hold onto him, nothing good will come out of it.

164
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,880
Do the math.

165
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:17,480
What would be the best choice for Songha Law Firm?

166
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,675
The answer is already out there.

167

to cut ties with Congressman Yu.

00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:31,425
and move on.

171
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,035
Fine.

172
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,835
What can I do for you?

173
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,710
First of all,

174
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,240
I'd like to use your law firm's name.

175
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,510
Everything I say and do from now on...

176
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,215
will represent Songha Law Firm's official stance.

177
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,270
(Nullification of disciplinary action upon Gi Mu Hyeok)

178
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:14,040
Will you be the Head of Crisis Management...

179
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,205
at Songha Law Firm once again?

180
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,935
Is that really necessary?

181
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:24,020
Once this matter is settled,

182
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,815
I hope we don't see each other again.

183
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,615
Whether personally...

184
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,485
or in court.

185
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,125
Attention, please.

186
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,730
We'll soon start the press conference...

187
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,065
to reveal the truth of the townhouse murder.

188
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,040
- Here he comes. - It's starting.

189
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,210
Let's go.

190
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,045
Hurry up.

(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth of the Townhouse Murder)

193
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:14,500
I'm Gi Mu Hyeok at Songha Law Firm. I'm the attorney...

194
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:18,265
of suspect Kim Han Su from the townhouse murder case.

195

(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth of the Townhouse Murder)

196
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:27,175
I'm here today...

197
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,680
to tell you the truth of the incident...

198
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:33,180
and prove my client, Kim Han Su's innocence.

199
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,315
- What? - What's going on?

200
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,920
The townhouse murder case...

201
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,455
was fabricated...

202
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,530
to frame Kim Han Su.

203
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:45,330
- What? - It was fabricated?

204
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:46,730
- What is he talking about? - Really?

205
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:47,970
- What does that mean? - What?

206
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,430
The person behind the fabrication is...

207
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:51,065
(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth of the Townhouse Murder)

208
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,540
It's the Suho Party's presidential candidate,

209
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,870
Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

210
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,075
- What? - Yu Yang Ki?

211
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,145
- Is that true? - He fabricated the case?

212
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,420
Make sure no one at the office acts up.

213
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,890
Then I'll see to it...

214
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:14,030
that your confirmation hearing for prosecutor general goes well.

215
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,825
Congressman Yu.

216
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,030
I think you really need to see this.

217
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,730
The reason why he tried to terminate the case through fabrication...

218
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:25,540
is because Congressman Yu had an inappropriate relationship...

219
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,240
with the murder victim...

220
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,905
through the deceased Lee Tae Seok, General Manager of Cheonmyung High.

221
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,075
That little rat.

222
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,245
- What does that mean? - What's going on?

223
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,050
Excuse me.

224
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:43,620
What exactly do you mean by "inappropriate relationship"?

225
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,160
Do you have any evidence?

226
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,220
Is Congressman Yu related...

227
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,730
to Lee Tae Seok's death too?

228
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,230
- Did Congressman Yu... - Is there any evidence?

229
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,130
- Is this certain? - Is Congressman Yu...

230
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,170
- I have a question! - Please answer!

Answer us.

234
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,740
Here are some text messages that Congressman Yu exchanged...

235
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,445
with General Manager Lee Tae Seok.

(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth of the Townhouse Murder)

237

- What's that? - Oh, my.

238
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:17,520
(Text Messages between Congressman Yu and General Manager Lee)

239
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:20,930
To take over Woonam University, Lee Tae Seok, who committed suicide,

240
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,430
used the models at his agency...

241
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,930
and offered sexual favors...

242
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:29,730
to numerous politicians, businessmen, and prosecutors.

243
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,495
A key player in the university takeover...

244
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,770
was the chairman of the Education Committee.

245
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:37,910
- That's awful. - Unbelievable.

246
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,175
Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

247
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:44,050
Lee Tae Seok introduced the victim to Congressman Yu,

248
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:47,375
and Congressman Yu met the victim regularly...

249
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:51,020
at her apartment in secret.

252
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,285
- Oh, my. - Unbelievable.

253
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,430
If your accusation turns out to be false,

254
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,440
it'll create a tremendous stir.

255
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,040
Can you prove the authenticity of these materials?

256

It's the presidential candidate registration day today.

257
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,410
Why are you revealing this just today?

258
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,310
- Please answer! - Is there more evidence?

259
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:17,205
- Why are you revealing this now? - Please answer my question!

260
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,915
Congressman Park is here!

261
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,165
- What's going on? - It's him.

I'm Gi Mu Hyeok.

263
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,565
Have you looked through...

264
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,935
the materials I sent you?

265
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,605
I have.

266
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,175
I find them quite interesting.

267
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:26,515
You can help me win the primaries?

268
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,720
You win an election...

269
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,060
by either winning more votes...

270
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,130
or making your opponent lose votes.

271
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,395
If I reveal this without enough evidence,

272
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,970
it might backfire on me.

273
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,900
Don't worry about that.

274
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:46,335
It'll be revealed by me.

275
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:49,005
What's your plan?

276
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,105
Songha Law Firm is holding...

277
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,040
a press conference tomorrow.

All I ask...

279
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:59,015
is that you show up and finish it up nicely.

280
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,275
Then I'll make sure...

281

First of all,

00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,510
as the party leader,

285
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,850
I feel morally responsible...

286
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:36,650
for the current unfortunate situation...

287
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:40,655
regarding Congressman Yu Yang Ki, one of the Suho Party members.

288
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,685
I apologize.

289
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:58,140
I promise to thoroughly investigate...

290

on behalf of all citizens.

292
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,520
I cannot let someone unqualified...

293
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:12,690
represent the Suho Party...

294
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:15,555
in the presidential election.

295
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:20,195
I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening.

296
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,380
It's just a political maneuver.

All the allegations released in the press earlier today...

300
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:44,820
have nothing to do with me and are completely false.

I, Yu Yang Ki,

302
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:51,160
have nothing to hide from the public.

Despite any negative campaigning against me,

304

I will finish the primaries as planned.

I will bring Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok at Songha Law Firm...

307
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,340
to justice...

308
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,905

I heard back at the rooftop.

00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:15,080
"Do you want to end up like Han Su?"

320

I'll give you that chance as well.

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,130
so she can't talk about you?

336
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,085
Leave Tae Ra alone.

337
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,900
Talk to me if you need to.

338
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,630
I'm shocked.

339
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,730
You really sound like you're trying to protect her.

340
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,565
You killed her.

341
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,340
- What? - I warned you.

342
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,740
I gave you one last chance too.

343
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,610
If only you listened to me,

344
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,565
Han Tae Ra wouldn't have had to die.

345

That's right. This is what Su Ah asked me to mail that day.

00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,040
It was misdelivered to another orphanage nearby.

who said he'd sponsor me.

Hello.

How about a more chic look this time?

Who's that? She's new.

She's a new model.

385
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:01,530
The ad she was in was well-received,

386
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,900
so we're shooting her profile. I have a good feeling.

387

What future strategy does a private foundation...

394
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,300
that isn't even a conglomerate need, right?

No, that's not it.

396
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:39,065
It's different from what I expected.

397
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:41,835
I thought you owned a studio...

398
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,035
or a modeling agency.

399
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,410
That's true too.

400
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,605
I do this and that for the future of the foundation.

401
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:54,345
How much did you make from modeling?

402
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,790
About 1,500 dollars this month.

403
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,615
1,500 dollars?

404
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,225
Drink.

405
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,305
How does it taste?

406
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:21,750
Not so great.

407
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,405
Not so great?

408
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,450
Okay.

409
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,445
But what you just drank costs...

410
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,955
about 100 dollars.

411
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:37,460
If we drink this entire bottle, it would be similar...

412
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,325
to everything you made while modeling.

413
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:44,695
What do you think? Is it still "not so great"?

414
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:06,760
Give me more.

415
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:09,925
The more I drink it, it's growing on me.

416
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,630
This is trouble.

417
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:19,300
A person's taste can keep getting more expensive,

418
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:22,535
but it can never go the other way.

419
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:24,235

420
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:26,475
a lot of money from now on.

423
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,490

I want to go back to school too.

427
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,665
I dropped out because I couldn't afford it.

431
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:29,905
He approached her with ulterior motives in the get-go.

432
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,845
It'll be hard...

433
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,380
to enter that diary into evidence in court,

434
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:44,785
but it can affect Yu Yang Ki if it's disclosed.

435
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:50,125
When she said there was something that could protect her,

436
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,655
she must have meant this diary.

437
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,840
To bring Yu Yang Ki down,

438
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:07,235
we must make the content of the diary public.

439
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:10,710
If we don't, they will blindly interpret it...

440
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,715
in a negative way.

441
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,985
I will do it myself.

447
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,460
I went to her place...

448
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,330
because I was worried about her.

449
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,095
What about the victim were you worried about?

She asked me to send this post.

454
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:17,045
What's inside?

455
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,155
From the day she first met Congressman Yu Yang Ki...

456
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,560
until the day she got murdered.

457
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,300
This is the victim's diary that has everything that happened to her...

458
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,895
during that period.

459
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,705
What's written in the diary?

460
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:51,080
That she met Congressman Yu through Lee Tae Seok for the first time...

461
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,650
and that Congressman Yu...

462
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,845
visited the victim's place every week since.

463
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,515
That's very important information.

464
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:03,825
If it's needed to reveal the truth,

465
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:08,195
are you willing to make the full text of the diary public?

Yes.

467
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,035
But before that,

468
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:22,350
there's one thing I want to share...

469
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,645
to all the viewers of this video.

470
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,275
Please go ahead.

471
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,960
It's true that the victim made the wrong decision.

But no one.

473
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:40,155
No one was there to protect her from making such decisions.

474

Before you criticize her, please think about this one thing.

475
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,695
She...

476
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:50,210
was a victim that Lee Tae Seok and Yu Yang Ki took advantage of.

477
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,380
Although she made a bad decision,

478
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,575
she lost her life...

Come on. Yes, you do. Things have gotten out of hand now.

484
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:44,130
Just tell me honestly about how you feel now.

485
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:46,100
What was your relationship with Jung Su Ah?

486
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:49,370
The word around is that you were close to the girl your father dated.

487
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,400
Is that true?

488
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:53,470
Have you two met in private?

489
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:57,535
Is this related to your girlfriend's suicide?

490
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,580
No, it's not. Get out of my way.

491
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:02,110
- Wait. - I have a question!

492
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:05,575
- Please answer my question! - Just this one!

493
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,115
Everything was fabricated!

494
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,120
There's no evidence whatsoever that proves the diary as solid proof.

495
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:17,625
And I don't even know that girl.

496
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:20,130
Just because she went to the same school my son goes,

497
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:24,030
they are creating such lame and nasty fake news.

499
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,135
Today,

500
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:33,175
I'm making myself clear once again.

501
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:36,050
I have never met the girl...

502
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,415
and I don't know anything about this incident.

503

(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth of the Townhouse Murder)

505
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:48,220
Congressman Yu Yang Ki has continuously been seeing the victim,

506
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:52,155
which is the reason why the victim got murdered.

507
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,570
What?

508
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,470
Are you saying Congressman Yu is related to the murder case?

509
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,300
Yes, he is.

510
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,535
- What? - He's related?

511
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,980
Are you saying Congressman Yu is the murderer?

512
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:07,980
No, I'm not.

513
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:10,480
If not, who is the murderer?

514
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:11,980
Is there anything else you know?

515
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,750
- Who is the murderer? - Please clarify.

516
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,520
- Please answer. - Who tipped off about it?

517
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:19,190
- Then why did Congressman Yu... - Are you sure?

518
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,785
The murderer...

519
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,925
The real criminal of this case...

520
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,770
is Congress Yu Yang Ki's son, Yu Beom Jin.

521

Are you sure? What's your reason?

525
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,110
Do you have evidence?

526
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,905
- Congressman Yu's son... - What's the evidence?

527
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,775
Please explain!

(Attorney Gi Spots Congressman Yu's Son, Yu Beom Jin, as the Culprit)

Ma'am, I think you should stay in the hospital.

531

There's no time to be lying down.

532
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,860
If not now, we can't drag him down.

533
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,760
"Drag down"? Drag down whom?

534
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,230
Assistant Prosecutor General Yang of course.

535
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,865
What?

536
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:08,500
Are you out of your mind?

537
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:10,510
That's wrong.

538
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:13,740
Yu Yang Ki is a congressman, so we can throw suspicion on him.

539
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,950
But Yu Beom Jin is not even a public figure.

540
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,280
He's just a high school student.

541
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:18,850
He's underage.

542
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,580
And you want to reveal his information at the press conference?

543
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,720
Just with suspicions and circumstantial evidence?

544
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,445
If not,

545
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,355
do we have other options?

546
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,925
We should look for them.

547
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,660
You're usually not this emotional.

548
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,065
You have been calm until now. Why are you suddenly doing this?

549
00:37:43,578 --> 00:37:47,280
Just because there's a chance that his alibi might be ruined,

550
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,610
he killed his own girlfriend who has been supporting him all along...

551
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:52,005
and disguised it as suicide.

552
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,050
We can't just let him do this.

553

We have to do this and stop him.

Don't worry about me.

557

Just make sure to catch Yang Sang Bae at the right time.

558

When I reveal the truth about Yu Beom Jin,

559
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,365
I'll reveal his too.

(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth of the Townhouse Murder)

563

This is the CCTV footage of Yu Beom Jin...

564

near the victim's place a week before the incident.

565
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:32,285

566
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:41,730
- Who is that? - Can you see?

567
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,370
- Isn't that Congressman Yu's son? - I think he is.

568

That's Congressman Yu's son.

569
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,740
Yu Beom Jin went to Han Su's hospital as soon as he woke up.

570
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,110
He told him about an escape route that even the police didn't know...

571
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:58,210
and asked him to make a false statement...

572
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,945
that he saw Lee Tae Seok on the scene.

573
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,560
And the only girl who could testify about what Yu Beom Jin was doing...

574
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,260
on the day of the incident...

575

jumped to her death from a skyscraper.

576
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,760
And Lee Tae Seok, who knew Yu Yang Ki's secret...

577
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,825
hanged himself...

578
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,565
at his own office.

(Attorney Gi Spots Congressman Yu's Son, Yu Beom Jin, as the Culprit)

581
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:23,405
Isn't it strange?

582
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:26,405
I'm casting doubts...

583
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,905
on the consecutive deaths.

584
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:39,860
Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok spotted Congressman Yu Yang Ki's son,

585
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:43,925
Yu Beom Jin, as the culprit of the townhouse murder case.

586
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,730
He presented a video footage of Yu Beom Jin that was filmed...

587
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:49,500
near the victim's place as evidence.

588
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,570
What's more shocking is that Yu Beom Jin talked to the victim,

589
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:55,100
Kim, into making false statements.

590
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,235
- Until now... - I just got goosebumps.

591
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,580
It wasn't Kim Han Su that killed her, but Yu Beom Jin?

592
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:02,680
Gosh, I had no idea.

593
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:05,780
By the way, the temp is Kim Han Su's attorney?

594
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:08,890
Does that mean he fooled everyone and faked his identity?

595
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,085
Beom Jin and the temp. I got fooled by everyone.

596
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:16,130
Mr. Gi didn't have bad intentions though.

597
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,695
Thanks to him, Han Su's innocence will be proved.

598
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,535
Here's Attorney Gi's speech at the press conference.

599
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,840
Yu Beom Jin installed a spy app on Congressman Yu's phone...

600
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,270
and monitored him.

601
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,780
And he figured out that Congressman Yu...

602
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:37,345
was having an inappropriate relationship with the victim.

603
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,015
Yu Beom Jin, you scumbag.

604
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:42,985
Is that the motive for murder?

605
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,985
Yes.

606
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:47,455
Once Yu Beom Jin found out about it,

607
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:50,325
he made a horrible decision in order to break...

608
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:53,555
the relationship between the victim and his father.

609
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:57,830
Kim Han Su.

610
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,300
Was your testimony about seeing Lee Tae Seok false?

611
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:03,365
Is it true that you were forced to give false testimony?

612
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,995
It's true.

613
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,465
I was told I had to give that testimony to protect the victim...

614
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:37,305
No.

615
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:41,575
To protect Su Ah from being criticized by the public.

616
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:45,445
I was told to testify that I saw Lee Tae Seok flee out the back door.

617
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:49,315
I sincerely apologize for giving false testimony.

618
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:56,055
But everything I just said...

619
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:58,325
is true.

620
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,220
When I first became...

621
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:25,020
Han Su's attorney in this case,

622
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:29,555
I had a plea bargain with the prosecutors.

623
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:31,985
- What's that? - What?

624
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,770
The prosecutor in charge of this case...

625
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,070
was Assistant Prosecutor General Yang Sang Bae...

626
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,070
at Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

627
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:40,600
He secretly met women...

628
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:42,970
at the modeling agency run by Lee Tae Seok...

629
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,910
and received bribes and favors.

630
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:47,110
He also interfered with other prosecutor's investigations...

631
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,405
to hide the truth.

632
00:42:52,386 --> 00:42:54,945
That crazy jerk!

633
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:05,425
How dare that reckless punk do this to me?

634
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,800
Hey.

635
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:11,365
Indict him for defamation right now.

636
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,570
Arrest him this instant!

637
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:16,340
Okay.

638
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,505
Gosh.

639
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,415
What are you two doing?

640
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,845
Who says you can barge into my office like this?

641
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,055
Sorry we forgot to knock.

642
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,330
Don't get too worked up.

643
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:43,830
You'll have to move out of this room anyway.

644
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:45,425
What?

645
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,870
Look, Hyun Jung.

646
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,970
Have you lost your mind after being hit in the head?

647
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:55,675
Who are you to tell me to move out of this room?

648
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,050
Everything has been revealed now. You better disappear quietly.

649
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,950
You're getting a little too desperate.

650
00:43:59,954 --> 00:44:01,480
"Revealed"?

651
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:03,420
What do you mean? What's been revealed?

652
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:05,720
Do you mean that lame photo of me?

653
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,320
Fine, I went to a movie with her.

654
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:11,325
What's so wrong with watching a movie with a girl?

655
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,700
Apparently, my colleague worked very hard while I was bedridden.

656
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:18,325
What?

657
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,535
Would you like to talk to the girl you met...

658
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,005
on the phone?

659
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:31,075
(Model from Lee Tae Seok's Agency)

660
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,215
What did you say?

661
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,620
We've also recorded her testimony.

662
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,390
She met you through Lee Tae Seok...

663
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,615
and delivered bribes to you as well.

664
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:52,695
You must have enjoyed wielding the scant power you had so far.

665
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:54,635
Now it's time to pay for it.

666
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:12,020
As Han Su's attorney, I will continue to do my best...

667
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:15,260
to prove my client's innocence. Therefore,

668
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:18,760
I also request that the prosecutors reveal the whole truth...

669
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,295
of the victim's death...

670
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:26,265
through a thorough and fair investigation.

671
00:46:23,497 --> 00:46:25,330
You shameless murderer.

672
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:26,830
- Did you see that on TV? - Goodness.

673
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,930
- That's right. It's Beom Jin. - You didn't see it?

674
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,800
- Is it true? - What's going to happen?

675
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:34,740
- His dad and Su Ah... - What's going on?

676
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:36,770
- That's what happened, right? - Oh, my.

677
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,535
What happened?

678
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,650
You knew all about it from the beginning.

679
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,710
You knew your dad was playing dirty with Su Ah.

680
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,715
How could you do that to us?

681
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:52,015
Is Beom Jin really a murderer?

682
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,715
You coward.

683
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:57,030
What?

684
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:59,530
You were jealous of Han Su, so you framed him as a bully.

685
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:02,495
And you followed Su Ah around and took secret photos of her.

686
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:04,865
Do you suddenly feel guilty now?

687
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,965
- What did you just say? - Am I wrong?

688
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,635
You were a stalker who took secret photos.

689
00:47:09,677 --> 00:47:11,805
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

690
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,635
Also,

691
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:17,275
is there evidence that I killed Su Ah?

692
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:22,015
Apart from those circumstances that stupid attorney is babbling,

693
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:27,215
is there any evidence that I stabbed Su Ah with a knife?

694
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,905
How dare you all look at me like that?

695
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:47,035
Without me,

696
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,375
you can't even think for yourselves.

697
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,820
- Unbelievable. - What is he saying?

698
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,080
Who does he think he is?

699
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:56,090
Listen up, everyone.

700
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,715
I didn't...

701
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:00,655
kill Su Ah.

702
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,160
If you want to keep arguing that I did,

703
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:06,025
bring evidence.

704
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,655
A video of me stabbing Su Ah or anything!

705
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:12,365
Bring it so I can see it.

706
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,680
- He's crazy. - What's with him?

707
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,405
He's totally creepy.

708
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:29,890
(Regional Investigation Unit)

709
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,715
You finish it up.

710
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,955
What can I do...

711
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,355
in this situation?

712
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,325
Do I even have to tell you what to do?

713
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,660
Turn yourself in...

714
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,870
and testify that you were following Lee Tae Seok's order.

715
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:47,170
He killed Su Ah,

716
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,635
and you fabricated the scene.

717
00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:53,005
Then...

718
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,740
who killed Lee Tae Seok?

719
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:57,675
You, of course.

720
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:01,720
Lee Tae Seok never rewarded you for fabricating the scene.

721
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:03,350
Out of resentment,

722
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,585
you killed him and disguised it as suicide.

723
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,155
Think of your daughter's future.

724
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:22,170
What do you mean by that?

725
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,505
I'm the one who saved her.

726
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,135
And I'll keep supporting her.

727
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:30,075
If both of us get arrested,

728
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,705
who will take care of her future?

729
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,990
The basis has been laid now,

730
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,285
but we still don't have enough evidence...

731
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:46,355
to take him to court.

732
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:55,600
Even if we do manage to make him lose the primaries,

733
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:59,405
It'll be hard to get him kicked out of the National Assembly...

734
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,810
or imprisoned.

735
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:02,910
We know what happened,

736
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,005
but we can't prove it.

737
00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:07,915
It's so frustrating.

738
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,550
What happened to what I asked for?

739
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,255
The thing is...

740
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,925
I found something slightly shady.

741
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,255
"Shady"?

742
00:50:21,335 --> 00:50:22,600
Lee Tae Seok...

743
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,100
paid for something regularly using his corporate credit card,

744
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,935
so I dug into it.

745
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:29,835
It was a home security video company.

746
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,440
What is the company name?

747
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,305
ISEE.

748
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:34,610
What?

749
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:38,610
No, no. The company name is "ISEE".

750
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:43,075
I see you. "ISEE Guard".

751
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:45,745
ISEE.

752
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,820
So? What did you find?

753
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:51,860
Well, what's more suspicious than the transactions with the company...

754
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:55,730
is the large sums of money that were transferred to a person.

755
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:58,225
So I looked him up,

756
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:00,065
and he works here.

757
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,905
He gave money to an employee...

758
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:10,010
of a home security video company?

759
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:11,845
A whopping...

760
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:13,615
20,000 dollars.

761
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:16,320
"20,000 dollars"?

762
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,450
Why did he pay that much money to one person?

763
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:20,815
That's why it's suspicious.

764
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:24,985
So I went to see him myself.

765
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:26,730
Police?

766
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:28,855
(Park Bo Gum, Police Agency)

00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:34,840
(Park Bo Gum, Police Agency)

768
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,265
What? Have you never seen a cop before?

769
00:51:37,277 --> 00:51:39,435
No, sir. I just...

770
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,605
How may I help you?

771
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:48,045
We already investigated thoroughly, so don't be nervous,

772
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,775
and spill it.

773
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:51,545
What?

774
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,715
Hold on.

775
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:55,615
Let's see.

776
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,755
Look at this. Closer!

777
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:08,600
The recipient works here, right?

778
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:11,865
Yes, he does work here, but...

779
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,435
(20,000 dollars)

780
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:15,775
20,000 dollars?

781
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:21,620
You are a good actor.

782
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:24,515
You look like you're genuinely shocked.

783
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:28,785
Tell me the truth. Okay?

784
00:52:29,263 --> 00:52:33,995
Your company took money on the side in this employee's name!

785
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,800
Right? You did illegal things for them...

786
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:39,500
and got a kick-back!

787
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:41,865
Hold on.

788
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,805
Darn it. This punk. Again!

789
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:50,710
We didn't take this money.

790
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:52,345
Then?

791
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,720
Then? Darn it.

792

You'll kill our good rapport if you do this.

793
00:52:57,191 --> 00:52:59,445
We really didn't take this money.

794
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:02,620
- Hey, mister. - Yes?

795
00:53:02,629 --> 00:53:06,500
Tell me the truth while I give you...

796
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,295
the chance.

797
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:12,370
The thing is, he worked here,

798
00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:16,100
but he took money on the side and installed hidden cameras.

799
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,835
That jerk.

800
00:53:17,911 --> 00:53:19,905
I'm glad I fired him.

801
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:25,375
Did you really fire him?

802
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:26,520
You're not covering for him?

803
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,920
It's the truth.

804
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:30,050
I fired him right away after seeing the hidden camera he installed...

805
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:31,720
in our customer's bathhouse.

806
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:34,490
Okay. Fine.

807
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:37,460
Then where is he now?

808
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,490
I don't know.

809
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:40,055

812

Didn't you say you were a cop?

Not "Police". They're similar though.

Ta-da.

827
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:32,245

00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:38,350
We'll use this to find out.

830
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,550
How?

831
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,255
In times like these,

832
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:45,625
we must use governmental authority.

833
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:47,755
Governmental authority.

834
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,895
He's a serial offender.

835
00:54:56,643 --> 00:55:00,080
Distributing pornography, running an illegal site...

836
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,640
Plus, he has several related priors.

837
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:03,110
Can you find out right away?

838
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:07,245
Yes. Don't worry. I'm sure he's doing something similar.

839
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,815
I'll check and get a warrant and search his place.

840
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,185
Okay, thanks.

841
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,585
We have to hope she'll find something.

842
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:24,300
Since they saw Han Su is well enough to hold a press conference,

843
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:26,600
it'll be difficult to continue to stay the trial.

844
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:27,700
I'm glad...

845
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:31,235
he doesn't have to be in detention during the trial.

846
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,010
Ms. Ha. Please stay with Han Su.

847
00:55:36,016 --> 00:55:37,905
I need to see someone.

848
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:39,645
Who?

849
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:42,975
There's something I want to say...

850
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,785
before Han Su's trial...

851
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,915
to that jerk Beom Jin.

852
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:01,270
You shameless murderer.

853
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,540
Beom Jin is the murderer?

854
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:03,540
No way.

855
00:56:03,543 --> 00:56:04,870
You saw his CCTV footage, right?

856
00:56:04,878 --> 00:56:06,980
- Yes, It's Beom Jin. - Did you see?

857
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,210
It's him.

858
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:10,910
It is suspicious, especially with what happened to Tae Ra.

859
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:12,010
But still. No way.

860
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:14,775
His dad and Su Ah were seeing each other.

861
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,945
- Oh my gosh. - It must be true.

862
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:22,915
Those worthless punks.

863
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,555
How dare you...

864
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:36,695
They can't do anything by themselves.

865
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,105
(Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok)

866
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,615
Gi Mu Hyeok.

867
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,445
(Attorney Gi Mu Hyeok)

868
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:59,555
How do you feel, being stomped on?

869
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:04,925
Come to the roof. I'll be waiting.

870
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,205
I was stomped on?

871
00:57:19,886 --> 00:57:21,545
Me?

872
00:57:26,393 --> 00:57:28,555
Seriously.

873
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:31,025
That annoying jerk.

874
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:05,455
Do you think you've won?

875
00:58:10,604 --> 00:58:12,225
No.

876
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:15,365
You lost, Gi Mu Hyeok.

877
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:18,705
You're an attorney, but you couldn't win in court,

878
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:20,840
so you used the media to beat me.

879
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:23,405
That in itself shows you lost to me.

880
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:28,975
Who said I wanted to win?

881
00:58:30,357 --> 00:58:33,090
You must only know about the law,

882
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,355
and nothing about the real game.

883
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:38,990
The best attorney in this industry...

884
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:41,355
is someone who doesn't step foot in court.

885
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:44,025
The attorney who gets...

886
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,825
what he wants without going to trial.

887
00:58:46,907 --> 00:58:48,665
He's the best of his kind.

888
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:52,365
And what I want...

889
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:55,275
is just ending you.

890
00:58:56,016 --> 00:58:57,645
Not winning.

891
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:01,545
Got that?

892
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:05,415
You're already finished even without going to court.

893
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,785
You can get angry,

894
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,330
but people will not act as you wish,

895
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:13,230
nor believe what you say, or follow you.

896
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:14,460
Shut it.

897
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,330
As much as they envied you,

898
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:20,000
they'll be excited to mock you, criticize you, and curse at you.

899
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:21,695
That's human nature.

900
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,370
People enjoy...

901
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,810
seeing a hero fall more than seeing a hero succeed.

902
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,310
- Why you... - The fact that you are...

903
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,145
Yu Yang Ki's son will follow you until the day you die.

904
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:33,575
No matter what you do,

905
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:35,920
that will always get in your way.

906
00:59:35,922 --> 00:59:39,245
Shut it! Shut it, you jerk!

907
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:48,695
You won't be able to decide any future ever again.

908
00:59:49,603 --> 00:59:51,765
Because you won't be Yu Beom Jin.

909
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:54,595
You'll be the hypocrite who fooled the entire nation.

910
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,935
You'll always be the son...

911
00:59:58,044 --> 01:00:01,005
of the sex offender and murderer, Yu Yang Ki.

912
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,905
You...

913
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:11,215
Until you die.

914
01:00:13,393 --> 01:00:14,985
No.

915
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:16,885
It'll follow you for life.

916
01:00:17,664 --> 01:00:19,255
What?

917
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:30,670
When you think things finally quieted down,

918
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:32,905
someone will dig it up all again.

919
01:00:33,113 --> 01:00:35,435
Whenever something similar happens,

920
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:37,780
the media will talk about you.

921
01:00:37,784 --> 01:00:40,675
You'll be stigmatized for the rest of your life...

922
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:44,185
and never be forgotten.

923
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,315
Until you die.

924
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,995
In that case,

925
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,765
where would you suffer more?

926
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:13,205
In prison or in this world?

927
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:28,395
(Class of Lies / Mr. Temporary)

928
01:01:42,982 --> 01:01:46,310
Between you and me, who will end up in the fiery pit?

929
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,545
We'll find it out in the end.

930
01:01:49,055 --> 01:01:51,020
Do you want to fall further down?

931
01:01:51,024 --> 01:01:54,285
Further down than Han Su?

932
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:57,585
I swear that I didn't kill her.

933
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:00,360
For Songha Law Firm to take your case,

934
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:02,360
you shouldn't hide anything from me.

935
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:05,725
Give him all his weaknesses.

936
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:07,865
Silence!

937
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,110
Is it true?

938
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:13,270
After finding out that my son killed the victim,

939
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:14,980
I wanted to cover up what he did.

940
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,480
I had Lieutenant Oh Ki Hwan fabricate the scene...

941
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,480
It's all a lie.

942
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,975
I'll be a witness and prove my innocence.

943
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:25,745
I request...

944
01:02:25,892 --> 01:02:28,355
that Yu Beom Jin be selected as a witness.
