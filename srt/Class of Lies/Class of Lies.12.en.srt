00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,885
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,255
I wonder what's his relationship with Yu Yang Ki.

4
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,710
He planted a fingerprint at the Su Ah's murder scene,

5
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,695
and the murder of Lee Tae Seok was disguised as a suicide.

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,280
Why did he do that?

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,980
He must have received something from him.

8
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,235
Or maybe he's got something held over.

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,305
It could be both.

10
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,720
We need to know this...

11
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,560
to prove that Yu Yang Ki is behind this.

12
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:48,160
To investigate Lieutenant Oh and Yu Yang Ki properly,

13
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,700
we need to remove Yang Sang Bae first,

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,285
but even Supreme Prosecutors' Office doesn't want to touch him.

15
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:57,555
So if anything, I will get fired first.

16
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:00,495
Then...

17
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:05,010
Still, we must do everything we can.

18
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,480
Crazy Bulldog. You gave me that nickname.

19
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,305
Once I bite something, I never let it go.

20
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,205
You're right.

21
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,960
Let's get some benefit from governmental power.

22
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,815
I'll pay you back one day.

23
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,315
What are you talking about? This is my case.

24
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:31,870
To me, finding the criminal that murdered Su Ah...

25
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,695
would be repaying my debt to Han Su.

26
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:41,765
Good luck then. I'll call you.

27
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,935
Okay. Bye.

28
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,375
The criminal.

29
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,345
We will catch the criminal.

30
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:05,225
Could you drive more nicely?

35
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,530
Is it finished?

36
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:37,515
I have confirmed Lee Tae Seok's body is cremated.

37
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:41,685
And the prosecutor shouldn't trouble us for a while.

38
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,055
Well done. You can go now.

39
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,025
Shouldn't we just kill her to make sure?

40
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:53,080
Once the prosecutor wakes up, she'll start chasing you again.

41
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,810
And she won't take it easy then. What if...

42
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,235
No.

43
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,220
When a man like Lee Tae Seok dies, it doesn't cause any trouble.

44
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,605
But when a prosecutor dies, it's different.

45
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,790
We have earned some time now,

46
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,860
so just make sure not to leave any evidence...

47
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,160
and keep your mouth shut.

48
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,230
So even when the prosecutor wakes up,

49
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,085
there's nothing she can do.

50
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,485

There is a connection between the death of the two.

I have no access to the police,

58

so please do some research on that.

What does the police say?

87
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,860
As soon as the case was reported,

88
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:55,930
they checked all the CCTVs nearby,

89
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,200
but he escaped through the blind spots, so it's hard to track him.

90
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,555
And the license plate was fake too.

I guess it means we're going in the right direction.

95
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:17,750

After what happened in the school,

110
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,815
it was hard for us to get back to work right away.

Is that a task the General Manager assigned to you?

You'd better not talk about it elsewhere.

that Mr. Gi was Han Su's attorney,

155

169
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,915
Let me invite you to a nice meal sometime.

170
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,055
I can't buy anything expensive though.

171
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,925
Okay. Sounds good.

172
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:55,515
Ms. Ha. Don't you think Byung Ho has changed a bit?

173
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,330
It looks like he has.

174
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,760
I'm glad he has become happier,

175
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,530
but it bothers me a bit that he has changed so suddenly.

176
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:07,225
Now Jun Jae is gone, it's understandable though.

177
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,080
Oh, right. Did you meet Jun Jae?

178
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,295
Yes, I talked to him, but...

179
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:22,205
It turned out the person who made Ji Eun do that...

180
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,475
was Beom Jin.

181
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,905
What?

182
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,060
Beom Jin?

183
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,930
Yes. He also told Byung Ho not to stand him any more.

184
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,555
I feel like he's coming between the two.

185
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,295
I need to figure out why he's doing that.

186
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:42,995
How?

187
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:45,280
I'll talk to him under the pretense of counseling.

188
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,380
I'll ask him about other kids too.

189
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:49,810
Ms. Ha, you know what?

190
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,505
You have changed a bit.

191
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,105
- I have? - It doesn't mean anything bad.

192
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,505
You would have said,

193
00:12:57,794 --> 00:12:59,290
"Even if it's for the good,"

194
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,345
"I won't use the counseling to dig up information."

195
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,345
Like this.

196
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,785
Was I like that?

197
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,800
You were pretty intense.

198
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:13,355
At least you won't be called Duchess Ha anymore.

199
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,410
You're next to see Ms. Ha.

200
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,865
Thanks.

201
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,435
Byung Ho.

202
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,520
How was your counseling session?

203
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:32,075
It was good. Can we talk for a minute?

204
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,775
Alone?

205
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:38,215
Sure. Should we go to Veritas?

206
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,000
Can I go there?

207
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,200
Of course. You're my friend.

208
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,555
Let's go.

209
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:55,735
Now, he's letting Porter go there...

210
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,905
What's going on?

211
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:07,690
Come to the photo club room.

212
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,915
Does he think he owns that room? How dare he order me around?

213
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,955
My turn.

214
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,755
My ball.

215
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,865
- Hey. - Let's go.

216
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,445
- Hi. - Let's play.

217
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,785
Daddy! When did you come?

218
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,640
Are you okay? Aren't you tired?

219
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,195
I'm okay.

220
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,535
This school must be super expensive too.

221
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:21,570
Are you afraid or worried about coming to school?

222
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,055
What is there to be worried about? Beom Jin is here.

223
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,125
What do you mean?

224
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,340
If Beom Jin is here, it's okay?

225
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,740
Of course.

226
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,810
We just have to follow him since he knows the right answer.

227
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:34,910
He's perfect.

228
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,005
He's Cheonmyung High's perfect student.

229
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,490
If you get good grades, you're just a good student,

230
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,320
but if you're good at everything like Beom Jin...

231
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,360
and have the perfect personality to boot,

232
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,190
people don't get jealous, but have respect for you.

233
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,315
It's like he lives in a completely different world.

234
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:56,900
Jun Jae and I were just security guards...

235
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,340
for the Veritas kids.

236
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,610
Especially Beom Jin, whom you mention, is untouchable.

237
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,210
No one would dare mess with him.

238
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,510
There's no one at our school...

239
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:08,065
who can defy him.

240
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,690
Ms. Ha asked about me?

241
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:20,420
Yes. She asked if you said anything else...

242
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,075
when you heard Mr. Gi was Han Su's lawyer.

243
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:29,170
Sorry. Did I cause you trouble by telling her?

244
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:33,725
I think it was a secret that Mr. Gi is Han Su's lawyer.

245
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,055
I guess she was fooled too.

246
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,610
Fooled? What do you mean?

247
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:43,635
That lawyer used to be at Gi Hoon's dad's law firm.

248
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,435
He was famous for doing anything in order to win.

249
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,890
Why is Ms. Ha defending someone like that?

250
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:55,060
He probably fooled her, saying it was for Han Su.

251
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:58,530
She's a good person, so she probably believed him.

252
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:01,200
Still, he stopped me from stabbing Jun Jae.

253
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,085
He had an ulterior motive.

254
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:07,100
He had to do that in order to control you.

255
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,095
And he could make you tell him about visiting Han Su.

256
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:16,295
You and Ms. Ha are being used by that lawyer.

257
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,950
I'm sure once he hears everything he needs,

258
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,075
he'll try to make you testify in court.

259
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,345
He looked like he wanted to punch me.

260
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:36,700
I hung out with Beom Jin all the time since middle school,

261
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:38,900
but I had never seen him lose his cool.

262
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,440
But he got all worked up when I brought up his dad.

263
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,695
It looked like he really was hiding something.

264
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,435
Beom Jin...

265
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,235
and Su Ah.

266
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,505
What was their relationship?

267
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:01,690
According to Ye Ri, Tae Ra was jealous of their relationship...

268
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,315
and started to bully Su Ah.

269
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,745
Was there really something going on?

270
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,770
It is true that something seemed to be going on.

271
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,055
But Su Ah did nothing wrong.

272
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:17,595
He's the one who approached her.

273
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:19,840
Beom Jin did?

274
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,280
That's why Tae Ra bullied Su Ah.

275
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,680
Because the guy who was always uninterested in her...

276
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,375
showed an interest in Su Ah and approached her.

277
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:38,185
How's your school life these days?

278
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:40,730
So many bad things happened recently.

279
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:43,085
Is it too hard to come to school?

280
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:47,810
I'm fine, but I'm worried about the other kids.

281
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,325
I hope they'll be able to come to school without worrying soon.

282
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,565
What about you?

283
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,605
Are you okay?

284
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:04,390
- What? - You've been through a lot...

285
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,260
ever since you became our homeroom teacher.

286
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:09,545
I'm just worried about how you're doing.

287
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,815
Yes. I'm fine.

288
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:18,325
Thanks for worrying about me.

289
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,210
He knew, but he played dumb.

290
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,810
He knew Tae Ra was jealous of him and Su Ah,

291
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,080
and that Ye Ri bullied her ruthlessly because of that.

292
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,435
He knew everything, but he played dumb and let her be bullied.

293
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,080
It's not that he didn't know,

294
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,520
he pretended not to know.

295
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,960
Do you think there's anything that happens at our school...

296
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,890
that Beom Jin doesn't know about?

297
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:42,115
He definitely knew.

298
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:44,530
But when Su Ah died,

299
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,000
he acted like he had zero responsibility...

300
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,885
and acted like he cared about her. That fake.

301
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:55,095
What was Su Ah and Han Su's relationship?

302
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,525
Why do you ask?

303
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,750
I think Han Su will wake up soon.

304
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,050
Then the trial will resume.

305
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:08,890
I think it would be helpful to know whether or not...

306
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,875
they really were dating or if something else was going on.

307
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,330
You, Gi Hoon, Tae Ra, and Ye Ri.

308
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:24,315
I heard you guys were close to Su Ah.

309
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,855
It's true that they were dating.

310
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,825
But they broke up very soon.

311
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:34,580
They broke up? Why?

312
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,910
Han Su saw...

313
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:38,635
a picture of Su Ah with some man.

314
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,880
Su Ah told me...

315
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:45,790
that after seeing that photo, Han Su kept getting angry and obsessive.

316
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:48,575
And that she was scared because he came over every night.

317
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,045
Did Su Ah...

318
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,155
really say that?

319
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,985
If you don't believe me, that's fine.

320
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:04,595
I'm simply telling you what I know.

321
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,350
It looked like...

322
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,190
all the kids in the class follow him blindly.

323
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,960
Like they'd be in big trouble if they didn't listen to Beom Jin.

324
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:23,760
So he really does control them.

325
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,100
Someone that thorough...

326
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,000
pretended not to know that Ye Ri and Tae Ra...

327
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:31,570
were bullying Su Ah.

328
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:34,225
That seems very deliberate.

329
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:39,440
Maybe he wanted to stop his dad...

330
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,010
from seeing Su Ah.

331
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,080
That may be why he told her to transfer out...

332
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:46,720
and pretended he didn't know she was being bullied.

333
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,990
That could be possible.

334
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,190
From his perspective,

335
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:55,045
it was probably infuriating just seeing her in school.

336
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,700
Hey, so did you find anything on Lieutenant Oh?

337
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,170
I tailed him all day long today,

338
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,800
and he has a daughter in grade school.

339
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:07,255
Yu Yang Ki has been sponsoring her for seven years.

340
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,940
- He sponsored her? - Yes.

341
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:12,380
She had a congenital heart defect.

342
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:15,350
A transplant was her only hope.

343
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:18,150
They found a donor last year, so she got the transplant.

344
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,250
So she's much better now.

345
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,420
The one who found the donor...

346
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,090
Beom Jin's mom, Yoon Jung Ok,

347
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,260
runs a foundation for voluntary medical services.

348
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,730
They're the ones who did it, but obviously...

349
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:32,245
Yu Yang Ki was involved.

350
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,955
There's a reason why he is so devoted to him.

351
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,170
To the extent of killing a person.

352
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:42,410
I think a good politician...

353
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:45,595
must not concern too much about the party's opinion.

354
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:51,435
Luckily, I have a lot of supporters who encourage me.

355
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,580
I'll cheer for you, sir.

356
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:55,020
How could a person be so shameless?

357
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,305
My point exactly.

358
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:02,390
That scumbag is all talk. And everything he says is garbage.

359
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,345
I wish I could just...

360
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:09,985
I'm sorry, Ms. Ha.

361
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,555
It's just so upsetting.

362
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:13,770
- I think it's too early... - Darn it.

363
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,495
to discuss things like that.

364
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,710
First, I wish this bill will be passed...

365
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:21,650
so our children can be both physically and mentally healthy.

366
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,120
That's good enough for me for now.

367
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,535
Should we do it too?

368
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,005
Do what?

369
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,420
How about we use the media?

370
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:37,260
We will make it public about everything we know.

371
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:41,270
Then there will be numerous mouths to keep shut,

372
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,655
and he can't harm anyone like he's been doing.

373
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,825
I get your point,

374
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:54,310
but what if he removes all the articles and replace them...

375
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,450
with other articles like when we had Han Su's trial?

376
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:58,235
Then all that will go in vain.

377
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,620
That's why we need to prepare it thoroughly...

378
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:05,875
and make it public through a reliable medium.

379
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,645
"A reliable medium"?

380
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,330
Is there such a thing?

381
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,745
There are many.

382
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,770
Everyone else handled Su Ah's case like a piece of gossip,

383
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:19,155
but this discussed the possibility that Han Su didn't kill her.

384
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,595
It raised suspicion regarding his suicide attempt too.

He's famous for investigative journalism.

387
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,995
Once he starts something, he digs until he finds the truth.

388
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,765
I know one.

389
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,920
I have seen one article...

390
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:39,005
that has been suspicious about Su Ah's death from the beginning...

391
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,545
and suggested there's a chance...

392
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,845
that Han Su isn't the culprit.

393
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,785

and to issue a correction.

401

from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in my article...

that Mr. Lee, the man who committed suicide,

fabricated a student's student record...

00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:12,720
Does this mean Mr. Lee...

495
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,850
is also related to J's death?

496
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:18,590
That will have to be clarified through investigations.

497
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:22,475
But there are more suspicions surrounding Mr. Lee.

498
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:25,800
A prosecutor of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office,

499
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,430
who was in charge of the investigation on J's case...

500
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,670
and investigating Mr. Lee's takeover of Woonam University...

501
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,900
recently got attacked on the street.

502
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:36,470
We have also confirmed that Mr. Lee's case was also concluded...

503
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,610
as a simple suicide case, without any autopsy.

504
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:42,510
You said you also have the evidence...

505
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:44,980
to prove that Mr. Lee fabricated the student records.

506
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,620
Yes. The teacher that decided to blow the whistle...

507
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:51,420
handed us the file which has the student records...

508
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:54,245
that she has fabricated herself since two years ago.

509
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:59,745
Now, I'm going to show you the content of the file.

510
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:12,025
(Evidence of Student at Prestigious High School Fabricating Record)

511
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,235
(Evidence of Student at Prestigious High School Fabricating Record)

512
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,905
What is this?

513
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:20,980
What happened?

514
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:24,650
We're trying to figure it out, but we think Jo Mi Ju is the informant.

515
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,675
I said to fire her and shut her up for so long.

516
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,460
Tell Ms. Jun to come over tonight,

517
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,700
and that if this gets out, we're all dead.

518
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,115
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:43,325
Mom. What happened?

520
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:45,340
What happens to me now?

521
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:46,980
Don't worry about it.

522
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:48,580
I'll take care of everything.

523
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,680
How could I not worry about it?

524
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:52,680
They showed the awards I won,

525
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,975
and everyone knows I fought with that teacher!

526
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:01,375
I...

527
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,475
I'm not going to school tomorrow.

528
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,430
What are you saying?

529
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:07,630
Why not?

530
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,530
I'm sure everyone knows by now.

531
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:12,740
They're already jealous that I have good records because of money.

532
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,870
If they find I forged my student record...

533
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:17,995
Han Tae Ra. Get it together.

534
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,150
- Mom. - You need to act more arrogant.

535
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,410
If you don't go to school,

536
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,320
they'll think you really did forge your student record,

537
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:30,135
and that it's why you aren't at school.

538
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,060
Still, if everything gets out...

539
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,920
It will not. Never!

540
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,830
If this gets out, we're not the only ones who will be hurt.

541
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,330
Everyone in Veritas.

542
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:42,800
All the parents at the recitals. Everyone will go down with us.

543
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:45,525
Don't you know who those people are?

544
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,855
They won't let that happen.

545
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,340
When you go to school tomorrow,

546
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:56,510
stick next to Beom Jin all day long.

547
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,810
Beom Jin? Why?

548
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,635
If you stay with him, no one will be able to say a thing.

549
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:04,675
So don't leave his side. Stick to him like glue.

550
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,445
Got that?

551
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,410
- Look. - Oh my gosh.

552
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:27,195
- I can't believe it. - How could she show up?

553
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:29,880
- It must be nice being rich. - Look at her.

554
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:32,435
That's her, isn't it?

555
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,375
Tae Ra!

556
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:43,815
Why are you here so late?

557
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:48,915
We were worried that you wouldn't come to school.

558
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:53,225
You worried about me? You?

559
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:56,440
Of course, I was worried about my friend.

560
00:34:56,444 --> 00:35:00,225
A video like that was shared in our class's chat room.

561
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,780
Everyone but you was invited.

562
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,580
The student record forger in this video...

563
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:07,405
is you, right?

564
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:11,550
I'm dumbfounded. How could you do that?

565
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,190
Was having your mom beef up your records not good enough?

566
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,190
Seriously.

567
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,430
- I don't believe her. - Gosh.

568
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,300
Look at her.

569
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
This... This isn't me.

570
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,730
- Someone lied... - It's a lie?

571
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:25,770
Then should we listen together?

572
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:28,255
We'll see whether it's a lie or not.

573
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:34,140
There's evidence found on student record fabrication...

574
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,810
in a prestigious high school...

575
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:38,850
in Seoul?

576
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:40,680
Yes. It's the C High School that created a buzz recently...

577
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:42,890
- Oh my gosh. - It's true.

578
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,920
- I can't believe her. - I know, right?

579
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,620
- Look at her. - My gosh.

580
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:48,960
- She's such a fake. - I can't stand her.

581
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,330
- Can you believe her? - She's got some nerve.

582
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:53,185
I know, right?

583
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,715
How dare she?

584
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,940
A suspicion has been raised...

585
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,040
- Beom Jin. - that it might not have been...

586
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,410
suicide?

587
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,510
That's right. The C High School, where its scandal was disclosed...

588
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,925
Are you okay?

589
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,550
is the same school J went to, who was the victim...

590
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:12,605
of the townhouse murder case from May.

591
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,335
According to the people concerned...

592
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,575
Hey, you. What do you think you're doing?

593
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:24,190
What else?

594
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,045
I thought everyone should know.

595
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,055
Fine.

596
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,485
They should also know...

597
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,285
that you are...

598
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:37,140
the sysop of the student community portal.

599
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:39,340
- What? - For real?

600
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,740
- That was her? - Really?

601
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:43,310
- This is huge. - It was her all along?

602
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,735
- Oh my gosh. - I can't believe it.

603
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:49,375
- Oh my gosh. - What are you talking about? I...

604
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,405
Guys.

605
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:56,790
Accusing someone like a lynch mob...

606
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,215
based on an unsubstantiated video...

607
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,385
is also assault and crime.

608
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,585
What if this isn't Tae Ra?

609
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,395
Can you handle the ramifications?

610
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,135
Let's go.

611
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:26,760
What was that?

612
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,520
What is he doing?

613
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:31,230
- What happened just now? - What was that?

614
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,015
I'm shocked.

615
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:39,400
- Why is he defending her? - It's obviously her.

616
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,640
Seriously.

617
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:42,070
I'm really disappointed.

618
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,940
- Unbelievable. - How could she?

619
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,810
- She is shameless. - Goodness.

620
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:49,580
Yes. You don't need to worry.

621
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:53,135
Yes, yes. I'll take care of it all.

622
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:56,620
I'll make sure you and the foundation...

623
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,735
are not hurt by this.

624
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:00,345
Yes.

625
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:10,555
Being dead...

626
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,785
is much better.

627
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,440
Put Tae Ra's name and picture on the video...

628
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:24,210
of the forged student record...

629
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,320
and post them on every portal and social media site.

630
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:31,720
Let people find out where she lives and what school she goes to.

631
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,820
You said you wouldn't do things like this anymore.

632
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,860
Whatever. I can't stand her. What do you want from me?

633
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,560
Don't give me lip. Just do as I say.

634
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,930
I told you before.

635
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:42,870
I want to live my life too.

636
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,430
Don't call me again.

637
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:47,155
I'm going to quit being your fan as of today.

638
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,540
What? Who says you can quit...

639
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,995
Hey. Hey!

640
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,335
That jerk.

641
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:01,935
Fine. I don't need runts like him.

642
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,375
I'll do it myself.

643
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:13,215
The number of people who signed the petition jumped to over 100,000.

644
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,815
At this rate, it'll hit 200,000 without a problem.

645
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,685
(I agree.)

646
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:22,025
It's catching on.

647
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:24,825
What's next?

648
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:26,740
We should wait.

649
00:39:26,748 --> 00:39:29,210
We provided plenty of smoke, so we wait...

650
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:34,305
until he pops his head out of the cave to breathe.

651
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:44,445
Lee Do Jin. Why is he suddenly calling?

652
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,045
(Lee Do Jin)

653
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:55,655
How have you been?

654
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:02,965
Is that all...

655
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,435
you have to say to someone you fired yourself?

656
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,675
Is that all?

657
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:17,715
Let's meet right now in my office.

658
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,215
Fine. I have something to say to you as well.

659
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,455
Why does he suddenly want to see you?

660
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,540
Does he know...

661
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:31,655
we're behind the article?

662
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,265
I'll find out when I see him...

663
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:39,065
what he's got up his sleeve.

664
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:46,575
If I offended you with the words I said to you before,

665
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:48,975
I want to apologize.

666
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:54,485
Cut through the chase.

667
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,785
Don't bother saying things you don't mean.

668
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:03,695
The media has been busy lately.

669
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,625
Are you behind that?

670
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:12,905
You really are quick.

671
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:17,235
I told you before, didn't I?

672
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,105
That I will never...

673
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:25,415
take it sitting down.

674
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,485
This Friday is the deadline, right?

675
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,355
To request...

676
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:39,465
the cancellation of your law license to be voided.

677
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,305
I'll help you...

678
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:50,775
get your law license back.

679
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,085
What will it cost me?

680
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:03,355
Forget everything about Kim Han Su's case.

681
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,215
Every last bit.

682
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:09,440
Then I'll get rid of all the suspicions...

683
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,795
including tax evasion, embezzlement,

684
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,065
and illegal solicitation.

685
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,005
Don't even think of defending Kim Han Su even if he wakes up.

686
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:26,875
Just forget about everything regarding Kim Han Su and Jung Su Ah.

687
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:33,285
Just go back to being an attorney as if nothing ever happened.

688
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:42,485
And what if...

689
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:44,655
I reject your offer?

690
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:50,265
Then I'll just have to continue to make you suffer.

691
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:56,275
And you have to forget about requesting the cancellation.

692
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:08,185
I hope you make a wise decision.

693
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:11,515
Is your goal...

694
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,055
to take revenge...

695
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:18,455
or to go back to being an attorney?

696
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:36,090
Ye Ri caused a big fuss by playing the video in the hallway.

697
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:39,785
It's too big of an issue for the school to keep it a secret.

698
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:42,855
Things are going as planned,

699
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:48,625
but I'm bothered that Tae Ra keeps depending on Beom Jin.

700
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:53,340
When Su Ah was stabbed,

701
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:54,910
where were you and what did you do?

702
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:58,365
Did you have a fight with Su Ah over your student record by any chance?

703
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:00,180
And did you end up killing her?

704
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:01,680
You're being ridiculous.

705
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,775
That day, I...

706
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,245
She doesn't know much about Yu Beom Jin.

707
00:44:13,968 --> 00:44:16,155
We need to show her his true colors as quickly as possible.

708
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:20,985
That way, we'll be able to get something...

709
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:23,755
out of Han Tae Ra.

710
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:28,695
What?

711
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,735
Reporter Kang just uploaded another video.

712
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:37,120
Today, we'll be looking into K, the suspect...

713
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,950
of the townhouse murder incident.

714
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:42,290
First of all, let's hear the recent news about K.

715
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:46,100
K, who was arrested at the scene of the incident,

716
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,930
tried to commit suicide...

717
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,455
on the day of his first trial and is still unconscious.

718
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,470
But according to the hospital personnel,

719
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:56,470
he's been showing signs of improvement...

720
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:58,870
considering the fact that he started to react to light and sound.

721
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:01,510
I heard someone uploaded a national petition...

722
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:04,050
asking for a reinvestigation.

723
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,610
What will happen if they pass the petition...

724
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,680
and K eventually ends up...

725
00:45:07,688 --> 00:45:09,535
regaining his consciousness?

726
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,190
There will be a trial as soon as he recovers.

727
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:15,190
So many suspicions have aroused.

728
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:17,690
Therefore, the prosecution and police...

729
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:19,400
won't be able to ignore the request to reinvestigate the case...

730
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,615
if the Blue House decides to pass the national petition.

731
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:39,735
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

732
00:45:40,187 --> 00:45:43,375
You will be charged after the beep.

733
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:48,405
(Congressman)

734
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:01,585
It would've been nice if you could get some rest.

735
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,270
Oh, well.

736
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:06,040
Mom is going to proceed with next month's recital.

737
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:09,535
Don't overwork yourself. I'll try to talk to your mother.

738
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,135
Thanks.

739
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:14,880
I need to get off now.

740
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:17,605
Okay, call me when you're done.

741
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:32,885
(Sir, I'll take care of it.)

742
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,480
You can come back after you eat.

743
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,065
Okay.

744
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,905
Tae Ra.

745
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:01,815
What do you want?

746
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:04,685
Can you come with me for a second?

747
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:06,270
I need to talk to you in private.

748
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:08,925
Why would I follow you? I don't want to.

749
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:13,595
It's about Jung Su Ah and Yu Beom Jin.

750
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:18,810
Come with me.

751
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:22,405
It's an important matter that you should also be aware of.

752
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:39,855
Thank you.

753
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:46,595
So tell me.

754
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:48,680
Do you know where this place is?

755
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:50,095
No.

756
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,195
I've never been here before.

757
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:55,380
If you follow this path,

758
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:59,035
it'll take less than five minutes to reach Jung Su Ah's house.

759
00:48:01,762 --> 00:48:03,175
So what?

760
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,845
Here.

761
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,035
Isn't this Beom Jin?

762
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:25,565
Yes, it is.

763
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,835
Beom Jin came here exactly a week before...

764
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,375
Su Ah got stabbed.

765
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,815
He stood right there where you're standing right now.

766
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:46,825
It's weird, isn't it?

767
00:48:47,775 --> 00:48:50,625
This place isn't even near your school.

768
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:55,025
And it's not like there's anything nearby.

769
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:56,565
Right?

770
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,905
You didn't answer me when I asked you this last time.

771
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,405
Where were you and what were you doing...

772
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:06,375
on the day that Su Ah got stabbed?

773
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,945
Let me ask you a different question this time.

774
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,085
You know...

775
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:16,485
where Beom Jin was...

776
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:20,155
and what he did that night, don't you?

777
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,965
It...

778
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,380
It wasn't Beom Jin.

779
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,305
He was with me that day.

780
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:40,220
It... It can't be him.

781
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,820
I can prove it.

782
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:43,975
We watched a movie together that night.

783
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,415
(Han Su's hospital)

784
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:57,195
- Hello? - Kim Han Su just woke up.

785
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:03,695
Okay, thank you. I'll be right there.

786
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,635
Don't trust...

787
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,245
Yu Beom Jin.

788
00:50:15,562 --> 00:50:17,045
Keep that in mind.

789
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,415
I'm telling you this for your own good.

790
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:48,445
The press always uses groundless rumors to cause a fuss.

791
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:53,715
Lee Tae Seok is giving me a headache even when he's dead.

792
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,855
But I'm glad I listened to you.

793
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,040
It would've been a mess if I had gone there that day.

794
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:10,695
Who could've known...

795
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:13,505
that he'd hang himself...

796
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,035
at the very hour we were supposed to meet?

797
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:36,355
She said she wanted to escape.

798
00:51:36,643 --> 00:51:38,495
Su Ah said...

799
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:40,480
she wanted to escape.

800
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:41,840
What does that mean?

801
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,210
Escape from whom?

802
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:44,750
Is Su Ah all right?

803
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:46,120
Finish what you were saying...

804
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,835
Please check...

805
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,675
how Su Ah is right now.

806
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:52,650
Will she wake up or...

807
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:54,145
In what state should she be?

808
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,975
In what state should she be to make you tell me the truth?

809
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:00,015
Should she be recovering?

810
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:02,530
Or should she never wake up?

811
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,315
Please check on her first.

812
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:07,740
Okay. I'll check how she is and come back tomorrow.

813
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:10,640
But remember one thing.

814
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,940
If you don't tell me the truth,

815
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:15,165
tomorrow will be the last time we meet.

816
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:26,920
Can you go any faster?

817
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:29,830
I'm already speeding now.

818
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,660
We'll get into an accident.

819
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:34,330
Please, sir.

820
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:36,785
Sure. Fine.

821
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:03,145
I'm a police officer. Where's Kim Han Su?

822
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:07,300
He's in the treatment room right now.

823
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,945
Where is that?

824
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,815
(Treatment Room)

825
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,895
May I help you?

826
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:27,480
I'm a police officer.

827
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:30,150
How is the suspect doing?

828
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:32,390
He still needs his rest,

829
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:34,490
but he can express himself in simple ways.

830
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:36,275
What a relief.

831
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:39,545
Just a minute.

832
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,385
I need to check something for the case.

833
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,400
I'll ask him a few questions...

834
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,570
and bring him right back.

835
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:53,940
Right now? He only just woke up.

836
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:55,695
I won't be long.

837
00:53:56,116 --> 00:53:59,550
It's something very important about the victim.

838
00:53:59,553 --> 00:54:02,835
But still. He needs to rest.

839
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,715
I want...

840
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:18,815
to talk to you...

841
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,755
about Jung Su Ah.

842
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:23,955
Is that okay?

843
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,125
Okay.

844
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:49,415
Hello.

845
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:51,900
Where's Han Su?

846
00:54:51,905 --> 00:54:55,325
He went down to the treatment room.

847
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:58,295
Thank you.

848
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:22,045
What is it? What did you want to tell me about Su Ah?

849
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:31,640
What happened to her? Did she wake up?

850
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:33,910
You stabbed her to kill her.

851
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,465
Why do you care?

852
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:40,235
You confessed in court that you stabbed her.

853
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:43,105
Answer me.

854
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,335
Did Su Ah wake up?

855
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:48,245
Figures.

856
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:52,375
What's wrong with me?

857
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:56,145
I tried to find out something I didn't need to know.

858
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:59,485
Whether you stabbed her or not,

859
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:02,725
the conclusion is the same.

860
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,325
Did she wake up or not?

861
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:35,540
(10:58pm September 24, Tuesday)

862
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:39,725
What's taking him so long? He said he'd be quick.

863
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:45,810
Excuse me. Where's Kim Han Su?

864
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,650
What? Are you a police officer?

865
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,820
No. I'm his legal guardian.

866
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,020
Well... A police officer just came and took him,

867
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:55,945
saying he needed to ask him something.

868
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:02,800
We need to get there quickly.

869
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:05,730
If the police get there first and prevent us from seeing him,

870
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:08,240
we'll never know what Han Su tried to say that day.

871
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:10,540
You mean the day he tried to kill himself, right?

872
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:12,440
Yes. The truth is,

873
00:57:12,446 --> 00:57:16,195
we've been taking care of him in order to hear that from him.

874
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,650
If we miss our chance now, it would all go to waste.

875
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,735
It drives me crazy.

876
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:29,875
(Hospital room)

877
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:38,055
Where are you?

878
00:57:41,475 --> 00:57:43,025
The roof.

879
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:07,985
Han Su!

880
00:58:17,444 --> 00:58:19,055
Beom Jin.

881
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,995
You're late,

882
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:27,835
Mr. Lawyer.

883
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,420
What did you do to Han Su?

884
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,135
I simply told him the truth.

885
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,690
Tell me the truth. What did you do to him?

886
00:58:38,698 --> 00:58:40,315
Get lost!

887
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:44,085
Leave now.

888
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,925
I don't need a lawyer like you anymore,

889
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,185
so leave.

890
00:58:50,577 --> 00:58:53,025
- Han Su. - Beom Jin.

891
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:55,140
Take me to my room.

892
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:56,595
Okay.

893
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:09,675
Stay out...

894
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,875
of my life.

895
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:15,215
Or I'll kill you.

896
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:22,825
Stop right there!

897
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:29,895
Tell me, Han Su.

898
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:33,180
What did you want to tell me that day?

899
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:36,665
From whom did Su Ah want to escape so badly?

900
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:51,615
Let's go.

901
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,355
Tell me.

902
00:59:57,043 --> 00:59:58,695
Han Su!

903
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,695
Han Su!

904
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:08,805
