00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,330
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:22,065
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,605
(Episode 14)

4
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,405
Thank you.

5
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,585
It takes 15 minutes to get here from the theater.

6
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,480
20 minutes.

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,315
How long did it take from here?

8
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,715
I think this is it.

9
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:28,985
40 minutes.

10
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,175
What did he prepare?

11
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,505
Did you wait long?

12
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,010
Hey.

13
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,810
What's that? How boring.

14
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,805
You're not even surprised.

15
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:32,085
You said you prepared a lot. Why is there nothing here?

16
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,220
You called a cab, right?

17
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:39,885
Yes.

18
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,395
I'm sure he didn't leave any evidence.

19
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,805
It's so pretty.

20
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,310
How did you find this place?

21
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,810
I told you...

22
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:34,410
I'd make your depression disappear.

23
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,280
Thanks. I feel more at peace now.

24
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:43,085
I'm glad I was able to keep my promise.

25
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:50,595
As you say, people will forget soon, right?

26
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:53,065
It's not their lives after all.

27
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,730
I won't worry about it anymore.

28
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:58,370
It's not like I committed a grave sin or anything.

29
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,005
It'll all pass quickly.

30
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,345
No.

31
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,845
It'll follow you for life.

32
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,015
What?

33
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,260
When you think things finally quieted down,

34
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,695
someone will dig it all again.

35
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:29,570
Whenever something similar happens,

36
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:32,105
the media will talk about you.

37
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,205
You'll be stigmatized for the rest of your life...

38
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,875
and never be forgotten.

39
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,945
Until you die.

40
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,345
What do you mean?

41
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,985
Don't you get it?

42
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,825
Beom Jin.

43
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:57,155
This is why you shouldn't have told anyone about it.

44
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,865
Why did you do that?

45
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,565
You are scaring me.

46
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,805
I can't mess it up because of you.

47
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,975
It can't be...

48
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:17,815
You...

49
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,585
You wanted to be at ease.

50
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,085
I'll let you be.

51
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:56,720
Oh my gosh.

52
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,585
That scared me.

53
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,060
What is it?

54
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,225
- Are you awake? - That was scary.

55
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,825
Hey.

56
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,235
How is the movie?

57
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,040
Watch for yourself.

58
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,535
The climax is about to start.

59
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,245
It took 57 minutes.

60
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,450
A movie runs for about two hours,

61
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,025
so there's plenty of time to commit the crime and get back.

62
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,965
Then was it really Yu Beom Jin?

63
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:45,170
But there's no way to prove it.

64
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:47,035
Why not?

65
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:50,105
There's Tae Ra, who watched the movie with him.

66
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:54,280
If he left for an hour for whatever reason,

67
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,545
there's no way she didn't notice.

68
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:01,250
Then...

69
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,320
Only Tae Ra can attest to it.

70
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,120
That Yu Beom Jin...

71
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,625
had no alibi whatsoever that day when Su Ah...

72
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,595
was stabbed.

73
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,885
(Donghan Hospital)

74
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:42,325
How did Su Ah come to our school?

75
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,770
Was it, by any chance, General Manager Lee Tae Seok...

76
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,635
(Hye Soo)

77
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,875
Excuse me for a second.

78
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,705
Yes, Hye Soo.

79
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:04,150
What's going on now?

80
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,885
Han Tae Ra died?

81
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,055
No way.

82
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,425
Darn it.

83
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,595
(Yedo General Hospital)

84
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:47,025
Guardians may now identify the body.

85
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,970
Tae Ra!

86
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:04,640
Tae Ra, my baby!

87
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:08,015
No!

88
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,820
Tae Ra!

89
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,015
It's okay.

90
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,025
How could this...

91
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,935
Tae Ra!

92
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,415
You...

93
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,025
Explain.

94
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,030
Yu Beom Jin.

95
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,695
I said, explain.

96
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,135
You killed her.

97
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,470
- What? - I warned you.

98
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,240
I gave you one last chance too.

99
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,280
If only you listened to me,

100
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,445
Han Tae Ra wouldn't have had to die.

101
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,345
Tell it to me straight.

102
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:22,590
If only you didn't come to the school, nothing would have happened.

103
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:25,525
Everyone would have been fine even now.

104
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,290
Tell me!

105
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,900
It's the same with Jung Su Ah. If it weren't for you,

106
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,565
our school wouldn't have had so much trouble.

107
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:36,065
You caused all the problems.

108
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,265
And I solved them.

109
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:43,705
You freak!

110
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,245
You killed a person.

111
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,475
Stand up.

112
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,320
You scumbag.

113
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:58,625
Didn't you hear me? You killed her.

114
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:03,530
Shut up, you punk!

115
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,560
What are you doing?

116
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,570
What are you waiting for? Take him out!

117
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,535
What are you doing, sir?

118
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,940
Let go of me! Yu Beom Jin, you freak!

119
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,675
Yu Beom Jin!

120
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,120
Son, are you all right?

121
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,015
I'm okay, Mom.

122
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:29,150
What's wrong with that jerk?

123
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:32,425
He's right. It's all my fault.

124
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,595
I failed to protect Tae Ra.

125
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,400
That's not true. You didn't do anything wrong, son.

126
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,065
No.

127
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:46,565
I'm sure Mr. Gi did that because he got upset.

128
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,175
Let's go.

129
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,745
We need to take care of her.

130
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,115
Okay.

131
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,600
What are you? Why did you try to hit the student?

132
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,835
I'm Han Tae Ra's...

133
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,005
homeroom teacher.

134
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,310
Homeroom teacher, I see.

135
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:28,580
I get you're upset,

136
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:31,720
but you shouldn't hit your innocent student.

137
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:34,320
The student said he's all right, so we'll let you off this time,

138
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,620
but you'd better apologize to him when you see him again.

139
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,090
What happened?

140
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,755
Pardon?

141
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,455
How did...

142
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,965
Tae Ra die?

143
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,995
She fell from the rooftop of a tall building.

144
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,035
Well...

145
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,535
She seems to have committed suicide.

146
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,440
I heard that she went through a lot these days.

147
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:01,815
She even left a message on her phone that she wanted to die.

148
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,020
A message to whom?

149
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,515
The student you just hit.

150
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,320
He must be going through a lot now.

151
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,925
You shouldn't have taken out on him.

152
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,725
We'll be off then.

153
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,835
Mr. Gi!

154
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,880
What happened?

155
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:35,445
Is it true? Did you check it?

156
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,615
The police say...

157
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,055
she committed suicide.

158
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,060
Suicide?

159
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,025
That's ridiculous.

160
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,995
Yu Beom Jin killed her.

161
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:58,470
He used Tae Ra as an alibi for the day of Su Ah's death...

162
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:00,605
and now it's about to be found out,

163
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:04,175
he killed her and disguised it as a suicide.

164
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:09,510
But how could he kill his own girlfriend?

165
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,080
He told me...

166
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,445
that if only I listened to him,

167
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:17,085
Tae Ra wouldn't have had to die.

168
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,985
If only I didn't come to the school,

169
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,555
nothing would have happened...

170
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,995
and everyone would have been fine.

171
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,965
I can't believe this.

172
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:35,375
It's my fault.

173
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:38,775
Han Tae Ra died because of me.

174
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:41,005
Hyun Jung...

175
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,545
Tae Ra... It's all because of me.

176
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,960
Don't be a fool.

177
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,200
Ms. Ha.

178
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,670
Those who have wronged must feel guilty.

179
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,535
You didn't do anything wrong, Mr. Gi.

180
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:09,340
She's right, you punk. You didn't do anything wrong.

181
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:12,375
Yu Beom Jin, that jerk, is the lunatic.

182
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,310
We must stop him.

183
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,250
If we give up now,

184
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:21,415
I don't know how far he'll go.

185
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,025
Everything is over now.

186
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,680
As you all know,

187
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,280
what had happened to Tae Ra is...

188
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,580
an unplanned suicide caused...

189
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:27,215
by the stress from vicious articles about her.

190
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,860
Anyway, as far as this incident is concerned,

191
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,560
the school knows nothing.

192
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:43,030
As the rumor regarding her student record is groundless,

193
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,870
don't let this get to you.

194
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,375
Please focus on taking care of our students.

195
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,545
You're going to silence us...

196
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,745
and cover this up again?

197
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,515
What?

198
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,660
How many more students must get hurt and be in pain...

199
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,730
for you to admit your mistakes?

200
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,860
Until when will you pretend to be clueless...

201
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,665
and neglect this?

202
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,330
Unbelievable.

203
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,370
Do you think I'm doing this only for my sake?

204
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:21,040
This is for the school and all the teachers here.

205
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,705
No.

206
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,745
This isn't what we want.

207
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:34,820
I believe if someone has wronged, he or she must admit it...

208
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,455
and right the wrongs.

209
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,925
Excuse me.

210
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,660
I agree.

211
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:48,100
All those wrongdoings that took place at the school...

212
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,365
must be admitted and disclosed to the public.

213
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:53,200
I agree.

214
00:19:53,209 --> 00:20:02,945
- I agree. - I agree.

215
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,450
It seems like you need a proper way...

216
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,255
of handling this incident.

217
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:16,390
Sir, this request is coming from the foundation.

218
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,560
The school is for the students. This isn't a place...

219
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,995
where we flatter the foundation and chase after profits.

220
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,040
I will take full responsibility...

221
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,910
of requesting an inspection from the Office of Education...

222
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,205
regarding this unfortunate incident.

223
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,840
- I can't believe it. - We should've done it before.

224
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,550
I'm glad to hear that.

225
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,945
What if they turn it down?

226
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,720
(Mr. Gi Kang Je)

227
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:49,025
Please come out to the school gate.

228
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,865
What's going to happen to our school?

229
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,170
How many students died so far?

230
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,940
(Tae Ra, be happy over there.)

231
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,170
I can't believe she committed suicide.

232
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,010
Hey, this is crazy.

233
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,340
- I can't believe this. - My gosh.

234
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,450
- Hey. - Did you hear?

235
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,645
Tae Ra committed suicide?

236
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:43,075
(Go to a good place and be happy.)

237
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,415
Everyone, thank you.

238
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:48,885
This is such a nice gesture for Tae Ra.

239
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,225
Why did you do it?

240
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,560
You were Tae Ra's best friend.

241
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,595
But why did you do such a despicable thing?

242
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:06,200
I didn't do anything.

243
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,435
I only spoke the truth.

244
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,550
- Did you hear that? - She's unbelievable.

245
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,450
How could she be so brazen?

246
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:23,090
- I can't believe her. - She's so scary.

247
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,790
Are you serious? Don't pretend you are innocent in all of this.

248
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,490
We all enjoyed seeing her in pain and laughed at her together.

249
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,090
Why are you pointing fingers at me?

250
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,030
We weren't going to take it that far.

251
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,570
She's right. Besides, you tried to turn everyone against Su Ah too.

252
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,430
You said you'd bully me if I didn't bully her with you.

253
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,240
- Really? - I can't believe it.

254
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,640
Explain yourself if you can.

255
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,740
She was the one who started this.

256
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:44,310
- She's so shameless. - She's despicable.

257
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,480
What's wrong with her?

258
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,540
- How could she be so mean? - How can she be so brazen?

259
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,110
- She's shameless, you know. - Seriously.

260
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,520
- She was the bully. - Hey, she's leaving.

261
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,620
- She should've left long ago. - Unbelievable.

262
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,720
Did you see her acting all wounded?

263
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:58,790
- She's so creepy, you know. - Exactly.

264
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,360
- Look. - She's so despicable.

265
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,595
She should have a sense of shame.

266
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:17,780
The public consensus...

267
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,140
and the reinvestigation are pointing at Lee Tae Seok.

268
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,265
But you'll keep Kim Han Su as your scapegoat?

269
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:25,820
If we change our suspect now,

270
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,450
only the prosecution will face the damage.

271
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,765
I'm sure you know this well.

272
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,820
What if Kim Han Su is found not guilty...

273
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,960
at the trial because of your stubbornness?

274
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:38,215
It will humiliate the organization even more.

275
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:43,015
After all, you indicted him for murder and requested for 20 years.

276
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:45,970
Submit a blank sentencing.

277
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,140
(Blank sentencing: Leaving the sentencing up to the judge)

278
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,755
What?

279
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,840
If we do that, we might as well as admit...

280
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,510
that we got the wrong guy for our suspect.

281
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,380
If you're bound to face the difficulties,

282
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:59,450
it's better to get it from me instead of strangers.

283
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:02,020
If the prosecution admits their mistake first...

284
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,660
and cooperates the best they can to arrest the real culprit,

285
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,475
I'm sure the public will be kind to the prosecution.

286
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,860
Is there...

287
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,770
another reason why you can't?

288
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:19,055
A reason that Kim Han Su has to become the culprit?

289
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,880
If there's something, tell me.

290
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,195
I'll help in any way I can.

291
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,435
Actually,

292
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,705
the order came from the chief prosecutor.

293
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:43,130
I was told to conclude Kim Han Su and Lee Tae Seok's cases...

294
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:46,745
as suicides.

295
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,330
The chief prosecutor...

296
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:50,330
of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office?

297
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,670
He's the most promising candidate...

298
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,655
to become the public prosecutor general.

299
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,870
Who influenced him?

300
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,880
Well, I don't know that far.

301
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,280
Anyway,

302
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:04,195
it's not something I can decide.

303
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:11,020
That jerk, Gi Mu Hyeok.

304
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:14,005
He knows everything about our relationship with Lee Tae Seok.

305
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,745
What? How... How did that jerk...

306
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:22,445
I don't think he plans to expose us yet.

307
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:26,315
Just follow my advice and submit a blank sentencing for Kim Han Su.

308
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,225
I'll give it some thought over the course of time...

309
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,025
on how to get rid of that jerk.

310
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:38,095
Goodness, if I do that, I won't be promoted.

311
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:42,705
Don't be so sad.

312
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:47,435
We'll hire you as a partner lawyer at our law firm.

313
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,315
With excellent conditions.

314
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:57,245
Okay.

315
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,495
You were right.

316
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:12,095
I can't let him have his way.

317
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,090
No matter how meticulous and monstrous he is,

318
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,805
I'm sure there's something he missed.

319
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,905
We must find what it is no matter what.

320
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,605
Okay.

321
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,475
I'll help too.

322
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,500
First, we need to meet with Han Su and get him to change his mind.

323
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,155
Otherwise,

324
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:35,170
everything will end the way Beom Jin wants.

325
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,125
We must prevent that.

326
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:41,965
How will you persuade Han Su?

327
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,405
That's why I brought this.

328
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,705
We have to hope that he'll realize it on his own.

329
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,280
What is this?

330
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:17,280
They're things your lawyer found out...

331
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,750
while you were unconscious.

332
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:21,435
My lawyer?

333
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,535
You don't mean that jerk Gi Mu Hyeok, do you?

334
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,860
That's right. Mr. Gi...

335
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,545
Put that away.

336
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:36,530

00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:38,855
- He... - Put that away!

338
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:50,465
What's the point of any of this?

339
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,295
Su Ah's dead.

340
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,590
Whatever it is that lawyer found out,

341
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,190
I don't want to know.

342
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,090
If that's what you're here for, please leave.

343
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,045
I don't want to hear it.

344
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,165
I know...

345
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:34,505
what you're trying to protect about Su Ah.

346
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,730
Whatever you decide, that's fine.

347
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:44,230
But don't avoid it. Look at this...

348

before you make your decision.

349
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,965
I'll be waiting.

350
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,075
How did it go?

351
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,200
Wait a little.

352
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,615
I think he needs a little more time.

He says to come in.

381
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,125
Is all of this...

382
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,395
true?

383
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,105
Was Su Ah...

384
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,875
really used in this way?

385
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,445
Sadly,

386
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,815
it's true.

387

Beom Jin knew that his dad was seeing Su Ah,

388

didn't he?

389
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:47,380
That's right.

390
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,950
He installed a spy app on his father's phone...

391
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:52,435
and was watching everything.

to me, he...

394
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:58,990
Now tell us the truth.

395
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:02,975
Did you really see Lee Tae Seok at Su Ah's place that night?

396
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:13,415
Han Su, you need to choose.

00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,640
Will you use Lee Tae Seok to bury everything as Beom Jin wants,

398
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:20,955
or will you make everyone who used Su Ah and killed her...

399
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:25,265
pay for their sins?

400
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,685
I'll tell you.

401
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,125
I'll tell you...

402
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,195

403
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,895
make those jerks who did that...

(Witness Statement)

407
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,315
So,

408
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:19,255
he showed you a picture of the victim in the hospital bed...

409
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:22,885
and relayed the story about the Little Mermaid.

410
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,025
Yes, that's correct.

411
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:32,095
The police are investigating me?

412
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,965
Don't worry. They're questioning you as a witness, that's all.

413
00:34:39,427 --> 00:34:41,105
It's okay.

414
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,175
Just tell them about the Little Mermaid.

415
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:49,100
Say you had no idea what it meant.

416
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:50,830
Then I'd be lying.

417
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,455
If you say it meant he should kill himself,

418
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:56,985
you'll be tied to Lee Tae Seok as his accomplice.

419
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,395
If they prove induced suicide,

420
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:02,065
you may take the fall for murder as well.

421
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:05,895
Why... Why would I...

422
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,090
Whether or not you knew what it meant,

423
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:17,245
it doesn't change the fact that Han Su jumped from the roof.

424
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:21,715
It would be unfair for you to take the fall...

425
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,145
for what Lee Tae Seok made you do.

426
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,655
Right.

427
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:31,755
He bought me...

428
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:35,155
things like sneakers and asked me favors.

429
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:50,960
So you had no idea...

430
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:53,115
that the suspect would kill himself.

431
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:56,500
No.

432
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:58,215
I see.

433
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,240
At least I'll write that on the report.

434
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,585
That you didn't know anything.

435
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,210
But...

436
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:10,780
if you go back on your word or cause any trouble,

437
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,265
you will need to prepare yourself to be put behind the bars.

438
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:17,305
Okay.

439
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,505
I won't.

440
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:27,445
Su Ah...

441
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:30,385
pretended she didn't know me and avoided me.

442
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:34,315
It frustrated me and I tagged along with her.

443
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:39,510
Then after one big fight,

444
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,525
I made up my mind.

445
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:45,125
I told myself, now she lives in a different world,

446
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,135
I would turn a blind eye to it.

447
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,635
I thought...

448
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:53,775
that would make Su Ah happy.

449
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:58,275
While I hung out with kids like Jun Jae and Jung Tae,

450
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,730
Su Ah hung out...

451
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:06,155
with the coolest kids in the school like Beom Jin and Tae Ra.

452
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,555
But I was wrong.

453
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,295
Su Ah...

454
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,295
became unhappier because of them.

455
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,820
- Punch him! - Go!

456
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,320
Get him!

457
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,850
Come on!

00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:25,360

Hey!

461
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,405
- Hey! - Goodness.

462
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,560
What are you doing?

463
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,615
Hit him!

464
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,485
Darn it.

465
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:39,600
Hang in there!

466
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,225
Come watch it with us. It's the final match.

467

468
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,980
With the weak kids?

469
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:50,310
Come on. Don't do this again. We already talked about it.

Since we started Shuttle Monster Fighter,

471
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,120
we have a lot more customers in our pawn shop.

472
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:56,950
This is not just for my own good.

473
00:37:56,958 --> 00:38:00,635
You said you wanted to make money too. You can't say...

474
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,275
I'll get going.

475
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,545
You should wrap it up and go home too.

476
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:11,100
Fine. Go.

477
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:13,815
It's better than killing the joy here.

478
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:18,655
Hey, come on! Keep going!

479
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,825
Seriously!

480
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,410
You scum!

481
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,225
You...

482
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,865
Darn you!

483
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:04,235
How could you...

484
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,395
And not long after,

485
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,680
a picture of Su Ah and Lee Tae Seok...

486
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:30,665
was posted on the student community.

487
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,020
Kids started talking about Su Ah,

488
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:38,405
and Tae Ra and Ye Ri's bullying became worse.

489
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,435
I was worried about that...

490
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,575
and went to Su Ah's place.

491
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:48,875
Then I saw...

492
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:53,285
the man Su Ah met.

493
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,815
Why did Su Ah...

498
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:32,415
You said you had something to say. Why aren't you saying anything?

499
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,085
Is it because of the picture again?

500
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,970
I told you...

501
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:41,795
I'm not seeing Lee Tae Seok, so stay out of my business.

502
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:47,065
I'm not the Yu Sun you knew. She's gone.

503
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,520
So just pretend you don't know me.

504
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:51,835
I will do the same.

505

00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:05,400
I was going to pretend I didn't know you if you were happy.

507
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:07,140
But you're not.

508
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:10,925
You're in pain now. Am I wrong?

509
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:16,210
I will always protect you.

510
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,095
That's the promise.

511
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,620
"Promise"?

512
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,020
You promised when we were in the orphanage.

513
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:30,090
You promised you'd study hard and become successful.

514
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:32,575
And when you buy a nice house and a nice car,

515
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,415
you said...

516
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,845
you would make me your driver.

517
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,955
You...

518
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:45,325
You still remember that?

519
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,895
Until then,

520
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:53,035
I will protect you even if it costs me my life.

521
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:56,835
So you must keep your word.

522
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:04,575
(Recipient, 75-6, Sangrae-dong, Hwamyeong-si, Gyeonggi Province)

523
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:35,435
Could you send this per post?

524
00:43:37,465 --> 00:43:39,105
(Recipient, 75-6, Sangrae-dong, Hwamyeong-si, Gyeonggi Province)

525
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:42,945

526
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:46,415
What is this?

527
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:49,725
You said you would protect me.

528
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:53,055
Yes.

529
00:43:54,315 --> 00:43:57,765
This will protect me too.

530
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,035
Please do it for me.

531
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,535
Okay.

532
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,775
I want to get out of this too.

533
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:18,385
Su Ah.

534
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:22,355
So please wait for me...

535
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,595
until I can go back to who I was.

536
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:29,155
I will keep...

537
00:44:30,618 --> 00:44:32,665
my promise too.

538
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:57,485
That's...

539
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:01,455
the last conversation...

540
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:04,165
I had with Su Ah.

541
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:13,990
She sent a post...

542
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:16,645
that will protect her?

543
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,475
Maybe Su Ah left evidence.

544
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:25,415
Where did you send the post to?

545
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,915
It was addressed...

546
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,985
to the orphanage.

547
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,025
The one at the catholic church?

548
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:39,265
Yes. When she asked, she seemed like she was...

549
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:42,835
getting her affairs in order.

550
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,635
So I was anxious. After I mailed the package,

551
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,745
I went back to Su Ah, and...

552
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,415
Su Ah.

553
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,225
Su Ah.

554
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,395
Are you in there?

555
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,535
Su Ah.

556
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,735
Su Ah!

557
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:22,635
Han Su...

558
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:45,295
No!

559
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,220
No!

560
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,350
Let go. Let go of me!

561
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:54,175
Su Ah!

562
00:46:57,865 --> 00:46:59,545
I didn't see...

563
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:02,375
Lee Tae Seok.

564
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,345
When I got there,

565
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,555
no one was there.

566
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:13,255
Then why did you say that to the police?

567
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,265
Beom Jin...

568
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:20,165
told me to say I saw Lee Tae Seok flee out the back door.

569
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:23,990
- The back door? - Yes.

570
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:26,775
He said if I say I saw him flee out the door from her room,

571
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:29,135
the police would believe me.

572
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,275
And that...

573
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:34,515
it was the only way to protect Su Ah...

574
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,045
from the rumors.

575
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,725
Beom Jin...

576
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:46,755
made a mistake.

577
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:50,525
A mistake?

578
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:56,050
Only the killer would know the path through the back door.

579
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:58,305
The fact that he knows it...

580
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:04,505
means he used that path...

581
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:07,945
to go kill Su Ah.

582
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:15,185
- Then... - Beom Jin is definitely the killer.

583
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:20,795
He must have been in a rush.

584
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,135
He confessed himself.

585
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:43,470
The nun wouldn't have lied.

586
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,970
Maybe they don't have it.

587
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:46,900
We should check though.

588
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:50,655
Regardless, it's such a relief that Han Su told the truth.

589
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,025
He was such a pain in the neck. Right?

590
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:57,680
But he was the only person who could testify.

591
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:01,935
Thanks to him, we confirmed that Beom Jin is the killer.

592
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:06,735
Beom Jin...

593
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:09,290
did a dry run...

(Soltz Townhouse)

596
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,015
in order to create an alibi.

597
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,045
That meticulous punk.

598
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,385
Hold on.

599
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:25,240
Did Beom Jin call the cops too?

600
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,910
To frame Han Su?

601
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:29,950
No. Han Su was a variable. He wasn't in his calculations.

602
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,820
If he had known, he would've killed Su Ah for sure.

603
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,650
She was conscious. If she said his name,

604
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:38,105
everything he had prepared would've been in vain.

605
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:42,060
True. If things went south,

606
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,505
his alibi would've been useless.

607
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,300
Everything thus far has gone according to Beom Jin's plan.

608
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:52,600
He manipulated the people around him...

609
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:55,485
and created situations that are most favorable to him.

610
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:57,885
From now on,

611
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:01,195
we will manipulate him.

612
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:03,710
- We'll manipulate him? - How?

613
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,180
We'll create variables.

614
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:08,620
With a surefire bait.

Who knew you'd recover so quickly?

620
00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:33,325
Gosh.

621
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:38,965
You have so much. May I take one?

622
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:43,665
How can you drink that after coming empty-handed?

623
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:47,505
Well.

624
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:50,690
Why do you think I came empty-handed?

625
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:53,745
I worked crazy hard while you were sleeping.

626
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:57,985
What is this?

627
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,370
Han Su told me everything.

628
00:51:00,374 --> 00:51:01,900
He told the police that he saw Lee Tae Seok...

629
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:03,840
because Beom Jin tricked him.

630
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:07,910
But he made a critical mistake in the process.

631
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:09,595
A mistake?

632
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:13,965
Take a look yourself. I included all the other evidence too.

633
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,720
You worked hard. We should finish it together.

634
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:22,390
I plan to get discharged right away.

635
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:26,745
I'll lock up the jerks who cracked my head open.

636
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,500
Good.

for the presidential election for the Suho Party...

640
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:49,990
are registering at the National Assembly Building today.

641
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,690
The Suho Party announced that their candidate...

642
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,460
will be decided by the votes of the entire nation.

643
00:51:57,464 --> 00:51:59,900
Thus, every citizen of our country...

644
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,385
can vote to decide which candidate runs for the Suho Party.

Isn't it a bit soon for you...

to run?

I feel like you were a baby Congressman only yesterday.

648

It's never too soon or too late to create a new world.

649
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:29,690
Consider this election a good experience.

650
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:33,115
You have the next election and the one after that.

651
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:36,600
If I am elected this time,

652
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:40,655
I'll make sure to support you all the way.

653

I hope we'll have a clean and fair competition without smear campaigns.

Reorganize everyone from aides to interns and volunteers,

00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:11,070
their personal lives are clean.

00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:17,885
Yes, sir.

660
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,545
Who is this?

661
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:44,970
It's nice to meet you,

662
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,685
Congressman Yu Yang Ki.

663
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,470
First, congratulations.

664
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,280
You registered to be a presidential candidate.

665
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,210
You receive support and interest of the people,

666
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:58,150
so you'll win the primaries easily...

667
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:01,265
and move on straight to the presidential election.

668

As long as nothing scandalous occurs.

669
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,290
Who are you?

670
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:08,460
I'm Kim Han Su's attorney.

671
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:11,845
I called because I have something to tell you about Jung Su Ah.

672
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Jung Su Ah? Who is that?

673
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:18,645
You must not remember.

674
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,515
She was your son's friend from school.

675
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:27,840
Seeing as you're silent, you must remember.

676
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,450
Let's discuss the details in person.

677
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,395
I'll wait for your text to this number.

678
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:48,515
I've thrown out the bait.

679
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:56,870
I'm not sure.

680
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,240
I gave you everything we have...

681
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:02,110
that had anything to do with Yu Sun last time.

682
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:05,150
Did anything come by mail?

683
00:55:05,152 --> 00:55:07,020
About 4 to 5 months ago.

684
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,350
No.

685
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:11,620
If anything did come, I'd remember.

686
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:15,235
Especially since it's Yu Sun's.

687
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:25,600
Han Su said this would be the address.

688
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:27,240
Where is it?

689
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,410
I know. It was several months ago already.

690
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,185
It should've arrived by now.

691
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,110
(Post)

692
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:38,125
Excuse me!

693
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:41,220
Yes? What is it?

694
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:44,220
Do you deliver all the mail to this church?

695
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,860
That's right. This is our post office's district.

696
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,430
Do you know about a large envelope that was delivered a few months ago?

697
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,730
It was about this big. There was a bluebird on the envelope.

698
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:57,100
How could I remember that?

699
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,000
I deliver so many large envelopes every day.

700
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:02,440
But why do you ask?

701
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,340
Well, my friend sent something very important to the church,

702
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:08,640
but they said they never received it.

703
00:56:08,648 --> 00:56:10,310
Really?

704
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:13,220
Then check with the post office.

705
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,320
The post office?

706
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:16,620
Yes. They hold mail that couldn't be delivered...

707
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,205
for several months.

708
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:22,505
If you're lucky, you may be able to find it.

709
00:56:23,764 --> 00:56:25,230
Thank you.

710
00:56:25,232 --> 00:56:27,675
Not at all. Good luck.

711
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:30,645
- Thank you. - Sure.

712
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:40,495
Bite.

713
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:43,595
Bite.

714
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:50,050
See you at the Namgang museum an hour from now.

715
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:51,905
He bit.

716
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:55,460
Okay. Since you're making time for me,

717
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:58,545
I'll tell you who killed Su Ah.

718
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:44,740
(I'll tell you who killed Su Ah.)

719
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:47,340
See you at the Namgang museum an hour from now.

720
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:50,350
Okay. Since you're making time for me,

721
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,835
I'll tell you who killed Su Ah.

722
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,015
"Camouflaged Selves".

723
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,610
What a great painting.

724
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,295
It matches you well.

725
00:58:55,382 --> 00:58:58,995
You know who killed her?

726
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:01,480
So do you admit you were seeing her?

727
00:59:01,488 --> 00:59:03,050
Answer me.

728
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:05,465
Who killed her?

729
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,960
But first,

730
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,845
shouldn't you ask how I know?

731
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:15,115
Doesn't that come first?

732
00:59:17,938 --> 00:59:20,655
I found out through your son.

733
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:25,040
He's very interested in his father.

734
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:29,310
Enough to install a spy app on your phone and monitor you.

735
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,410
He was using that...

736
00:59:31,418 --> 00:59:35,295
to look at everything on your phone.

737
00:59:36,423 --> 00:59:38,465
Do you get it now?

738
00:59:39,526 --> 00:59:44,660
Your son knew that you were seeing a girl...

739
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:48,475
who went to his high school. He knew everything.

740
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:56,140
If you don't trust me, why don't you check now?

741
00:59:56,142 --> 01:00:00,510
If he saw the texts that you and I exchanged,

742
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,140
wouldn't he show up here?

743
01:00:02,148 --> 01:00:06,425
Because he'll be very curious about our conversation.

744
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:10,620
I'm warning you.

745
01:00:10,624 --> 01:00:13,105
Don't try anything funny.

746
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:17,730
Answer me.

747
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:20,245
Who killed her?

748
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:25,345
I thought I made myself clear, but you still don't get it.

749
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,655
Then...

750
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:31,385
why don't you see for yourself?

751
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,625
Do you see it now?

752
01:01:08,148 --> 01:01:09,480
Congratulations.

753
01:01:09,482 --> 01:01:13,895
You've found out one more thing about your son.

754
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:16,535
You...

755
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:20,105
I'm disappointed,

756
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:21,835
Father.

757
01:01:22,629 --> 01:01:26,915
You're pretty good, Gi Mu Hyeok.

758
01:01:32,305 --> 01:01:33,840
You came sooner than I expected.

759
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,940
We didn't get to the heart of our conversation yet.

760
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,110
What do you plan to do?

761
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,370
What else?

762
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:42,740
I planned to tell him about Su Ah's killer,

763
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:45,165
and you showed up.

764
01:01:45,485 --> 01:01:48,965
Thanks to you, I don't need to bother with a long explanation.

765
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,905
Congressman Yu.

766
01:01:51,057 --> 01:01:54,075
Su Ah's killer came...

767
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:56,675
here...

768
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,745
right now.

769
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,855
