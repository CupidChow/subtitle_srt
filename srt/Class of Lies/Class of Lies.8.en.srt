(Ahn Byung Ho)

5
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,570
How much of this do you think...

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,840
is true?

7
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:33,080
I don't know whether or not she was being secretly photographed,

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,080
but it's true that Su Ah was stressed out...

9
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:38,315
about Gi Hoon following her around and bothering her.

10
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,745
And Tae Ra's student record is a sure thing.

11
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:45,720
Will you talk to Byung Ho for me?

12
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,530
Me?

13
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:51,230
I feel like he'd be more inclined to open up to you than to a teacher.

14
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,070
Of course, I'll try as well,

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,795
but he may get uncomfortable.

16
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,340
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

17
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:02,810
Don't be too abrupt. Slowly. Get closer to him first.

18
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,475
- Okay? - Okay.

19
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,145
Do I have to make him fall for me too?

20
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,185
Ms. Jo.

21
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,115
Were you in the middle of a counseling session?

22
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,560
It's okay. We just finished.

23
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,595
- I'll go now. - Okay.

24
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,295
What are you doing here so late?

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,980
You heard everything that night, didn't you?

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,875
What Mr. Lee and I talked about.

27
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,845
Take this.

28
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,285
What is this?

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,065
It's all in there.

30
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:04,400
Everything I wrote in Tae Ra's student record...

31
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:07,135
ever since she was in the ninth grade.

32
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,340
It isn't just Tae Ra.

33
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:12,180
It has a list of our school's VIP students and parents,

34
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:15,205
and all the special treatments that they received.

35
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:18,380
I put in everything that I know.

36
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,090
VIPs?

37
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,755
They'll all be at Tae Ra's recital tonight.

38
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,585
It isn't a charity recital.

39
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,930
It's a cartel...

40
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,625
to maintain their position on top of the pyramid.

41
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:43,510
That's why Lee Tae Seok is so obsessed with the recital.

42
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,935
Since all the parents that have what he wants will be gathered.

43
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,180
They knew he was being bullied so badly he wanted to die,

44
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,620
and all they cared about was their VIP students.

45
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,790
When he got in trouble, they couldn't wait to kick him out.

46
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,445
That's what...

47
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,555
the real teachers did.

48
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:04,300
Most of the students at our school...

49
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,130
are like side dishes there to make the VIPs shine.

50
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,470
A few parents shop for special treatments...

51
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,070
and hand them down to their kids,

52
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,905
and the other kids pay the price.

53
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,050
I know it's hard to believe.

54
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,680
- But... - I need to go.

55
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,480
You'll go there?

56
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,490
Yes. I need to see for myself...

57
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:32,385
who it is that's turning our students into monsters.

58
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,090
From his reserve fund to takeover policy...

59
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:05,455
and the preferences of the students and staff...

60
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,690
Lee Tae Seok falls short in every aspect...

61
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,860
for him to be selected as the preferred bidder.

62
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you doing now?

63
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,370
I thought this was going to be just a witness interview...

64
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:17,435
regarding the embezzlement of the university funds.

65
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,310
When I visited you at the school, yes, you were merely a witness.

66
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:25,080
But after interviewing you, I'm starting to have other suspicions.

67
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,475
Enough so that you can even become a suspect.

68
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,220
It was just a meal.

69
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,060
And we parted right afterwards.

70
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:44,500
Do you always need a woman next to you at the table?

71
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:48,365
If it was just a meal, why did you go to such an exclusive place?

72
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:51,835
That day,

73
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:56,005
what did you and Lee Tae Seok talk about at the restaurant?

74
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,410
It can happen in the blink of an eye.

75
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:04,245
Going from a witness to a suspect.

76
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:09,045
Like that.

77
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,060
Why don't I make a suggestion?

78
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,055
Which will prevent that change.

79
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,030
What would that be?

80
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:20,225
Cancel Lee Tae Seok's preferred bidder position.

81
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:23,440
Cut ties with him completely and tell me everything you know.

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,910
Then it'll be Lee Tae Seok who sits in that seat,

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,365
not you, Chancellor Jung.

84
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,905

Where are you even from?

88

I'm from Korea, you idiot.

89
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,145
Okay. It's planted.

90
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,745
Okay. Stand by in the lobby.

91
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,770
You want to abandon me...

92
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:32,100
after taking advantage of me? Darn it!

93
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,965

Hold on. Wait!

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,495
Gosh.

170
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,640
She brought investigators.

171
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,470
She must want to arrest Lee Tae Seok.

172
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,465
Lee Tae Seok?

173
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:12,380
Hey.

174
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:14,135
I mean...

175
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,450
Ms. Ha.

176
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,575
What are you talking about? Will he be arrested?

177
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,275
What?

178
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,350
Well...

179
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:23,185
Please tell me the truth.

180
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,385
Let's talk somewhere else.

181
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,055
Darn it.

182
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,755
Gi Mu Hyeok?

183
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,230
What are you doing here?

184
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:10,195
You're here to arrest him, right? Lee Tae Seok.

185
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,010
Not yet. He's just the tail.

186
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,970
If you arrest him now, you'll miss the head and the body.

187
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:19,535
Tail? Why did you show up here and what are you talking about?

188
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,545
Watch what you say in front of Ms. Woo.

189
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:33,290
Give me something that will keep my mouth shut.

190
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:35,260
It was what you wanted, President Lee.

191
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:39,095
You wanted to frame Han Su for everything about Su Ah.

192
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:41,870
Get him out of the way.

193
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,865
Wait. Cha Hyun Jung! Cha Hyun Jung!

194
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,710
What are you up to now?

195
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,375
Lee Tae Seok...

196
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,245
was not Jung Su Ah's sponsor.

197
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,985
He just used her to entertain people.

198
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,655
Someone is behind him.

199
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,460
That's the one who killed Su Ah and framed Han Su for it.

200
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:11,060
Even if you arrest Lee Tae Seok now, he'll be released soon.

201
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,525
We have to find the hard evidence and the person behind him.

202
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:21,340
Is that why you're eavesdropping? With this?

203
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,605
I have to listen in to find the person behind...

204
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,720
You're disbarred...

205
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:35,185
and now you want to be a criminal?

206
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,420
I'm not like you.

207
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,590
I can catch him without using something like this.

208
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,790
Hyun Jung!

209
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,525
Wait!

210
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,935
I'm Han Su's homeroom teacher.

211
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,810
General Manager Lee Tae Seok...

212
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,635
made Han Su commit suicide.

213
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,610
What does that mean?

214
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:03,010
Han Su would never kill himself, leaving Su Ah behind.

215
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,450
He got blackmailed by Lee Tae Seok...

216
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:08,090
to commit suicide.

217
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,955
To find out the truth, we need to stop it now.

218
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:17,730
Ms. Cha, we haven't even reported this to the superiors yet.

219
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:22,165
If we don't arrest Lee Tae Seok now, we might never get a chance again.

220
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:29,605
You don't have to worry about that.

221
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,910
As long as we have this USB, we can arrest him anytime.

222
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,675
All the evidence to reveal Lee Tae Seok's scheme.

223
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,815
So please listen to me first.

224
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,945
Please.

225
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,705
How was it?

226
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,110
How did you like the mess?

227
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:07,505
Stop talking rubbish.

228
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:11,220
The acquittal of the chancellor of Woonam University.

229
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,780
Is that all you want?

230
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,845
On top of that,

231
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,460
I want you to take all legal actions needed for me to take over...

232
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:19,990
Woonam University.

233
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:22,330
And I want you to take all the lawsuits that come with.

234
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,460
Oh, right.

235
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:28,070
Ms. Woo. You should spend more money.

236
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,100
What?

237
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,070
Because you were dawdling,

238
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,010
I'm about to be disqualified from being a preferred bidder.

239
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,070
Now Woonam University is worth more, you need to invest more.

240
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,405
What if I can't?

241
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,110
Then...

242
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:44,180
you'll ruin your only daughter's life.

243
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,780
I'm going to make public that her student record was...

244
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:47,990
all fabricated.

245
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,355
Don't you know that will damage you as well?

246
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:53,990
I'll just get punished then.

247
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,730
If I turn myself in, I'll just get probation.

248
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:59,900
I have always been living dirty,

249
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,400
so that's not a big problem for me.

250
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,065
Isn't it...

251
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,200
different for you and your daughter though?

252
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,470
If people find out that she got into trouble with the police...

253
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:11,835
and examined by the prosecution as a high school student,

254
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,750
will she even be able to get married?

255
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:18,550
You vermin, how dare you talk about my daughter...

256
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:20,345
Don't you know...

257
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:23,250
that even a vermin can turn?

258
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,460
If you want to let your precious daughter live in this country,

259
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,625
shut your mouth and bring me all the investment you promised!

260
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,025
I will take it.

261
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,065
The Woonam University lawsuit.

262
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,100
Let's talk about the details in our law firm.

263
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,305
I'll schedule our appointment.

264
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:52,645
Ma'am, the congressman has arrived.

265
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,290
Escort him here.

266
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,190
And send him half the deposit we prepared...

267
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,415
for Woonam University.

268
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,160
Half?

269
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,900
The situation now is a mess.

270
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,700
I don't trust you enough to send all the money.

271
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:09,830
First,

272
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,500
make sure my daughter has a perfect student record.

273
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,065
I'll give you the rest after that.

274
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:19,110
Fine.

275
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,480
I'll find a replacement and send them right away.

276
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,680
Although, you will have to keep in mind...

277
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,175
that if you change your mind again,

278
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,015
we will all die together.

279
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,805
I'm sorry I'm late.

280
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:42,490
Watch what you say in front of Ms. Woo.

281
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:46,625
Give me something that will keep my mouth shut.

282
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,700
It was what you wanted, President Lee.

283
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:53,135
You wanted to frame Han Su for everything about Su Ah.

284
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,280
What happened?

285
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,045
We lost them.

286
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:06,645
If it was recorded longer, we would have been able to hear the details.

287
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:11,460
Still, with this, we can prove Han Su is innocent, right?

288
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,960
Lee Tae Seok said he framed Han Su.

289
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,090
Records that are wiretapped or recorded by a third person...

290
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:18,355
are usually not admissible in court.

291
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,000
And what happened? You're a teacher of Cheonmyung High School?

292
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:27,765
Did you even forge identity?

293
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,065
I had no other way.

294
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
This was the only way to find out the secret between Han Su and Su Ah.

295
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,610
What's the secret?

296
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:40,250
There are VIP students that are taken care of by Lee Tae Seok.

297
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:43,985
Su Ah was close friends with them until she died.

298
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,490
One of the students...

299
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,090
is President Lee Do Jin's son. He stalked Su Ah...

300
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,790
and framed Han Su for it.

301
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,500
Woo Eun Hye's daughter, Han Tae Ra...

302
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,925
persistently bullied Su Ah.

303
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:57,800
Su Ah knew that the school was fabricating...

304
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:59,740
Tae Ra's student record.

305
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,370
The two had a serious fight because of that.

306
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:06,505
Lee Tae Seok, the VIP parents, and the students...

307
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,010
are all intertwined.

308
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,020
There must be more secret they're hiding.

309
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,450
And that secret can be an important clue to find the truth.

310
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:15,790
In order to find that,

311
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,185
we shouldn't arrest Lee Tae Seok now.

312
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:28,630
Yes, sir.

313
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,965
Where on earth are you?

314
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:32,740
What's the matter?

315
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,740
Don't you know what the matter is?

316
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,640
Whatever you're doing now,

317
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:40,475
stop it and come back right now!

318
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,775
He's Speed Dial Three.

319
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,280
"Speed Dial Three"?

320
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:48,115
Lee Tae Seok...

321
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:51,320
is using the girls in his agency...

322
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,460
to entertain his customers.

323
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:57,255
One of them is Assistant Prosecutor General Yang Sang Bae.

324
00:21:58,701 --> 00:21:59,960
Some people's contacts are saved under speed dials...

325
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,700
in Lee Tae Seok's phone.

326
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:03,100
Yang Sang Bae is Speed Dial Three.

327
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:07,370
I heard Su Ah entertained Speed Dial Zero.

328
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,270
I think Speed Dial Zero is President Lee Do Jin.

329
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,735
And I went there to check that.

330
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:14,140
Both Yang Sang Bae and President Lee...

331
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:17,205
are definitely related to Lee Tae Seok.

332
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,755
By the way, how did you know it?

333
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,960
The chancellor of Woonam University confessed everything.

334
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,630
He said, since all the people that are needed...

335
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,600
to take over Woonam University will be gathered there,

336
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,070
Lee Tae Seok will be there too.

337
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,070
Woonam University?

338
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:41,440
Lee Tae Seok is appointed as a preferred bidder.

339
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,240
He's now competing with his brother to be the next director...

340
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,410
of Cheonmyung Foundation.

341
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,640
I think he wants to take over Woonam University...

342
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,380
to win the competition.

343
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:52,375
So what Lee Tae Seok wants is Woonam University.

344
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:56,785
If the entertainment was for that,

345
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,860
Speed Dial Zero must have been...

346
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:04,255
a person who played a crucial role...

347
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,455
in the assumption.

348
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,745
Get out!

349
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:34,960
When the adults see this, they will be surprised.

350
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:38,085
So what? Are you here to nag me to stop?

351
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,275
No.

352
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,675
Let's break everything together...

353
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,945
until we feel better.

354
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:10,130
It's too stressful running a business these days.

355
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,560
We pay all the taxes we're supposed to pay,

356
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,870
but regulations and crackdowns are getting stricter.

357
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,570
That's right. You guys got caught, right?

358
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,765
During the late-night tutoring crackdown.

359
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,635
I get so angry whenever I think about that.

360
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,735
You must be very worried.

361
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,210
Two strikes, and they'll shut you down.

362
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,980
If we don't provide supplemental classes during midterms and finals,

363
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:34,050
all the students will drop out.

364
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,550
Shouldn't the crackdowns be a bit more flexible?

365
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,290
The kids will be up all night at home anyway.

366
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:42,190
The academy is taking care of them and studying with them.

367
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:44,285
Why is that a crime?

368
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,125
Don't you agree, Congressman Yoo?

369
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,265
Ma'am.

370
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:56,405
Do you know where I went before coming here?

371
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,740
Pardon?

372
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,875
I went to a funeral...

373
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,305
of a grade school student in our district.

374
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:08,115
A 10-year-old child took his own life.

375
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,055
Do you know why?

376
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,485
Because of his academy.

377
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,825
Because he had to go to more than 10 academies a week.

378
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:25,065
His wish was to sleep in for just one day.

379
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,765
Are you bitter about being caught during the crackdown?

380
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,765
I'm bitter about not protecting that child.

381
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,080
Congressman Yoo, that's not what I meant.

382
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,450
From now on, in my district,

383
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,710
any academy caught providing...

384
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,680
late-night classes will be shut down.

385
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:41,915
Repeat offenders will have their permits canceled.

386
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,445
Without flexibility.

387
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:48,155
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

388
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:52,230
Had I known I'd have to listen to stuff like this,

389
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:55,365
I would've stayed for the child's funeral procession.

390
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,900
Eun Hye, let's get some fresh air.

391
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:02,710
I haven't had wine in a while. It's going straight to my head.

392
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,505
Okay.

393
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,205
Excuse us.

394
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,755
I heard there was a scene at the recital.

395
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:21,785
How did you know?

396
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:24,385
My wife told me on the way here.

397
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,155
What happened?

398
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:30,565
Why did our school's general manager look for you and make a scene?

399
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,635
It's nothing.

400
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,665
I took on a case for him a few months ago.

401
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,765
He's annoying me about it.

402
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,305
What was the case about?

403
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,050
A student murdered another student.

404
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,515
He asked us to defend him.

405
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:49,450
It's over already,

406
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,390
but he's whining for no reason.

407
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:53,815
I told you to be careful whom you associate with.

408
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,930
If you think he'll cause trouble, don't even talk to him.

409
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,555
That's the best way.

410
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:02,695
You're right.

411
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,545
That felt good.

412
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,745
Were we a bit extreme?

413
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,685
Did we break too much?

414
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:30,085
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

415
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,130
Had I known, I would've studied art...

416
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,995
or figure skating instead of the piano.

417
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,395
Then they wouldn't have told me to paint something...

418
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:44,565
or do a triple axle in front of them.

419
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:47,535
They totally would've.

420
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:49,610
They would've held a personal exhibit,

421
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:51,150
and rented out an ice skating rink...

422
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:54,575
and made you put on a gala in front of high people.

423
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,685
I can't stand it.

424
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:01,555
Unzip me a little.

425
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,795
I couldn't even drink water properly because it's so tight.

426
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,000
You should've worn something that fits better.

427
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:12,470
Women don't fit the outfit to their bodies,

428
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,735
they fit their bodies to the outfit.

429
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:16,905
Who says that?

430
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:21,835
My mom. Madam Woo Eun Hye.

431
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,750
I'm her doll.

432
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:26,975
She's only satisfied if the outfit she prepared fits perfectly.

433
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:29,845
A pretty doll.

434
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:38,660
Okay. Is that better?

435
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,225
Yes.

436
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,170
How many years have you been working in the field?

437
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,265
You look like you're pretty senior.

438
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:26,475
I saw you once while chasing Lee Tae Seok.

439
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,280
But you should be more careful.

440
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:37,315
The basics of tailing someone is keeping a distance.

441
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,960
Like they can see you, but can't see you.

442
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:44,330
Like you can catch them, but not really.

443
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:47,030
Tailing people is what punks like you do.

444
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,325
What I do is undercover investigations.

445
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:55,170
That's a bit harsh.

446
00:29:55,177 --> 00:29:56,470
I do undercover investigations too.

447
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:59,680
I hide like this and watch secretly.

448
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,905
Like this.

449
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:06,245
(Sending the files)

450
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,085
Anyway, this clarified it.

451
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:16,425
I wondered why Mr. Yang protected Lee Tae Seok so much.

452
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,530
It carries no weight as evidence,

453
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:23,325
but it'll be useful to pressure Mr. Yang or President Lee.

454
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:27,140
Since they wouldn't want people talking about it.

455
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:32,235
Give me all the evidence of Mr. Yang receiving favors from Lee Tae Seok.

456
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:36,510
If you find any new evidence at Cheonmyung, share it immediately.

457
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,715
Okay, I will.

458
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,190
Please keep the USB safe.

459
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,250
Once I take care of Mr. Yang,

460
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,060
I'll take it from you when I need it.

461
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,385
Okay. Don't worry.

462
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,685
Okay. Let's stay in touch.

463
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,395
- Bye. - Bye.

464
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,915
Thank you for helping me.

465
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,730
I wasn't really trying to help you.

466
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,225
It's because they're our students.

467
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:29,825
I'm definitely not agreeing with everything you plan to do.

468
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,235
I was...

469
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:35,705
just thanking you. You're so mean.

470
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,205
Still,

471
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,845
I'll give you one thing.

472
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,620
That my methods until now...

473
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,850
will not work to clear Han Su's innocence...

474
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:49,845
or to change...

475
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,815
our school.

476
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,625
Let's...

477
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:00,355
find a way together.

478
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,870
So that our students...

479
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,765
won't turn into monsters anymore because of the school.

480
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,895
And from now on,

481
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,535
don't keep anything from me.

482
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:16,275
Okay. I won't.

483
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,755
(Resume: Gi Kang Je)

484
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,425
Get home safely.

485
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,000
Text me when you get home.

486
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,795
How can you laugh...

487
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,825
after humiliating me like that?

488
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,340
Let's blame your injured wrist for the ruined recital.

489
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:43,870
But after that?

490
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,410
Are you protesting to me?

491
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:49,475
I'm sorry. I was just so upset.

492
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,350
I found a replacement.

493
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:57,245
He'll pay more attention to you.

494
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,925
Gi Kang Je?

495
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,530
Mom, not this person.

496
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,255
What do you mean? Why not?

497
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,570
The thing he did to Su Ah...

498
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,540
What? Who?

499
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,040
Anyway, I don't like him. I want someone else.

500
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,210
Are you serious?

501
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,710
It's midterm soon. I can't find another person so fast.

502
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,940
Do you think it's easy to find someone who would do this job?

503
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,975
It will be him, and that's that.

504
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,785
I was so shocked while putting it together.

505
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,830
You won prizes even without entering the contests.

506
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,200
You participated in volunteer works...

507
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:42,830
that were never publicly announced.

508
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:46,300
Do you have any evidence that I did that?

509
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:48,510
I'm not going to look for evidence myself.

510
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,740
The Education Office,

511
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:54,210
the police, and the prosecutors will look for it once I disclose.

512
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,480
They'll even dig up even dirtier secrets.

513
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:59,950
Your mom's academy will have to shut down.

514
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,015
Once the word spreads in the school, you'll be bullied...

515
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,660
Let go of me. Do you have a death wish?

516
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,390
You?

517
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,690
To me?

518
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:11,090
You can never beat me.

519
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,460
I'm not an idiot like you...

520
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,695
who can't do anything without Mom.

521
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,330
So please stop getting on my nerves.

522
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,095
Also, stop being so jealous.

This is...

529
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,550
more like creating a whole new person.

530
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:13,655
It sure deserves to be called VIP management service.

531
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,430
Ms. Ha, I'm here.

532
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,895
Hi. Can you take a look at this?

533
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,830
Ms. Ha.

534
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:26,200
Why are you so surprised? Mr. Gi.

535
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,965
No. Attorney Gi.

536
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,840
What? How...

537
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,580
It was Yun Ah...

538
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,350
who told me you were Han Su's attorney.

539

I attended Han Su's trial.

540

Is your neck okay?

541
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,055
Han Su nearly choked you.

542
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:51,460
Oh, thanks for your concern.

543
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:54,200
Why couldn't you tell me earlier?

544
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:57,330
You said most school awards were going to specific students...

545
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,670
when you and Su Ah went through the award records.

546
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:01,595
Are these the ones?

(Jang Hye Jin, Kim Hee Kyeong, Lee Yu Ri)

Invited?

550
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,410
They gather in the club room once in a while.

It's usually these guys.

552

Okay. That confirms it.

What's wrong, Yun Ah?

555
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,925
Well...

556
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:28,895
It just feels like I'm ratting on them.

557
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:33,100
This was probably initiated by their parents.

558
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,635
The kids must have just followed them.

559
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,535
Do you really think that?

560
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,545
That the kids just followed their parents?

561
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,280
Both you and these kids...

562
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,190
are old enough to know...

563
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,520
how wrong this is.

564
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:55,660
Where did the special favors they were enjoying come from?

565
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:59,100
And how did it affect the other students?

566
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,300
I doubt that they were unaware.

567
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,800
- Still... - I've seen many people like them.

568
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,200
As long as their sins go unpunished,

569
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,670
they shamelessly hold their heads high...

570
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:12,475
and declare that that's how the world works.

571
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,235
Do you think they were like that from the very beginning?

572
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,205
No.

573
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,685
They became like that because that was all they ever saw.

574
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,955
These kids are young and deserve a second chance. But before that,

575
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,760
they have to realize...

576
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:35,000
how serious their sins are...

577
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,025
for them to sincerely repent.

578
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:56,485
He kissed you? Unbelievable.

579
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:01,390
What happened? All Beom Jin did before was hold your hand.

580
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:03,290
It just happened.

If you're jealous, date someone.

582
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:07,660
Once you debut, guys will be dying to date you.

583
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:08,830
I don't think so.

584
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,465
I'll have to protect my image.

585
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,100
If I date someone publicly and break up with him,

586
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:17,510
it'll be such a blow to my image.

587
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:20,905
Probably. That sounds tough.

588
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:26,975
Anyway, I'm jealous. You officially have everything now.

589
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,940
What was that yesterday?

590
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:52,380
Between your father and General Manager.

591
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,310
It looked pretty bad.

592
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:55,480
How would I know?

593
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:58,345
That crazy jerk just showed up and made a scene.

594
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:40,160
Ms. Ha, apart from the VIP students,

595
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:42,590
what are you going to do with Byung Ho?

596
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:45,185
I'm not sure yet.

597
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:49,525
Maybe we should discuss later...

598
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:50,830
- and come up with... - Mr. Gi.

599
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,835
Yes, Ms. Jun.

600
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,110
General Manager wants to talk to you.

601
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,380
General Manager? Do you have any idea what it's about?

602
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,680
You'll see.

603
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,505
Okay.

604
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:07,050
Be careful who you hang out with.

605
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:10,420
Oh, okay. I will.

606
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:12,655
Please excuse me now.

607
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,780

608
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:41,615
Come in.

609
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:48,315
I can't really take credit for it.

610
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,700
Okay. Good.

611
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,625
Well, that guy...

612
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:57,530
Come.

613
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,400
- Okay. - I didn't really do anything.

614
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:03,035
Of course.

615
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:07,135
Things took way too long to work out.

616
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:12,620
Assistant Prosecutor General Yang, you don't need to worry anymore.

617
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,790
Let's meet up and do something fun together soon.

618
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,845
All right. Bye.

619
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:25,355
What's that?

620
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,730
A rat managed to sneak in there?

621
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,900
Could you open it? I need to take a look.

622
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,465
Move.

623
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,740
It's clean.

624
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,940
Are you sure?

625
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,940
Yes. It was just a reaction to an outside sensor.

626
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,875
This model does that sometimes.

627
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:15,810
The bug detector has been installed.

628
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:17,110
All right.

629
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,920
You can relax in this room from now on.

630
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,650
It can detect absolutely everything.

631
00:42:22,657 --> 00:42:25,720
Thanks. Let me know when you're done with my car too.

632
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:27,655
Sure.

633
00:42:34,502 --> 00:42:37,495
What? Do you think I'm being fussy?

634
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,365
No way.

635
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:42,100
Have a seat. I want to talk to you.

636
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:43,705
Yes, sir.

637
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,045
Ms. Jun told me everything.

638
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:53,345
She said you were very cooperative with the school...

639
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:56,990
and you handled it well when Ms. Woo visited.

640
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,150
I'm flattered.

641
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,115
I just did what my heart told me to.

642
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:03,955
So I'm thinking...

643
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:06,855
of giving you an opportunity.

644
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:09,195
Why don't you be...

645
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:11,565
the homeroom teacher of Class Two?

646
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,595
Class Two, sir?

647
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,340
Then what about Ms. Jo?

648
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,165
She will quit.

649
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,135
She's taking responsibility for what happened with Tae Ra.

650
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,290
Thank you for giving me an opportunity, sir.

651
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:32,090
I'll do my best.

652
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:34,215
Okay. Good luck.

653
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:39,185
Hey. Did you check everything all right?

654
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:40,825
What?

655
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:42,795
A tracker?

656
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:47,000
Darn it. What kind of a person does that to his brother?

657
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:50,165
Remove them all and put the protection.

658
00:43:57,918 --> 00:43:59,920
Gosh, this is really stressing me out.

659
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,450
I really need good grades this time.

660
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:03,720
I may not be the best student in this school,

661
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,920
but I can be in other schools.

662
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:09,030
When it comes to the school records, it's only disadvantageous to us.

663
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,690
They're totally out of our league.

664
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:12,655
I know.

665
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,255
I'm not prepared at all.

666
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:20,565
Do you want to do it together?

667
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,505
- Do what? - Studying for the exam.

668
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:27,435
I'll help you. Let's study together.

669
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:29,480
Why would you do that?

670
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:31,780
Ms. Ha told me to help you out,

671
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:34,845
saying it will be hard for you to catch up after the break.

672
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:37,920
Why? You don't want to?

673
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,515
I want to.

674
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:42,115
Thanks.

675
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:46,795
Make sure she gets tier one in every subject.

676
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:50,165
Tier one, ma'am?

677
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:53,800
Ms. Woo is furious because of Ms. Jo.

678
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:55,710
We need to show her...

679
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,735
how we care about Tae Ra to calm her down.

680
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:03,310
Why? Are you scared?

681
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,345
No, that's not it.

682
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:09,450
I'm just not sure if that is enough...

683
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,350
to win Ms. Woo's trust back.

684
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,155
You're not sure if that's enough?

685
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:21,195
Aren't you one generous man, Mr. Gi?

686
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:24,030
No way.

687
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:27,540
I'm just a little worried.

688
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:31,665
You'd better not cross the line. Just do as I say.

689
00:45:32,613 --> 00:45:34,310
I'm the right-hand man of General Manager Lee,

690
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,980
and you're my right-hand man.

691
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,310
Everything that is related to General Manager Lee...

692
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,615
has to be confirmed by me first.

693
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:43,550
- You went to the army, right? - Yes.

694
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:46,255
You'd better respect the reporting mechanism.

695
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:49,785
I will keep that in mind, ma'am.

696
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,365
So, Ms. Jo quit.

697
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:03,435
No wonder, after everything that happened to her.

698
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,710
When I become the homeroom teacher of Class Two,

699
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:13,080
I get access to Tae Ra's student record.

700
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:15,750
If we compare it to what's in your USB,

701
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:18,820
I'm sure we can find the evidence on the fabrication.

702
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:22,685
But you said she asked you to give her tier one in every subject.

703
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:25,230
After the mid-term is over,

704
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:28,500
there will be some time until we give grades to students.

705
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,795
We'll find a way.

706
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:50,645
What do you think Byung Ho said to Han Su when he visited him?

707
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:00,495
We need to find that out.

708
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:03,200
If it's a message from Lee Tae Seok...

709
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:05,165
that instructed him to commit suicide,

710
00:47:05,673 --> 00:47:08,095
it could be new evidence.

711
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,235
Okay.

712
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:13,975
I will talk to him.

713
00:47:26,193 --> 00:47:27,755
Hello.

714
00:47:27,962 --> 00:47:30,290
I'm going to be the homeroom teacher of Class Two...

715
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:34,255
from this day forward, due to Ms. Jo's personal situation.

716
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:35,400
Nice to meet you.

717
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:37,100
- Nice to meet you, sir. - Nice to meet you, sir.

718
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,865
He is our homeroom teacher now.

719
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:45,835
What are you going to do now? Mr. Gi is my homeroom teacher now.

720
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:52,475
I want those who take my class to help me out.

721
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:56,050
Let's work hard together to get good grades at the mid-term.

722
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:57,050
Okay?

723
00:47:57,057 --> 00:47:59,185
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

724
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,055
(What are you going to do now? Mr. Gi is my homeroom teacher now.)

725
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:11,165
You never call me out. What's the matter?

726
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:16,770
You said last time...

727
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:19,235
that if I tell you what I have in mind,

728
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,305
you will help me.

729
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:23,550
Do you still think the same?

730
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,550
Of course. We're friends.

731
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:27,275
What is it?

732
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,490
The temp blackmailed me.

733
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,655
He said he will stop me from making my debut.

734
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:38,390
The temp? Why?

735
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,995
Well...

736
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,395
Because I bullied Su Ah together with Tae Ra.

737
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:52,410
Back then, I thought Su Ah was coming between you and Tae Ra.

738
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:54,010
And Tae Ra started it first.

739
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,975
I was just helping her a bit.

740
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,880
So?

741
00:48:58,886 --> 00:48:59,980
What?

742
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:03,045
The temp blackmailed you just because of that?

743
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:07,020
Why? What does he have to do with Su Ah?

744
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,385
I don't know.

745
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:12,825
Gi Hoon knows.

746
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:14,830
Gi Hoon does?

747
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:17,830
He knows everything, but he acts like he doesn't.

748
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:19,900
He knows that the temp was digging into Han Su and Su Ah...

749
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:21,100
and that the temp suspected Butler Lee.

750
00:49:21,108 --> 00:49:23,470
He knows all that and he's lying to you.

751
00:49:23,477 --> 00:49:25,035
Wait.

752
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,540
The temp is suspicious of Butler Lee?

753
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,210
Yes. He asked me if the man in the photo was Butler Lee...

754
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,880
which was posted on the portal.

755
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,685
But the photo was taken by Gi Hoon.

756
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:43,790
Maybe he's actually planning something with the temp.

757
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:44,790
He was the one who hated him the most.

758
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:47,525
Why is he suddenly taking his side now?

759
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:53,995
Did you tell anyone else about this?

760
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:58,010
No. There's no one I can talk about this with.

761
00:49:58,012 --> 00:50:00,405
I'll do some research and take care of it,

762
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,705
so don't tell anyone else.

763
00:50:03,117 --> 00:50:04,705
Okay?

764
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:08,645
Okay. I will never tell anyone.

765
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:20,130
Goodness. Hopefully, this won't cause any big problem.

766
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:23,055
You're already out of favor with Assistant Prosecutor General Yang.

767
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:29,470
Are you kidding me?

768
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:31,265
What's the matter, sir?

769
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:33,735
Unbelievable.

770
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:37,280
What is this?

771
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,120
Woonam University, Cheonmyung Foundation?

772
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,120
Do you think this country is paying you...

773
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,845
to do...

774
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:47,815
a joke like this?

775
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,320
Calm down, sir.

776
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:50,530
I will rectify both Woonam University...

777
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:52,030
and Cheonmyung Foundation.

778
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:54,930
At last?

779
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:57,870
You'll be referred to the disciplinary committee...

780
00:50:57,871 --> 00:50:59,470
for defamation of the prosecution.

781
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,535
Okay. I'm willing to accept any punishment.

782
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,675
Those who did wrong must be punished.

783
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:13,920
Hey, you'd better fly right.

784
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:17,345
Before you get in trouble by abusing that tiny power you've got.

785
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:21,185
Goodbye, sir.

786
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:24,355
Darn it.

787
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,825
What do we do?

788
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:35,565
Ms. Cha, do you think it'll be okay?

789
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,335
I think we're already in big trouble.

790
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,440
What are you going to do now?

791
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:43,910
Since we're in trouble anyway, we'd better deal with it surely.

792
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,210
If something happens, I'll take care of it.

793
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:49,075
So could you ask around and see whom he's been meeting?

794
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,945
You're the most senior deputy director in this building.

795
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:02,970
Just tell me already.

796
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,400
Did you get another instruction from Father?

797
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:08,640
He did call me last night...

798
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:09,640
and said I should get ready for the lawsuit...

799
00:52:09,643 --> 00:52:10,940
on the acquisition of Woonam University.

800
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:11,970
Woonam University?

801
00:52:11,979 --> 00:52:14,610
Yes. Cheonmyung Foundation is taking over it. Gi Hoon.

802
00:52:14,615 --> 00:52:17,605
I'm not supposed to talk to you any more.

803
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:19,150
Please do me a favor.

804
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:21,615
Stop talking nonsense. You'll keep reporting to me.

805
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:25,415
And don't forget to send me Father's schedule last year.

806
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:41,635
How do you feel today?

807
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:44,305
What is it all of a sudden?

808
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:47,935
Why is Butler Lee...

809
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:50,305
I got a call...

810
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,145
from him.

811
00:52:55,222 --> 00:52:58,420
Don't be nervous. Today,

812
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:02,355
we just have to show him what you're like.

813
00:53:03,197 --> 00:53:05,990
Still. It's so sudden...

814
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:08,100
I gave you everything...

815
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,200
you desperately wanted.

816
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:12,670
So you should do what I want now...

817
00:53:12,673 --> 00:53:14,435
as promised.

818
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,775
Think of it simply.

819
00:53:21,315 --> 00:53:24,345
You're just using him for your future.

820
00:53:27,254 --> 00:53:30,415
Darn it. What's going on?

821
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,785
What...

822
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:43,225
Darn it.

823
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:51,035
What is it?

824
00:53:53,413 --> 00:53:55,675
With a twerp like Butler Lee...

825
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,380
What's your problem? How dare you come in here?

826
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:30,380
If you're done solving the problem,

827
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,705
I should grade you.

828
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:39,645
You felt it too, right?

829
00:54:40,294 --> 00:54:42,955
That great father of yours...

830
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:46,155
was totally slammed by Lee Tae Seok.

831
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,100
The same goes for you,

832
00:54:49,102 --> 00:54:51,365
Gi Mu Hyeok.

833
00:54:51,571 --> 00:54:53,200
That's right.

834
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:57,465
So I, who was slammed, will catch Lee Tae Seok for you.

835
00:54:57,844 --> 00:55:00,240
Stop being stubborn and tell me everything.

836
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:03,510
Your father can never catch him.

837
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:05,380
Why are you so sure?

838
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,075
Do you know my father better than I do?

839
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:14,355
I don't know him better than you do, but I know one thing for sure.

840
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,930
That Lee Do Jin...

841
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,190
gave the order to bury Jung Su Ah's case...

842
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,225
using Kim Han Su as the scapegoat.

843
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:24,200
Did Han Su really kill her?

844
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:26,025
What if...

845
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,965
Han Su killed her.

846
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,610
Certainly.

847
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,610
There's no doubt.

848
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:35,780
So stop questioning it already.

849
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:37,505
Understood?

850
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:42,515
Stop your gibberish and get lost.

851
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,050
You must know now that it isn't gibberish.

852
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:48,290
Do you want to have your identity revealed and get kicked out?

853
00:55:48,295 --> 00:55:52,525
Get lost. Get lost right this instant!

854
00:56:11,051 --> 00:56:13,145
I told you...

855
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,375
that to us, it's a wound.

856
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:19,420
What you heard the day of Jun Jae's rooftop party...

857
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:21,585
wasn't a request.

858
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,755
It was a warning.

859
00:56:25,232 --> 00:56:27,500
Never talk about anything related to those two kids.

860
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:30,300
That's the unwritten rule among the students here.

861
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:33,365
Many of the kids are still struggling with it.

862
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,535
Don't try to find out more.

863
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:40,165
Whether it's about Su Ah, Han Su,

864
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,875
or Lee Tae Seok.

865
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,215
Someone else may get hurt otherwise.

866
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:31,755
(Must go to Hanguk University!)

867
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:47,935
Lee Gi Hoon. Yu Beom Jin.

868
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,805
I need to know what they're hiding in order to...

869
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,960
Okay, we'll stop here. Good work guys.

870
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,655
- Have a nice day. - You too.

871
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:06,225
- Number 12. - Okay, 12.

872
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,255
(Lee Ha Joon)

873
00:58:12,439 --> 00:58:13,600
Sir?

874
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:15,900
Okay. Here. Good work.

875
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,440
- Have a nice day. - You too.

876
00:58:17,444 --> 00:58:19,140
Pick up your phones.

877
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:24,045
- Thank you. - Thank you.

878
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:28,850
Are you out of your mind? They found the bug.

879
00:58:28,855 --> 00:58:32,150
But what? You want to hack his cell phone?

880
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:35,615
How many crimes do you want to be convicted of?

881
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:39,090
Seriously, must you go this far...

882
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,030
just to get your law license back?

883
00:58:42,035 --> 00:58:43,900
If you get caught, you'll get a rap sheet...

884
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:47,495
and may end up in prison. You have so much more...

885
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:49,535
to lose.

886
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,975
They need to pay as well for what they did.

887
00:58:56,182 --> 00:58:57,745
Pay?

888
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:01,515
As an attorney,

889
00:59:02,055 --> 00:59:05,315
you get to meet annoying clients sometimes.

890
00:59:06,259 --> 00:59:09,585
The case would end easily if they'd settle,

891
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,030
but they insist on sending the other person to jail.

892
00:59:13,033 --> 00:59:15,455
They are stubborn.

893
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:19,330
Although they may end up going to jail themselves.

894
00:59:19,339 --> 00:59:22,965
They must be burning up with a desire for revenge.

895
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:27,305
Do you know what they say?

896
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:30,550
They don't mind serving time in prison,

897
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,050
but they want the other jerk to be in jail longer,

898
00:59:34,054 --> 00:59:37,245
even if it's just by a day.

899
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:39,150
I used to find those clients frustrating...

900
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,460
and impossible to understand,

901
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,655
but I totally get them now.

902
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,660
I can't stand...

903
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,025
seeing that jerk who messed me up...

904
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:52,495
living well without paying for what he did.

905
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,140
It's a matter of time before the school finds out my identity.

906
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:03,035
I need to find out one thing before then.

907
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:09,250
The secrets of these dirtbags that made me...

908
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:10,920
(Yu Beom Jin)

909
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:14,560
crawl into this wretched school.

910
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:18,525
Darn it. You're burning up.

911
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:22,125
I've never seen you burning this hot before.

912
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:23,925
Okay.

913
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:27,025
Fine. Let's go.

914
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:32,940
Do you have a plan?

915
01:00:32,946 --> 01:00:34,640
You just...

916
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:37,750
stay here and do what you do best.

917
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:39,305
I will...

918
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:42,445
take care of the rest.

919
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:46,915
(Yu Beom Jin, Na Ye Ri)

920
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:50,725
(Second Semester Midterm Exams, Math)

921
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,840
Here you go.

922
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:09,705
Thanks.

923
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,275
(Lee Ha Joon)

924
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,805
Each phone will take 10 minutes.

925
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,880
Do you see that? It's a hacking app I developed.

926
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:47,745
Anyway, connect your phone to the students' phones.

927
01:01:48,088 --> 01:01:52,890
From here, I'll breach the security and pull all the data.

928
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:55,690
Photos, messages,

929
01:01:55,695 --> 01:01:59,060
internet browsing history, social media use... All of them.

930
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:01,400
- Can't you do it at one go? - Seriously.

931
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:04,000
The phone security system these days is super strong.

932
01:02:04,003 --> 01:02:06,500
Just connecting your phone to theirs doesn't do the job.

933
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:11,470
I have to patiently penetrate each phone from here.

934
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,640
Anyway, you decide the order.

935
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:17,705
When you connect the phones, I can see it on this screen.

936
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:35,695
(Math)

937
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,285
(Lee Gi Hoon)

938
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:30,415
All right. The first batter for Cheonmyung High School.

939
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:33,960
Lee Gi Hoon is at bat now.

940
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,455
He's pretty good, if you ask me.

941
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:37,950
Well... Everything looks good.

942
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,315
The last pitch.

943
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:45,530
Strike! Strikeout!

944
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:49,195
Now, the second batter.

945
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:55,735
Send in the second batter.

946
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:58,965
(Send in the 2nd batter.)

947
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,885
(Ahn Byung Ho)

948
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:30,065
Only 35 minutes left.

949
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:36,505
- What is this? - Mr. Gi.

950
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:38,710
Gosh, how annoying.

951
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,620
It's a math test. We have no time to lose.

952
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:43,650
Is it you? Darn it.

953
01:05:43,656 --> 01:05:45,090
Focus on your test.

954
01:05:45,091 --> 01:05:48,360
You have more than 30 minutes left. And I turned off the phone.

955
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,455
Focus now.

956
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,715
Okay.

957
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:55,420
All right. Send in the third batter.

958
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,955
(Send in the 3rd batter.)

959
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:14,805
(Yu Beom Jin)

960
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:24,345
Mr. Gi.

961
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,860
Yes. What is it?

962
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:31,855
I'm done. Can I go out?

963
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:37,355
There's some time left. You'll have to wait.

964
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:39,970
Can I at least get my phone back?

965
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,635
I have nothing to do.

966
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:51,005
I can't give you your phone back until everyone is done.

967
01:07:57,123 --> 01:08:00,320
What? Is there any reason why you need your phone right now?

968
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:04,555
Then is there any reason why I can't go out?

969
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:07,200
What?

970
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,130
Once a third of the time has passed, I can submit my answer sheet...

971
01:08:10,136 --> 01:08:12,430
and study on my own according to the school rules.

972
01:08:12,438 --> 01:08:15,395
Is there any special reason for you to stop me from doing that?

973
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:31,815
What's this?

974
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:35,215
What?

975
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:44,925
This photo...

976
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:49,865
Jung Su Ah?

977
01:09:09,095 --> 01:09:10,885
Unbelievable.

978
01:09:11,297 --> 01:09:14,285
I hit the jackpot.

979
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,945
Jackpot.

980
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,145
Don't disconnect yet.

981
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:45,760
Why are you standing up? Stay seated.

982
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,560
I don't know what's with you.

983
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,755
It's not like I'm breaking any rules.

984
01:09:50,736 --> 01:09:54,100
Mr. Gi, just give him his phone. It's distracting.

985
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,370
- Seriously. - What is this?

986
01:09:57,376 --> 01:10:01,175
- Just let him go out. - I can't focus.

987
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:08,045
I'll submit my answer sheet anyway.

988
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:17,985
Didn't you hear me?

989
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,955
Stay seated.

990
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:24,600
That's strange.

991
01:10:24,604 --> 01:10:27,400
You always make a point of sticking to the rules.

992
01:10:27,406 --> 01:10:30,365
And why are you being so unreasonable now?

993
01:10:31,077 --> 01:10:32,740
Suit yourself.

994
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:35,035
I'll just do what the rules say.

995
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,945
Let me check my phone in front of you and return it.

996
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,645
That's no problem, right?

997
01:11:03,576 --> 01:11:06,805
(Class of Lies  / Mr. Temporary)

998
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,230
I found a suspicious app on his phone.

999
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:27,860
That photo was found on Yu Yang Ki's son's phone.

1000
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:31,470
Why would a future presidential candidate deal with Lee Tae Seok?

1001
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:34,240
Woonam University will come into the hands of Cheonmyung Foundation.

1002
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,440
You can't leave your future in that suspicious person's hands.

1003
01:11:36,442 --> 01:11:37,970
You must be uncomfortable too.

1004
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:40,840
Is it true that you went to visit Han Su?

1005
01:11:40,846 --> 01:11:42,180
I'll tell you everything...

1006
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:44,505
what Han Su and I talked about.

1007
01:11:44,817 --> 01:11:47,175
I found another route...

1008
01:11:47,186 --> 01:11:48,820
- to Su Ah's place. - Hi.

1009
01:11:48,821 --> 01:11:51,020
Your relationship with Su Ah.

1010
01:11:51,023 --> 01:11:53,790
It's driving me crazy.

1011
01:11:53,793 --> 01:11:56,560
I need to tell the truth. I need to tell the entire truth...

1012
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:59,725
There's someone else who should be punished for his sins.

1013
01:12:01,367 --> 01:12:02,730
Get in here, you jerk!

1014
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,100
Let's end this once and for all!

1015
01:12:05,104 --> 01:12:07,495
- Lee Tae Seok. - I need to get out.
