1
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,200
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:22,230
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,395
Gosh.

4
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,175
(Won Suk)

5
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:35,250
What is it? I'm at school. Keep it short.

6
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,350
I found him. The guy from Jung Su Ah's townhouse in the video.

7
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,745
What? You found...

8
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:44,615
You found him? Who is he?

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,660
There was a reason why I couldn't find him anywhere.

10
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,900
He's a chauffeur.

11
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,200
He isn't employed by any company but works alone.

12
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:55,700
A chauffeur? A high school student hired a chauffeur?

13
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:59,435
It's not Jung Su Ah who hired him.

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,875
Don't be surprised. The owner of the car is...

15
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,715
(Episode 4)

16
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:25,560
Don't be surprised. The owner of the car is...

17
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:29,030
Lee Tae Seok, the general manager of Cheonmyung High School.

18
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,635
(Cheonmyung Foundation General Manager)

19
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,940
General Manager and a girl from his school?

20
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:35,940
Why?

21
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:39,280
Gosh, you're completely out of your mind.

22
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:43,175
You ignorant wench!

23
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,290
I mean...

24
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,320
Why did you have to show up and say such a thing today, of all days?

25
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,520
Do you want to get sacked?

26
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,760
Do you think I'll go down alone?

27
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:57,960
You're the one who made me do all those things!

28
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,865
- Shut your mouth, will you? - Get off me!

29
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,635
Darn it.

30
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,940
I'm sure it was somewhere here.

31
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,740
Ms. Jo.

32
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:14,145
What made you want to put me through all this trouble?

33
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:18,680
I just don't want to have anything to do with Tae Ra anymore.

34
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:22,915
Exactly! That gives me trouble!

35
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:28,130
What's the reason?

36
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,830
You've been doing exactly I say so far.

37
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:34,300
After enjoying all those advantages, why do you suddenly...

38
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:35,870
stab me in the back?

39
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,365
I've been blackmailed.

40
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,345
You've been blackmailed?

41
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,715
- By who? - Su Ah. Jung Su Ah.

42
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,620
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,720
Explain.

44
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,930
She came to me.

45
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,155
She said she knew everything about Tae Ra.

46
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,615
She knew? How?

47
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,690
I don't know.

48
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,720
But she definitely knew.

49
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,990
She threatened that she'd reveal everything...

50
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:38,155
unless I stop Tae Ra's bullying.

51
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,565
And I failed.

52
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,500
I tried my best,

53
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:45,500
but Tae Rae would never listen to me.

54
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:49,410
On the contrary, her bullying got worse and worse.

55
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,135
In the end...

56
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:57,845
She died! Su Ah died!

57
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,760
Bullying?

58
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,430
Reveal everything?

59
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,625
What is she...

60
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,905
So, are you saying...

61
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,785
Tae Ra killed Su Ah or something?

62
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,555
Look here, Ms. Jo. I mean...

63
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,300
Jo Mi Ju.

64
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,565
I don't know what's in that head of yours,

65
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,500
but it isn't true.

66
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,565
- But what if... - I said no.

67
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,505
Got that?

68
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:01,605
Kim Han Su killed Jung Su Ah.

69
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,215
So stop talking nonsense...

70
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,745
before I rip your mouth off.

71
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,515
Then...

72
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,325
Then what about Tae Ra...

73
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,460
Don't worry.

74
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,765
I won't entrust my VIP client to a lunatic like you.

75
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:33,845
Han Tae Ra killed Jung Su Ah?

76
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,985
Darn it. This woman has the worst timing.

77
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,865
Mr. Gi?

78
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:05,505
I...

79
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,890
Ms. Jo, are you all right?

80
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,960
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,790
How could he do this?

82
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,490
Let's get you to the hospital.

83
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,930
Get examined and a medical report. Then you can sue...

84
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:24,895
How much did you see?

85
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:29,270
I don't know how much you saw.

86
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,270
Just stay out of it, and forget it. I'm fine.

87
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,940
How could I do that? Look what he did to you.

88
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,880
I warned you.

89
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,935
Stay out of it.

90
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:44,245
Do as I say unless you want something to happen to you, too.

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,320
I'll win and share with you.

92
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,330
- Darn it. - With one uppercut...

93
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,055
One uppercut, and I can...

94
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,500
Well, so...

95
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,265
Scram.

96
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,105
Where to?

97
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,805
I guess you're deaf.

98
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,640
I said to scram...

99
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,010
unless you want to kiss your peaceful school days goodbye.

100
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,680
Sorry, we'll get out of your hair. Let's go.

101
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,415
Come on.

102
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm so annoyed.

103
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,220
Hey. Must we really do this?

104
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,860
What are they doing there by themselves?

105
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,060
Don't try to find out.

106
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,000
We just have to stand guard twice a month...

107
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,670
and continue using the rooftop.

108
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,200
Yes, that's true, but...

109
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,470
I get it this time, okay?

110
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,270
I can't wait. Seriously.

111
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,410
It's so pretty.

112
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,210
Did you see that?

113
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,235
I got it.

114
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,320
I said to guard the hallway so no one can get through.

115
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:02,755
Where did you go without even telling me?

116
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,800
I received an urgent call from home.

118
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:10,670
I misjudged you. You lack a sense of responsibility.

119
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:14,705
How can you assist me well like this?

120
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,205
Assist?

121
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,605
Watch it.

122
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:23,410
You need to be work hard if you want me to have your back.

123
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,220
Move quicker than everyone else.

124
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,685
Be different from everyone else. Okay?

125
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,915
Have a good night, ma'am.

126
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:36,430
Does she think she's influential or something?

127
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,055
My head's spinning as is.

128
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,100
(Won Suk)

129
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,895
I got the chauffeur. Come here.

130
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:56,475
My gosh. Look at this. How did...

131
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,945
Stop it.

132
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,420
Can't you be more tender?

133
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,455
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,885
I mistook him for someone else.

135
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,085
(Arbis Internet Cafe)

136
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,995
Surprise.

137
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,575
Hey! Stay away!

138
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,645
Gosh, my head.

139
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:36,690
Sir, put that down.

140
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:37,860
You might get hurt.

141
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,590
How did you find me?

142
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:42,460
I have no money to give you, so leave.

143
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:44,395
Get lost!

144
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:56,805
I said, you might get hurt.

145
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:05,345
I thought he was a creditor.

146
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,615
Sir.

147
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,785
You've seen this girl, right?

148
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,595
Take a close look. You gave her a ride once.

149
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,165
El Dorado?

150
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,005
"El Dorado"?

151
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,075
If I tell you, will you pay off my debt?

152
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,185
I can't believe this man.

153
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,815
Should I strike you in the head too?

154
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,530
What's in it for me?

155
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:51,630
I can see that this information matters a lot to you.

156
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,870
I have no choice. You little...

157
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,765
Won Suk, sit down.

158
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:57,200
Sir.

159
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:00,970
If someone is hit in the head with a brick,

160
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:03,370
how likely do you think that person is to die?

161
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,780
I already apologized for that.

162
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,210
An apology works...

163
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:10,150
when you bump into someone on the street by mistake.

164
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:13,250
But when you strike someone on the head with a brick...

165
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,720
"I deserve to die."

166
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,660
"If you forgive me, I'll do anything for you."

167
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,160
That's what you say.

168
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,630
It's true that we're in a rather urgent situation,

169
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,860
but it's no big deal...

170
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,555
compared to you going to prison.

171
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,100
Well, tell us everything you know.

172
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,865
Then I might be able to help you file for bankruptcy.

173
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,445
That's where she got in my car.

174
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,115
In front of El Dorado Business Club.

175
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:53,020
Stop making a scene on the street and get back in.

176
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,690
It'll be over in an hour.

177
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,790
- I'm not going in there. - Is she getting in or not?

178
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,300
You lowlife.

179
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,400
Just because I buy you clothes and food,

180
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:03,065
do you think you can do whatever you want?

181
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,995
Enough is enough, you piece of trash.

182
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,935
You little...

183
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,080
These ungrateful wretches deserve to be hit.

184
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,905
Come in now.

185
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,580
- What are you going to do now? - Are you crazy?

186
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,520
Never bring me to these things again.

187
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:22,385
If this happens again, I won't put up with it anymore.

188
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,585
Gosh.

189
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,160
Please leave.

190
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,425
Yes, okay.

191
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,600
So I gave her a ride, and that's all.

192
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:41,605
I know nothing else.

193
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:46,340
What's that place like? I mean El Dorado Club.

194
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,450
It's a business club.

195
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,850
They earn more than 10,000 dollars in drinks in one night.

196
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,980
Customers from that club...

197
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,150
always give me huge tips.

198
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,215
Many of them are nuisances though.

199
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:08,165
Lee Tae Seok choked Jung Su Ah's homeroom teacher?

200
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:10,700
Yes.

201
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,270
While screaming that she couldn't control Tae Ra.

202
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,465
"Control"? What does she mean by that?

203
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,175
Tae Seok referred to Tae Ra...

204
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,375
as his VIP client.

205
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,960
What could that be?

206
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,660
A VIP service provided by the grade head...

207
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:35,060
under the direction of the general manager...

208
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,485
at a prestigious high school.

209
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,700
Tampering with grades?

210
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,000
Leaking exams?

211
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,665
That's a possibility.

212
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,165
But it's probably something more professional.

213
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,475
It must be something more special.

214
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,480
He must have managed every single matter of his VIP client...

215
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,715
like a butler, as his special service.

216
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,790
Oh, Butler Lee.

217
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,890
Exactly.

218
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,790
To recap, Tae Seok provided Tae Ra with some kind of service...

219
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,690
through Mi Ju...

220
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:11,700
while meeting Su Ah personally outside school.

221
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,430
They were so close...

222
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:17,065
that he even sent her home in his car.

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,100
Close enough to fight on the street.

224
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,970
They even slapped each other in the face.

225
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:23,510
What Han Su was so desperately trying to protect...

226
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,310
might have been her relationship with Tae Seok.

227
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,680
Whether he was her sex buyer or lover,

228
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:29,150
either is equally inappropriate.

229
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,780
Okay.

230
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,780
Let me start some serious digging from tomorrow.

231
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,020
Who is this man that has so much to hide?

232
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,460
Be careful.

233
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,255
He seems to be one serious psycho.

234
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,530
Have you looked into the student community portal yet?

235
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:48,525
Do you have any idea who uploaded those pictures of Su Ah?

236
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,340
Give me just a little more time.

237
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,805
I might be onto something.

238
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,815
French?

239
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,860
Why are you so surprised?

240
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,325
I thought you wanted a new role.

241
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,700
But I've never taught French.

242
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,595
You haven't?

243
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:23,770
But based on your resume,

244
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,840
it looks like you can teach French too.

245
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,410
Are you telling me you lied on your resume?

246
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:31,835
(Resume)

247
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,380
I did do a double major in French,

248
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:39,850
but that was a long time ago.

249
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,590
That's not my problem.

250
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,590
You wanted a new role,

251
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:49,185
so I did what I could according to your resume.

252
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:52,830
You can't only do what you like.

253
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,195
That's selfish.

254
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,205
Hold on.

255
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:07,010
This is not right.

256
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:08,650
She can't suddenly start teaching another subject...

257
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,945
without any preparation.

258
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:12,850
Why not?

259
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,620
You're a PE teacher and student counselor at the same time.

260
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,260
Well, that's only because I don't need any preparation...

261
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,260
for counseling students.

262
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:24,830
Mr. Gi also teaches Politics and Law...

263
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,030
and German at the same time.

264
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,700
- Mr. Gi. - Yes?

265
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,100
Is teaching two subjects that hard?

266
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,095
Do you want to quit?

267
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,350
I'm okay.

268
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:45,850
See? Mr. Gi says he's okay.

269
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:49,550
There are teachers who successfully teach two subjects.

270
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:52,320
Why can't you teach French?

271
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,730
It's not like you're unqualified either.

272
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,090
If you really can't do it,

273
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,055
I guess your incompetence is to blame.

274
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,495
Right?

275
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,270
Right?

276
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,995
Yes.

277
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:19,520
Does Ms. Jun think teaching is like following Baek Jong Won's recipe?

278
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:22,750
Just because you're qualified doesn't mean you can start teaching.

279
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,515
Ms. Jo is already going through a lot.

280
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,455
Ms. Ha.

281
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,625
I have a class. I'll see you later.

282
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:37,825
Mr. Gi.

283
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,635
Hold on.

284
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,540
What is it?

285
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,440
I warned you.

286
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,010
Stay out of it.

287
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:50,345
Do as I say unless you want something to happen to you, too.

288
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:56,320
Well, it's the thing you said in the teachers' room.

289
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,590
You got Ms. Jo in trouble...

290
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,330
by saying you were okay with teaching two subjects.

291
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,555
Shouldn't you be more considerate to your fellow teacher?

292
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:09,425
Especially considering what Ms. Jo is going through.

293
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,495
You're right.

294
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,405
I'm sorry. That was careless of me.

295
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,305
But remember...

296
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,475
I'm only a temporary teacher.

297
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,080
- Pardon? - I wish I could be...

298
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,350
as brave as you.

299
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,350
But I'm not really in the position.

300
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,320
If I get on the wrong side of Ms. Jun,

301
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,620
my contract might not be extended.

302
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,720
I wasn't trying to criticize you.

303
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:37,285
I finally started teaching here in my 30s.

304
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,460
If I fail to become a regular teacher here,

305
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,625
I have nowhere else to go due to my age.

306
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,435
I'm sorry...

307
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:49,205
I have to be this shameful teacher...

308
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:51,835
who can't be considerate to his colleague.

309
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,000
It's the parent interview result.

310
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,930
The daughter of Hanguk Medical School's Dean...

311
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,900
and the son of Wubang Construction's CEO...

312
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,570
can start tomorrow.

313
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,435
Yes, Mr. Lee.

314
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,170
Also, find a replacement for Tae Ra's manager quickly.

315
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,140
Seriously. I don't want someone weak like Ms. Jo.

316
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,450
Someone bold and passionate.

317
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,650
Someone who can take care of the kids until they graduate.

318
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:34,820
Actually, I have someone in mind.

319
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,450
I'll check if this person is eligible as soon as possible.

320
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,015
There's someone? Who is it?

321
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,265
Mr. Temp, are you all right?

322
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,905
I'm sure you're all right.

323
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,250
Mr. Temp?

324
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:04,550
It's your nickname.

325
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:08,315
You're a temporary teacher, so you're Mr. Temp.

326
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,915
Funny, right?

327
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:17,330
Did you throw this?

328
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,430
Yes.

329
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,100
We're having a game with another class, so we're practicing.

330
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:24,165
Give it to me. I'll be careful next time.

331
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,520
You can go pick it up after class.

332
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:44,615
But I'm not sure if it'll be there until then though.

333
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,460
I don't care what you call me,

334
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:49,030
but I don't want you to disrupt my class.

335
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:54,055
Next time you do this again, I'll throw you, not the ball.

336
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,400
He's so cool.

337
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,810
He's so manly.

338
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,240
All right. Shall we begin?

339
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:06,805
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

340
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:13,715
You had one job.

341
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,950
You want the second round of Shuttle Monster Fighter?

342
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,290
On the school rooftop next week?

343
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:22,155
Yes. I couldn't finish the fight properly last time.

344
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,060
You can't just come up to me and ask things like that.

345
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,860
The rooftop opens every other week.

346
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,200
And we keep guard over Veritas Meeting every other week.

347
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,970
This is the contract between you and us.

348
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,870
That's why I'm asking you a favor.

349
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,765
Could you cut us some slack? Our situation is a little urgent.

350
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,440
You've got a lot of nerve.

351
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,310
I asked you to tame the temp, but you failed.

352
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:44,575
And now you want me to do you a favor?

353
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,745
I'm sorry. I'll give you this instead.

354
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:51,290
This is twice as much as the monthly rooftop fee.

355
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:55,785
Please take this and let us use the place just once more next week.

356
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:07,595
Why do you think I take money from you?

357
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,170
Of course, it's because you need the money...

358
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:12,305
No. I just do.

359
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:19,250
I don't need this chicken feed,

360
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,290
but I take money from you anyway to make clear who is the boss.

361
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,620
You're the one who gives the money...

362
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,330
and I'm the one who takes the money.

363
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,085
Is it clear now?

364
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,155
Hey.

365
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:35,800
Until you humiliate the temp properly, you can't use the rooftop.

366
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:39,100
I don't care if you make money or not.

367
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,495
Keeping my face is more important.

368
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,185
- She's coming. - She's coming.

369
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,665
If you're finished, let's go.

370
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:27,890
- Ms. Jo. Over here... - Wait, Ms. Ha.

371
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,920
Don't you know people already hate you?

372
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,290
Can't you read the table?

373
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:35,685
Don't be meddlesome. You don't even talk to her that often.

374
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:38,225
Eat.

375
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:18,740
The temp is so cool.

376
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,370
Strong men are the best.

377
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,010
It was quite a sight, wasn't it?

378
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:26,110
Sight, my foot. He's just an EM.

379
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,480
"EM"? What's that?

380
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,310
I'm talking about the loser, the temp.

381
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,650
He's an educated moron. For short, EM.

382
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:35,020
He studied law at Hanguk University and he's only a temporary teacher.

383
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:36,490
He's the worst loser.

384
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:39,360
Have you seen such a tall and handsome loser?

385
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,890
You're just being jealous.

386
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,930
Jealous? Are you crazy?

387
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,460
You don't get jealous of someone who is totally out of your league.

388
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:48,300
You're such an idiot.

389
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,200
Is that so?

390
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,300
What about Kim Han Su then?

391
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:53,500
Were you jealous of him because you two were in the same league?

392
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,640
- Stop saying nonsense. - "Nonsense"?

393
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,540
What I said is just the truth.

394
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,880
You're the one who stalked Su Ah, the working girl.

395
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:01,575
Ye Ri.

396
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,610
Yes?

397
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,520
We agreed that we won't talk about it anymore.

398
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:08,015
It makes us feel uncomfortable.

399
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,520
It makes you feel uncomfortable too.

400
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,290
Right.

401
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:15,085
Sorry. I forgot.

402
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,780
I was thinking of going to a French restaurant as usual,

403
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,510
but I decided to treat you with health food instead.

404
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:38,280
Now, you're going to start preparing for the exam in earnest,

405
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,545
so you may as well invigorate yourself.

406
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,560
Thank you for your kindness.

407
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,460
Thanks to you, our regular meeting was successful.

408
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,530
There's no need to thank me.

409
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:54,500
Well, it's rather good for me that you take care of everything.

410
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,495
You're lightening my workload.

411
00:25:56,872 --> 00:26:00,300
For your reference. Make sure to get it started within next week.

412
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,670
Let me see.

413
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,180
Hee Kyeong wins a math contest.

414
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:09,950
Yu Ri wins a science competition.

415
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,780
There's a German language contest?

416
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,180
Yes. I'm getting one just in case.

417
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:17,215
In case I go to a college in that direction.

418
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,090
This is perfect.

419
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:23,725
I wanted to check if he's reliable anyway.

420
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,030
What about you, Ye Ri? Are you sure you don't need any?

421
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:31,570
No, I'm good. Just make sure my attendance is perfect.

422
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,770
I will have to go practice more often from now on.

423
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:36,870
Okay. I will take care of it.

424
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,680
Now, shall we begin?

425
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,405
Before the food you prepared gets cold.

426
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,090
You go ahead.

427
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,490
I need to stop by somewhere.

428
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,460
Me too. I need to go practice.

429
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,790
Now my stomach is full, I need to digest the food.

430
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,670
Gosh. Every time I gain 1kg, my debut gets delayed by 1 year.

431
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,470
All right, then. We'll get going.

432
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:06,165
Let's go.

433
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,875
I'm leaving too.

434
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:21,690
What is it?

435
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,450
Are you going to keep saying nonsense in front of them?

436
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,855
It hurts. Let go of me.

437
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:28,090
If you talk rubbish one more time,

438
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:30,355
it won't be just your wrist that hurts.

439
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,970
Why? Are you scared?

440
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,825
Are you scared they might find out everything you did?

441
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:40,870
If they do, they will find out everything you did too.

442
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,465
Then you will never get to debut.

443
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,420
This is annoying.

444
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,390
I wish everyone fails.

445
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,415
Everyone except me.

446
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:08,030
Ms. Kim, when will you open your heart to me?

447
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:10,430
I've been trying to get you on our team since last month,

448
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,300
but you kept turning me down.

449
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,195
I'm disappointed.

450
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:22,180
Are you being loyal or something?

451
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,010
Are you waiting for Gi Mu Hyeok to come back?

452
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:27,450
He's done in this business. He lost his license.

453
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,145
You should look ahead. Ahead.

454
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,455
Gi Hoon. What brings you here? You didn't say you were coming.

455
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,105
Do I have to call first before coming to my dad's firm?

456
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:58,180
Did you prepare what I asked for?

457
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:01,145
Yes, sir. I mean, yes.

458
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,345
Well, I did get it ready, but...

459
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,285
- Did you eat? Do you want... - Darn it.

460
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,890
I'll give it to you. Sure. I was going to.

461
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:11,455
(Song Jae U, The Lawyer Who Saved the National Character)

462
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:17,230
But seriously, you can't let anyone else see this.

463
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:20,040
I'm dead if your dad finds out I let an outsider see a case file.

464
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,910
And the Kim Han Soo case is taboo...

465
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,810
Stop your stupid worrying.

466
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,410
Am I an outsider?

467
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:28,235
It'll all be mine later anyway.

468
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:38,220
Seriously.

469
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:40,490
I'm getting so annoyed the more I think about it.

470
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,085
How dare you, you pervert?

471
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,030
Watch where you're going!

472
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,800
- You walked into us... - What?

473
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,130
- That's not... - No.

474
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:52,035
We're sorry.

475
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,310
Gosh.

476
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:03,050
I don't know what to do with her and her temper.

477
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,250
She's the best talent-wise.

478
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,350
Seung Hee is better.

479
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:09,220
She's nice and younger.

480
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,785
Ye Ri will be a ticking time bomb even if she does make a debut.

481
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,740
Hi.

482
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,310
You're here early. Are you done with class already?

483
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:30,710
I cut.

484
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,680
You're lucky you're still in middle school.

485
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,450
Not at all. I wish I were in high school already.

486
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,515
I want to grow up quickly and be the object of girl crushes like you.

487
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,860
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

488
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:51,455
Catch a tiger by the toe.

489
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:56,325
If he hollers, let it go. Eeny, meeny, miny,

490
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,895
moe.

491
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,210
Okay.

492
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,975
I'll mess you up big time.

493
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:10,445
(Educated Moron)

494
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:25,330
Hey, hey, hey! Did you see?

495
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,460
Of course, we did!

496
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,830
I saw it as soon as it went up!

497
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:30,200
What is it?

498
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:31,570
- What is it? - Let me see.

499
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:33,040
Hey!

500
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,240
This is really huge.

501
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,310
Look.

502
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,040
- Oh my gosh. - What is that?

503
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,380
Post your comments now!

504
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:40,880
They'll post more pics if they get 30 comments.

505
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,180
Get to your seats and post your comments.

506
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,680
- Hurry. - I'll send it to you.

507
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:47,015
- Oh my gosh. - This is huge.

508
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,120
You have to touch, clean,

509
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:54,590
and love all the equipment whenever you get a chance.

510
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,630
Think of it like your boyfriend.

511
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:58,360
Got it?

512
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:00,995
You are so...

513
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:03,570
Leave things like that to us,

514
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,170
and focus on your studies.

515
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,605
I'm sad. I'm being nagged by an underclassman.

516
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,675
You want me out of the way, is that it?

517
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:19,950
Wait.

518
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,720
Where's the UHD camera?

519
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,450
The one we bought last semester.

520
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,590
Ji Eun checked it out. She needed to use it.

521
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:27,990
She did?

522
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:30,330
Manage it properly. It's super expensive.

523
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:31,830
I'm sure she'll bring it right back.

524
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,295
It's Ji Eun, after all.

525
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,100
There's another one.

526
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:38,100
What?

527
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,935
Our student community portal.

528
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,270
Hey, do you know these teachers?

529
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:45,675
They're supposedly teachers for your grade.

530
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:50,175
Everyone's going crazy asking if it's real.

531
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:54,445
Real? As if. It was obviously photoshopped.

532
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,815
(Student Record)

533
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:09,725
I'm sure our eyes met.

534
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:27,455
But Tae Rae would never listen to me.

535
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:30,225
On the contrary, her bullying got worse and worse.

536
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,861
In the end...

537
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,034
She died! Su Ah died!

538
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:43,304
Darn it. Things finally quieted down. That idiot.

539
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,573
What is it? Why did you want to meet?

540
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,942
Hello, sir.

541
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,048
You should enjoy some culture now and then.

542
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:55,250
I had some questions too.

543
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,085
Questions?

544
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:59,988
The investigation regarding Jung Su Ah.

545
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:02,323
Is it completely over now?

546
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,592
Jung Su Ah?

547
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,830
To be precise, it isn't over, it's being halted...

548
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,132
until Kim Han Su wakes up.

549
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,735
What if...

550
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,204
he never wakes up?

551
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,972
Then it ends.

552
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,576
He confessed in court and died on his own.

553
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,845
As long as there are no new suspects.

554
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,614
That would just be a headache for us all.

555
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,751
You didn't find anything more, right?

556
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,453
Nothing.

557
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:32,987
Why?

558
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,456
Is something nagging at you?

559
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:36,991
No, of course not.

560
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:42,263
I just wish it would end quickly and cleanly. That's all.

561
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,166
Okay.

562
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,868
Then...

563
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:49,504
I hope you enjoy the movie.

564
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:53,174
Okay.

565
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,376
Hello.

566
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,215
Let me help you.

567
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:03,184
You didn't have to.

568
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,253
This is a bit much.

569
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,955
It's nice to meet you.

570
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:08,590
- How old are you? - I'm 20.

571
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,958
Please make yourself comfortable.

572
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:12,327
Pretend you're on a date with your girlfriend.

573
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,962
Okay, girlfriend.

574
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:17,165
Sure. Shall I make myself comfortable then?

575
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,652
Seriously.

576
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:14,455
I'm sick of being a private eye.

577
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:24,265
What are you doing?

578
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,368
It's okay. Keep walking.

579
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,604
What are you doing?

580
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:32,173
I said to keep walking!

581
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,110
What a pervert.

582
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,646
Let's just go.

583
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:53,261
Their methods of lobbying are insane.

584
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,096
Talk about taking care of your clients.

585
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,531
Watching a movie...

586
00:36:56,531 --> 00:37:00,001
in a skybox acting like lovers with a girl young enough to be his niece.

587
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,403
Hey, do you have any other photos that show his face?

588
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:04,372
You can't make out his face.

589
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:06,574
Just zoom in.

590
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,946
Deputy Manager Yang.

591
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:14,415
I already talked about it with Deputy Manager Yang...

592
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:15,950
from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

593
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,953
The prosecution will seek a 10-year sentence...

594
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:21,356
and you will shorten it by three years.

595
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:25,860
Those jerks.

596
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,162
What is it? Do you know him?

597
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,864
I know him very well.

598
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,034
Deputy Manager Yang Sang Bae.

599
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,470
He's the jerk who worked with Lee Do Jin...

600
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,572
to ruin my life.

601
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,643
I never expected this.

602
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:42,710
Then what?

603
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,481
Were the three of them always working together?

604
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:52,186
I'm not expecting anyone at this hour.

605
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:55,156
Mr. Gi.

606
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:56,891
Ms. Ha?

607
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,696
You weren't even that respectful to your colleague at your law firm.

608
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,930
But what? "Ms. Ha"?

609
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,034
Whatever. Turn up the volume. I want to hear what she says.

610
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,170
Mr. Gi, can you see me?

611
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,538
Please let me in.

612
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,773
(Student Record)

613
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:13,908
So she's Ha So Hyun?

614
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,877
What should I do? Pretend you're not home?

615
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,313
No. She'll probably stick around all night, knowing her.

616
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:20,882
Let her in. I need to ask her something too.

617
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,451
Okay. Open sesame.

618
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:25,053
Did you just let her in?

619
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,423
What? You said to let her in.

620
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:32,026
- What about those pictures? - Gosh.

621
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:34,462
- She's coming up. - Seriously.

622
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:37,165
Gosh, what should we do?

623
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,233
Darn it.

624
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,304
Hello.

625
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:52,413
Why are you two breathing so heavily?

626
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,253
We were working out. We're obsessed these days.

627
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,956
What's that called? We follow workout videos at home.

628
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,691
- Home training. - Home training.

629
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:06,027
It's very popular these days. Home training.

630
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,029
Home training.

631
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:10,865
Who is this man, by the way?

632
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,900
- He's my... - I'm his roommate.

633
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:15,603
We're friends. We're the same age.

634
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,872
No way.

635
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,775
What? "No way"?

636
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,445
Well, I was just talking to myself.

637
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:29,917
What brings you here at this hour?

638
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,787
Well, you said...

639
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,289
you wanted to know more about the kids in our class.

640
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,290
Yes.

641
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,693
Even though I can't give you access to the student record,

642
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:42,563
we can look at the copies of it together.

643
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:43,865
Oh, my.

644
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:47,802
You're not only beautiful but also generous.

645
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,172
Are the three of us going to look at those together tonight?

646
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,776
No. This contains the students' personal information.

647
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:58,312
Only Mr. Gi and I are allowed to view it.

648
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,150
I'm really sorry, but could you excuse us?

649
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,051
Oh, I see.

650
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:07,255
Yes, without me, I guess.

651
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:10,224
Yes, without you. Why don't you go to your room?

652
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:13,594
You said you had a lot to do. Don't mind us.

653
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:17,465
Sure. I have to work. I have a lot to do.

654
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,741
Enjoy.

655
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:27,742
All right.

656
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:30,011
Have you thanked her?

657
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,614
- Thank you. - Thank you.

658
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,953
Faster!

659
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,856
Faster! More expressively!

660
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:16,624
Faster!

661
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,159
Even faster!

662
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,194
Wrong! Faster!

663
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,296
Faster!

664
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,165
Faster!

665
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:43,117
There'd be no guarantee even if she was getting better by now.

666
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:45,286
But she's become worse since last semester.

667
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:46,521
She can't seem to focus.

668
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:48,155
What's the problem?

669
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:49,924
Does she need more lessons?

670
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,227
No. The amount of practice is enough.

671
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:56,063
I'd say her technique is already there.

672
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:59,800
But not everything can be solved by practice in this field.

673
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,370
It was to solve exactly that part...

674
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,605
that I chose you.

675
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,277
Make sure she has a chance by all means.

676
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,445
I can give her as much support as she needs.

677
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,147
I'll do my best.

678
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,483
I have another lesson.

679
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:18,386
She can use the practice room as long as she wants.

680
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:05,566
Try again. From the very beginning.

681
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,869
Straight back. Wrists in position.

682
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:10,071
Can't you focus?

683
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:14,375
Are you planning to humiliate me in front of everyone?

684
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:23,651
Beom Jin.

685
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,219
Ms. Woo, have you been well?

686
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:28,389
Yes. Have you been well too?

687
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:29,523
Yes.

688
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,593
I thought Tae Ra's lesson would be over by now. Isn't she finished yet?

689
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:37,365
Her lesson is over, but I thought she needs more practice.

690
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:40,301
Why did you bring flowers?

691
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,769
Are they for Tae Ra?

692
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,839
No. They're for you.

693
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,041
For me? Why?

694
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,477
It's Tae Ra's birthday today.

695
00:43:49,477 --> 00:43:53,347
It's a special day to Tae Ra, but you're the one to take credit.

696
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:55,282
Will you accept these?

697
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:56,951
Thanks.

698
00:43:56,951 --> 00:44:00,054
They're beautiful.

699
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:01,856
They smell so good too.

700
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:05,893
I'd like to thank you for giving me such a great friend.

701
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:10,164
Will you let me take Tae Ra out now?

702
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:14,502
I think we should look around the university we'll be going to.

703
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:23,110
Fine, you can do that.

704
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,413
Tae Rae needs to relieve her stress.

705
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,048
But don't send her home too late.

706
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:29,450
Of course. Don't worry.

707
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,485
- Let's go. - Okay.

708
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:37,024
How did you know?

709
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:39,727
Yes.

710
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:42,496
Getting into a university isn't quite as important...

711
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:45,433
as becoming that boy's wife.

712
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,705
Thank you for coming.

713
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:54,775
Of course. It's your birthday.

714
00:44:57,545 --> 00:44:59,513
Should we sit down for a minute?

715
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:01,615
Sure, let's do that.

716
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:12,660
What's this?

717
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,929
A birthday present. Open it.

718
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:16,964
I hope you'll like it.

719
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,502
Pretty.

720
00:45:21,502 --> 00:45:22,870
I love it.

721
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,340
It's engraved with a phrase and our initials.

722
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,343
"Tueor"?

723
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:32,046
- What does it mean? - Tueor.

724
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:35,683
In Latin, it means "to gaze from the side" and "to support".

725
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:40,755
You must feel nervous about the charity concert...

726
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:44,492
as our parents will be there, but don't worry.

727
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,961
I'll be by your side the whole time.

728
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:52,933
Beom Jin, do you want to go watch that movie again?

729
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:55,436
Oh, is that still playing?

730
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,671
Yes. I'm sure we can find a theater that plays it.

731
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,806
Word started spreading pretty late.

732
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:01,008
It recently reached the 10-million viewer mark.

733
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,311
That day, I was so tired that I fell asleep during the movie.

734
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:07,148
I had spent the whole night before practicing.

735
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:09,850
Right. I remember.

736
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,020
It was such a hilarious movie.

737
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,424
I laughed more than 100 times during the whole movie.

738
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:22,429
"The whole movie"?

739
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,865
Did you watch it to the end?

740
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,567
Of course.

741
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,403
I didn't fall asleep like a certain someone.

742
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,575
Spicy or plain?

743
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:38,946
- Welcome. - What are you talking about?

744
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:48,022
Did I sleep for a long time?

745
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:54,161
Where did he go?

746
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:03,704
Have you ever peeled 33 bundles of green onions in a day?

747
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:06,006
It's CBR training every day.

748
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:13,747
Shall we go now? Your mom must be waiting.

749
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,650
Oh, okay.

750
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:30,898
(Student record)

751
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:33,834
(Lee Gi Hoon)

752
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,445
(English contest winner, debate competition winner)

753
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,795
(Student Record)

754
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,964
(Kim Han Su)

755
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,133
"A school violence perpetrator."

756
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,235
"Suspended for 10 days."

757
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:11,105
Who is the victim?

758
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:22,316
Is there anything you want to say to me?

759
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:27,454
You've seen everything, right? At the parking lot.

760
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,124
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

761
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:33,193
I know talking about that in school made you uncomfortable.

762
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:34,962
That's why I'm here.

763
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:37,364
I wanted to discuss it with you in private.

764
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,066
You're right.

765
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:41,869
You're making me very uncomfortable.

766
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:43,938
Let me make myself clear one more time.

767
00:48:43,938 --> 00:48:47,675
You don't seem to get it when I beat around the bush.

768
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,811
I never want to be involved in that thing yesterday.

769
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:52,579
I don't think there's much...

770
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:54,615
a temporary teacher can do anyway.

771
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:57,418
Mr. Gi, if you listen to me...

772
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:00,421
I don't need to. I know all there is to know.

773
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:03,624
I know what happened at this school last semester.

774
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,730
This is the boy, right?

775
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,632
Kim Han Su.

776
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,135
I did some research myself because I got curious.

777
00:49:15,135 --> 00:49:17,905
He seemed to have a lot of problems.

778
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:21,375
Mr. Lee's violent attitude was definitely unacceptable.

779
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,179
But the fact that a problem student who used to stalk another student...

780
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,447
committed murder...

781
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:28,415
No.

782
00:49:29,283 --> 00:49:32,553
Han Su didn't kill Su Ah.

783
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:40,995
Is there a reason why you think so?

784
00:49:41,362 --> 00:49:44,765
Yes. It's true that Han Su had a lot of problems.

785
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:47,301
But he's completely changed.

786
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:51,071
I know that because I've been his homeroom teacher...

787
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,374
from the moment he entered this school.

788
00:49:55,976 --> 00:49:57,945
He was one famous boy.

789
00:49:58,212 --> 00:50:00,514
Not long after he entered the school,

790
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:03,450
he had all cliques from other schools under his control.

791
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:08,255
Back then, he was very close to Jun Jae and Jung Tae.

792
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,056
Hey!

793
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,226
Then the second semester started...

794
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:48,095
and Su Ah transferred to our school.

795
00:50:48,095 --> 00:50:49,830
She came to Class 1-2, where Tae Ra was in.

796
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,332
Everyone, she transferred today and her name is Jung Su Ah.

797
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:54,101
Introduce yourself.

798
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:57,104
Hi, my name is Jung Su Ah.

799
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,206
Nice to meet you.

800
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:05,612
Back then, Tae Ra was close friends with both Su Ah...

801
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,381
and Ye Ri.

802
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:10,184
The three of them were close friends?

803
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:14,655
Class 2 had many joint classes.

804
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,324
Unlike in the classroom, where you sit only on your seat,

805
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,494
out on the grounds, you can see more things.

806
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:26,533
Don't underestimate the warm-up exercise.

807
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:28,535
- Focus. - Okay, ma'am.

808
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:30,804
You can see things like...

809
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:35,876
who are close friends and who are getting bullied.

810
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:49,723
Sometimes, I could see other things too.

811
00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:54,261
That's not a big deal.

812
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,196
Really?

813
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,866
You're so pretty.

814
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,436
And when the 1st semester of their junior year started,

815
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,705
Han Su came to me.

816
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,306
You want to become a PE teacher?

817
00:52:06,306 --> 00:52:08,575
I'm not so good at studying,

818
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,644
but I'm quite good at sports.

819
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:14,681
I heard practical exam matters more than grades in this field.

820
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,984
That's true,

821
00:52:16,984 --> 00:52:18,785
but if you want to apply for the physical education major,

822
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:21,522
you need to get decent grades from school.

823
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:23,056
There are many colleges that include the CSAT score...

824
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,225
even if you apply to rolling admission colleges.

825
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,395
Of course. I see.

826
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:33,033
I was just curious.

827
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,571
There's no way I can make it.

828
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,375
Never mind. I should get going.

829
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:46,813
Wait, Han Su.

830
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,216
What's the reason?

831
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:54,855
There must be a reason why you wanted to become a PE teacher.

832
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:57,691
Can you tell me?

833
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:02,696
While watching television, I saw a celebrity saying...

834
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:08,001
that we all look similar because we wore similar-looking uniforms,

835
00:53:08,335 --> 00:53:09,736
but once we graduate,

836
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:12,105
we will all be living in different worlds.

837
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:14,441
While one gets a job with a big corporation...

838
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,244
and works in an air-conditioned office,

839
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:20,914
another has to work under the scorching sun in summer...

840
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,784
and in the cold in winter.

841
00:53:25,052 --> 00:53:27,721
That sounds somewhat uncomfortable.

842
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,224
To be honest, it doesn't matter.

843
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:34,094
I like physical work.

844
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:36,196
Still,

845
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:38,632
I don't want to live in a different world...

846
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,834
after I graduate.

847
00:53:41,535 --> 00:53:45,305
Since then, he's become a totally different person.

848
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,375
He never got into fights or caused any problem.

849
00:53:49,176 --> 00:53:52,913
I don't know how the rumor started that he stalked Su Ah,

850
00:53:52,913 --> 00:53:56,183
but the Han Su I know would never harass Su Ah.

851
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:57,884
Besides...

852
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:02,055
I'm sorry. I'm going to take this.

853
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:05,092
Hello.

854
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:07,194
Hey, where are you?

855
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:09,396
I'm at Mr. Gi's place.

856
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:11,365
There's something we need to discuss together.

857
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:14,434
What? Mr. Gi's place?

858
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,506
Then did you really...

859
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,541
sleep with him?

860
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:23,443
What?

861
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:26,213
Are you out of your mind?

862
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:28,582
What are you saying all of a sudden?

863
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,521
You get out of that place right now.

864
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,524
This is not the time to be in Mr. Gi's place.

865
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:41,395
What's the matter? Explain so I can understand.

866
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,164
How can I explain this?

867
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:47,401
Hold on. I'll show you.

868
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:57,544
What...

869
00:54:58,345 --> 00:55:00,614
What is this?

870
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,282
Did something happen?

871
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:05,285
No. Well...

872
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:27,274
Ms. Shin, where did you find this picture?

873
00:55:27,274 --> 00:55:29,943
Oh, my. Is that you, Mr. Gi?

874
00:55:33,814 --> 00:55:37,284
I'm the supervisor of the self-study session today,

875
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:39,886
and all the students' eyes were fixed to their phones.

876
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:43,056
I wondered what was going on and checked their phones.

877
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,525
Then I found the picture of you two posted on a weird app.

878
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:48,495
And there are more than just one picture.

879
00:55:48,862 --> 00:55:51,064
Could you keep this secret from other teachers?

880
00:55:51,064 --> 00:55:52,265
Please.

881
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,936
Sure. That's no problem, but...

882
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,406
It's not true, right?

883
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:01,241
You know once these kinds of pictures start spreading,

884
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:02,576
they spread like crazy.

885
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:05,011
Thank you. Please take good care of it.

886
00:56:05,746 --> 00:56:07,414
Hello?

887
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,952
What? He hung up?

888
00:56:13,387 --> 00:56:15,856
They're getting more and more suspicious.

889
00:56:21,995 --> 00:56:24,765
I think you should go back home now.

890
00:56:24,765 --> 00:56:27,134
We can talk about the rest back in school.

891
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,536
If someone finds out that you were in my place...

892
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:33,373
while such pictures are spreading, it will be a big problem.

893
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:35,542
I guess you're right.

894
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:38,044
Who on earth made this ridiculous picture?

895
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:50,424
I'm sorry to bother you late at night.

896
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,626
Don't worry.

897
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:56,096
It's late. We should take you home.

898
00:56:56,096 --> 00:57:00,534
No, thanks. I'm good. I live nearby.

899
00:57:00,534 --> 00:57:03,236
Then see you at school, Mr. Gi.

900
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:04,971
Okay.

901
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:07,174
Have a safe trip back home.

902
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:09,676
Don't worry too much about it.

903
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:24,991
Worry? Worry about what?

904
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,593
Let's go back in.

905
00:57:26,593 --> 00:57:28,795
We're working late tonight.

906
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:30,564
We're working late?

907
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,633
Hey, I've been working nonstop.

908
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:36,903
Does your week have six weekdays or something?

909
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:41,775
(Girl Group Trainee's Disgusting Truth)

910
00:57:48,582 --> 00:57:49,983
I'm disappointed.

911
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:52,686
I never expected you to cause problems like these.

912
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:55,956
It isn't true. I just went to a friend's birthday party.

913
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:58,024
The pictures are all over the Internet.

914
00:57:58,024 --> 00:57:59,292
Along with a rumor...

915
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,695
that this restaurant was shut down because you're a minor.

916
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:03,263
That's ridiculous.

917
00:58:03,263 --> 00:58:06,566
I was there for less than 10 minutes.

918
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:10,103
(CEO Choi Yun Woo)

919
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,806
- Ye Ri. - Yes, Mr. Choi.

920
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:16,676
You did great all these years. Work even harder now, okay?

921
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:18,745
Since you'll be making your debut.

922
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,082
Yes, sir. I won't disappoint you.

923
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,884
Good.

924
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:26,453
Sir.

925
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:32,325
What do I do now?

926
00:58:36,162 --> 00:58:39,266
What do I do now?

927
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,306
Normally, contrary to people's belief,

928
00:58:46,306 --> 00:58:49,876
even writings posted online have a recognizable style.

929
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:53,313
Where they place the commas, the indentations,

930
00:58:53,313 --> 00:58:54,781
how they separate paragraphs,

931
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,884
the number of periods they use for abbreviations.

932
00:58:57,884 --> 00:59:00,453
If you analyze these little details,

933
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,456
you can find out who wrote what.

934
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,726
Just like this.

935
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:11,131
According to my analysis,

936
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,733
one person continuously posted all the slanderous stories...

937
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:16,136
about Su Ah on the student community portal.

938
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,772
The person changed the writing style each time,

939
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:20,106
but you can't fool me.

940
00:59:20,106 --> 00:59:24,344
So? Who was it? Who posted those photos?

01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:04,884
Su Ah's home.

947
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:07,854
Yes, but that went out the window.

948
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,656
Kim Han Su caused a scene in court...

949
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:12,392
and confessed that he did it soon thereafter.

950
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:14,594
Where's this lawyer now?

951
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:17,464
He was fired. Nice and quick.

952
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,936
He lost his house...

953
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:25,972
and car to pay the penalty for terminating the contract.

954
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:30,176
Plus, he lost his license, so he's probably homeless.

Stupid idiot.

She looked so angry because she was being wronged.

968

Did he call the school already?

Not only now, but ever.

You'll never get a chance like that in your lifetime.

Cheonmyung High's Student Community portal.

995
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:12,125
I don't have to listen to you.

996
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:15,595
Hey. It's free food, which you like. Knock yourself out.

997
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:17,563
They'll bully you as long as you take it.

998
01:05:17,563 --> 01:05:20,466
Show them you won't take it anymore.

999
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,271
I kept asking you to stop!

1000
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:27,173
Byung Ho!

1001
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,575
Drop the knife right now.
