1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,959
Tonight, on top of these city walls,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,999
there is no Duan Zi Ang...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,200
and no Xiao Shu He!

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,600
The prince of South Hui and the crown prince of Ji North...

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
should never...

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
have met.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,480
You should go.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,320
Soldiers of South Hui, listen up!

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,720
Capture the assassin from Ji North...

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,400
and avenge my brother!

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,880
Did you capture the assassin from Ji North?

12
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Your Highness,

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Duan Zi Ang is very skilled.

14
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,560
The soldiers have tried their best to chase him.

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Seeing the dagger is the same as seeing me.

16
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,080
Father and Shu Qian are no longer here.

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
Someone has to take on the responsibility...

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
of governing the South Hui Kingdom.

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
Although I was born in the palace,

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,600
I always dreamt of paradise.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,679
I thought that between poetry and wine,

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,240
was where I belonged in life.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
But it turns out...

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
that it was just a dream that I fooled myself with.

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
Now that I've woken up,

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
I know that behind me is my country...

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,960
and in front of me...

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
is my duty.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
I have nowhere to run.

30
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,079
I had just heard that you, the profligate son,

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,160
wanted to share my burdens.

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I've been obsessed with poetry for too long.

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,080
The soul and the spirit ought to speak to one another.

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
Do not be born into the imperial family.

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,000
If I take over the world one day,

36
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,480
I'll be suffocated.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,639
In the 25th year of the Great Xiao,

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,359
the emperor passed away.

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,359
Crown Prince Shu Qian was killed by a Ji North assassin.

40
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,880
He was 24 years old.

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,999
Sixth Prince Shu He heard the news...

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,919
and led the Imperial Guards to the rescue.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,759
But the crown prince had already passed away.

44
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,119
The ministers were horrified.

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,279
Prime Minister Gu Yuan Shan and others...

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,359
were warned by the late emperor...

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,999
that the state cannot be without a ruler for a day...

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,520
and to appoint Shu He to the throne.

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,080
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,719
Within the month,

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,919
Xiao Shu He succeeded the throne in Nanling...

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,919
and ushered in the Jinghe era.

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
He issued a nationwide amnesty.

54
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,520
(South Hui Kingdom)

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,680
(Ji North Kingdom)

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,000
Duan Zi Ang, hear the decree.

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,479
The crown prince of South Hui...

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,639
was power-hungry,

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,920
tyrannical, and merciless.

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,999
Duan Zi Ang has made great contributions...

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,559
by assassinating the crown prince of South Hui,

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,039
ridding His Majesty's worries,

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,439
and securing peace for the Ji North Kingdom.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,919
Therefore, he is appointed Chief Commander...

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,960
to serve His Majesty in unifying the Central Plain.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
That is all.

67
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
All these years,

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
you have suffered.

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,000
Your mission target is no longer the South Kingdom's crown prince.

70
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,920
It's Xiao Shu He.

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
You can either kill him...

72
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,800
or drink this poisoned wine.

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,480
The old emperor is ruthless.

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,039
He didn't leave a single portrait behind.

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,160
He's extremely arrogant.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,839
I'm deeply moved by your generosity, Father.

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
I can't repay you.

78
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
I can only pledge my loyalty to our kingdom.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,239
I'll slaughter all our enemies...

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
I'll protect my kingdom forever.

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,960
to repay Your Majesty's kindness.

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,760
His Majesty forbade you from going to the southern border.

83
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,400
He has his reasons.

84
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,480
Have something to eat.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is something bothering you?

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,319
It's nothing.

87
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
Yesterday, His Majesty issued an order.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,360
You look worried and uneasy.

89
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,760
Do you care about South Hui?

90
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
Or do you miss him?

91
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Zi Ang,

92
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,320
trust is a fragile thing.

93
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,280
A reunion after a long separation?

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,120
Revenge for your father?

95
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,640
What is the truth?

96
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,040
Back then, I promised him...

97
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,960
that I wouldn't lie to him again.

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,440
But before I could say anything,

99
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,920
we had become enemies for life.

100
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
It was because of me...

101
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,040
that you sneaked into Sixth Prince's Manor...

102
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
and did something you would regret for life.

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
I don't regret it.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,600
I don't want to lose him.

105
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,240
And I definitely don't want to lose you.

106
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,840
But what stands between the two of you now...

107
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,440
is a feud between the North and the South.

108
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Therefore,

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,880
as long as I can rule the world,

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,560
I can have him.

111
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,439
In the spring of the second year of the Jinghe era,

112
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,839
Xiao Shu He proclaimed...

113
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,919
the closure of all paths to the south...

114
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,039
and the severance of all diplomatic relations.

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,319
Violators would be accused of treason...

116
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,399
and moved to guard the border.

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,279
The North Kingdom also closed its doors in response.

118
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,559
The friendship between the two kingdoms...

119
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
was terminated.

120
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,399
Xiao Shu He is now the emperor of the South Kingdom.

121
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,480
There's no chance of contacting him.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Big Brother, don't miss your old friend...

123
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
and hurt your health.

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,399
With the statuses you both have now,

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,720
there is no chance of meeting again.

126
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,440
It's time to let him go.

127
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,720
I knew that the moment Xiao Shu Qian died!

128
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,520
Everything I'm doing now is to see him again.

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
How?

130
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,199
In the third winter of the Jinghe era,

131
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,039
Chief Commander Duan Zi Ang of Ji North...

132
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,600
led his troops back to the imperial court.

133
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Your Majesty,

134
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,839
Duan Zi Ang ascended to the throne of Ji North.

135
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm afraid it won't be good for South Hui.

136
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,560
Duan Zi Ang?

137
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,920
How did he gain power?

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know.

139
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,679
The old emperor of Ji North passed away.

140
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,120
Duan Zi Ang mustered an army and is on a military conquest.

141
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,200
It seems he wants to rule the world.

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,120
You and I...

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
have become enemies after all.

144
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,639
In the fourth year of the Jinghe era,

145
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,399
the new emperor of Ji North, Duan Zi Ang, ascended the throne...

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,559
and sent troops to the south.

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,320
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

148
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Report!

149
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,240
The Ji North army has dispatched troops to the border.

150
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,320
Duan Zi Ang's envoys seek an audience.

151
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I won't see them.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,079
Drag them out.

153
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,440
Don't ever mention him again.

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Shu He,

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,719
five years of winter and summer have passed.

156
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,680
How is your health, Your Majesty?

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,560
The scenery in the South Kingdom must not have changed.

158
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,360
The memory of the short time we spent together in the manor...

159
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
is like the reflection of the moon on water.

160
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
Though I know I can't pursue it,

161
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,040
it's engraved in my heart.

162
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
For five years,

163
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
I climbed a bloody path to the throne.

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,959
It was not because I am hungry for power.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,280
It was because I wanted to gain a foothold.

166
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
It is my hope that in this position,

167
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
I can see you again.

168
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Men!

169
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,520
Deliver this letter to the emperor of South Hui.

170
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Make haste.

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,559
Today,

172
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,920
since I'm the emperor of the North,

173
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,000
I know what happened in the past can't be undone.

174
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
I hope Your Majesty will consider our past friendship...

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,520
and allow trade between our two kingdoms.

176
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,240
This is not just for diplomatic relations.

177
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
It's also my way of seeking a way back into your heart.

178
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,720
Trust is a fragile thing.

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
If you really do something harmful to South Hui,

180
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
I won't forgive you.

181
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
I don't dare to ask for your forgiveness.

182
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
I only hope...

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,000
that we can communicate with each other.

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Your Majesty, there is no reply.

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
This is the only thing...

186
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,000
that the emperor of the South Kingdom sent back.

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
Seeing the dagger is like seeing me.

188
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
The dagger is here.

189
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Think of me whenever you're in danger.

190
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Why?

191
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Why?

192
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,880
Why?

193
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,720
But what stands between the two of you now...

194
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
is a feud between the North and the South.

195
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Therefore,

196
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,920
as long as I can rule the world,

197
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
I can have him.

198
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,040
Very well.

199
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
Shu He,

200
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,280
since our friendship...

201
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
is like this dagger to you...

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,680
Let's not meet again...

203
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,199
in this life.

204
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,840
It has become a piece of scrap metal.

205
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
Then,

206
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
I shall use these million iron hooves...

207
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,880
to pave the way in the South Kingdom.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,880
A bloody path that leads straight to your throne room.

209
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm going to break down your palace doors myself...

210
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,200
and stand before your throne.

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,480
I'm going to make sure you have nowhere to hide.

212
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
You can't escape.

213
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Attack!

214
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
All armies, listen up!

215
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,560
Destroy the South Hui Kingdom!

216
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,880
Those who burn and pillage shall be executed.

217
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,799
Anyone who captures Xiao Shu He alive...

218
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,039
will be rewarded with 10,000 taels of gold!

219
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,640
Anyone who harms him will have their family executed!

220
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,919
We don't retreat from today's battle!

221
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,200
While it's easy to take over a kingdom,

222
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,400
people's hearts are hard to capture.

223
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,439
When your two armies clash,

224
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
how will you know if he loves you or hates you?

225
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,520
Whether he loves me or hates me is a matter for later.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,160
Right now,

227
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,240
I just want to see him.

228
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,559
In the spring of the fifth year of the Jinghe era,

229
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,439
the Northern army broke through Tianmen Pass...

230
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,039
and marched straight in.

231
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,759
They breached the Southern capital.

232
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,799
The South's Imperial Guards were absent from the battlefield.

233
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
The capital fell at once.

234
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,599
(South Hui Main Hall, South Hui Kingdom)

235
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,879
(The 17th day of the 12th month, the day that South Hui fell)

236
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Father,

237
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,520
I am ashamed to face my ancestors.

238
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,720
It is my incompetence.

239
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,920
In the afterlife,

240
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,440
how can I face the ancestors of the Xiao family?

241
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,640
Duan Zi Ang,

242
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,240
I couldn't protect the kingdom.

243
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,680
It's my fault.

244
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,080
But I won't be your prisoner!

245
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,480
It's you, isn't it?

246
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
You killed my brother.

247
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,280
You destroyed my kingdom.

248
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
And now,

249
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,280
will you trample on my dignity too?

250
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,279
The Northern army...

251
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,599
besieged the Southern capital.

252
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,639
Shu He knew the tide had turned.

253
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,799
He drew his sword to take his own life.

254
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,519
Zi Ang rushed forward to capture him...

255
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,079
and brought him back to Ji North.

256
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,600
The South Hui Kingdom was destroyed.

257
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Don't move.

258
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm afraid the wound will reopen.

259
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Did you shoot that arrow just now?

260
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
That's right.

261
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,240
You annihilated South Hui.

262
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,799
Why did you save me?

263
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,920
I only annihilated South Hui to save you.

264
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Trust me.

265
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,880
The one who was shouting outside the Imperial Garden...

266
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,120
must have been your brother.

267
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,520
Do you still remember...

268
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,880
how you two were able to meet again?

269
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,560
I still remember...

270
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,640
your kindness.

271
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
You do?

272
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,240
You blindfolded me.

273
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
You must feel guilty...

274
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,280
and don't dare to face me.

275
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,000
I covered your eyes...

276
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
because I couldn't bear to see you cry.

277
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,479
In the fifth winter of the Jinghe era,

278
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,799
Zi Ang captured the former ruler of South Hui, Shu He,

279
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,999
brought him back to the Northern capital,

280
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,960
and gave him a new residence.

281
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,600
All these years, you've been busy with political affairs.

282
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
You haven't returned to Sixth Prince's Manor, have you?

283
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,960
Duan Zi Ang.

284
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,720
How much effort did you put in...

285
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,040
to cut out my old residence from my homeland...

286
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,520
and plant it in the land of your North Kingdom?

287
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,040
I know that the throne...

288
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,960
was like a heavy shackle to you.

289
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,000
Indeed, it's not as comfortable...

290
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,880
as the land in this manor.

291
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Indeed, I haven't been back to my old residence for a long time.

292
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,520
But I remember every blade of grass...

293
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,040
and every tree in my manor.

294
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,479
I also remember the wind blowing, the leaves falling,

295
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,280
and the sandalwood incense wafting outside the window.

296
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,520
Ever since you came here,

297
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
the sounds of weapons clashing appeared in my manor.

298
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Although this place is very similar to my manor,

299
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,560
there is nobody around.

300
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,680
What exactly is this place?

301
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,960
If you stay here for a while,

302
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,720
people will naturally come.

303
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
I know you're frail.

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
You must be unfamiliar with Ji North.

305
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,840
But if you can live in a residence that is similar to your old one,

306
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
perhaps...

307
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,840
you will be able to adapt better.

308
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,920
You annihilated my kingdom.

309
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Now you've rebuilt my former manor in South Hui to humiliate me.

310
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,919
Duan Zi Ang,

311
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,719
I should have killed you myself that night at the city gate!

312
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I've put in so much effort to remake Sixth Prince's Manor!

313
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,640
How could you treat me like this?

314
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,360
Take him away!

315
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Lock him up in this manor.

316
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,600
Let him know that he wasted my good intentions.

317
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,360
Go to the prisoner-of-war camp.

318
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
Ask the palace maids of South Hui...

319
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,920
where the sandalwood incense used in Sixth Prince's Manor...

320
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,480
came from.

321
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,400
Walk faster. We're falling behind.

322
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,479
I don't even get to relieve myself.

323
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
How can I walk faster?

324
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Hey.

325
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,880
Can I pee?

326
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Hold it in.

327
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,559
If I hold it in much longer, I'll burst.

328
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,920
Are you sure you want to be smelling urine the whole way?

329
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Go over there.

330
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Young Master Xiao,

331
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,440
His Majesty prepared this Longjing tea for you.

332
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,960
This incense was ordered by His Majesty at the last minute.

333
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,879
If the preparation is lacking,

334
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,240
please forgive me.

335
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,960
Although your tea preparation is that of South Hui,

336
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,640
your accent is from the north.

337
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,840
Young Master Xiao,

338
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,520
three years ago, His Majesty held a tea party...

339
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,080
and selected palace maids...

340
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,560
to learn the South Hui Kingdom's tea ceremony.

341
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,120
I was one of the ones chosen to learn it.

342
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,640
Young Master Xiao, you might not know this.

343
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,280
His Majesty held this tea party...

344
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,440
because he loves the Longjing tea of South Hui.

345
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,040
Secondly, as His Majesty always says,

346
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,800
after this residence is built,

347
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,920
an important guest from South Hui will come.

348
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,920
This guest has specific tastes.

349
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,799
His Majesty feared he wouldn't be used to the astringency...

350
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,920
of Ji North's flower tea.

351
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,239
So he ordered the palace maids to learn South Hui's tea ceremony...

352
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
to prepare for it.

353
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,040
We've all wondered who this important guest might be.

354
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,240
It must be you, Young Master Xiao.

355
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
What you said implies that...

356
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,439
he had been planning to destroy South Hui...

357
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,040
for three years!

358
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,440
What is the meaning of this?

359
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
His Majesty has ordered me...

360
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
to watch over you, Young Master Xiao.

361
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,280
What if I insist on leaving Ji North?

362
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
Then blood will be shed...

363
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,600
by the South Hui soldiers in the prisoner-of-war camp.

364
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,800
(Sixth Prince's Manor)

365
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,159
Your Majesty conquered the Central Plain yourself.

366
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,560
It's a great achievement.

367
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,799
Your influence stretches in all directions.

368
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,919
It is a great merit.

369
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,280
- It is a great merit. - It is a great merit.

370
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,360
I...

371
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
toast all of you.

372
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,280
We are loyal.

373
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,840
But I have my doubts today.

374
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,840
To capture Xiao Shu He alive,

375
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,080
I've lost so many of my men.

376
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,560
Yet, he's sitting comfortably in the newly built palace.

377
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
Your Majesty, please provide an explanation.

378
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
General Liu,

379
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
I've heard that you love your soldiers like your own sons.

380
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,199
You should know...

381
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,559
that even after destroying the East and West Kingdoms,

382
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,400
there are still many disasters in our territory.

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,919
If we want to win the hearts of the people of South Hui,

384
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,360
we must take the gentle approach.

385
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,439
If we are shortsighted in our haste,

386
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,480
we will spoil our grand plan!

387
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,400
Prime Minister Duan, do you know...

388
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,320
that Xiao Shu He said something disrespectful...

389
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,880
to His Majesty at Sixth Prince's Manor?

390
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
The leader of South Hui...

391
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,520
is in Ji North.

392
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
How dare he be so arrogant...

393
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
as to insult my liege?

394
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,719
General Liu!

395
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Huai Yi.

396
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,280
What General Liu said...

397
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,720
is not unreasonable.

398
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,320
I wanted to be kind to the former sovereign...

399
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,040
and reassure the people.

400
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,800
But I didn't know he would be so nitpicky and critical.

401
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,480
Tonight,

402
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,840
I was supposed to celebrate with all of you.

403
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,440
How could I have known that this defeated emperor...

404
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,480
would trouble me so?

405
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,800
If Your Majesty is still concerned about this,

406
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,560
why don't we put an end to it today?

407
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,240
We don't want your health to be harmed.

408
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,640
I've already sent someone to fetch Xiao Shu He and wait here.

409
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,280
Should I call him in?

410
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Bring him in.

411
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Kneel.

412
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,480
Today, Ji North Kingdom has achieved unification.

413
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,960
I should be celebrating with my ministers.

414
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,400
But you ruined the mood.

415
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
I called you here...

416
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,200
to hear your explanation.

417
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,680
What do I have to explain to you?

418
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,400
Don't speak to His Majesty that way.

419
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,599
How dare he wear...

420
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,120
the South Hui's imperial robe in our palace?

421
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,600
He's asking for death.

422
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,760
Remove the robe.

423
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Remove it!

424
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,840
Thank His Majesty for his kindness in sparing your life.

425
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,160
Kindness in sparing my life?

426
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,600
As the ruler of the South Hui Kingdom,

427
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
today,

428
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,560
I only wish to die!

429
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Dismissed!

430
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,680
You'll die when I tell you to.

431
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,760
You'll live when I tell you to.

432
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
Even if the King of Hell comes, he won't dare to take your life!

433
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Everyone,

434
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,480
leave us.

435
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,200
I have some private matters to discuss with Xiao Shu He.

436
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,440
- Your Majesty. - Leave us!

437
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,800
When my army attacked the capital of South Hui,

438
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,999
I gave a death order...

439
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,799
that no one from South Hui was to be killed.

440
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,879
The battle lasted for weeks. How many soldiers listened to you?

441
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,040
Do you really not know?

442
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,880
There was looting and burning.

443
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,720
There was no mercy at all!

444
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,919
Let me tell you.

445
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,199
When we breached the city gate,

446
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,840
I thought there would be a bloodbath.

447
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,319
In the end,

448
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,840
the people of the South Hui Kingdom welcomed us into the city.

449
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,320
You're really funny,

450
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Duan Zi Ang.

451
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,800
You really haven't changed.

452
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,040
You're still a smooth talker.

453
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,560
In their eyes,

454
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Ji North came to save them.

455
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,279
To save them from you,

456
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,680
their incompetent emperor!

457
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,720
I should have listened to my ministers back then...

458
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,439
to attack the North Kingdom while your forces were weak...

459
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,040
and avenge my brother!

460
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,640
I really don't get it.

461
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,799
You love the one who hates you,

462
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,520
and you hate the one who loves you!

463
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,200
Aren't you both?

464
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Guards!

465
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
Since he's not used to living in the palace,

466
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,720
lock him up in the dungeon!

467
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,480
For the sake of the throne,

468
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,840
what kind of monster will you become before you stop?

469
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,160
But what stands between the two of you now...

470
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,960
is a feud between the North and the South.

471
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,600
(Three years ago, when Duan Zi Ang returned to the capital)

472
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Therefore,

473
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,240
as long as I can rule the world,

474
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,880
I can have him.

475
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,160
Do you know what you're saying?

476
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,560
If I fail,

477
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,960
I don't want to drag you down with me.

478
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
You unfilial son!

479
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,920
I didn't care that you're an illegitimate child.

480
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,120
Is this how you repay me?

481
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,240
Take off your imperial robe.

482
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,080
I'll spare your life.

483
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,640
This is the best way to repay you.

484
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,320
If you really want to be the emperor,

485
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,399
the first thing you need to learn...

486
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,039
is to kill without hesitation!

487
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Just like what you did to my mother?

488
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,120
I won't lose a kingdom...

489
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,879
because of a romance!

490
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,280
I don't care about the kingdom!

491
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,360
I just want one person!

492
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,799
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

493
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,840
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

494
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,080
The cause of His Majesty's illness...

495
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,799
is the poison he took from the Red Shadow Guards.

496
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,120
His body has long been weakened.

497
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,880
Is there a cure for this illness?

498
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
If you can treat him,

499
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
you will be rewarded handsomely.

500
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,840
My medical skills are lacking.

501
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
I am unable to cure him.

502
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
However,

503
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,600
I know of a strange physician...

504
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,560
who might be able to cure His Majesty.

505
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Who is this person? Where does he live now?

506
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,520
South Hui was destroyed.

507
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,400
One of the captives in the palace...

508
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,680
was a wanderer in the martial arts world.

509
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,040
He learned from masters of medicine all over the world.

510
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
He is well-versed in medicine.

511
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,240
He's good at treating complicated diseases.

512
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,520
If that's the case, why didn't you bring him?

513
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,720
I took it upon myself...

514
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,960
to ask him to wait outside.

515
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Summon him in.

516
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,920
As the emperor,

517
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
you must have done a lot of bad things.

518
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Is it the poison of your own heart?

519
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Or is it karma?

520
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Young man,

521
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,520
what crime have you committed...

522
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,320
to end up like this?

523
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
You look...

524
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,640
like a nobleman.

525
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,040
No wonder someone gave you a blanket.

526
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,680
If you are cold,

527
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,240
you can take it.

528
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,760
You're covered in silk.

529
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,840
You speak with a southern accent.

530
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,800
Are you...

531
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,080
the sixth prince of South Hui?

532
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,040
I am the ruler of South Hui,

533
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,720
Xiao Shu He.

534
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Nonsense!

535
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,520
I was ordered by the late emperor...

536
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,000
to renovate the imperial residence.

537
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,040
I've worked hard for decades.

538
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,880
Then I ended up at Sixth Prince's Manor!

539
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
Even in this dungeon,

540
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,840
I can't escape from the manor.

541
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,800
Do you think I want to be here?

542
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,960
If it wasn't for the Sixth Prince's Manor,

543
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,560
I would be able to see my grandson...

544
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,880
who has just turned one month old.

545
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,480
What happened to the Sixth Prince's Manor?

546
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Three years ago, I received an order from His Majesty...

547
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,240
to replicate Sixth Prince's Manor of South Hui.

548
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,160
I was worried at the time.

549
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,920
The Sixth Prince's Manor was an important place in South Hui.

550
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,320
No one knew what it really looked like.

551
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,480
He actually remembers...

552
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,960
every detail about the manor.

553
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,000
That's not all.

554
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
He remembers everything that happened...

555
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,600
in every corner.

556
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,080
I should have known then...

557
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,560
that this manor was special to him.

558
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,440
I wouldn't dare to change it in the future.

559
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,160
Why don't I believe you?

560
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,240
To this day, I still don't understand.

561
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,120
His Majesty said it himself.

562
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,640
There's a private cabinet in your room.

563
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,840
His Majesty's paintings and a memorial tablet are in there.

564
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,880
I know it's bad feng shui.

565
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,400
I was afraid it would affect the nation's luck.

566
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,240
So I sealed the cabinet's door without permission.

567
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,880
To my surprise, His Majesty was furious when he found out.

568
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Then I was imprisoned here.

569
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,240
It's strange though.

570
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,280
Why did you add such a strange cabinet back then?

571
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,560
All the clues you found were planted by me.

572
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,040
Every single item...

573
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,320
was a part of my calculations.

574
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,200
Absurd.

575
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,840
He clearly knew...

576
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,200
that it was all fake.
