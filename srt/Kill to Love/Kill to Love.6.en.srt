00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,720
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Greetings to Your Majesty...

3
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
from commoner, Duan Zi Ang.

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,800
So it was you...

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
who protected the Sixth Prince?

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,080
Your Majesty,

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
that's right.

8
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,800
Today is the betrothal
banquet for the Sixth Prince.

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,840
I'd like to perform a sword dance...

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,520
to congratulate the Sixth Prince
and the Princess...

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
on their marriage.

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I'll play the zither
to entertain you, Father.

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
All right.

14
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,960
That's great.

15
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
This is clearly the swordplay...

16
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,320
of the Ji North Kingdom's
Red Shadow Guards.

17
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,400
The Red Shadow Guards all have
crow-shaped tattoos on their backs.

18
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
Guards, check his body.

19
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,240
Your Majesty.

20
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
There's no tattoo on him.

21
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,200
Since you're doing this,

22
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,800
why don't you check
our kingdom's guards too?

23
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Even if he's not a spy,

24
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,359
it's still a serious crime
for the Sixth Prince...

25
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
to hide an assassin in his manor.

26
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,200
To clear Shu He's name,

27
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,480
Father, I plead you...

28
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
to issue a decree...

29
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,920
to thoroughly investigate
the Sixth Prince's Manor.

30
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Shu He.

31
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,920
To ensure our innocence,

32
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
you'll have to put up with this.

33
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Yes.

34
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,360
Order the Imperial Guards
to search the manor.

35
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,399
Your Highness, there's nothing.

36
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,160
Your Highness, there's nothing
in the side rooms.

37
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Your Highness.

38
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:32,120
There's nothing in the east
and west wings either.

39
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,080
You're good, Xiao Shu He.

40
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
So?

41
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Your Majesty.

42
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
We've searched the whole manor.

43
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,960
We didn't find anything suspicious.

44
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
Interesting.

45
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,280
This act that Your Majesty
has put on...

46
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
was truly spectacular.

47
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
This was supposed to mend
our kingdoms' relationship.

48
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,480
I didn't expect you
to humiliate me like this.

49
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,360
I didn't intend to interfere
in the affairs of the South Kingdom.

50
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,320
But under such circumstances,

51
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,840
I really can't entrust
our princess to you.

52
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,400
Regarding the tribute gifts,

53
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
we'll have to discuss them later.

54
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Xiao Shu Qian.

55
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
Are you satisfied?

56
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Father, please don't be angry.

57
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm sure Shu Qian
was just concerned about my safety.

58
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,520
Please don't punish him, Father.

59
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm returning to the palace.

60
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Why were you
so foolishly bold today?

61
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,440
You acted so recklessly.

62
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Do you want us to die together?

63
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Reckless?

64
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
If I didn't show up today,

65
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,280
the Crown Prince
wouldn't have let you off the hook.

66
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm a prince.

67
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:53,760
I wouldn't have been beheaded
on the spot.

68
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,599
If anything had gone wrong today,

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
you wouldn't be alive
to argue with me right now!

70
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,880
Luckily, I got there in time.

71
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise?

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
Otherwise, the beautiful lady
in this portrait...

73
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,000
would become Your Highness's wife.

74
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,879
If it's something precious to me,

75
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,800
I'll protect it with my life.

76
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
But he won't listen.

77
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,160
There's nothing I can do.

78
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,199
A true man stands between
heaven and earth.

79
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
His life and death
are determined by fate.

80
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,840
But Prince Shu He,

81
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,320
if the Crown Prince really traps you
in the depths of the palace,

82
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,040
will you still pay attention to me?

83
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,000
Will you still remember
that you have a good friend...

84
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,240
named Duan Zi Ang?

85
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,640
This blade has been
with me for seven years.

86
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,320
It has been stained
with blood 19 times.

87
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm gifting it to Your Highness now.

88
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
It will protect you for me...

89
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,880
and always ensure your safety.

90
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
I've never liked to practice
martial arts since I was little.

91
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,560
Aren't you afraid it'll hurt me?

92
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,440
Seeing the blade
will be like seeing me.

93
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,560
Even if we're separated
by mountains and rivers,

94
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,520
the blade will be here.

95
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Your Highness, think of me
whenever you're in danger.

96
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,720
No matter what danger you're in,

97
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm willing to stay by your side.

98
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,840
The Sixth Prince and Duan Zi Ang's
friendship is quite strong.

99
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,200
Why is Your Highness helping
South Kingdom's Sixth Prince?

100
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,040
The purpose of this intermarriage...

101
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,600
is to secretly control Xiao Shu He.

102
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,399
I didn't expect...

103
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,959
his relationship
with the Crown Prince...

104
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
to be so strained.

105
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,920
We can use this to our advantage.

106
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,280
What do you mean, Your Highness?

107
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,960
Xiao Shu He only cares about poetry.

108
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,440
It's useless for him
to rule the kingdom.

109
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,480
If he becomes the emperor one day,

110
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,680
it's advantageous to me.

111
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,000
The Ji North Kingdom
can rule he world.

112
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,520
(Confidential Letter)

113
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,720
Huo Ying is useless.

114
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,080
After that battle,

115
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,960
Your Highness is put
in a more difficult position now.

116
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,360
We had such
a good opportunity yesterday.

117
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
We could have killed
two birds with one stone.

118
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
Is Father really losing his senses?

119
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,080
He's even willing to submit
to the Ji North Kingdom.

120
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,160
His Majesty's health is weakening.

121
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,640
He has long changed.

122
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,559
Did the Red Shadow Guard...

123
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,640
not put the token in the study?

124
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,200
He doesn't want to die yet.

125
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
He wouldn't dare.

126
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Forget it.

127
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
The priority now is
to come up with a plan.

128
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Since the intermarriage was decreed,

129
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,440
the war hawk faction
has been complaining.

130
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,440
It's obvious that the North Kingdom
is up to no good now.

131
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,199
If Your Highness
takes this opportunity...

132
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
to win over the military generals,

133
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,600
even if His Majesty
doesn't want to fight,

134
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,400
the people's voices
can't be silenced.

135
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,920
However, what should we do
with the Sixth Prince?

136
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,280
When he returned
the zither string to me that day,

137
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
it was a clear sign of the end.

138
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,520
The South Hui Kingdom...

139
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,960
will not share its power.

140
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,880
If I may be so bold,

141
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,960
before the envoys
from the Ji North Kingdom leave,

142
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,079
why don't we ask His Majesty...

143
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,920
to confine the Sixth Prince
in the palace...

144
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,840
in the name
of His Majesty's protection?

145
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

146
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
How long have you been
by Xiao Shu He's side?

147
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Five years.

148
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,199
How long has it been...

149
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
since I saved your life
from the Shadow Guard Camp?

150
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Sixteen years.

151
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
It has been 17 years.

152
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Yes.

153
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,400
Counting this year, it's 17 years.

154
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Give me your hand.

155
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
This is the elixir pill recipe
that you wanted.

156
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,960
You don't have to come here anymore.

157
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,360
A loyal servant
wouldn't serve two masters.

158
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
I'll fulfill your wish.

159
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,800
Once you leave this palace today,

160
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,160
you have nothing more
to do with the Crown Prince's Manor.

161
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,320
Your Highness, please believe me.

162
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
I indeed hid the token...

163
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:56,800
in the secret compartment
of the study.

164
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
It's the truth.

165
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
But what happened?

166
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,960
I was incompetent.

167
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,600
Please punish me
as Your Highness wishes.

168
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,280
Your Highness gave me my life.

169
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,920
I shall live and die...

170
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,520
as Your Highness's servant.

171
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,040
Don't think I don't know
what's on your mind.

172
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I saved you...

173
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,400
because your martial arts skills
are quite useful,

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
so I reluctantly kept you
by my side as a hidden weapon.

175
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,760
Now, you're poisoned to the bone.

176
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,520
You even messed up
such a trivial task.

177
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,480
You're just a useless blade now.

178
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,720
Be clever and remember this.

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,640
There has never been a guard
named Huo Ying in my manor.

180
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,200
I, Xiao Shu Qian, know nothing
about any poison.

181
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,080
Naturally, I have no antidote.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

182
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Take your wishful thinking...

183
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
and find a quiet place
to kill yourself.

184
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
That way, you won't suffer
from the poison anymore.

185
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Take a good look at my face.

186
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
Given our 17 years
as master and servant,

187
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll allow you...

188
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
to think of my face before you die.

189
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Your Highness.

190
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,479
The palace has summoned
Your Highness....

191
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,760
to the palace immediately.

192
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,040
- All right. You may go.
- Yes.

193
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,960
Father summoned me so urgently.

194
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
It must be because...

195
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,240
of the Crown Prince's
search yesterday.

196
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
He didn't find any evidence.

197
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,840
Is he going to frame you
out of nothing?

198
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
The Crown Prince
of the Ji North Kingdom...

199
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,239
is cunning.

200
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,840
If the intermarriage fails,
he will cause trouble.

201
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
The court ministers
who favor peace...

202
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,520
Forget it. I'll do it myself.

203
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,040
Why don't you say you're sick?

204
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,440
I can't avoid it forever.

205
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Hide your whereabouts.

206
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,640
Don't leave the manor.

207
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Huo Ying.

208
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Huo Ying.

209
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
Are you all right?

210
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,120
Prince Shu He.

211
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,680
What a coincidence.

212
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,239
I've long heard
that you're a talented man.

213
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,479
It was chaotic yesterday.

214
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
It's such a shame...

215
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,680
that we didn't get
to know each other.

216
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Your Highness is flattering me.

217
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,560
What happened yesterday was
my brother's recklessness.

218
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry for scaring the Princess.

219
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,480
Please forgive us.

220
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
The Princess is fine.

221
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,439
But Your Highness seems to have
a close relationship...

222
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,120
with your guest.

223
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,880
Don't be joking, Your Highness.

224
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,360
If it weren't for my good friend,

225
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm afraid things
wouldn't have ended well yesterday.

226
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,880
The most poisonous snake
tends to be right by your side,

227
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,120
while the most dangerous blade
could be hidden in your sleeve.

228
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,880
Be careful, Your Highness.

229
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,680
Your Highness, this way, please.

230
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Eunuch.

231
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
Why did Father summon me here?

232
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Forgive me, Your Highness.

233
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,440
I'm just following orders.

234
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Lock the door.

235
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Eunuch.

236
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,800
Eunuch, what's the meaning of this?

237
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,360
It's His Majesty's decree.

238
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,119
The guest in Your Highness's manor
is still a mystery.

239
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,520
To prevent any more trouble
from the North Kingdom's envoys,

240
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
Your Highness
must rest here for now.

241
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Open the door.

242
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I want to see His Majesty.

243
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

244
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
Wait, Young Master Duan.

245
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,359
His Highness reminded me
repeatedly before he left...

246
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,920
to watch you carefully.

247
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,919
Your master hasn't returned
for a long time.

248
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Aren't you anxious?

249
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Think about it.

250
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,760
Isn't it safer for His Highness
to be in the palace than here?

251
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Forget it.

252
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,840
I'll do as His Highness says.

253
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,000
You haven't lost your touch.

254
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,480
(Confidential Letter)

255
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
A new mission?

256
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,800
(Xiao Shu He)

257
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,520
There was some misinformation.

258
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
The target has changed.

259
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Your mission is no longer to kill...

260
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:24,040
the Crown Prince
of the South Kingdom.

261
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,880
It's Xiao Shu He.

262
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
(Xiao Shu He)

263
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,839
Xiao Shu He is a scholar.

264
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
He has no interest in politics.

265
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,360
Killing him and letting
the Crown Prince take the throne...

266
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,040
won't be good
for the Ji North Kingdom.

267
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,360
That's not for you to think about.

268
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
There are many skilled
martial artists...

269
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
in Xiao Shu He's manor.

270
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm afraid I can't do it.

271
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,400
Is it that you can't do it...

272
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,160
or you don't want to do it?

273
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,600
Either kill him...

274
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,920
or drink this poisoned wine...

275
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,840
as an apology
to the Red Shadow Guards.

276
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,520
(Xiao Shu He)

277
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,760
Don't forget.

278
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
I taught you...

279
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,400
all your martial arts.

280
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Who is it?

281
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,559
Is it the Sixth Prince?

282
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,840
I've brought you food.

283
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
Leave it and go.

284
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I have orders from above...

285
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,840
to deliver it to you in person.

286
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,320
What are you doing?

287
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,440
Who are you?

288
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,000
How could you be so careless?

289
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
If you aren't here...

290
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
to play the zither to help me relax,

291
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,320
what will I do?

292
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,240
If the Red Shadow Guards
hadn't saved me back then,

293
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,600
I would have died
in the South Hui Kingdom.

294
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Today...

295
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,240
I'll return what I owe you.

296
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,440
According to the rules
of the Red Shadow Guards,

297
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,400
those who disobey will die.

298
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,840
The Crown Prince was merciful today.

299
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
The poison was replaced with water
to spare your life.

300
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But remember this.

301
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,520
You're still a member
of the Red Shadow Guards.

302
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,519
Monitor the Crown Prince
of the South Hui Kingdom....

303
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,240
for the next few days.

304
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
If there's anything unusual,

305
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,720
report it to me immediately.

306
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,240
I will accomplish
the Crown Prince's mission for me.

307
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,560
But as for the Sixth Prince's Manor
and Xiao Shu He...

308
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
I'll be protecting them.

309
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,720
How could the Crown Prince do this?

310
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,400
If Father's trusted aides
hadn't heard something unusual,

311
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,880
I wouldn't have escaped.

312
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,080
I knew this would happen...

313
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,319
when I promised Prime Minister Gu
to get involved...

314
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,200
in exchange for finding Huai Yi.

315
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,640
But considering that we're brothers,

316
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,320
I thought the Crown Prince
wouldn't be this cruel.

317
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Shen Song.

318
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,280
I want to send Zi Ang away.

319
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,360
Are you sure?

320
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Commander Chen.

321
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Commander Chen.

322
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,880
What do you think?

323
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,880
Duan Zi Ang has wavered.

324
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
We can't keep him.

325
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
You're too cruel.

326
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,440
Come to think of it,

327
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,520
Duan Zi Ang should be
like family to you.

328
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
It's the hardest to fool oneself.

329
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,480
He's indeed my brother.

330
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,040
He loves to do difficult things.

331
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Shu He.

332
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,480
Did the Crown Prince
give you a hard time?

333
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,320
I've been worried all day.

334
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
It's fine.

335
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,479
The Ji North Kingdom
envoys haven't left yet.

336
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Father summoned me
and the Crown Prince...

337
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
to discuss a plan.

338
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Have a seat.

339
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,000
I asked the kitchen
to prepare this meal.

340
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,160
Try it and see if you like it.

341
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,400
You've been
in my manor for a while now.

342
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
We still haven't heard
of Huai Yi's whereabouts.

343
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,000
We can't go on like this.

344
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,440
Why don't you stay
at White Cloud Temple...

345
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
and lay low for a while?

346
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Are you still worried about
what happened yesterday?

347
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,840
I promised you
I won't do anything rash again.

348
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
The Crown Prince is powerful.

349
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
The court is in turmoil.

350
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
With you by my side,
it's dangerous for me.

351
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,240
What did the Crown Prince
say to you?

352
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,360
Did he threaten you?

353
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Weren't you the one...

354
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,400
who planned our encounter
at White Cloud Temple?

355
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,040
- Shu He.
- I used to be a carefree prince.

356
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,440
You disturbed my peace.

357
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,600
I can't leave you in danger.

358
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Now...

359
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,600
The situation is too complicated.

360
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,000
I can still protect you for now
if I stay here.

361
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,000
Do I have to spell it out for you?

362
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
Having you by my side...

363
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,760
is the biggest danger to me.

364
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Look.

365
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,440
The tighter I hold it,

366
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
the deeper the wound.

367
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,400
What are you doing?

368
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,800
You don't have to do this
to force me to leave.

369
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,200
Don't pretend to be affectionate.

370
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,600
You approached me...

371
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,999
just to use me to get close
to the Crown Prince...

372
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and find your brother.

373
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,960
I'll be honest with you.

374
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,920
My feelings for you
are not real either.

375
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,920
When we met
at White Cloud Temple that day,

376
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,880
I was just using you
to control Gu Yuan Shan.

377
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,320
When the Crown Prince slaughtered
everyone in General Duan's Manor,

378
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,600
it was actually Gu Yuan Shan
pulling the strings.

379
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,720
I already knew about it,

380
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,720
but I didn't tell you.

381
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,160
You knew?

382
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,320
I knew all along.

383
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
I even used it as a trap.

384
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
What?

385
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,200
Only you're allowed to lie to me?

386
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,560
I can't lie to you?

387
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Duan Zi Ang.

388
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,160
You're a smart man.

389
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Take a guess.

390
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,200
When did I set up
the secret compartment in my study?

391
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
A self-portrait.

392
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
A memorial tablet.

393
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,920
All the clues you found
were set up by me.

394
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,680
Every single one of them...

395
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,400
was planned by me.

396
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
You lost.

397
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,000
I, Xiao Shu He,
am no different from others.

398
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,080
Let me tell you
how you're different.

399
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,760
Compared to others,

400
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,600
Xiao Shu He is terrible at lying.

401
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,160
Since you want to use me,

402
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,000
why are you still pushing me away?

403
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,200
Let me tell you.

404
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,760
I'm willing...

405
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,760
to be the scapegoat.

406
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,800
Did the Crown Prince do this?

407
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,399
These hands only
play the zither, paint,

408
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,440
and dance.

409
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,800
Even so, he still won't let you go?

410
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,200
Back then,
I couldn't protect Mother.

411
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Now, I can't protect myself.

412
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,440
I can't protect you either.

413
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Does it hurt?

414
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,720
I won't leave.

415
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
In this world,

416
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
I have nothing else
to care about anymore.

417
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,680
If I can't protect you
with my martial arts,

418
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,720
what do I need my skills for?

419
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,920
Shu He.

420
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,960
I know you're in pain.

421
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,520
You're just too cruel to yourself.

422
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,240
But if you achieve
the life you dream of,

423
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,600
will you invite me to your paradise?

424
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,760
From now on,

425
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,560
I'll stay by your side.

426
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,440
Is what I desire...

427
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,200
what you want too?

428
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,280
In this vast land,

429
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
only you are the freedom I want.

430
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Don't let me...

431
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,080
lose again.
