1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,360
(Crown Prince's Manor, South Hui Kingdom)

2
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,680
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,240
The crown prince has returned.

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,480
It's time for him to gloat.

5
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,040
Shu He, won't you go see him?

6
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,000
All the officials will want to congratulate him.

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I won't be missed.

8
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,640
You can take this opportunity...

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,440
to tell His Highness...

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,960
that you want to live in seclusion.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
(Shen Song, a guest at the Sixth Prince's Manor)

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,800
I'll wait a little longer.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,696
Although the crown prince came back victorious,

14
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,440
this battle has also depleted Father's years of hard work.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,560
Under such circumstances,

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,200
I really can't add to Father's worries right now.

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,920
Mountains and oceans will return someday.

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,760
And friends will meet again someday.

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Your Highness,

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,479
Prime Minister Gu invites you to his residence.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
(Huo Ying, Imperial Guard Commander of the Sixth Prince's Manor)

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,039
Prime Minister Gu is suspicious...

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,240
and cautious.

24
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Why would he want to see me at this time?

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
Prime Minister Gu knows how you feel,

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,801
but he constantly invites you to join the imperial court.

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
He's not a simple person.

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
I know what you're worried about.

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
Back when my mother was killed, why did I go missing?

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,040
Why was General Duan killed?

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Prime Minister Gu must have had a hand in it.

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
I won't let anyone hurt me again.

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Shu He.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,760
If I'm not back by 9pm,

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,679
please go to Prime Minister Gu's manor...

36
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
and check on the situation.

37
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
There's an assassin!

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Guards!

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
Protect His Highness!

40
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,759
Your Highness, the intruder was shot with an arrow.

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,240
He climbed over the wall and escaped.

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,080
Search the whole city.

43
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,640
Capture him alive.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
I want to see...

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,879
who dares to attack the manor of the crown prince of South Hui.

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
(Xiao Shu Qian, Crown Prince of South Hui Kingdom)

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Your Highness.

48
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Help me.

49
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Help me.

50
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,719
(Five years ago)

51
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,440
After you came from the Shadow Guard Camp,

52
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,799
you've never revealed yourself...

53
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,640
while standing guard in my chambers, have you?

54
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,919
I've been by Your Highness's side day and night.

55
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I haven't seen anyone.

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
You don't have to come starting tomorrow.

57
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
What have I done wrong?

58
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,000
Starting tomorrow,

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,079
I'll have Steward Liu arrange for you to stay...

60
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,200
at Sixth Prince's residence.

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
With your capability,

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,960
you should be able to win Shu He's favor.

63
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm at your service, Your Highness.

64
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,360
They all like him.

65
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,160
They like that he's smart.

66
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,279
They like that he's kind...

67
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,320
and do not vie or compete.

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,759
But now Father says I'm weak.

69
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,120
He's forcing me to fight with him.

70
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,600
Do you think my brother...

71
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,120
is really a loafer?

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,559
Or is he just lying low...

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
and pretending to be an ignorant child?

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Will you...

75
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,200
be like them...

76
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,680
and like him too?

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,240
I only have one master in this life.

78
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,920
That is you, Your Highness.

79
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
This medicine is called Blood Dove.

80
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
You must take a Rhino Horn Pill every month.

81
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Otherwise, the poison will take effect.

82
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
You'll wish you were dead.

83
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Good boy.

84
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
There is a thunderstorm tonight.

85
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Stand guard here.

86
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,720
After I infiltrate Sixth Prince's manor,

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,079
I'll come back...

88
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,840
to accompany Your Highness on stormy nights.

89
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
You are the only one I trust.

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
You must be loyal to me.

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Don't use your qi.

92
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
All right.

93
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Thank you,

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Crown Prince...

95
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,759
Catch the assassin! Come on. You two, go that way!

96
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,199
- Yes. - You two, go that way.

97
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,679
- Yes. - Hurry. Catch the assassin!

98
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,199
- Get more help! - Come on! Catch the assassin!

99
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,920
Who's there? There's someone.

100
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,640
Who is in there? Come out!

101
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
Take a good look...

102
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
at who I am.

103
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Your Highness.

104
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,656
It's not safe on the streets today.

105
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,160
You should go back to your residence.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
You may go.

107
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Let's go!

108
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
May I ask...

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Don't move.

110
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,760
May I ask what your name is?

111
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
They didn't look like imperial guards.

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,280
They looked like the crown prince's soldiers.

113
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,639
Why did you take the risk...

114
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,040
and provoke them?

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Your Highness, mind your own business.

116
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Don't talk too much.

117
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't force me.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,760
Are you looking for this?

119
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,760
With this jade token, you can leave the city.

120
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
Sixth Prince, do you want to help me...

121
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,240
or capture me at the city gate with this jade token?

122
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
I like to make friends.

123
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,079
Though you held me hostage,

124
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,400
you didn't hurt me at all.

125
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
It shows that you're not a bad person.

126
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,160
I'm willing to let you go.

127
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,760
I'll keep my promise.

128
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,320
Go.

129
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
Don't do evil deeds again.

130
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,400
Brother, save me!

131
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,920
Brother, save me!

132
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,600
This silhouette...

133
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,600
looks so familiar.

134
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,480
You failed tonight.

135
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,839
You should be sent back to the North Kingdom...

136
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
to be punished.

137
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
I was incompetent.

138
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

139
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,640
But it's a good opportunity.

140
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
You met the sixth prince.

141
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,720
Stay by Xiao Shu He's side.

142
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,000
You will get another chance to kill him.

143
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Are you sure he didn't recognize you tonight?

144
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm sure.

145
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,600
After all, the last time we met, we were just kids.

146
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,319
Don't cry. Are you hurt?

147
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,999
(Young Duan Zi Ang)

148
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,079
Don't be afraid. Have you heard of General Duan?

149
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,680
He's the most powerful man in South Hui.

150
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm his son.

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,280
I'm Duan Zi Ang.

152
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,040
I... I am Shu He.

153
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
It's just that...

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm not sure if he still remembers me.

155
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,919
(Gu Manor)

156
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,839
(Prime Minister Gu's residence, South Hui Kingdom)

157
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,480
Capturing assassins is the Imperial Guards' duty.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,720
If anyone encounters the assassin tonight,

159
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,480
you have the authority to execute on sight.

160
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
- Yes! - Yes!

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Prime Minister Gu.

162
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,359
It seems that you can freely mobilize...

163
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,336
the imperial guards under the crown prince's command.

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,680
Your authority is impressive.

165
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,959
Your Highness's manor...

166
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,400
is only a joss stick away from my manor.

167
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Your Highness, you took your time.

168
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,640
I ran into something on the way.

169
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,880
It's not peaceful at the crown prince's manor tonight.

170
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,280
A bold assassin disturbed His Highness.

171
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,120
Is Shu Qian all right?

172
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,440
His Highness is fine.

173
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,680
The assassin hasn't been caught yet.

174
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,080
Please return to your residence, Your Highness.

175
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,000
You are in charge of the capital's defense.

176
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm afraid you'll have a busy night.

177
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,800
It's my duty.

178
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,960
The crown prince is the foundation for our nation's stability.

179
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,600
Even if it's chaotic tonight,

180
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,520
Your Highness, there's no need to panic.

181
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm sure the assassin...

182
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,320
won't target Your Highness.

183
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,400
Men, escort His Highness back to his residence.

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
- Yes! - Yes!

185
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,560
Your Highness, please go back.

186
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,240
Who do you think was behind tonight's attack?

187
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
Your Highness,

188
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,879
I just met Huo Ying two hours ago.

189
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,679
There are no unusual changes at the Sixth Prince's manor.

190
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,200
I don't think it was Prince Shu He's doing.

191
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,920
Sixth Prince may be indifferent to worldly affairs,

192
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
but he's not a reckless person who doesn't know his place.

193
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Moreover, when the assassin attacked today,

194
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,200
Sixth Prince was with me.

195
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Is that so?

196
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,920
At such a late hour, what were you and Xiao Shu He doing?

197
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,759
He is still trying to ask me...

198
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,920
for a way to hide away in the martial arts world.

199
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
What's going on in the Prince of Qi's residence?

200
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,760
It has been taken care of.

201
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Your Highness, you can't do this sort of thing again.

202
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Prime Minister Gu, please go back.

203
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,520
It's so chaotic tonight.

204
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,320
I'll have to trouble you to deal with it.

205
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,880
Find two teams.

206
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,320
One team will keep an eye on Xiao Shu He.

207
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,440
The other team will follow Prime Minister Gu.

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,880
Every person that the sly old man meets with...

209
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,440
must be reported to me.

210
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Yes, Your Highness.

211
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Did you give him this month's Rhino Horn Pill yet?

212
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,920
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Forget it.

214
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
It's just this once.

215
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
Commander Huo can endure it.

216
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
If worse comes to worst,

217
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,920
Xiao Shu He's country bumpkin doctor...

218
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,720
can still keep him alive.

219
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
You're right, Your Highness.

220
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,160
I'll take my leave now.

221
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,440
Just this once.

222
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,200
This is the last time I will tolerate it.

223
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Yes.

224
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,520
Hasn't the Crown Prince given you the antidote?

225
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Why is it you?

226
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,120
The Blood Dove poison is peculiar.

227
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
It usually lies latent in the meridians.

228
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,760
But if you stop taking the Rhino Horn Pill,

229
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,480
it will cause you pain and suffering,

230
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
like ants in your bones.

231
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,960
The crown prince used this to control you.

232
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
How vicious of him.

233
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,720
Before I took the Blood Dove,

234
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,600
His Highness informed me of its effects.

235
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,080
I was the one who chose it.

236
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
How is he vicious?

237
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Right.

238
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,176
If you don't take it, you would be executed immediately.

239
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,440
If you take it, you would be controlled by him for life.

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Is that called a choice?

241
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,040
I did it willingly.

242
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,560
Don't get upset.

243
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Don't think you can do anything to me...

244
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,161
just because you have something on me.

245
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,200
You can tell Sixth Prince...

246
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,640
that I'm a spy sent by the crown prince.

247
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,319
I never asked you to keep it a secret for me.

248
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,359
Fine.

249
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,400
If you don't listen to me,

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,480
I'll tell Shu He everything.

251
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,440
Don't think that you will still have a chance...

252
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,120
to serve the crown prince then.

253
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Lie down and rest.

254
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,599
Take the medicine...

255
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
so that you can live to see your heartless master.

256
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,520
It has been 10 years.

257
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,839
Back then, the Duan family was hit with an unexpected crisis.

258
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,640
If the Red Shadow Guards hadn't taken you in,

259
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,520
you wouldn't have survived.

260
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,760
So you have to remember your mission.

261
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,359
It was the crown prince who led the Imperial Guards...

262
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
to persecute your whole family.

263
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,040
Killing the crown prince...

264
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
is also a way to appease your father's spirit.

265
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,600
Your shoulder hasn't fully recovered.

266
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,160
To avoid Xiao Shu He's suspicion,

267
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
I'll arrange for someone to fake an assassination.

268
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,176
When you sacrifice yourself to save him,

269
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
Xiao Shu He will surely trust you.

270
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
What if this plan doesn't work?

271
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
You can go to this mill for help.

272
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,560
We have news about your brother.

273
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,720
I'll do my best.

274
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
Rest assured, Consul Wang.

275
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,360
If necessary, you can get rid of Xiao Shu He.

276
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Abbot,

277
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:00,679
you and Father are old friends.

278
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,719
(White Cloud Temple, South Hui Kingdom)

279
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,999
I sincerely came here this time to seek a good plan...

280
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,360
to distance myself from the disputes in the imperial court.

281
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,760
How can you bear to let me down again and again?

282
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,160
Your Highness, you should understand.

283
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
No matter where you go,

284
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,680
you can't avoid worldly affairs.

285
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,480
The wind moves the sails,

286
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
but it's neither the wind nor the sails.

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
It's Your Highness's heart that moves.

288
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,519
You're afraid that history will repeat itself...

289
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,840
if you meddle in state affairs.

290
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,960
Your Highness, you're a smart person.

291
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
There are some things that I can't speak candidly about.

292
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,280
Since you think I'm smart,

293
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,840
why are you playing dumb?

294
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,616
After nefarious monks caused chaos in the previous dynasty,

295
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,720
all the temples in South Hui were suppressed.

296
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,959
All these years, White Cloud Temple has prospered...

297
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
over other temples.

298
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
It couldn't have been possible without my support.

299
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
Abbot, do you really think...

300
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,160
that I did this without any risk?

301
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,599
If the imperial court were to find out...

302
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,240
about the true source of White Cloud Temple's funding...

303
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But next time,

304
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm sure you will have come up with a solution for me.

305
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
Abbot, there's a visitor outside who insists on seeing you.

306
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,680
He's really...

307
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,800
Your Highness,

308
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,920
I understand.

309
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,320
Abbot, I'm the one who wants to see you.

310
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
Who are you?

311
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
I'm looking for my long-lost brother, Huai Yi.

312
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,599
Stay by Xiao Shu He's side.

313
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,320
You will get another chance to kill him.

314
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,639
He was adopted by a Buddhist temple...

315
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,200
around the 15th year of the Great Xiao.

316
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,560
Abbot, do you remember?

317
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Huai Yi?

318
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
Sixth Prince, do you want to help me?

319
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,680
May I know your surname?

320
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
My brother changed his surname after he left.

321
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,960
I don't know his current surname.

322
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't think he is in our temple.

323
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,880
You can inquire in the south.

324
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,240
Wait.

325
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,760
May I know your name?

326
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,840
I've never seen you before, sir.

327
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Please excuse me.

328
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm Xiao Shu He.

329
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
Do you recognize me?

330
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,880
To avoid Xiao Shu He's suspicion,

331
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll arrange for someone to fake an assassination.

332
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Watch out!

333
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Are you badly injured?

334
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
It's him?

335
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,279
He escaped from the manhunt just last night.

336
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,160
Now he has shown up here on purpose.

337
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,440
Would there be such a coincidence?

338
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
I'm fine.

339
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
It's just a minor injury.

340
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,360
May I ask if your surname is Duan?

341
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,080
It seems like he does remember our childhood friendship.

342
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,720
It's fine. Don't worry.

343
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,120
- I don't think the wound is deep. - Don't move.

344
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,360
I have a physician at my manor. We will be there soon.

345
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,320
I didn't expect to see you again in this life.

346
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,160
I did not expect to see you again...

347
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,280
in my hometown.

348
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Zi Ang.

349
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Why is it that every time I see you,

350
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
you save my life?

351
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,760
Where have you been all these years?

352
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,800
When I returned to the courtyard and didn't see you that day,

353
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
I actually thought you were already...

354
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,240
The steward later told me about Huai Yi's whereabouts.

355
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,440
But he didn't mention you.

356
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,560
Huo Ying, faster!

357
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,559
(Sixth Prince's Manor, South Hui Kingdom)

358
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,840
(Sixth Prince's Manor)

359
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,240
"Sixth Prince's Manor"? Shu He, you are...

360
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,056
I'll tell you more after your wound is treated.

361
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
Your Highness, forgive me.

362
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,120
Inform Shen Song at once. Tell him that I'm injured.

363
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
You do it.

364
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Bear with it.

365
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:31,600
Shen Song's father is a famous physician.

366
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,320
He's better than the imperial physicians.

367
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,360
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

368
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,560
My name is Shen Song. I'm a year younger than you.

369
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
No need to be so formal.

370
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,519
I've heard a lot about you from His Highness.

371
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,640
Now that I've met you,

372
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
you're indeed elegant and dashing.

373
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,439
Ignore him. He followed his father around the world when he was young.

374
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
He developed a frivolous attitude.

375
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,680
He is a smooth talker.

376
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,679
Zi Ang, have a good rest.

377
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
Let Huo Ying know if you need anything.

378
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,239
Zi Ang, you've lost too much blood.

379
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
Let me check your pulse again.

380
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,599
It's just a minor injury.

381
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,880
You don't have to be so serious.

382
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,200
Zi Ang, have a good rest.

383
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Shen Song and I have matters to discuss.

384
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,999
If you're interested in chatting tonight,

385
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,040
I'll come again.

386
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Goodbye.

387
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,999
General Chen,

388
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,320
Duan Zi Ang has infiltrated South Hui as planned.

389
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
I see.

390
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,320
You're the most experienced consul of the Red Shadow Guards.

391
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,760
This time, we need you to personally assist Duan Zi Ang.

392
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,320
Make sure the plan goes smoothly.

393
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
More importantly, make sure Duan Zi Ang is safe.

394
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,160
After this mission,

395
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,559
Duan Zi Ang...

396
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,400
will be the next leader of the Red Shadow Guards.

397
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,840
Don't make any mistakes.

398
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes.

399
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
It was too easy.

400
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
All these years,

401
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,680
we haven't found a single person from Duan Manor.

402
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,560
Now, the one who came to our doorstep...

403
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,200
is General Duan's orphan.

404
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
We have General Duan's handwritten letter...

405
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,080
and a witness from back then.

406
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,440
Prime Minister Gu is going to be nervous this time.

407
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,760
Does Your Highness plan to use this to threaten Prime Minister Gu?

408
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,216
Prime Minister Gu has been a minister for two dynasties.

409
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,736
Whether we can take him down or not...

410
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,479
doesn't depend on whether we have evidence...

411
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
to prove his guilt.

412
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Then...

413
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,760
It only depends on...

414
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,799
whether Father wants to use Prime Minister Gu...

415
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,080
to assist the crown prince...

416
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,080
to balance the court.

417
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,039
Prime Minister Gu and General Duan didn't get along back then.

418
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,160
Everyone knows that.

419
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,240
When General Duan set out to war,

420
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,119
His Majesty ordered...

421
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,960
General Duan's entire family to be executed...

422
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
for the crime of colluding with the enemy.

423
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,879
He didn't even summon General Duan...

424
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,480
to give him a chance to defend himself.

425
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,240
Because of this,

426
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,119
people have long suspected Prime Minister Gu...

427
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,200
of deceiving the emperor.

428
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,480
But they fear his power.

429
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,040
Having this person...

430
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,360
is enough to put fear in Prime Minister Gu.

431
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,440
It's just that...

432
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,960
Your Highness is worried about Duan Zi Ang.

433
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,640
He saved my life after all.

434
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,120
Yet, I mean to use him and hurt him.

435
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,640
I want to be idle and carefree.

436
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,320
I don't want to become that kind of person.

437
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,680
Your Highness, don't be too hard on yourself.

438
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
There is one more thing.

439
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,319
I suspect that Duan Zi Ang...

440
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,559
is the assassin...

441
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,520
that the crown prince was searching for that day.

442
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,920
The way he saved me from the assassination today...

443
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,920
was the same way he held me hostage that day.

444
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,079
I'm afraid Duan Zi Ang returned...

445
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
with an ulterior motive.

446
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Revenge?

447
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,240
Back then, it was the crown prince who led the raid on Duan Manor.

448
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,519
General Duan's Imperial Guard token...

449
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,160
was also passed on to Shu Qian by Father.

450
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
If this is the case,

451
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
everything makes sense.

452
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,560
As long as Duan Zi Ang doesn't escape our control,

453
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,320
we can naturally guide his actions.

454
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,720
Then you can seduce him with your affections...

455
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,720
to achieve our goal.

456
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,840
You can tell him the truth later. What do you think?

457
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,120
I've planted those secret letters.

458
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,200
I've also completed the imitation that Your Highness asked me to make.

459
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm curious what Zi Ang's reaction will be.

460
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
You've lost.

461
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,360
You're really good at bullying people.

462
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,800
There's only one thing left to do.

463
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,640
He has to expose Prime Minister Gu...

464
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,480
on his own.

465
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,719
After General Duan's household was disbanded,

466
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
where did you go?

467
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,680
I've been looking for you all these years.

468
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,080
But it was as if you had disappeared from South Hui.

469
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
I never left South Hui.

470
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,640
It's just that I couldn't reveal my identity all these years.

471
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,120
If we hadn't met by chance today,

472
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,576
I'm afraid we wouldn't have had the chance to meet again.

473
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,400
All these years, I've tried to find out...

474
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,480
why General Duan was demoted.

475
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
It's all in the past.

476
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,520
We were still young back then.

477
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,256
I didn't mean to leave without saying goodbye.

478
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,959
- It wasn't Your Highness's fault. - Father sent someone to find me.

479
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,479
I didn't get the slightest chance.

480
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Your Highness.

481
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
I don't want to talk about the past.

482
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,520
I haven't had a hard time all these years.

483
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
I haven't seen you in years.

484
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,040
I just wanted to ask you.

485
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,399
All these years out in the world,

486
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,479
did you suffer?

487
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,880
Did you have anyone to protect you?

488
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,360
I'm sorry for overstepping.

489
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,720
I reminded you of something sad.

490
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
After that day,

491
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,840
I was adopted by a salt merchant.

492
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,680
My godfather sells salt at the border of South Hui.

493
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,480
Godfather has no children.

494
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,696
He treats me like his own child.

495
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,680
He hopes that I can inherit his business one day.

496
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,360
I don't want to hurt his feelings by bringing up the past.

497
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
However,

498
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,440
I never thought that Your Highness would be the sixth prince.

499
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,200
I see you as my best friend.

500
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,240
I can be honest with you.

501
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,880
I've hated being the sixth prince since I was young.

502
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,520
If it weren't for this identity,

503
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,080
my mother wouldn't have been killed that day.

504
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
My life wouldn't have been endangered either.

505
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,560
Fortunately, I met you.

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,040
I will never forget your kindness.

507
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,480
Your Highness, you are exaggerating.

508
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,640
I never thought about receiving anything in return.

509
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
But right now,

510
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,040
I do have a favor to ask.

511
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,439
There is no need for this.

512
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,560
Just tell me what it is. I'll do my best to help you.

513
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,320
I only have a few months for this trip.

514
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,600
If I can't find Huai Yi, I'm afraid...

515
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm afraid I won't have another chance.

516
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,160
You care so much about your brother.

517
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll do my best to help you.

518
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,400
I think I haven't seen Huai Yi for years either.

519
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,120
The last time I saw him, he didn't know how to ride a horse.

520
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

521
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Come to think of it,

522
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
rather than searching fruitlessly on my own,

523
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,200
I could benefit from Your Highness's help.

524
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,280
I am here today...

525
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
because you saved me when I was a child.

526
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
You saved my life.

527
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,280
Don't address me so formally anymore.

528
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Just call me Shu He.

529
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,360
We've helped each other.

530
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,959
I'm sure...

531
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,840
we'll both get what we want.
