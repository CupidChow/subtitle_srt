1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,760
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Go!

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,679
I'm escorting
the South Hui emperor's bodyguard.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,440
He's a difficult fellow.
He kept trying to escape.

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
He slowed me down.

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
He's a talker.

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,040
It's annoying. Let me in quickly.

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,040
Get up. Let's go!

9
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,480
Sir, what is going on?

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,920
Today is the day you are executed.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,799
Wait!

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,079
He only changed
an unimportant detail in the manor.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,240
Why do you have
to punish him so severely?

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,039
Disobeying His Majesty's order...

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,119
is punishable by death!

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,919
- Punishable by death?
- Don't argue with him.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Just drag him away!

18
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,959
He changed
the layout of the residence...

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,839
to improve the feng shui
of the imperial family's residence.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,999
Did Duan Zi Ang
actually sentence him to death?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,759
How dare the lowly ruler
of South Hui...

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,839
speak His Majesty's name?

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
He's killing innocents.
He's not fit to be the emperor!

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,919
Don't touch me.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Let go of me!

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
How dare you run your mouth?

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,080
That's for talking!

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,200
Serves you right for yapping!

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Big Brother.

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
You're recovering well.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
You woke up...

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,480
two hours earlier than I expected.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
How do you feel now?

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
I'm fine now.

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,960
But I heard
Shu He's shrill scream just now.

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
It woke me up from my dream.

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Scream?

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,520
We've been standing guard here.

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Except for the sound of the wind,

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
there was no other sound.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
The dungeon is far from the palace.

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,520
You must have had a nightmare.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,760
Maybe it was a dream.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,040
But that scream...

45
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
I've never seen him like that.

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,800
Thank you for saving my life
yesterday, Shen Song.

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
You were lucky.

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,000
I abide by medical ethics.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,920
Heaven knows
how much I wanted to poison you...

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,559
and fulfill my selfish wish.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
You...

52
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,880
Ji North razed South Hui
to the ground.

53
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I can understand
your wish for revenge.

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,880
But Ji North has never
massacred South Hui's people.

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,480
We also tried to capture
the South Hui soldiers alive.

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,879
South Hui has been
in a drought for years.

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,439
I've provided food for them.

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,920
I've saved countless lives.

59
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
But you don't
appreciate my kindness.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,560
You still want to kill me.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,560
I really don't understand.

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
To me,

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
the kingdom is too big.

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,040
The only thing I care about...

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,280
is the one
who loves you wholeheartedly.

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
This Longjing tea is from South Hui.

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
It's his favorite.

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Since he is in your heart,

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
why did you hurt him?

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Hurt him?

71
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,840
My brother's illness...

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,480
was from protecting
the very person you mentioned.

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Why do you say so?

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,440
What I did,

75
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,440
killing the emperor and my father,

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,800
were all choices
that I was willing to bear.

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
I'll take you...

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,360
to meet someone.

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Your Majesty.

81
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Huo Ying?

82
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Why are you here?

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
Why did you bring me here?

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,840
What are you trying to sell me?

85
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,760
Go forward and ask.

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

87
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,240
We want to see the commander
of the South Hui Imperial Guards.

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,960
His name is Huo Ying.

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
What's the matter?

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Where is he?

92
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:35,719
Your Majesty,

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Huo Ying was knocked out yesterday
and brought here.

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
He spouted nonsense
as soon as he woke up.

95
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,760
We put a gag on him.

96
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Bring him here.

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,400
Your Majesty, I deserve to die.

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
Hurry. Back to the palace!

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Huo Ying, get out of here.

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
It's too late for me.

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Do you know...

102
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,720
where our South Hui soldiers are?

103
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,759
They are all imprisoned
in prison camps.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
They are not in danger for now.

105
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,679
Your Majesty,

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,400
the rest of South Hui
has gathered their forces.

107
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
They are discussing how to save you.

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,920
You must protect yourself.

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Your Majesty.

110
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Open the door.

111
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,960
Who did this?

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Who did this?

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Zi Ang.

114
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Shu He.

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
It's me.

116
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
The dungeon is cold and damp.

117
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
If he stays here,

118
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,720
his wounds won't heal.

119
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,800
Let's go back to the palace.

120
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,080
You're familiar with his condition.

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
Return with me
to my chambers and treat him.

122
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,960
(The Emperor's Quarters,
Ji North Kingdom)

123
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,760
Let him rest.

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,560
I just gave him some medication
to relieve the pain.

125
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,040
It might make him delirious.

126
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,880
It's best to have someone
keep an eye on him.

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,560
I'll do it myself.

128
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,680
There are too many people
in the palace who want him dead.

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,680
I'll get going then.

130
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
If you learn where Huo Ying is,

131
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
please let me know immediately.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
Go.

133
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,800
Go.

134
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,680
If I had to choose again,

135
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
I wouldn't have left.

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
You love the one who hates you,

137
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,520
and you hate the one who loves you!

138
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,200
Aren't you both?

139
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Don't move.

140
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,040
Where did you get the dagger?

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,479
You have a habit of hiding a blade
under your pillow.

142
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,960
That hasn't changed.

143
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
How come I didn't know
you knew how to tie people up?

144
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,600
After I left,

145
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,680
someone taught you something new.

146
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Don't try to flatter me.

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,840
Release the prisoners from the camp.

148
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Sure.

149
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,640
But you have to stay.

150
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,280
You're in no position to negotiate.

151
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,960
Next time,
tie the ropes more tightly.

152
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,920
A softhearted person can't
sit on the throne.

153
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,880
For example, just now,

154
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,640
you could have stabbed me,

155
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,960
but you didn't dare to press harder.

156
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,160
If it weren't for you,

157
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,320
I wouldn't have been on the throne.

158
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
If it weren't for you,

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
I wouldn't have ended up...

160
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,520
as a fallen emperor.

161
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Today is...

162
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,400
the death anniversary
of Father and Shu Qian.

163
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,200
Why are you here?

164
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,799
Duan Zi Ang knows you escaped
from the prison camp.

165
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
That doesn't matter.

166
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,079
What's important now is
to find a chance...

167
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,520
to get you and His Majesty
out of here.

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,200
Duan Zi Ang won't harm Shu He.

169
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
You, on the other hand,

170
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,480
always put yourself in danger.

171
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,800
You must be more careful.

172
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll find a chance
to sneak into the manor.

173
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
We'll plan further then.

174
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
All right.

175
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Go on.

176
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Shu Qian,

177
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,760
if you were still alive,

178
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,879
Duan Ziang's valiant cavalry...

179
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
wouldn't have dared to set foot
in the South Hui Kingdom.

180
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm useless.

181
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,280
I've let you and Father down.

182
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Shu Qian,

183
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,040
I should be the one who is dead.

184
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
The emperor of Ji North...

185
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:50,360
pays respects
to the former ruler of South Hui.

186
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
If word gets out,

187
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,280
you won't be able to sit
on the throne anymore.

188
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,200
Between us,

189
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,880
there are too many things
we can't control.

190
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,720
But no matter
how chaotic the world is,

191
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Shu He,

192
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,880
I am still Duan Zi Ang.

193
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,560
But at this moment,

194
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,560
things are no longer the same.

195
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,400
As long as you follow your heart,

196
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,440
it doesn't matter
if it's a lie or not.

197
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
Shu He,

198
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,240
I still feel that way.

199
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
Heart?

200
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,040
But my heart...

201
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
was once right here.

202
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,760
Now that I think about it,

203
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,440
it was like a prophecy.

204
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,600
My kingdom and family
have been destroyed.

205
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,280
I haven't let go of my hatred
for a single day.

206
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
But there is no one...

207
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,560
I can be honest with.

208
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,760
If I weren't
the emperor of Ji North,

209
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
would you still think that way?

210
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,519
I wanted too much.

211
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,640
I can give you
whatever you want now.

212
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,560
Then release
the South Hui prisoners of war.

213
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you know that during the few days
I was in the dungeon,

214
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,200
I was too cold to sleep every night?

215
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
Do you know what I was thinking?

216
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,520
I've already ordered the guards
to be punished.

217
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,560
They're in prison.

218
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,839
Only the thought
of something they care about...

219
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,960
can help them through this.

220
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
It's South Hui.

221
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,520
It's their home.

222
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,120
As for me,

223
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,200
I have nothing left.

224
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Zi Ang,

225
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,120
it hurts so much.

226
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,200
I'll get Shen Song.

227
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,920
He can't cure me.

228
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,120
Come with me to court tomorrow.

229
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,920
Your Majesty,
you released the tiger.

230
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,520
You released the prisoners of war
for no reason.

231
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,480
I really don't understand.

232
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
Attack the state
but love the people.

233
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,760
It was fine to attack.

234
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
But if we don't let them go,

235
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,600
that will only breed resentment.

236
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,240
- Your Majesty!
- I've made up my mind.

237
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,559
Your Majesty,

238
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,960
there's something I don't know.

239
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,040
He is a prisoner of war.

240
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,760
How dare he listen in
on state affairs?

241
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,799
Your Majesty works hard
for the people...

242
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,880
and rules the state well.

243
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,200
It is a blessing
for the people of Ji North.

244
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,000
But if Your Majesty insists
on doing things your own way...

245
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,399
and is bewitched by outsiders,

246
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
to do harm to our kingdom,

247
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,879
with all due respect,

248
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,400
even if I am beheaded today,

249
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,440
we firmly oppose it.

250
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,000
- Your Majesty, please reconsider!
- Your Majesty, please reconsider!

251
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,200
If you let the prisoners go,

252
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,040
I'll give you the information...

253
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
on South Hui's salt mines.

254
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
If we confiscate the salt mines,

255
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,120
they can be used to fund the army...

256
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,560
and fill our coffers for years.

257
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
In that case,

258
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,280
are you still against it?

259
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,520
Why didn't you say anything
in court just now?

260
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,400
Actually, I agree
with General Liu and the others.

261
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,479
I just didn't want to oppose you
in front of everyone.

262
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,560
I'm going to release
the prisoners no matter what!

263
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,640
You have to be on my side.

264
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
I heard...

265
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,840
that Shu He was
in your chambers last night.

266
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
He's sick.

267
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,720
Regarding the release
of the prisoners,

268
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,000
if you need me,

269
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,840
I'll be there.

270
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,560
Last night, he didn't
do anything to you, did he?

271
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
Huo Ying gave me
a secret letter just now.

272
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,640
He said that if you can get
to the south city gate...

273
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,400
on the day of the Lantern Festival,

274
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
he will have a way to get you out.

275
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,640
But now,

276
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,840
I can't even step out of this manor.

277
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,400
Two days ago,
Duan Zi Ang suddenly fell ill.

278
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
I went to treat him.

279
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,320
I talked to him for a while.

280
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
He doesn't mean you any harm.

281
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,719
Try to gain his trust...

282
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,080
so that you can get
to the city gate.

283
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
Why don't you pretend
to get close to him?

284
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,720
He destroyed my kingdom
and imprisoned me just to have me.

285
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
My lords,

286
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
there's a message from the palace.

287
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,479
His Majesty has issued
an imperial decree.

288
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
The South Hui prisoners will be
gradually released starting today.

289
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,199
On the Lantern Festival,

290
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,520
the prisoners must be reunited
with their families.

291
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
If it means I can escape,

292
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,320
it wouldn't be difficult
to do these things.

293
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,120
It's just that only sincere feelings
will be met with a genuine heart.

294
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
Don't let yourself be trapped...

295
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,480
just to earn this trust.

296
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,880
He's willing to release
the South Hui soldiers.

297
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,600
That means he still has you
in his heart.

298
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,000
If you want to exploit this trust,

299
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,640
you can only
rely on your friendship.

300
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,880
If you really can't let go,

301
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,400
then think about how he treated you
after the kingdom collapsed...

302
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,400
and the situation that
the people of South Hui are in now.

303
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,000
This medicine is good
for your wound too.

304
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,480
If you want,

305
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,360
you can be with him.

306
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
I'll leave
after I deliver the medicine.

307
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Shu He,

308
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,200
if you don't leave Ji North,

309
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,080
he'll hurt you even more.

310
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Zi Ang.

311
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,720
I brought you some clothes.

312
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,720
Why are you here?

313
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,640
I heard that you released
the South Hui soldiers.

314
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,120
I'm here to thank you.

315
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,720
You sure picked a good time.

316
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,640
Shen Song prepared some herbs.

317
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,120
He said they can nourish
your qi and blood.

318
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
He asked me to deliver them.

319
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Is this medicine...

320
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
nourishing...

321
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
or poisonous?

322
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,880
It can be applied to heal wounds...

323
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,520
or smelled to calm the mind.

324
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
If you don't believe me,

325
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,960
I can test it on myself.

326
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,000
Let me help you undress.

327
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,920
Are you not going
to make a fuss today?

328
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
You fulfilled my wish.

329
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,920
I'm here to apologize to you.

330
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Sometimes, I really don't get it.

331
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,360
What exactly do you want?

332
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,880
I know I'm not a hero.

333
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,880
But I will save...

334
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,480
as many citizens
of South Hui as I can.

335
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,920
Why do I need to be waited on
just to take a bath?

336
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,360
That's so strange.

337
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
It's a normal thing.

338
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,640
What's so strange about it?

339
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
Your wound is open.

340
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,440
Back then, you had many injuries.

341
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,680
Now,

342
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,800
why is it even worse?

343
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
It's not that I don't want
to treat it.

344
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,920
It's that there is no cure.

345
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Why is that?

346
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
What did you say that day...

347
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
to make the guards
to treat you that way?

348
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,000
I said I was the only one to blame
for the new manor.

349
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
If anyone should be punished,

350
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm the only one
who should be punished.

351
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,040
Everything that I thought
was good for you...

352
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
turned out...

353
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,280
to be a sharp knife that stabs you.

354
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
If I wasn't...

355
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,320
the sixth prince of South Hui...

356
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,480
and you weren't
a Red Shadow Guard of Ji North,

357
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,680
would we...

358
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,560
still have ended up here today?

359
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,960
I'm sure of it.

360
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,840
I didn't answer you that day...

361
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,279
because I didn't want...

362
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,080
to hide my only truth in lies.

363
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,560
It's in the past.

364
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,960
Is it really in the past?

365
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,560
You're the emperor now.

366
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,320
You can't leave the palace.

367
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,200
But I can see you every day.

368
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,120
That is enough for me.

369
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,040
I asked you to deliver medicine
to the bathhouse.

370
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
Why did it turn out
to be a cause for joy and sorrow?

371
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,840
I haven't said anything yet.

372
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,880
How do you know
it was a cause for joy and sorrow?

373
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Joy,

374
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,800
because there is
finally music in Ji North.

375
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Sorrow,

376
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,840
because the melody is woeful.

377
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,240
It's out of tune.

378
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
In the end, I couldn't tell...

379
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,400
if I was lying to him...

380
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,360
or to myself.
