00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,960
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,560
I asked you to deliver medicine
to the bathhouse.

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,840
How did you end up
with both joy and sorrow?

4
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,080
I have yet to say anything.

5
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
How do you know
it is joy and sorrow?

6
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
The joy...

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,040
is that the Ji North Kingdom
finally has zither music again.

8
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
The sorrow...

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,960
is that the zither sounds mournful,

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
and the melody is out of tune.

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,600
In the end, I could not even tell...

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,760
if I was lying to him...

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,840
or to myself.

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
The Lantern Festival
is in four days.

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,600
You must not let
anything slip again.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,760
Duan Zi Ang has
to trust you completely.

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,440
Only then will he lower his guard...

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,680
and give Huo Ying and the rest
a chance to strike.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
During this period of time,

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,360
we cannot have any mishaps.

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
That is exactly what worries me.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
You are worried...

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
you cannot guard your own heart.

24
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,800
A ruler of a fallen kingdom...

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,400
still holds in his heart the liar
who once invaded his land.

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,560
I am so despicable.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,200
But right from the start,

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,840
you never wanted this position.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
No matter what,

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,720
the South Hui Kingdom
must not be ruined at my hands.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
Since the realm
has just changed hands,

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,720
it should not be hard to recruit
soldiers loyal to the old dynasty.

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
What are you trying...

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,479
I, Xiao Shu He, am one
with the South Hui Kingdom.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Its ruin is my ruin.

36
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,760
I am not a good emperor,

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,560
but at least I am a South Hui man
with pride and spine.

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,880
How can love...

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,200
outweigh the burden of the kingdom?

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
You want to restore the kingdom?

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
Only by thinking this way...

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
can I force myself to live on.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,160
I am really not used
to you being like this.

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
A few days ago...

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
was the anniversary
of Shu Qian's death.

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,640
In the entire year,

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,080
only during the Lantern Festival...

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,360
is there no curfew
in South Hui's capital.

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,200
Once when I was little,

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,680
Shu Qian disguised us
as commoners to stroll the streets.

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,120
Now that the South Hui Kingdom
is gone,

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
that moment, that scene...

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
has become a thing of the past.

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,200
I can no longer see it.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,200
There is no curfew anymore.

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,679
The custom of
the Lantern Festival night market...

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
has also been preserved.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Tightrope walking,
stilt performances,

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,640
and music troupes with drums
make for a lively scene.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Do you wish to go and see?

61
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I do.

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
But according to the customs
of the Ji North Kingdom,

63
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,160
the one you go out with...

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
during the Lantern Festival is...

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,320
It is always...

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
with the one you love.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,080
I want to go with you.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Shu He,

69
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,160
I will get someone right now.

70
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
You promised me.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
From dawn to dusk,

72
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,360
through all the seasons,

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
you will always stay by my side.

74
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,320
It is getting late.

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
Tonight,

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,320
rest in my chamber.

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,560
When you released
the prisoners of war,

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,320
were they still causing trouble?

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
No.

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,480
No one dares to cause trouble.

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,880
We did as you said.

82
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,320
Before they left,
we even gave them some relief food.

83
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,640
Surely by now...

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,440
they have already reunited
with their families.

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Good.

86
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,240
This is
the first Lantern Festival...

87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
after you have pacified the realm.

88
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,800
There are many remnants
of the former dynasty in the city.

89
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,000
I have ordered the first battalion
to strengthen surveillance...

90
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,120
and the second battalion
to guard all city gates.

91
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
I guarantee no one
will cause trouble.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Huai Yi.

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,080
I wish to take a stroll...

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,480
with Shu He
during the Lantern Festival.

95
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Zi Ang.

96
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
You must not let feelings
for one person...

97
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
affect the affairs of the state.

98
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
Do you feel the same way too?

99
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,880
As long as you are happy,

100
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,240
I am willing to do anything.

101
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
A few qing of humble fields to till,

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
a few ladles of grain by day,

103
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,320
and a bed of six chi at night.

104
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,640
That was all...

105
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Shu He and I ever desired.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
But throughout history,

107
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,200
if an emperor gave his heart
to true love,

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
even if he ended well,

109
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,560
he mostly lived in melancholy.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
That is why I no longer wish
to be this emperor.

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,320
I want to pass the throne...

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,920
to you.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Does that mean
I cannot see you anymore?

114
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,920
When the realm is at peace...

115
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
and the people live in safety,

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,640
then I shall know
you are safe as well.

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Though the realm is settled,

118
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
the people's hearts remain unsteady.

119
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
At this time...

120
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,880
I do not have much time left.

121
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,880
I want to leave it to Shu He.

122
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,800
You wish above all to see me happy.

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Do you not?

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Yes.

125
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,680
How did it go?

126
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Most of South Hui's former troops...

127
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,760
are still held in the prisoner camp.

128
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,560
However, I have secretly gathered
some loyal warriors who escaped.

129
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,880
As long as we get to the canal,

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,680
Your Majesty will be safe.

131
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Very well.

132
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,440
Then what should we do
when the time comes?

133
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,479
Before entering the night market,

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,120
Your Majesty will pass
by a clay figurine shop.

135
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,560
In the time Duan Zi Ang
spends buying clay figurines,

136
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,000
we can take Your Majesty away.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Good.

138
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Huo Ying.

139
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
Promise me one thing.

140
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Please tell me, Your Majesty.

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Do not...

142
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Do not hurt...

143
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Duan Zi Ang.

144
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,400
I also have a favor to ask of you,
Your Majesty.

146
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
What is it?

147
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
The men I have gathered are loyal
to the South Hui Kingdom.

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,320
Tomorrow, please do not hesitate.

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
Otherwise,
it will bring death upon them.

150
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Of course.

151
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,480
Tomorrow, our signal shall be
the sound of the phoenix flute.

152
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Bring this to Huo Ying.

153
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Cooperate with him.

154
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
Do not let your personal feelings...

155
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,920
break the hearts
of South Hui's people.

156
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,920
Zi Ang, you look
truly dashing today.

157
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,680
Is it not just the Lantern Festival?

158
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
It was not easy
for Young Master Xiao to honor me...

159
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
with this chance to redeem myself.

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,280
Of course, I must dress up properly.

161
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
The night market
is very lively today.

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
Shen Song, are you not joining us?

163
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
I am afraid of the cold.

164
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,320
I have to trouble you,
Young Master Xiao,

165
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
to bring me some peanut candy.

166
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,680
The night market is up ahead.

167
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
What is wrong?

168
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,200
It has been a long time
since I last saw a crowd.

169
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
I feel a little dazed.

170
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Say,

171
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,440
how about we open
an inn in the future?

172
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
An inn?

173
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Yes.

174
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,199
I do not know how to farm,

175
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,280
nor the ways of business.

176
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,920
I have been at the mercy of others
since I was born.

177
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,080
Then I fear this inn
will lose money every day.

178
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Or we could open
a medical hall with Shen Song.

179
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
He will treat patients every day,

180
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
while you and I do nothing.

181
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,680
We will just be lazy young masters.

182
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,960
Or we can do what you want.

183
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,800
Find a forest...

184
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,680
and build a hut.

185
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,080
You can play the zither
for me every day.

186
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
I will chop wood
and boil water for you.

187
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
In this world,

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,920
there are only you and me.

189
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Why are you crying?

190
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
The North Kingdom...

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is windy.

192
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,520
Do you want to head back?

193
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Let us walk some more.

194
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I want to be with you.

195
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,960
Just the two of us.

196
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Let us stay a little longer.

197
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,440
I will ask Huai Yi to head back
with the soldiers first.

198
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Tonight,

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,440
it is only you and me.

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,800
There is a clay figurine shop
up ahead.

201
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,680
I loved playing with it
when I was a kid.

202
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
Go and buy one for me.

203
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,600
Then wait here for my return.

204
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,720
Sir, make a clay figurine.

205
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
It has to be festive.

206
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,320
Make another one
to keep him company.

207
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,920
A horse convoy
would be too conspicuous.

208
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,320
If we walk three li from here,

209
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,400
we can go downstream by boat,
return to our homeland,

210
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,080
and contact
the surviving South Hui forces.

211
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,920
This is a letter from Shen Song.

212
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Huo Ying.

213
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,440
After this,
there is truly no turning back.

214
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
I will not blame you
if you want to leave.

215
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,480
I will always be
by Your Majesty's side.

216
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,680
You should know better than I...

217
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
how Shen Song treats you.

218
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I have wronged him.

219
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Your Majesty knows my heart
belongs to someone else.

220
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
Do you think our Ji North Kingdom...

221
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,800
is a place where you may come...

222
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
and go as you please?

223
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,080
The household soldier
reported yesterday...

224
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,520
that someone sneaked
into Zi Ang's residence.

225
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
I ordered him to play along...

226
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
and set up defenses earlier.

227
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
You...

228
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,519
really are a loyal dog.

229
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,680
You can do whatever you want to me.

230
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,400
But do not lay a hand on Huo Ying.

231
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Duan Zi Ang!

232
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,720
I planned everything.

233
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
If you want to kill someone,
kill me first!

234
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,559
I planned this escape alone.

235
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
It has nothing to do with others.

236
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
- Your Majesty.
- You still dare to call him that?

237
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,160
Now in this world,

238
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
only Zi Ang
is the heaven-ordained emperor.

239
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
It turns out
I am the biggest villain.

240
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,000
When did you start planning this?

241
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,560
Since the very first day
you locked me up here.

242
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,800
All this time,

243
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,800
you have been lying to me.

244
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,720
"A lie must be told
with a true heart."

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Duan Zi Ang,

246
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,000
you taught me that.

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,320
Do you really think
I would not dare to take your life?

248
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Zi Ang.

249
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
I thought you had long
since changed your mind.

250
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,320
I did not expect...

251
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,320
I will kill you!

252
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Huo Ying.

253
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Your Majesty.

254
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,120
You once said...

255
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,040
the more you care about someone,

256
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,800
the more they hurt you.

257
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Now,

258
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,840
you are the one forcing me
to hurt you even more.

259
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I am forcing you?

260
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
I have not let go of my hatred
for a single day.

261
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Duan Zi Ang,

262
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,480
I said this before,
word for word, plain and clear.

263
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Did you forget?

264
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,840
Or do you not want to hear it?

265
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
So everything I have done is wrong.

266
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Yes.

267
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,320
When the kingdom fell,
all I wished for was death.

268
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,320
From the day you saved me,

269
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
it was wrong.

270
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,320
What do you want me to do then?

271
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,080
Do you want me to watch you die?

272
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Living is worse than dying.

273
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Duan Zi Ang.

274
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,560
You kept me caged here.

275
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,120
What am I?

276
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,560
A former ruler of a fallen kingdom?

277
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Or...

278
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,800
your male pet?

279
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,040
How cruel of you.

280
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,880
Someday,
under the historians' brush,

281
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
I hope my final words
as Xiao Shu He...

282
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,720
will be:

283
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,560
"The new emperor of Ji North,
Duan Zi Ang,"

284
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
"struck down the former ruler
of South Hui,"

285
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,800
"Xiao Shu He."

286
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,720
Hate me then.

287
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Do you still recognize that?

288
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,040
Remember this.

289
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,960
This is what you should look like.

290
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,160
You are a fallen ruler
of a lost kingdom.

291
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
We should not have kept you alive...

292
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:41,600
for so long.

293
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,360
Zi Ang should have abandoned you
a long time ago.

294
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,399
Now you want to contact
your former subordinates...

295
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
and plot a rebellion.

296
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,880
Do you not think it is ridiculous?

297
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,639
Day after day, you worried over...

298
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
the lives of South Hui's
prisoners of war.

299
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Now,

300
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
they all lie in the underworld,

301
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
waiting for you
to reunite with them.

302
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,880
He lied to me all my life.

303
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,520
My brother is a mighty ruler.

304
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,919
To the countless wronged souls
under his sword,

305
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,640
what is one mere prisoner camp?

306
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,880
Killing prisoners of war...

307
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,639
Over a hundred unarmed lives...

308
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,720
of my South Hui people...

309
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,720
In an instant,
they vanished into nothing.

310
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,400
I really did not expect...

311
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,560
that Duan Zi Ang would be so cruel.

312
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,000
That is because you are stupid.

313
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,520
My brother is a mighty ruler.

314
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,639
To the countless wronged souls
under his sword,

315
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,120
what is one mere prisoner camp?

316
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,600
I think the world is all the same.

317
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,640
When a dynasty rises,
the people suffer.

318
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,960
When a dynasty falls,
the people suffer.

319
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,320
But most people's lives...

320
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,200
are not in their own hands.

321
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,800
Rather than entrusting another
as if it were a gamble,

322
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,200
it is better that this person
be Xiao Shu He.

323
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,280
At least the realm...

324
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
will not become any worse.

325
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,880
Once the heart has been damaged,
no remedy can truly cure it.

326
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,360
He can only endure it.

327
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,880
Remember, he must not
lose his temper again.

328
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Is there nothing we can do?

329
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,080
His body is spent,
like an arrow at its last flight.

330
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,760
It is fortunate...

331
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
that we can maintain
his current condition.

332
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
These days,

333
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,760
General Li and the other generals
have long been dissatisfied.

334
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
There is no need to waste your time.

335
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,600
You may leave.

336
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
The Central Plains
have been pacified,

337
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
and the world is at peace.

338
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Zi Ang,

339
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,080
you have already achieved
what ordinary men could not.

340
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,640
Why are you still
torturing yourself like this?

341
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,080
What I am determined to do,

342
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,080
even if it is impossible,
I will still see it through.

343
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,600
The person I am determined to have,

344
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,080
even if he turns into
a handful of ashes,

345
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,080
I will still make him turn back
on the road to the afterlife.

346
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
But his heart is empty.

347
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,240
I cannot hold on to him.

348
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,800
Love gives birth to worry.

349
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,200
Love gives birth to fear.

350
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,520
These days, I often wonder...

351
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,040
if I had not been so greedy,

352
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,560
if I had not sought
to complete the mission,

353
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,080
maybe I could have
had a sincere relationship.

354
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,640
If I had not insisted
on reuniting with you,

355
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,120
perhaps we might each be
living well on our own now.

356
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,960
It seems like every time
I made a choice,

357
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,640
I made the wrong one.

358
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Huai Yi.

359
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Yes.

360
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,080
There are many men of talent
and ambition in the court.

361
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,040
You shall act as my regent.

362
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,760
All right.

363
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I did not kill you...

364
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,240
because of my brother.

365
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,800
His body can no longer
withstand the slightest shock.

366
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,960
I cannot harm him.

367
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,800
So you are here today...

368
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,719
just to perform before me...

369
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
the deep brotherly bond
between you two.

370
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Duan Huai Yi,

371
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,880
do you really think I cannot see
what you two are up to?

372
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
You can despise me all you want.

373
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
It does not matter.

374
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,120
But the Red Shadow Guards' diet
has been controlled since childhood.

375
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I read all the records,

376
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,600
and all the chiefs
died in their prime.

377
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,800
As for the secrets behind this,

378
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I do not know either.

379
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,600
He has done plenty for you,
Xiao Shu He.

380
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
If it were not for you,

381
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,800
the court officials
would not be in such fury,

382
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,560
and he would not
have worried so much...

383
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,160
that his body deteriorated
so quickly.

384
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,360
Now he is frail and bedridden.

385
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
He keeps calling your name
in his sleep.

386
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,560
If you still have
a shred of compassion,

387
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
go and see him.
