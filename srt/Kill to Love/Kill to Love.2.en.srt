1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,800
I haven't seen you in years.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,400
I just wanted to ask you.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,719
All these years out in the world,

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,800
did you suffer?

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,920
However,

6
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,760
I never thought that Your Highness would be the sixth prince.

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,880
If I can't find Huai Yi,

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,680
I'm afraid I won't have another chance.

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,360
You care so much about your brother.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,320
I'll do my best to help you.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,480
(Episode 2)

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,720
To the Covert Division of Ji North,

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,079
I have settled in South Hui...

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,120
and infiltrated the residence of He, an old friend.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,720
We reminisced and bonded over drinks.

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,959
He is the crown prince's younger brother,

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,200
the sixth prince.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,120
We can use him to help our great cause.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,159
(Imperial Palace, Ji North Kingdom)

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,279
I told you.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
There is no need for formalities in private.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,120
Duan Zi Ang has successfully infiltrated Sixth Prince's Manor.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,039
If he succeeds in assassinating the crown prince...

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,080
and completes his mission,

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,760
we can bring him back...

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,640
and reveal his identity.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,840
(South Hui Kingdom)

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,360
I'll teach you.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,280
This is...

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
that bow from when we were kids.

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,760
He kept it all this time.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Didn't His Highness ask you...

35
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:07,576
to take good care of Young Master Duan?

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Where is he?

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,319
I... I haven't seen Young Master Duan...

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
since this morning.

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
Report it to His Highness.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,400
The assassination failed.

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,760
Not only did he not leave,

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,160
he intentionally approached me.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,920
I wonder...

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,200
what Zi Ang is up to.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Shu He!

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Shu He.

47
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,920
The kitchen prepared a hangover soup.

48
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,240
Zi Ang, you haven't recovered yet.

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,600
Why don't you get some rest?

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
It's just a minor injury.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Shu He, what are you doing?

52
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,176
I haven't practiced for a long time.

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm rusty.

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Is that so?

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Shu He, if you're suspicious of me,

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
I won't leave you alive.

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
I wonder...

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
when I'll be able to hear you play the zither.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,040
My teacher said...

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,440
the sound of the zither is also the sound of the heart.

61
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm still drunk from last night.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,480
I'll play another day.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Then...

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
Shu He, can you understand the sound of my heart?

65
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,320
The sound of your heart...

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
is certainly hard to understand.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
I'll teach you.

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,400
Between the two of us,

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
who is the pawn...

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,200
and who is the chess player?

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,959
It seems...

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,120
yet to be decided.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
This is the "gong" pitch.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
This is "shang".

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,120
Is there a difference?

76
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,360
Zi Ang, listen to this now.

77
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,240
This is "jue".

78
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
This...

79
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,240
It seems like he didn't suspect me.

80
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Forget it.

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,360
If you want to master the zither,

82
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm afraid you'll need some more time.

83
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
Swordplay suits me better.

84
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,920
Remember to drink the soup.

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
Convey my order.

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,360
Today, all the guards outside my study...

87
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,400
are all dismissed.

88
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
In five days,

89
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,439
General Duan will bring a few trusted men...

90
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
to Mount Lingyun to survey the terrain.

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,680
Set up a small platoon to run into General Duan.

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
At that time, we'll send the Imperial Guards...

93
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
to catch General Duan red-handed.

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,640
Remember, only General Duan and I know the formation.

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,760
After your platoon is captured, you must not mention me.

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,640
He was the one who framed us...

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,200
for colluding with the enemy.

98
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
Why are you here so late?

99
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
It's dangerous for you to be here.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
Xiao Shu He is drunk.

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
It's the safest time to sneak out.

102
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Lord Wang,

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,439
I found some letters...

104
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
in a secret compartment in Xiao Shu He's room.

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,840
According to the letters,

106
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,360
my father was framed by Gu Yuan Shan.

107
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,120
The crown prince was just an enforcer.

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,480
What do you mean?

109
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
All these years,

110
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,160
did I hate the wrong person?

111
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,040
How dare you come here without my permission?

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
This had better be important.

113
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,879
Yesterday, Prince Shu He ran into an old acquaintance...

114
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
at White Cloud Temple.

115
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,481
He's a remnant of General Duan's family.

116
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,040
Judging from the prince's reaction,

117
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,960
they must have been very close.

118
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
A remnant of General Duan's family?

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,320
The assassin.

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,159
I saw him acting suspiciously,

121
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
so I followed him.

122
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,640
He met a man at the mill on East Street.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
From the conversation, I surmise...

124
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,976
that the mill and its visitors...

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,839
are most likely scouts from Ji North Kingdom.

126
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,600
Huo Ying, you must not lie!

127
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
From Ji North Kingdom?

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Huo Ying,

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
you know what you're saying, right?

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,919
It's true.

131
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,520
I wouldn't dare to take this lightly.

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,400
How dare Xiao Shu He associate with people from Ji North?

133
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,400
He doesn't want to be an idle prince, does he?

134
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,079
Your Highness,

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
this is a serious matter.

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's confirm it before we consider it.

137
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,696
Although Prince Shu He stays away from the imperial court,

138
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,480
I don't think he would be so ignorant about such matters.

139
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
That person even mentioned...

140
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
the Red Shadow Guards.

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,240
Weren't the Red Shadow Guards...

142
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
The mill on East Street.

143
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,640
In the next two days, find out who is inside.

144
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,720
Don't spook them.

145
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,440
Report this to Prime Minister Gu.

146
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

147
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,241
How long have you been planted in the prince's residence?

148
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Five years.

149
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,520
I've kept you there for so long.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,520
It's time to put you to use.

151
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,680
Within seven days,

152
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,040
I want you to kill Xiao Shu He.

153
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
What?

154
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,159
The two of you have gotten close over the years.

155
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Will you refuse now?

156
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
No.

157
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,320
Your Highness is my only master.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
What?

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,800
Do you also think Xiao Shu He is good?

160
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,280
He's a good-for-nothing.

161
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
Why do you all like him so much?

162
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
I wouldn't dare.

163
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,800
I'll complete my mission.

164
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
You may go.

165
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
Zi Ang, it's me.

166
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,400
He's not in his room early in the morning.

167
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Zi Ang.

168
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
What rare item are you carrying?

169
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,200
Why didn't you make a sound?

170
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,560
You were such a serious child. You seem different now.

171
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,880
You're always playing childish tricks.

172
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,456
I'm a martial arts practitioner.

173
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,496
I'm used to getting up early to practice martial arts.

174
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,136
I saw the pear blossoms blooming this morning.

175
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,280
It reminded me of you.

176
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,880
I wanted to give your room a touch of pear fragrance.

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Now, I suppose...

178
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,720
it will be an apology.

179
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,920
Do you like to eat sweets?

180
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
I'll ask the chef to prepare a box of pear blossom pastries for you.

181
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
I thought you weren't awake.

182
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,056
I ordered someone to prepare breakfast.

183
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,360
Zi Ang, try my cook's skills.

184
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
The song of the sword...

185
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,480
reminds me of my close friend, Zi Ang.

186
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,760
The bamboo bow is still warm from his fingertips.

187
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,520
In our youth, we trampled through wild paths.

188
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,720
Separated by trials and hardships,

189
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,080
I dare not dwell on those tender feelings.

190
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,520
How could he have such thoughts?

191
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,120
How ridiculous.

192
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
What's wrong?

193
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Does the arrow wound still hurt?

194
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
No.

195
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,280
It's just that I've been away from home for a long time.

196
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,440
No one has prepared breakfast for me for a long time.

197
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,240
I didn't expect that to bring up sad feelings.

198
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
When you say that,

199
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,480
it sounds like you're mocking me for being sentimental.

200
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,720
Lord Gu is here and asks to speak with Your Highness.

201
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
The soul and the spirit ought to speak to one another.

202
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,600
Do not be born into the imperial family.

203
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
What?

204
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,799
Zi Ang,

205
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,440
I have some matters to attend to.

206
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,440
I shouldn't pry into state affairs.

207
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,040
If Your Highness is unhappy,

208
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,520
you can come to me.

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

210
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,520
You don't have to be so formal.

211
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,919
He's an old friend of mine.

212
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,440
We met again a few days ago.

213
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,800
I invited him to my residence.

214
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
Greetings, Lord Gu.

215
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,999
How polite of you.

216
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,880
Your Highness, this way, please.

217
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,640
I have something to discuss.

218
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,256
Did the crown prince come to see you again?

219
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,319
It's none of your business.

220
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,040
I came to see you because of Prince Shu He.

221
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
Sit down first. I'll get the medicine.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,320
The crown prince is going to make a move on Prince Shu He.

223
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
When?

224
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
How?

225
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,920
The crown prince wants you to do it.

226
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,480
I only have seven days.

227
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,400
Then why did you tell me?

228
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,041
Because I helped you hide your identity, did you think...

229
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,000
I would help you assassinate Shu He?

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,640
I never thought of asking you to help me.

231
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,319
I'm telling you this...

232
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,680
because I know Prince Shu He is a good person.

233
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,800
And if the crown prince does this,

234
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
he will regret it later.

235
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,640
You're so concerned about the crown prince.

236
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,480
Haven't you ever thought...

237
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,040
that the crown prince treats you like a dog?

238
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,759
Even if I'm a dog,

239
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm still a dog that he cares about.

240
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
You're a martial artist.

241
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,480
You get hurt so badly every time.

242
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,760
A martial artist is just a blade.

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,960
A blade that can only slice its way forward.

244
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
When a blade is born,

245
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,879
isn't it meant to cut everything down...

246
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
until it breaks?

247
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
If a sword is to break,

248
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,920
it should break at the most critical moment.

249
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,656
Before you've accomplished anything for the crown prince,

250
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,840
you will have already broken.

251
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,480
Can you accept that?

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Yes.

253
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,080
I don't deserve to have an opinion.

254
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm an orphan.

255
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I was chosen by the crown prince,

256
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,680
taken in, and trained.

257
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,680
I even became the crown prince's sword.

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
It's already a great honor.

259
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
You're the one who cannot accept it.

260
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Huo Ying,

261
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
promise me.

262
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Don't be impulsive.

263
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,360
Prime Minister Gu, what brings you here today?

264
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,760
I understand...

265
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,200
that you don't want to be involved in the imperial court.

266
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,040
But there are some things...

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,680
that I have to say.

268
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Go ahead, Prime Minister Gu.

269
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,080
The crown prince...

270
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,880
killed the Prince of Qi.

271
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,280
Prime Minister Gu, you are the crown prince's teacher.

272
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,160
The fate of the nation is unstable.

273
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,960
His Majesty only has the two of you.

274
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,399
I don't want one of you...

275
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,440
to have his hands stained with his brother's blood.

276
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,000
And I don't want the other to die by his brother's hand.

277
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,239
I don't want the throne.

278
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Everyone knows that.

279
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,239
I know how you feel.

280
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
I really don't want to fight with him.

281
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,080
Prime Minister Gu, just get to the point.

282
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
Every crown prince that came before...

283
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,840
was not allowed absolute power.

284
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,280
I just wish...

285
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,760
that Your Highness can be involved in the imperial court...

286
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,680
and curb the crown prince's arrogance.

287
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,160
When everything is settled,

288
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,480
I'll do my best to ensure you can return to seclusion.

289
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,880
I'll help you travel the world.

290
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,200
Forgive me for being rude.

291
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,480
No matter what you're planning,

292
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,080
I don't believe that Shu Qian would harm me.

293
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
Prime Minister Gu, please leave.

294
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,320
I misspoke.

295
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,200
But I still have to remind Your Highness.

296
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,536
Two days ago, there was an assassin in the crown prince's manor.

297
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,039
The crown prince found out...

298
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,439
that someone left the city that night...

299
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,560
using Your Highness's token.

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Prime Minister Gu,

301
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,440
you don't have to threaten me like this.

302
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,880
What do you mean, Your Highness?

303
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
If I don't agree,

304
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,159
will you also report to Father...

305
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,040
that I'm suspected of colluding with the enemy?

306
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,320
Your Highness, you must be joking.

307
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,280
I don't understand what you mean.

308
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,480
Do you still remember...

309
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
General Duan?

310
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,640
I've had a lot of free time lately.

311
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,600
I happened to find someone from Duan Manor.

312
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,440
General Duan was a disgraced South Hui official.

313
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,040
If His Majesty hadn't been so observant back then,

314
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,760
once the two armies went to war,

315
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,040
who knows how many soldiers of South Hui...

316
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,376
would have died because General Duan had colluded with the enemy...

317
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,560
and betrayed the nation?

318
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
When I was in school as a child,

319
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,840
you were the best storyteller.

320
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,016
Now that you are the crown prince's Grand Master,

321
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,640
your storytelling skills have improved.

322
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,840
Your Highness, you should know.

323
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Everyone in General Duan's family is a criminal.

324
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,640
If what Your Highness said is true,

325
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
Your Highness should report it to the Imperial Guards.

326
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,040
In General Duan's case,

327
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,160
who was the true victim?

328
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,880
You and I both know it.

329
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,600
I hope Your Highness can enlighten me.

330
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,480
After I get to the bottom of this, I will report it to Father.

331
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
But before that,

332
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,840
I don't want to cause him more trouble.

333
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,680
What do you think, Prime Minister Gu?

334
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,880
I have no right to interfere with your decision.

335
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,160
If you've made up your mind,

336
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,320
I'll take my leave.

337
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Promise me.

338
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't be impulsive.

339
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I promise.

340
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,640
Also, yesterday, I heard the crown prince say...

341
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,960
that Duan Zi Ang...

342
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,080
is connected to the Red Shadow Guards.

343
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Wait.

344
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Take this.

345
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,000
Red Shadow Guards have their own way of identifying each other.

346
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
Why are you so flustered?

347
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,880
I just found out...

348
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,016
that the one who tried to assassinate the crown prince...

349
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,240
was from the Red Shadow Guards of the Ji North Kingdom.

350
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Are you saying...

351
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,720
that Duan Zi Ang is from the Red Shadow Guards?

352
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
That's right.

353
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,600
Red Shadow Guards keep a low profile.

354
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,080
They usually communicate one-way.

355
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,639
Their only identification...

356
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
is a crow brand behind their shoulder.

357
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
It's just a minor injury.

358
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,656
You don't have to take it so seriously.

359
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,160
If Duan Zi Ang really is one of the Red Shadow Guards,

360
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,400
and Prime Minister Gu finds out about this,

361
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440
we'll never be able to recover from it.

362
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,559
Does everyone in the Red Shadow Guards...

363
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,040
have a crow brand on their back?

364
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,160
Young Master Duan, this is the place.

365
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
This way, please.

366
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
You may go.

367
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I can do it myself.

368
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,360
Young Master Duan, let us help you bathe.

369
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,056
His Highness told us to take good care of you.

370
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,759
What if your wound gets wet?

371
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
It won't.

372
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm the one who asked you to leave.

373
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Yes.

374
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,279
Your Highness, I've tried my best.

375
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,760
Young Master Duan wouldn't let us help him bathe.

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,159
When the lady plays the wrong note,

377
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
the gentleman notices.

378
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,480
Remember to take your medicine.

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,520
I usually don't believe everything Shen Song says.

380
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,199
Forget it.

381
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
It's better for me to confirm it myself.

382
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Zi Ang.

383
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Zi Ang.

384
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,800
I brought you some clothes.

385
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
He's bathing with clothes on.

386
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,000
Why didn't you cover yourself?

387
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
I...

388
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,440
I don't know.

389
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,080
I'm just a commoner. I usually bathe with everyone.

390
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,120
Why should I hide?

391
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Everyone?

392
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,360
How many is that?

393
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,639
Your Highness, you usually have people waiting on you...

394
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,680
when you bathe, don't you?

395
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,360
Why are you being so shy?

396
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,680
Zi Ang, you were boasting just now.

397
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,559
Why are you shy now?

398
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,640
Well, nobody stares like that.

399
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,240
I only pretended to save his life.

400
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,360
Does he really like me?

401
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,280
Why didn't you let them help you bathe?

402
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,600
What if you get your wound wet?

403
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,000
Is the tattoo on his waist?

404
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,600
It can't be on his leg.

405
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,039
This wasn't mentioned in the mission.

406
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,239
Why do I need to be waited on just to take a bath?

407
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,720
That's so strange.

408
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,760
It's a normal thing.

409
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,960
What's so strange about it?

410
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
What?

411
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,280
Only you get to tease me?

412
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,640
Am I not allowed to tease you?

413
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,840
Your wound is open.

414
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,799
Zi Ang, it's time to change the dressing.

415
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm coming in.

416
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,680
The wound got wet just now.

417
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,816
You need to change the dressing.

418
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll do it myself.

419
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Don't trouble yourself.

420
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,480
Can you reach your back?

421
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
I...

422
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,040
Wet wounds don't heal easily.

423
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,800
Shen Song...

424
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,160
is so full of it.

425
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Be more careful.

426
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Okay.

427
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,336
I ordered the kitchen to prepare some hometown dishes.

428
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,760
Try them and see if they taste the same.

429
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
All right.

430
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,400
Now it's time for the front.

431
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,280
I'll do the front myself.

432
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Don't trouble yourself.

433
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,040
Zi Ang, you haven't been slacking off all these years.

434
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,160
You have so many calluses on your hands.

435
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,680
Do you need to train so hard to sell salt?

436
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
Selling salt is a business.

437
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
It's not physical labor.

438
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,760
Then why did you train so hard?

439
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,480
It's just a habit from my childhood.

440
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,000
Otherwise, how could I have saved you?

441
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
It doesn't hurt.

442
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,559
The crown prince invites Your Highness...

443
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,736
to a banquet at the Crown Prince's Manor.

444
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
All right.

445
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,280
The crown prince even invited you to a banquet.

446
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,760
It seems like the two of you are quite close.

447
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,600
When we were young, he studied hard every day.

448
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,240
But I didn't like reading books on history or swordplay.

449
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,400
He asked me to study with him.

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,160
But I only liked to play the zither and read poems.

451
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,960
Then you and the crown prince...

452
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
When we were young,

453
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:56,281
he was my closest and most respected brother.

454
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
He never got mad at me.

455
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,640
He listened to me play the zither.

456
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,400
He recited poetry with me.

457
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,760
But he was terrible at it.

458
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
All these years,

459
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
did I hate the wrong person?

460
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Shu He.

461
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Shu He.

462
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,640
Shu He.

463
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,600
Duan Zi Ang, when you were exiled to Ji North,

464
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,600
it was the Red Shadow Guards that took you in.

465
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,479
Now, with just a few unverifiable letters,

466
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,799
you're questioning the man who saved your life...

467
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
and raised you.

468
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,376
The crown prince brought men to capture General Duan...

469
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
for the crime of treason.

470
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,680
If General Duan doesn't obey, they will fight.

471
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,640
Mrs. Zhang has escaped with Huai Yi.

472
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,240
Madam Duan told me to take you with me.

473
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,640
I'm not leaving.

474
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I have never forgotten...

475
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,481
how the Red Shadow Guards trained me.

476
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,280
I will fulfill my promise to the Red Shadow Guards,

477
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,840
no matter what the truth is,

478
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,399
You know that your life as it is now...

479
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,960
is because of the crown prince, right?

480
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,640
How innocent can his brother, Xiao Shu He, be?

481
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,520
The crown prince cannot escape blame.

482
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,240
I will complete my mission.

483
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,600
He knows I don't get involved in politics.

484
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,080
Yet, he invited me to a banquet with the ministers.

485
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,520
Then why do you look so worried?

486
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,400
I wonder...

487
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,040
if I will see the crown prince.
