1
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,960
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
You have such a delicate side.

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
It seems
I have not known you well enough.

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,840
Then I hope we may be together
to the end of time.

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,520
Maybe one day,

6
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,200
I will know you fully.

7
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,120
Come with me.

8
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,800
This is...

9
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,320
I have made up my mind.

10
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,399
If we are together,

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,720
this imperial status
will surely be an obstacle.

12
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,080
If you are willing,

13
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
I wish to wear
these commoner's clothes with you.

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,880
Just like what we promised.

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,400
We will live in seclusion
in the woods...

16
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
and roam the mountains
and rivers together.

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,080
Of course I am willing.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
When the time comes,
the two of us...

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
will find a courtyard
in the woods...

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
and hold a simple wedding ceremony.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,760
May we be like
a pair of swan geese in flight,

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
never parted for a hundred years.

23
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,040
But...

24
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
before that,

25
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,560
there is something I must tell you.

26
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
If I do not say it out,
my heart will remain knotted.

27
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,400
What is it?

28
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Your Highness,

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
the carriage is bumpy.

30
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,680
Why not return to the residence
and read it later?

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
A locust plague has already started
in the western realm.

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,680
If we do not make preparations,

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,680
a famine will come.

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,720
Who will suffer then?

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
Time is pressing.
I have no choice but to read it now.

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,040
- What happened?
- I will go down and take a look.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,040
Who are you?

38
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,919
Do you know the consequences...

39
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
of your actions?

40
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,840
If we both take the throne,

41
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,240
a war is inevitable in the future.

42
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,920
Why not decide
the winner here and now?

43
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,120
What is it?

44
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
I...

45
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Your Highness,

46
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I have terrible news.

47
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,040
The Crown Prince of Ji North
was ambushed...

48
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,920
and died within the borders
of South Hui Kingdom.

49
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,920
It is said to be
Crown Prince Shu Qian's doing.

50
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
Is there any movement
in the Gu Manor?

51
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Your Highness,

52
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
the messenger has reported back.

53
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Prime Minister Gu claims to be ill,

54
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
shutting himself in his room.

55
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
That old fox...

56
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,680
shows some sense, at least.

57
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,320
Your Highness,
a letter from Prime Minister Gu.

58
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
The crown prince has rebelled.

59
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,560
The realm stands
on the verge of ruin.

60
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
I am willing to turn back
from the wrong path,

61
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
rein in before the cliff,

62
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
and give my all...

63
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
to protect Your Highness.

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You wait at the door.

65
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,120
Your Majesty!

66
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,200
I deserve to die
for disturbing Your Majesty.

67
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,719
The rebel forces
have reached the palace gate.

68
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,320
The palace guards
hold the line without retreat.

69
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,120
However, the enemy presses fiercely.

70
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,400
I fear we cannot hold out for long.

71
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,000
Prime Minister Gu locked himself in.

72
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
The deputy commander
of the Imperial Guards...

73
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,400
seems to be up to something.

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
The commander
of the Imperial Guards...

75
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
is the crown prince's man?

76
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Insolence!

77
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Your Majesty, please move
to the secret passage.

78
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,600
If I flee in haste,

79
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
how can I face...

80
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,080
my ancestors in the afterlife?

81
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
To the main hall.

82
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Your Highness,

83
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:05,840
you and I know
the crown prince all too well.

84
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
No one knows Huai Yi's identity now.

85
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
And in a monk's guise,

86
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
he should be safe.

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
But you...

88
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Your Highness.

89
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
This is dangerous.

90
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,960
I will gather the household troops
to guard the manor.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,880
At the western corner gate,
a secret channel leads to the moat.

92
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,119
I have already ordered 20 warriors
sworn to give their lives,

93
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,600
disguised as a merchant convoy,
to wait in the reed marshes.

94
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,999
Now is the perfect chance
for Shen Song...

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,080
to break out with Huai Yi.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Let us not waste time.

97
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Shen Song,

98
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,760
you are the one I trust the most.

99
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Take Huai Yi and go.

100
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Huo Ying,

101
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,480
have the household troops
set up defenses.

102
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,000
Huai Yi, be careful.

103
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Go.

104
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Huo Ying.

105
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Huo Ying.

106
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
Why did you not tell
Xiao Shu He to leave?

107
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,920
The rebel cavalry
is almost at your gates,

108
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
and the Imperial Guards
are all elite.

109
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
Do you think you can hold them off?

110
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Concern makes chaos.

111
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,560
You know Prince Shu He
better than I do.

112
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,640
If His Highness leaves,

113
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,759
the rebels will announce
to the world...

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,840
that he fled in fear of punishment.

115
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,040
Even if His Highness
manages to escape,

116
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,000
the court of the South Hui Kingdom
lies wounded,

117
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,520
and war has broken out
in the north.

118
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,000
Can His Highness truly live
as a carefree recluse?

119
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Today,

120
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,119
the court of South Hui is corrupt,

121
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,920
villains hold power,
and the state is falling apart.

122
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,360
I, as the Crown Prince,
cannot stand idly by.

123
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Soldiers, hear my command!

124
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,720
We shall cleanse the court...

125
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
and save the kingdom from peril!

126
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Cleanse the court!

127
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,760
Save the kingdom from peril!

128
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Tonight's act...

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,400
is for the salvation of the realm.

130
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
If I do not raise my troops,

131
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,400
the southern dynasty
will be destroyed overnight.

132
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
First battalion,
come with me to the palace.

133
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,159
Second battalion,
surround the Sixth Prince's manor.

134
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,360
Do not let anyone out.

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Yes, Your Highness!

136
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Are you here
to urge me to leave too?

137
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,080
Father's whereabouts are unknown.

138
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,080
The crown prince
has gone to such lengths.

139
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,879
I may not be talented,
but as a prince of South Hui,

140
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,240
I cannot simply walk away.

141
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
The life and death
of an imperial family...

142
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,240
is but a single line
under the historian's brush.

143
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,440
It is but a single line.

144
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,000
But the judgment of history,

145
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,680
you may not care,

146
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,680
but I cannot.

147
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
If you go,

148
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,000
will you be able to come back alive?

149
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,680
You and I have different fates.

150
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,799
Even if this day marks my end,

151
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
I should die in South Hui.

152
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,680
Then, I shall think
of these days as a dream.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Shu He.

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Is that what you mean?

155
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
Do not force me anymore.

156
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
All right?

157
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,320
When I was young,

158
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,520
Father invited Crown Prince Shu Qian
and me to visit the Imperial Garden.

159
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,200
Crown Prince Shu Qian
praised my zither skills.

160
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,840
Father was pleased...

161
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,040
and said he wanted to hear me play.

162
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,720
There were many people
at the pavilion.

163
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,640
But I knew...

164
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
the only one...

165
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
who listened attentively
was Crown Prince Shu Qian.

166
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,960
That is why I played
that piece with such ease.

167
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
Crown Prince Shu Qian knows me.

168
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
He understands me.

169
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,680
That is why he hurts me.

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,720
This is my fate.

171
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,040
I cannot escape from it.

172
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Take the dagger.

173
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
I will.

174
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,720
Can you feel it?

175
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,560
If, after today,

176
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,000
we can never see each other again,

177
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,800
remember this.

178
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,640
This place only belongs to you.

179
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,080
Every moment...

180
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,000
belongs only to you.

181
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Report!

182
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,959
Your Highness,

183
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,280
the crown prince invites you
to the palace immediately.

184
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I see.

185
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
You may go.

186
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,160
Let me put on...

188
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,520
the mountain river brocade.

189
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,920
Father.

190
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
It has only been a few days,

191
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
and you have aged.

192
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,520
I have not yet grown old enough...

193
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,480
to satisfy you.

194
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,320
In the past, you could not
even help me into the sleeves,

195
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,520
and now, you are helping me
into the mountain river brocade.

196
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,600
When did you learn that?

197
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,800
Why did I not know?

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,920
There are many things
you do not know.

199
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
From now on,

200
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,760
I will tell you all of it,
one by one.

201
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
Every single thing?

202
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,960
From morning to night,

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,280
through all the seasons,

204
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,880
until you refuse
to hear another word.

205
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Until you are sick of it.

206
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Sick of you?

207
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,520
That is rather difficult.

208
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This realm,

209
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
you have ruled for far too long.

210
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
So long that you forget...

211
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
you were once the crown prince...

212
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,160
who rose to the throne
through bloodshed.

213
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,640
Must you be so impatient?

214
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,480
You always say
that I am cruel and vicious.

215
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,079
But if you had not indulged
Prime Minister Gu...

216
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
to form factions for private gain,

217
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,720
nor allowed Shu He
to grow his power in court,

218
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,640
I would not have come to this.

219
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Rest assured.

220
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,800
The chronicles will say
you died of an illness.

221
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,360
I shall be a benevolent ruler.

222
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,760
Just like you were.

223
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,680
Your Highness.
Wake up, Your Highness.

224
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Your Highness.

225
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
- Your Highness.
- I am sorry for being late.

226
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
The crown prince is obsessive
and disregards all moral orders.

227
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
The South Hui Kingdom
is in grave peril.

228
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Prime Minister Gu, say no more.

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,240
- Prepare the horses.
- Please.

230
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,480
Long live the Emperor!

231
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,920
Reserve that
for the enthronement ceremony.

232
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Where is Xiao Shu He?

233
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Your Highness,

234
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,080
is this not too risky?

235
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,160
A man with a disabled right hand
amounts to no threat.

236
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,800
All of you wait here.

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
I shall end...

238
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,600
my brother's life myself.

239
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Guard the palace gates.

240
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:09,680
Do not let anyone in.

241
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
You wretched cur from Ji North.

242
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,080
How dare you wear my brother's skin
to seek death?

243
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,120
Who dies tonight...

244
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,240
is yet to be decided.

245
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Where is Xiao Shu He?

246
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Tell me,

247
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,920
and I shall grant you
an intact corpse.

248
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Shu He.

249
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
No matter what happens
in the future,

250
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,600
my heart will never change.

251
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,920
Duan Zi Ang.

252
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,440
Think carefully.

253
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,960
If you kill me,

254
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,480
how can you leave South Hui?

255
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
How dare you!

256
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,760
The crown prince has ordered me...

257
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,480
to bring Prince Shu He
to the palace immediately.

258
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
I have the crown prince's token.

259
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,919
Without my order,

260
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,960
you shall not release the arrows.

261
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,640
Zi Ang! Xiao Shu Qian!

262
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,920
How is Father...

263
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Shu He,

264
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,320
my dear brother,

265
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
how could you ask
such a naive question?

266
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
Rest assured.

267
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
The chronicles will say
you died of an illness.

268
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
I shall be a benevolent ruler.

269
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
Xiao Shu Qian.

270
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,400
That is your biological father!

271
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
What?

272
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,840
It was one thing to expect me
to be a good brother,

273
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,040
but now you expect me
to be a good son!

274
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
For the sake of the throne,

275
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,520
what kind of monster must you
become before you will stop?

276
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
What a pity.

277
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
If you had told me this yourself...

278
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
when you gave me the broken string,

279
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,160
you and I might have
been able to talk it out.

280
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,520
Let us out of the city.

281
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,200
I promise I will never set foot
in the capital again.

282
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,799
You fell into the ice lake
when you were four.

283
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
It was I who fished you out.

284
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,919
You were poisoned by an arrow
when you were seven.

285
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,240
It was I who sucked out
the pus and blood for you.

286
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,119
And now you speak of "us"...

287
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,240
with a savage of Ji North?

288
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,720
What is he saying?

289
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Do you think this cur poured
his heart out to you?

290
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,399
A Ji North spy sneaked into...

291
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,800
the southern frontier
three months ago.

292
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,519
- Shut your mouth.
- He made you willingly act...

293
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,680
like a fool for the past few months.

294
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Shut your mouth.

295
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:17,920
When you shared a bed with him,
did it ever cross your mind...

296
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
that the secret report
clearly states,

297
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,920
"I am acquainted with Prince Shu He
and he may be of use"?

298
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Shut your mouth!

299
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
Do you think everyone
is as despicable as you?

300
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,280
The South Hui Kingdom
cannot satisfy your ambition,

301
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,880
so you would fill it
with my heart and flesh.

302
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,320
I, Xiao Shu He,

303
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,200
deserve to be schemed
by my family and loved ones.

304
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
For I am a fool.

305
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
Let him go.

306
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Shu He.

307
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,920
Let him go.

308
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,120
If he does not die today,
then you will.

309
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,000
He even dared
to kill his own father.

310
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
You would plead for him?

311
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,399
Do you think you can still live?

312
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
I am not doing this for him.

313
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
I am doing it for the kingdom.

314
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,879
As a prince of South Hui,

315
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,840
it is my fate to die tonight.

316
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,680
You were born in Ji North,

317
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
raised in Ji North,

318
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and your loyalty
belongs to Ji North.

319
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
On top of the city walls tonight,

320
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
there is no Duan Zi Ang...

321
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,360
or Xiao Shu He.

322
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,719
There is only a prince
of South Hui...

323
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,240
and an assassin of Ji North!

324
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,320
Such a loyal and filial Xiao Shu He.

325
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
If you truly kill Duan Zi Ang today,

326
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,360
I shall be impressed.

327
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,760
Sparing your life
would not be impossible.

328
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Shu He.

329
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,240
You should know
that my blade is faster than yours.

330
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
I would rather you hate me,

331
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,680
yet still I will keep you safe.

332
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,880
Is that so?

333
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Shu He.

334
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
How about this?

335
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
Why are you doing this?

336
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Who is calling me, Shu He, now?

337
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,680
The son of a salt merchant,

338
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,320
the orphan
of General Duan's household,

339
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,440
an assassin seething with hatred,

340
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,400
or a cunning and scheming...

341
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,000
spy from the Ji North Kingdom?

342
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,840
Each word was from the heart.

343
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,840
It pains me deeply to hear that.

344
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,600
Why not let me set you free?

345
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Shu Qian.

346
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Shu Qian!

347
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Shu Qian.

348
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Shu Qian.

349
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Shu Qian.

350
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
Imperial Guards, heed my order!

351
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,600
Protect Prince Shu He!

352
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,520
Huo Ying.

353
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,520
The Rhino Horn Pill formula.

354
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,320
Rhinoceros horn over 300 years old,

355
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,720
roasted on thunder-struck wood
for seven days.

356
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,280
Three maces of snow lingzhi,

357
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,480
grown upon a century-old coffin
in a land of bitter frost.

358
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,280
It can cure all poisons.

359
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,840
Two and a half maces
of Ghost Dove's tears,

360
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,800
steamed in strong liquor
for seven days...

361
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,240
until a shape of amber is formed.

362
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,440
Swallow it with warm water.

363
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,640
I only trust you.

364
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,080
You must be loyal to me.

365
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
On a stormy night,

366
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,000
I will come back
to accompany Your Highness.

367
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,040
I have killed 17 powerful princes.

368
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,400
But I have never felt
as satisfied as now.

369
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,480
A reunion after long parting,

370
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Huai Yi,

371
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,880
and avenging your father.

372
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,080
What is real?

373
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,640
This heart is real.

374
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
How ridiculous.

375
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
I actually spent my last days...

376
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,720
teaching an enemy spy to write poems
of the southern frontiers...

377
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,560
and paint the snows of Jinling.

378
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Shu He.

379
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,440
Let us go, shall we?

380
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,199
You do not wish to be this prince,

381
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
nor do I wish to be
the heir to the throne.

382
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,520
Can you feel it?

383
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,560
From now on,
every beat here belongs only to you.

384
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,280
Every beat will call your name.

385
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
Then, allow our heartbeats...

386
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,120
to end tonight.

387
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,720
The prince of South Hui
and the heir of Ji North...

388
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,640
They should have...

389
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
never met.

390
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,640
You should go.

391
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,360
In this life,

392
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,560
let us never meet again.

393
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,480
Protect Prince Shu He!

394
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,080
Hear me, soldiers of South Hui!

395
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,599
Capture the Ji North assassin,

396
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,280
and avenge Shu Qian!
