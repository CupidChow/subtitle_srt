1
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,440
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Your Highness.

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,999
Prince Shu He's right-hand meridians
are completely severed.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
He shall no longer disturb
your peace with his zither.

5
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Guards.

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,080
Reward him with 10 taels of gold.

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

8
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,000
Swap the gold for copper coins,

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,079
pack them in a sack,
and bind it to his body.

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
Then cast him
into the middle of the river.

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
If you survive and seize it,

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,280
three generations' wealth
shall be yours.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Your Highness.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Your Highness, spare me.

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
Your Highness!
Your Highness, have mercy!

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Your Highness!

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Your Highness!

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,400
You are but a useless blade.

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
You are but a useless blade.

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,119
Go somewhere quiet
and kill yourself.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,520
Take a good look at my face.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
You have my permission.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,560
You can think of my face
before you die.

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,160
You can think of my face
before you die.

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Huo Ying.

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
The poison has not been cured.

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,840
Where are you going?

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Your body is spent,
like an arrow at its last flight.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
If you still will not rest,

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,360
the only thing waiting
for you will be death.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,440
So what?

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Huo Ying.

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,400
Who are you degrading yourself for?

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,800
The crown prince will not care
whether you live or die.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Since the Shadow Guards
no longer have a master,

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
I will end my life.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
You are a human being,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
not an object.

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,560
I am illiterate.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
I know nothing about the world.

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
As long as I bear a sword,

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,239
where the crown prince
orders me to cut,

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
there will I cut.

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,679
Now that the poison runs deep,

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,319
I cannot even hold my sword.

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,080
In the end, I am worth nothing.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,840
There is nothing left
for me in this world.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Shen Song.

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,680
Rather than keep me barely alive,

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,240
give me a swift release.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,520
Say that again.

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,680
Put me out of my misery.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
I have treated you so many times,

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,160
yet all you seek is death.

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,760
I have done numerous evil deeds.

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,400
My hands are stained with blood.

57
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
The heart-piercing agony
when the poison flares...

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,720
Such is my retribution.

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
Do not pity me.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
All right.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Good.

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,680
It is my fault for degrading myself.

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
It is my fault
for playing the good man.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You said you have no parents.

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,920
So I sent people to look for them.

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I came here today...

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
because I wanted to tell you...

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
that I have found clues
to your parentage.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
But now,

70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,880
I pity your parents.

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
They just found out
about your whereabouts.

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,840
And next comes
the news of your death.

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
My...

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
family.

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
My family.

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Regulate your breathing.

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Where is my family?

78
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,240
They are now
in the Ji North Kingdom.

79
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
You cannot reunite with them,

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
but all is well.

81
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Huo Ying.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
The crown prince saved your life.

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,840
You repaid his kindness
for 17 years.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
I have saved you countless times.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,560
Even a hundred years of repayment
would still fall short.

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Huo Ying.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will not let you die.

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,120
I already have someone in my heart.

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
I do not wish to deceive you.

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
But my life...

91
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,560
belongs to you from now on.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Get some rest.

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Are you pretending to be asleep?

94
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
What is this?

95
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,160
Now you are shy?

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Your Highness.

97
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
There is news from the palace.

98
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
The Emperor of South Hui has agreed
to cede three prefectures...

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and open border markets for trade.

100
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
To show such cowardice...

101
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
is truly unexpected.

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
I am slow-witted.

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,600
You mean to talk
about the marriage alliance?

104
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,560
Xiao Shu He devotes himself
to poetry and books,

105
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
and his nature is weak.

106
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,440
If the marriage alliance succeeds,

107
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
let alone the land
of the three prefectures,

108
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
but even the fate
of the entire South Hui Kingdom...

109
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
will be at its end.

110
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
This way,

111
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
we may accomplish more with less.

112
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,960
Why give up on Xiao Shu He?

113
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
You are just in time.

114
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Let us have breakfast.

115
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Your Highness.

116
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
What is the matter?

117
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,040
The abbot of Hanshan Temple
sent a monk to deliver a message.

118
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,799
He said, at Hanshan Temple,

119
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
there is an old acquaintance
of Your Highness's retainer.

120
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
He invites Your Highness...

121
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:45,760
and Young Master Duan
over for a meeting.

122
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Hanshan Temple?

123
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Yes.

124
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
They found Huai Yi.

125
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,119
To be born human is rare,

126
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,200
and to hear the Dharma is rarer.

127
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,840
You have lived in the temple
since you were young.

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
Thus, it shows your affinity
with the Buddha's teaching.

129
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Today, you shave away your hair,

130
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,520
cutting off three thousand strands
of affliction.

131
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,319
This body is devoted to...

132
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,560
the Three Jewels
of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

133
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,200
May you soon see
the light of your own nature...

134
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
and continue the wisdom-life
of the Buddha.

135
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
I have no root of wisdom.

136
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,160
It is just that when I was young,

137
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
my family was massacred,

138
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
and I was separated from my brother.

139
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,320
I no longer have any attachments.

140
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,560
The pain of losing my family...

141
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
led me to perceive
the truth of emptiness.

142
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,400
From now on,

143
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,560
I will regard everything
the world treats me with...

144
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
as a courtesy.

145
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
I have no desire.

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I seek nothing.

147
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,519
Amitabha.

148
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
The abbot of White Cloud Temple...

149
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
told me to look for someone here.

150
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
May I know...

151
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
who you are looking for?

152
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,560
My long-lost brother.

153
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,040
May I know your name?

154
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Duan Zi Ang.

155
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
How can you prove it?

156
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,600
When my brother was young,
he never called me "elder brother."

157
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He only called me "big brother."

158
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
At the hollow of his right hand...

159
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,440
lies the scar of a snake's bite
that he took for me.

160
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Big Brother.

161
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
You standing in front of me...

162
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,520
really feels like a dream.

163
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,720
I have been looking
for you all these years.

164
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,519
How did you find me?

165
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I...

166
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
I got help from a benefactor.

167
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
When you see him later,

168
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,640
you must thank him properly.

169
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Of course.

170
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,000
I was fostered here
since I was young.

171
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,400
I had planned to take tonsure today.

172
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
But the abbot said...

173
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,680
I am not yet free
of worldly entanglements.

174
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
I can go with you.

175
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Good.

176
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
We will never be apart again.

177
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
All right.

178
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,440
Pack your things first.

179
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
All right.

180
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Was it Huai Yi?

181
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,680
Shu He, it really is Huai Yi.

182
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,200
After he packs his bags,

183
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,480
he will go back with us.

184
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Great.

185
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
Now you can finally reunite
with your brother.

186
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,079
Soon, we may also be free...

187
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
to roam the four corners
of the land.

188
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,440
I will not let you down.

189
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,600
Let us go back and think of a way...

190
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
to be free as soon as possible.

191
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
All right.

192
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Go to the carriage first.

193
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
When he finishes packing,

194
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
we will leave together.

195
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
- Very well.
- All right.

196
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Urgent summons.

197
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:05,800
Return at once to the liaison spot.

198
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,600
Your Highness,
Prime Minister Gu is here.

199
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Your Highness.

200
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,399
His Majesty ordered
the Imperial Guards...

201
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,480
to search the Sixth Prince's Manor.

202
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,080
I did not have a chance
to make a move.

203
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,680
I could not find any clues.

204
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,440
What about the retainer
from Ji North Kingdom?

205
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,080
He has disappeared.

206
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Why did Zi Ang not get in
the carriage?

207
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
He said he had an urgent matter.

208
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,840
Did he say what it was about?

209
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,320
He seemed to be in a hurry,
so I did not ask.

210
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,040
Huai Yi, do you still remember?

211
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,000
I went to the Duan Manor
to play when I was little.

212
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
When we were little,

213
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,840
my brother often brought
his friends over.

214
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
It is fine if you do not remember.

215
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,840
You were too young then.

216
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
But no matter what,

217
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,280
thanks to
Young Master Shu He's help,

218
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,920
I was able to reunite
with my brother.

219
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Think nothing of it.

220
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,759
I am just happy
that I was able to resolve...

221
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
the knot in his heart.

222
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,519
Soon, we will be able to live...

223
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,800
the life that our hearts desire.

224
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,400
My brother wants
to wander the world with you.

225
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Indeed.

226
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,080
It is our shared wish.

227
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
Congratulations, Your Highness,

228
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,520
for reuniting the two Duan brothers.

229
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
This is the abbot
of White Cloud Temple.

230
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Have a good rest.

231
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,280
I will go and speak with the abbot.

232
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Thanks to you,

233
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,959
Zi Ang was able to find
his brother...

234
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,280
in Hanshan Temple.

235
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
Now that they have reunited,

236
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,279
I see Zi Ang's face...

237
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,320
has regained some color.

238
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
The account book.

239
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,600
I shall leave it
in your care, Abbot.

240
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,640
Good, good.

241
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,600
The rekindling of brotherly ties...

242
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
by Your Highness...

243
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,720
is an act of great merit.

244
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,600
But I sense some melancholy...

245
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,320
in Your Highness's expression.

246
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
I am just afraid...

247
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,200
that he is going to
cast aside certain things.

248
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,520
That is the source...

249
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,120
of human suffering.

250
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Your Highness...

251
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,320
has also fallen into greed.

252
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,680
Do not covet what others...

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
can give you.

254
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Seek only...

255
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
what you can give.

256
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Only by letting go...

257
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
can one be liberated.

258
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,480
Thank you for your teachings, Abbot.

259
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
May I ask...

260
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,960
how you find Huai Yi?

261
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,519
That day, the crown prince
of Ji North Kingdom...

262
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,560
came to pray before the Buddha.

263
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,640
He saw the painting.

264
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,600
By chance,
the servant provided a clue.

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Thus, we found Duan Huai Yi
at Hanshan Temple.

266
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
How did a servant
of the Ji North Kingdom...

267
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
recognize that painting?

268
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
I do not know either.

269
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
It is getting late.

270
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,600
You should go back, Abbot.

271
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Huo Ying.

272
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
What are you doing?

273
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
I am guilty.

274
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
This has nothing to do with you.

275
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,800
I know the crown prince
is behind this cruel act.

276
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,800
No need to blame yourself.

277
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
I...

278
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,120
I have another matter to report.

279
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Tell me.

280
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
Do you still remember this sword?

281
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Of course.

282
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,840
It was supposed to be
my coming-of-age gift.

283
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
When Your Highness
gave me this sword,

284
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I once said...

285
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
I would be loyal...

286
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
and protect Your Highness
all my life.

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I...

288
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
I have broken my promise.

289
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
All these years,

290
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,360
the crown prince has been
controlling me with Blood Dove.

291
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,359
He forced me to reveal...

292
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,400
Your Highness's movements
every month.

293
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
How long has it been?

294
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Over five years.

295
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
Before that, Your Highness
neglected state affairs.

296
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,800
So the crown prince
asked nothing of me.

297
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
It is just...

298
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,560
It is just that the crown prince
did not expect...

299
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,440
I would join the court one day.

300
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Yes.

301
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,520
The Blood Dove's poison is vicious.

302
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,040
One of its components
has long been lost.

303
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,200
I did not expect
the crown prince to have it.

304
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
During the marriage alliance
a few days ago,

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,520
the crown prince
gave me a waist token...

306
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,400
and asked me
to put it in your study.

307
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Now that I think about it,

308
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,760
it should be a token
of the Red Shadow Guards.

309
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,880
The crown prince is so affected
by his desire for power.

310
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
I have done too many harmful things
to Your Highness.

311
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,720
I can no longer seek forgiveness.

312
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
You had no choice.

313
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
I do not blame you.

314
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,480
Besides, you had
a chance to escape.

315
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,440
But you chose
to come here and apologize,

316
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
revealing everything...

317
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:52,640
so I could understand
the whole picture.

318
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I will not blame you.

319
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

320
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,800
I am just worried that...

321
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,800
in striving for the great vision
of the South Hui Kingdom,

322
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,800
Shu Qian may be consumed
by obsession...

323
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,600
and ultimately bring ruin
upon himself.

324
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,240
Why did you dodge?

325
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,600
Spare me, Your Highness.

326
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I am...

327
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
afraid.

328
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,359
Do you think my swordsmanship
is so poor...

329
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
that I could cut off your hand?

330
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
You do not believe me.

331
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
You are afraid of this and that.

332
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,520
Do you not believe that I,
the Crown Prince of South Hui,

333
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,800
can achieve great things?

334
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,520
The crown prince's swordsmanship...

335
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,280
is the best in the world.

336
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
Others do not believe it.

337
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,480
That is due to...

338
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,280
their narrow vision.

339
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Forgive my shortcomings,
Grand Tutor.

340
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
You may leave.

341
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
The plan has yet to succeed.

342
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,880
Do not take out your anger
on the servants.

343
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,880
The tale of Fan Jiang and Zhang Da
assassinating Zhang Fei.

344
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,160
I have been teaching you
since you were little.

345
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,600
I wish these lowlifes
had the guts to do so.

346
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
Now, the South Hui Kingdom...

347
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
is almost annexed
to the Ji North Kingdom.

348
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,080
Yet none of the civil
or military officials shows concern.

349
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
Today, I observed...

350
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,280
the officials in court.

351
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
All of them think...

352
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,640
that the two states are on the path
to a harmonious relationship.

353
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,440
If I disagree,

354
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,240
I am afraid next time,

355
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,560
I will not be able to attend
the imperial court.

356
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
After all this effort,

357
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
can Father still not...

358
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,160
take a firm stand
against the Ji North Kingdom?

359
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,000
In the South Hui Kingdom,

360
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
the call for peace...

361
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,320
has already become
the general trend.

362
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Now,

363
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,840
we can only change our strategy.

364
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,480
And what advice do you have,
Grand Tutor?

365
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,000
Your Highness.

366
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,280
I have found out...

367
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
the whereabouts
of the Crown Prince of Ji North.

368
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
If the Crown Prince of Ji North...

369
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,200
is assassinated
in South Hui Kingdom,

370
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,760
do Your Highness think...

371
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
the Ji North Kingdom...

372
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
will still be willing to make peace?

373
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,000
If relations between the two states
turn hostile,

374
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,480
Your Highness
and the war factions...

375
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,640
can regain power.

376
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,720
Assassinate
the Crown Prince of Ji North?

377
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,360
Grand Tutor, do you not think...

378
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,160
this plan is too dangerous?

379
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
The Emperor
has grown foolish and dull.

380
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,160
The South Hui Kingdom...

381
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,320
needs its crown prince.

382
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
I am here today to tell you this.

383
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,840
I no longer wish to pledge loyalty
to the Red Shadow Guards.

384
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,360
I can bear any price,

385
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,320
as long as Sixth Prince Shu He
remains unharmed.

386
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
It seems like...

387
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,400
you have prepared the poisoned wine.

388
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No.

389
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
Your skills cannot harm me at all.

390
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,400
The marriage alliance
has already failed.

391
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,880
Why are you still staying
in South Hui?

392
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
Marriage alliance?

393
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,840
To the South Hui Kingdom,

394
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
it is a desperate act,

395
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,040
like drinking poison
to quench thirst.

396
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
It is not important at all.

397
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,720
War between the North
and South is inevitable.

398
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
I am here...

399
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:47,680
to see you.

400
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,400
Just to see me?

401
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,600
Each Chief
of the Red Shadow Guards...

402
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,480
must be the Emperor's own brother.

403
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,280
So, after I become Emperor,

404
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,320
it is only right
that you take the seat...

405
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,760
as Chief of the Red Shadow Guards.

406
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Right.

407
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,400
General Duan is a righteous man.

408
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
He treats you like family.

409
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,720
No wonder
you never suspected anything.

410
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,440
I am a descendant
of the imperial family of Ji North.

411
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,040
A bloodline split in two.
One in the open, one kept in shadow.

412
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Brother.

413
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,280
He is my son too.

414
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,520
From the moment he was born,

415
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,840
he did not have a choice.

416
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,280
That is the very reason.

417
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Otherwise, why do you think...

418
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,600
there is no crow tattoo
on your back?

419
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,200
Come back to Ji North with me.

420
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,080
We can definitely achieve
something great together...

421
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,920
and benefit the people.

422
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I know.

423
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,160
You just reunited
with your long-lost brother.

424
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
Although he is
from the South Hui Kingdom,

425
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,000
you two are very close.

426
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,760
As long as he is willing
to follow you,

427
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
I will not hold it against him.

428
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I cannot go.

429
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
It seems like...

430
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,199
there is someone
you cannot let go of...

431
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
in the South Hui Kingdom.

432
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
It matters not.

433
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I can wait for you.

434
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,480
Sooner or later, you will realize...

435
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
that what you are doing now...

436
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:40,640
is just a waste of time.

437
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,360
Your identity...

438
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,400
has already destined you
to part from him.

439
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,320
You are a talented person.

440
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,880
And I want to be a wise ruler
in the future.

441
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,920
That taste of yearning
to make one's mark...

442
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,080
I know it all too well.

443
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,640
You and I share the same blood.

444
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,560
That is why I know...

445
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,160
you will come back sooner or later.

446
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Wait!

447
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
My mother.

448
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
What did she look like?

449
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,560
The late Emperor was cruel.

450
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,880
He did not leave a single portrait.

451
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,200
But after Lady Yan
was granted death,

452
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,680
a poem spread in the palace.

453
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,720
It is said that the late Emperor
wrote it to mourn her.

454
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,960
Do you still remember it?

455
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Your Highness,

456
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
we have figured out...

457
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,280
the whereabouts
of the Crown Prince of Ji North.

458
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,480
We have set up a trap in a place...

459
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
easy to attack but hard to defend.

460
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,800
We now await your command.

461
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Good.

462
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,760
Do not let a word of this get out.

463
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Yes, Your Highness.

464
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,160
Find all the herbs in this letter.

465
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Your Highness.

466
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Among them,

467
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,920
the herb coldgrass...

468
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,440
only grows in the far north,

469
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
and the last time it was seen...

470
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,480
was already 10 years ago.

471
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
No matter what it takes,

472
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,200
find all the herbs for this formula.

473
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,760
(Mountain)

475
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
What happened?

476
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Why are you sighing?

477
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,440
You used to have
excellent handwriting.

478
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,280
It breaks my heart
to see you like this.

479
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,160
Save your sighs
for your poor handwriting.

480
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
I now write with my other hand,

481
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,360
but I am still better
than a certain someone.

482
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
What is the matter?

483
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Well...

484
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Nothing.

485
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,400
On my way back,

486
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,600
I heard a poem.

487
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,680
I did not understand a few parts.

488
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,040
It is rare for you to be
in the mood for poetry.

489
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Tell me.

490
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,120
Her brows borrow from distant hills,
three shades of dark green.

491
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,559
Her temples steal
from the clouds of Mount Wu,

492
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,240
a wisp of gray.

493
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,760
Her smooth, fair hands
once softened into dew.

494
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,240
While lingering musk
still clings to her pillow.

495
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,039
Reluctantly,
I cast this baneful beauty...

496
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,200
back to the rivers and seas.

497
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,040
The fate of the realm outweighs...

498
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,080
the mound of your bones.

499
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
I have heard this poem before.

500
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
How do you know?

501
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,280
I have been collecting poems
since I was young.

502
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,719
I remember this
as a poem of mourning,

503
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,759
written by
the Emperor of Ji North...

504
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
after he ordered
a maidservant to her death.

505
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,840
I was very interested,
so I asked someone about it.

506
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Then what do you think?

507
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,600
This may be a poem of mourning,

508
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,360
but it is extremely arrogant.

509
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440
"Her brows borrow
from distant hills..."

510
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,840
and "her temples steal
from the clouds of Mount Wu..."

511
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
seem to say,

512
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:48,479
the woman has a face...

513
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,600
that does not belong to her.

514
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,760
The usage of "baneful beauty"
shirks responsibility...

515
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
and blames the woman
for his misrule.

516
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,640
Do you know more
about this maidservant?

517
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
No.

518
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,800
I do not know much
about the matters in Ji North.

519
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Zi Ang.

520
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
What is wrong with you?

521
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
Nothing.

522
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,960
I just feel that a woman...

523
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
wasted her feelings.

524
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
It breaks my heart.

525
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,280
I know you are kind,

526
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
but I did not know...

527
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:31,240
you have such a delicate side.

528
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,880
It seems
I have not known you well enough.

529
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,000
Then I hope we may be together
to the end of time.

530
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,000
Maybe one day,

531
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
I will know you fully.

532
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Come with me.
