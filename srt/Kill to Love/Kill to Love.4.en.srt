00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,920
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,800
Go to court tomorrow?

3
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,120
Your Highness,

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,840
what are you thinking?

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,960
You don't have
to be so angry, Shen Song.

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,520
I haven't changed my plan.

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,440
I just need to postpone it.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,520
It's hard enough
for you to leave now.

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,040
If you join the imperial court,

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,760
would His Majesty ever let you go?

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,600
What's done is done.
I have no choice.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,480
You don't have to worry about me.

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,880
In history's struggles
for the crown prince's position,

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
might made right.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,120
Few ever had a happy ending.

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,520
Your Highness,

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,960
you are aware of the risks.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Could it be...

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,240
that Your Highness is doing this
for Duan Zi Ang?

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,640
Then you will definitely
meet the crown prince.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,680
Have you decided how to face him?

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,720
Even if he doesn't trust me,

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,800
he is family after all.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,280
We can't be separated.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
There are no brothers
before the throne.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,840
The bonds of blood are
as unsubstantial as the clouds.

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Shu He,

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,960
don't go against the crown prince.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,040
I never intended
to be in the middle of it.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,960
But I'm still in the middle of it.

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Who is it?

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
Zi Ang, it's me.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Shu He.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
I saw the light in your room.

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
I thought you might not
be asleep yet.

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
Yes, I'm not asleep yet.

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Sit down and talk.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,960
You went out so late.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,320
You must have something
on your mind.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Why are you dressed so luxuriously?

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,880
Do you like it?

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,880
This is what Father gave me.

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,320
It's mountain river brocade.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,119
Didn't you always hide away
because you worried...

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
that the crown prince
would be paranoid?

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,320
If I enter the imperial court,

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,840
will you think I'm a hypocrite?

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
You've never cared
about these things.

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,080
It's fine
if there's a reason behind it.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
But if you want to tell me,

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,960
I'll surely listen.

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,560
If I enter the imperial court,

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,240
I won't be able
to avoid doing bad deeds...

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
and catering to the powerful.

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,320
What will you think of me?

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
You must have your reasons.

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,320
I only believe
in the Xiao Shu He that I see.

58
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
He has a pure heart.

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,400
He is virtuous
even when no one is watching.

60
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
But this way,
you and the crown prince...

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,880
will be fine.

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,199
The only thing in this world
that cannot be traded for money...

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,280
is genuine affection.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
I've already got what I want.

65
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,840
Shen Song.

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,120
What's the matter, Zi Ang?

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
She He...

68
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,960
His Highness left
in a mountain river brocade outfit.

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
Is it...

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,920
Yes, His Highness is going
to the imperial court today.

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,520
Your Majesty, if Ji North
raises taxes on us again,

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm afraid our state...

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,999
- Approve it.
- Your Majesty.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,319
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
advised that the street lanterns...

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,200
Annoying prattle.
Let them do as they wish.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,919
Recently, there have been
many thefts in the capital...

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,400
targeting court officials.

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
Sixth Prince Shu He
is waiting outside.

79
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,120
The Imperial Guards are
severely understaffed.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
His Highness has been waiting
for a long time.

81
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
I think...

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,200
Summon him. Summon Shu He.

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,960
Summon Sixth Prince Shu He.

84
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,879
- Why is he here?
- I don't know.

85
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,040
Why did His Majesty allow him
to come?

86
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
It's the mountain river brocade
that His Majesty gifted him.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
Didn't he want
to be a carefree wanderer?

88
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
Who knows?

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
Greetings, Father.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Long live Father.

91
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Rise.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,479
I think the imperial guards...

93
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Let's discuss this later.

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,519
I had just heard that you,
the profligate son,

95
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,760
wanted to share my burdens.

96
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
I didn't expect you
to be here today.

97
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
I've been obsessed
with poetry for too long.

98
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,720
I've recently realized
the importance of this kingdom.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,840
I'm willing to contribute
to the kingdom and you, Father.

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,920
- That's good.
- That is worth celebrating.

101
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Good.

102
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Good.

103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Good!

104
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,559
You've never been involved
in state affairs.

105
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
Learn from your brother first.

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,800
I thought His Highness never
bothered with state affairs.

107
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Duan Zi Ang,

108
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,120
don't let His Highness down.

109
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,879
Court dismissed.

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,319
- Goodbye, Your Majesty.
- Goodbye, Your Majesty.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, Father.

112
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Your Highness,
you finally came out of seclusion.

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,959
We're all looking forward
to seeing you...

114
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,120
share His Majesty's burdens.

115
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
Prime Minister Gu,
you're exaggerating.

116
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,080
Shu He, you are truly...

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
a bolt from the blue.

118
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,079
For having never been
to the imperial court,

119
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,600
you captured so much attention
on your first day.

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Shu Qian, you must be joking.

121
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,439
I didn't capture attention.

122
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
I just don't fit in.

123
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,360
Shu He, don't belittle yourself.

124
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,760
No matter what happened today,

125
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,720
you were able
to share your thoughts.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,599
Father wants me
to share my thoughts...

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,239
because he sees
that I am shallow-minded...

128
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,279
and speak childishly.

129
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,360
He just wants to teach me.

130
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,720
Father wants me to learn from you.

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,920
You are still the most favored
by His Majesty.

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Xiao Shu He,

133
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,640
if you can tell me frankly
what you want,

134
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,480
I'll be impressed with you.

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,639
I'm a citizen of the nation.

136
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I'm also a prince.

137
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,640
I receive the people's offerings.

138
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,239
I should be loyal and responsible...

139
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
and fulfill my duties.

140
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,999
Every day, you bragged
about your indifference...

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
to fame and fortune.

142
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Now that I think about it,

143
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,320
it was just one of your tricks.

144
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Your Highness,

145
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I also don't know...

146
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,640
why Prince Shu He
suddenly showed up in court today.

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,280
As Xiao Shu He's personal guard,

148
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,760
would you be completely unaware
that he had such a big plan?

149
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Huo Ying.

150
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,120
How can I trust you?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
I really didn't know.

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,600
Ever since that guest arrived
at the manor,

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Prince Shu He
has been sending me away.

154
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,520
Today, Prince Shu He
acted the same as usual.

155
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
You must be loyal to me.

156
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,240
Do you hear me?

157
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,960
You must be loyal to me!

158
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Why?

159
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,840
Why must you all betray me?

160
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
I can't wait any longer.

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Three days.

162
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,600
I'll only give you three days.

163
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,920
I want news of Xiao Shu He's death
within three days!

164
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,320
After you kill Xiao Shu He,

165
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,920
I'll give you
this month's supply of medicine.

166
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Guards, do as usual.

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,200
Huo Ying! Hey!

168
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,440
You've really grown up.

169
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,639
Are Crinis Trachycarpi
and Hairyvein Agrimonia Herb...

170
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
to be used like this?

171
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,080
These two herbs can only
stop the bleeding temporarily.

172
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,239
Applying this much
on a wound for an extended time...

173
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,400
will kill you.

174
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,080
I had to see the crown prince today.

175
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,439
I didn't want the wound
to bleed and stain my clothes...

176
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,479
and trouble the crown prince.

177
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,800
The crown prince.
It's the crown prince again.

178
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
You knew that he would punish you
if you went to see him.

179
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,200
I found these two herbs myself.

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,960
And I used them myself.

181
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
It was originally a minor injury.

182
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,199
After what you've done,

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,680
you won't be able
to get out of bed for a few days.

184
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Don't worry about me.

185
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
I know what I'm doing.

186
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
You know what you're doing?

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,840
If it weren't for me,
you would have died several times.

188
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,560
You don't have to care
whether I live or die.

189
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't worry.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,640
You're ruining your own body.

191
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Even if I'm a miracle physician,
I can't save you.

192
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,919
How can a patient
only treat his wounds...

193
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
but refuse to recuperate?

194
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
Am I really stuck in bed
for two days?

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Under these circumstances,

196
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,680
you must be
on bed rest for two days.

197
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
I can't.

198
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,760
I can't stay in your room for long.

199
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
I'm going back to my room.

200
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,760
You're only damaging your body more.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
How can I stay in your room?

202
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
If you don't help me,

203
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,400
I'll crawl back there myself.

204
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Wait.

205
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I'll help you.

206
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Your Highness,

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,880
you've been cooped up
in your room all day.

208
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
It's time to eat.

209
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

210
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Everyone, leave!

211
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,199
Every day, you bragged
about your indifference...

212
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
to fame and fortune.

213
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,360
Now that I think about it,

214
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,280
it was just one of your tricks.

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,880
Why does it sound so awful?

216
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,199
Zi Ang?

217
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,320
Shu He.

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,399
When I was traveling,
I heard someone play a melody...

219
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,520
called "Cloud Water Lullaby".

220
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
What do you think of it?

221
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,080
It's very good.

222
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,840
Zi Ang, you have a talent
for music.

223
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,040
Shu He,

224
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,920
aren't you going to teach me?

225
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,159
I heard you were in a bad mood,

226
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,200
so I thought of a way
to cheer you up.

227
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,040
That's why I asked the servants
to find a zither.

228
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,160
But pity on your ears.

229
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm really sorry.

230
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,840
This zither hasn't
been maintained for a long time.

231
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,839
You need to change the way
you pluck the strings...

232
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
to make it sound better.

233
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
Did things not go well
at the imperial court today?

234
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Everything happened as I expected.

235
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,079
I don't think the outdoor fair
for the Nine Nights Festival...

236
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
is over yet.

237
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
Shu He, take a walk with me.

238
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Now?

239
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,400
We can leave separately.

240
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
If you can find me in the crowd,

241
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,880
I promise to give you a small gift.

242
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Who are you?

243
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
My mistake.

244
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
You lost.

245
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Earlier, you told me
to look for you.

246
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,640
Now, you've come to me.

247
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
Why doesn't that count
as me finding you?

248
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,520
You are still as eloquent as ever.

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,320
In that case,

250
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll keep my promise.

251
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
I didn't expect you
to have this inclination.

252
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,240
I thought it was fun
when I was little.

253
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,080
After that, whenever I missed home,

254
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,720
I would climb
to the highest point on the roof.

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,440
Because only from this angle...

256
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,640
does everything in the world...

257
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,760
look so similar.

258
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,320
Zi Ang, what do you
think of South Hui now?

259
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
I think the world is
mostly the same.

260
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,960
When the dynasty prospers,
the people suffer.

261
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,560
When the dynasty falls,
the people suffer.

262
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm curious.

263
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,360
After spending these days with you,

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,599
you seem different
from those people...

265
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,999
who only care
for fame and fortune...

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
and don't care about the people.

267
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,600
If you have the power
to change the world,

268
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,160
why haven't you done anything
over the years?

269
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
There are many injustices
in the world.

270
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,880
What can one person do?

271
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Everyone has their own fate.

272
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,880
But the fate of most people
in this world...

273
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,920
are not in their own hands.

274
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,720
It's bustling
with people down there.

275
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,160
The future of every household.

276
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,560
will change
because of one person's decision.

277
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
Instead of trusting it to others
as if it's a gamble,

278
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,160
it would be better
if that person is Xiao Shu He.

279
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
At least the world...

280
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
won't get worse.

281
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,400
The ruling and opposition factions
of South Hui are intertwined.

282
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,800
They've been rotten
for a long time.

283
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
On the surface, it looks prosperous.

284
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
Up close, it's all
made up of white bones...

285
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,520
that can't be shaken.

286
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,840
In such a situation,

287
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
if I want to do something,

288
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,640
I must be ruthless.

289
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
I can't do it.

290
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,800
No matter what you choose,

291
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,080
I believe in you.

292
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Huo Ying.

293
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Huo Ying.

294
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
I told you not to sleep so early.

295
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
How can I eat all of this by myself?

296
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Forget it.

297
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,600
Have it for your breakfast.

298
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,559
Your Highness, we've found out...

299
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,679
that the owner of the mill
on East Street...

300
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
is indeed from Ji North.

301
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,840
The original owner
disappeared half a month ago.

302
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,799
I see.

303
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,480
Keep a close eye on it
for the next few days.

304
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,000
If anyone suspicious goes
to the mill, take action.

305
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,520
As you wish.

306
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,720
How did you get in here?
Aren't you afraid of exposing me?

307
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,040
Lately, I've noticed that someone
purposely approached the mill.

308
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,359
We might have been exposed.

309
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,439
To be on the safe side,

310
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
let's leave tonight.

311
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
That's impossible.

312
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,040
I was with Xiao Shu He all night.

313
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
There's no way
he could have found out.

314
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,760
It might not be the prince's men.

315
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,640
We don't have a chance
to carry out our plan.

316
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,160
We don't have to take this risk.

317
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,200
Zi Ang.

318
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,600
Let's drink some more!

319
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,560
Duan Zi Ang, are you crazy?

320
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,400
As long as he's alive,
neither of us will survive.

321
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Huo Ying!

322
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Who dares to do this?

323
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,240
Your Highness,
I'll go after him with soldiers.

324
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Stop.

325
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,080
Search every corner of the manor.

326
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,480
Don't let anyone else know.

327
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,120
- Your Highness!
- Don't let anyone else know.

328
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,000
What happened tonight
stays between us.

329
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
You may go.

330
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,040
Can I hear the truth from you?

331
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,560
Are you connected
to Ji North Kingdom?

332
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,560
I did come here
for the crown prince.

333
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,560
But I have nothing
to do with Ji North.

334
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,560
It's true that I was in exile.

335
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,440
It's also true that I was adopted
by a salt merchant.

336
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,479
It's just that in the process,

337
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,080
I met a lot of martial artists.

338
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
For revenge,

339
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,240
I learned martial arts from them.

340
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,240
So you're not here
to look for your brother.

341
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,039
It's true that I miss Huai Yi.

342
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
I did come to look for him.

343
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
But when I was in exile,

344
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
I almost died too.

345
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,080
Huai Yi was too young back then.

346
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
I don't know if he's still alive.

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,680
Who was the one
who just tried to assassinate me?

348
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,200
Just a swordsman I trained with
when I was young.

349
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,600
Besides, a failed assassination
on the crown prince...

350
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,560
is still a capital offense.

351
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,480
Are you here
to assassinate the crown prince?

352
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,080
What else did you do behind my back?

353
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,079
I was with Your Highness
all this time.

354
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,160
I didn't do anything.

355
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,120
And all this time,

356
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,200
I never intended
to hurt Your Highness.

357
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,999
Without my permission,

358
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
you can't leave.

359
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Do you think I can't leave?

360
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,320
Shen Song, what did you do?

361
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,920
Are you still going to defend him?

362
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,319
Don't worry, Shu He.

363
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,800
I only knocked him out temporarily.

364
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,480
so that he can't harm Your Highness.

365
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,800
I can disrupt his meridians
with acupuncture...

366
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,440
and seal his martial arts for now.

367
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Will it be harmful?

368
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
No.

369
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,600
Do it.

370
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
I was wrong.

371
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,800
I shouldn't have sneaked out.

372
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,080
Madam Duan told me
to take you with me.

373
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,440
I asked Shen Song
to seal your meridians.

374
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
Now, your skills...

375
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,320
are no different
from an ordinary person.

376
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
Your archery stance...

377
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,360
is better than before.

378
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,880
I have to weigh every word
you say now.

379
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,040
Do you remember our younger days?

380
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Or did you go over every detail
so you could get close to me?

381
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,960
You got up early
to practice archery.

382
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Was it so you could pierce me
with your words?

383
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,280
Let's go to the suburbs
and practice.

384
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Wait.

385
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,440
You have to wait for your prey
to let its guard down...

386
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,400
so you can kill them
with one strike.

387
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,440
All this time,

388
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,360
have you been waiting for me
to let my guard down?

389
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,800
If I make you feel so uneasy,

390
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,360
just kill me right here.

391
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,400
I'll help you find your brother.

392
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,840
For the sake of our friendship,

393
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
you should stop now.

394
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
All right.

395
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
I promise you.

396
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,120
If you really do something harmful
to South Hui,

397
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,480
I won't forgive you.

398
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,760
I won't forgive myself either.

399
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Shu He,

400
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,920
I won't let you down.

401
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,439
If I do find Huai Yi,

402
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
I don't want him
to wander around anymore.

403
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,280
Now that my martial arts skills
have been sealed,

404
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,120
I'm no threat to the crown prince.

405
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Zi Ang,

406
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,040
trust is a fragile thing.

407
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,360
I'm willing to trust you again.

408
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,560
Don't let our friendship go
to waste.

409
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,199
(Ji North Kingdom)

410
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,559
He's willing
to assassinate the crown prince...

411
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,880
for General Duan's sake.

412
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,680
But if he finds out...

413
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,360
that it was all
Prime Minister Gu's doing,

414
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
will he still be loyal
to the Red Shadow Guards?

415
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Back then,

416
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,840
you were too impulsive.

417
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,359
I'm indebted to General Duan
of the South Hui Kingdom...

418
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,400
for saving my life.

419
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,920
I entrusted the child
to him back then...

420
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,400
because the child's mother
had begged me...

421
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
to protect him
until he became an adult.

422
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,720
I never expected...

423
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,480
that a sudden disaster
would befall General Duan.

424
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,120
One child is in the light,
and one is in the dark.

425
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,039
The one in the light
must become a wise ruler...

426
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,120
praised by future generations.

427
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,160
The one in the dark
must do whatever it takes..

428
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,000
to help the wise ruler
secure his kingdom.

429
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,440
That's all I can abide by.

430
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,560
He had no choice since he was born.

431
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,760
Even now, he doesn't know who he is.

432
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
My brother,

433
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,560
he is my son too.

434
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,600
I couldn't even name my own child!

435
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,320
I should not have said that.

436
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,200
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

437
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,600
How can I blame you?

438
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,160
The head of the Red Shadow Guards...

439
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,280
holds the position...

440
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,120
only for ten years.

441
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
I...

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,080
must leave now.

443
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Yes.

444
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,240
I thought
about what you said that day.

445
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,720
Even if I'm the right person,

446
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,400
I'm not willing
to become someone I despise...

447
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,280
just to get to that position.

448
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,440
I guess I'm a coward.

449
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I don't know.

450
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Shen Song and I
had planned it all out.

451
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,440
I would tell Father my intentions
on my birthday next year.

452
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,480
I would stay far away
from the imperial court...

453
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,160
and be a carefree wanderer.

454
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,360
I had even decided
where to live in seclusion.

455
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
A simple house...

456
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
is enough.

457
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,520
If this isn't the life
that truly makes you happy,

458
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,320
then you don't have to live it.

459
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,040
When we met again
that day at White Cloud Temple,

460
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,040
if I weren't the sixth prince...

461
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,840
but just a commoner,

462
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
would you and I...

463
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,280
still have ended up like this?

464
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
I don't know.

465
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,440
But if you attain the life
that you dream of,

466
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,640
would you invite me
to your paradise?

467
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,120
He didn't come back all night.
What should we do?

468
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,720
Shen Song. Commander Huo.

469
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,800
What is going on?

470
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,079
Your Highness didn't
come back last night.

471
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,200
I was really worried.

472
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,440
If Your Highness didn't
come back today,

473
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
I would have gone out
to look for you.

474
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I'm fine.

475
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,720
I went hunting last night
and traveled a bit too far.

476
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,960
But you look refreshed.

477
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,840
Huo Ying and I
were worried all night.

478
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,960
I shouldn't have done that.

479
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,120
(Sixth Prince's Manor)

480
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,560
Sixth Prince's Manor,
heed the order.

481
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,360
We suspect that a spy from Ji North
is hiding in Sixth Prince's Manor.

482
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,920
We need to conduct a search.

483
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
How dare you?

484
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,760
Do you dare to disobey the order?

485
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,719
Bring Zi Ang to my bedroom.

486
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,479
Unseal Zi Ang's meridians
and hide him.

487
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I'll try to stall them.

488
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,400
Who dares to cause trouble
in front of my residence?

489
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,319
Greetings, Your Highness.

490
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,879
I'm the captain
of the Imperial Guards.

491
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,639
I have orders
to enter Your Highness's manor...

492
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,160
and search for Ji North spies.

493
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,200
Orders? From whom?

494
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,879
If it's Father's order,

495
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,960
I want to see the imperial edict.

496
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,199
It's not His Majesty's order.

497
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,480
The crown prince is
in charge of the capital's defense.

498
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,320
This is my manor.

499
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,959
Without His Majesty's order...

500
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,080
or my permission,

501
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
I'll see who dares
to set foot in my residence.

502
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,279
Bring a message to the crown prince.

503
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,560
Tell him Prince Shu He is
resisting the order.

504
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,440
- How is it going?
- It takes time to unseal meridians.

505
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Why don't we take him away first?

506
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,639
The Imperial Guards have
surrounded the whole manor.

507
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
I'm afraid that will be difficult.

508
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,560
Do the Imperial Guards dare
to break into a prince's manor?

509
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Can Huo Ying stop them?

510
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,720
Of course the Imperial Guards
wouldn't dare.

511
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,360
But I'm not sure
about the person behind it.

512
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,880
I didn't expect this
to happen to you.

513
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
This is my fault.

514
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Why don't I...

515
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,120
We don't need to talk about this.

516
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
What's done is done.

517
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,800
You don't have to apologize.

518
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
Besides, I'm not a kid anymore.

519
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
It's my choice.

520
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,040
It has nothing to do
with other people.

521
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,159
Your Highness,

522
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,320
the crown prince is here.

523
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,640
Your Highness hasn't
visited me in years.

524
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,920
I didn't expect you
to visit me like this.

525
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,520
Shu He, you must be joking.

526
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Recently, the Imperial Guards...

527
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,320
found a Ji North spy hideout
on East Street.

528
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,920
I received a tip...

529
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,840
that this hideout has been
in contact with your residence.

530
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
That's why I had to disturb you.

531
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,760
My residence has been
in contact with Ji North spies?

532
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Do you have proof?

533
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,120
You just joined the imperial court.

534
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,560
It's fine if you don't
understand the reason.

535
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,560
As a prince,

536
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,960
there cannot be any doubts about you
when you serve the nation.

537
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,880
Of course, I trust you.

538
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm just worried...

539
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,880
about the rumors from people
who don't know the truth.

540
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Why don't you let me
prove your innocence?

541
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,880
Does Father know about this?

542
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,439
Father worries
over the nation every day.

543
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,600
He has enough burdens.

544
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,000
Why bother Father
with such trivial matters?

545
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,919
Then...

546
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,080
Shu He, don't be afraid.

547
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
As your brother,

548
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,560
I won't let you
be wrongfully accused.

549
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,480
Imperial Guards, listen up.

550
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,840
Search every inch of the manor.

551
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,400
Don't let Prince Shu He be wronged.

552
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Yes.

553
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,120
Search thoroughly!

554
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,960
- Did you find anything?
- No.

555
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,320
Go that way.

556
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Hurry!

557
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,879
Your Highness,

558
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
we've searched everywhere
in the manor.

559
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
There is nothing
out of the ordinary.

560
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,800
-But...
- But what?

561
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,439
I don't have the right
to enter Prince Shu He's bedroom.

562
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Please give me an order.

563
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,359
What is it?

564
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,600
Do you think
I'll hide a Ji North spy...

565
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,280
in my own bedroom?

566
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
Shu He, you're wrong.

567
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,120
I'm doing this
to prove your innocence.

568
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,760
You are so insistent.

569
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
What will Father think
if he finds out?

570
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,200
Shu He, why are you
mentioning Father?

571
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,519
Everything we do today...

572
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,240
is to share Father's burdens,
isn't it?

573
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,440
You keep resisting.

574
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,400
The officials will be suspicious
when they hear about it.

575
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,400
It won't bode well
for your future in the court.

576
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,960
- I...
- Why don't I accompany you there?

577
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,480
So that you won't be so worried.

578
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,200
Please forgive me for the offense.

579
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Who are you?
