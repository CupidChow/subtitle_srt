1
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,960
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
Please forgive me for the offense.

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Who are you?

4
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,560
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

5
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,800
Mr. Shen.

6
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,040
I had forgotten that my brother...

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,880
has an elegant friend like you.

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,240
It is an honor...

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
that Your Highness remembers me.

10
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Are you looking for something?

11
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Prime Minister Gu is here.

12
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Crown Prince Shu Qian,

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,560
I have something important
to speak to you about.

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
Please come with me to my manor.

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,120
What is so urgent?

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
Why don't I visit you tomorrow?

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,160
I shouldn't keep Your Highnesses...

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
from catching up.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
But this matter is very urgent.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Catching up?

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,400
This way of catching up...

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
is unheard of to me.

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,440
Aren't Your Highnesses
just catching up today?

24
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,200
If His Majesty hears about this,

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
what would His Majesty think
of Your Highnesses?

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Prime Minister Gu is right.

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Since Prime Minister Gu wants
to see you,

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
I won't keep you, Shu Qian.

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Huo Ying,

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,640
see Prime Minister Gu
and His Highness off for me.

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,760
I'll invite you to my manor
to catch up another time.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Let's go.

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Where is Zi Ang?

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Zi Ang.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,680
You need a few more days
to recover.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,280
I'll prescribe some medicine
tomorrow...

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
to help you
regulate your qi and blood.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,720
Thank you so much, Shen Song.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,639
You promised me.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,720
You can't go back on your word.

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,399
Greetings from Gu Yuan Shan,
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
May Your Majesty be blessed
with good health.

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Prime Minister Gu.

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,760
When we were young,

45
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,080
you always said...

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,720
that pride harms
and humility benefits.

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,320
What a pity.

48
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,360
Although I understand this,

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
my sons do not.

50
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Father,

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,560
the Ji North spy liaison point
that I shut down two days ago...

52
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,720
is only a few miles away...

53
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
from Shu He's residence.

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Let me ask you.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
You searched
the residence yesterday.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,320
What was the result?

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,320
The Ji North spy was very cunning.

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,959
- I believe...
- I'm asking about the result.

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,320
What was the result?

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Shu He, tell me.

61
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Father,

62
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,439
I just joined the imperial court.

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
I don't understand
the ways of the court yet.

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,319
What Crown Prince Shu Qian did...

65
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
must have been for my safety.

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,040
I beg you, Father.

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,640
Please don't
blame Crown Prince Shu Qian.

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,360
Although your brother pleaded
for you,

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,840
you still need
to reflect on yourself.

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Shu He,

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,280
I've arranged your marriage for you.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
Princess Wen Jing of Ji North
has admired you for a long time.

73
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,320
I've agreed to a marriage alliance
with the Ji North Kingdom.

74
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,400
Considering the date,

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,360
the marriage alliance delegation
should be on its way.

76
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
They will arrive soon.

77
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,760
Your Majesty, please do not do this.

78
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,199
Ji North has been
eyeing our kingdom...

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
for a long time!

80
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,040
This is as good as inviting a wolf
into our home!

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
It might cause big trouble.

82
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,040
Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

83
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,640
Father, I'm still young
and immature. I'm afraid...

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,720
I've made up my mind.
There is nothing more to say.

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Shu Qian,

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,720
I am putting you
in charge of this matter.

87
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
We'll hold a poetry and wine banquet
at Shu He's residence tomorrow...

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
to welcome the delegation.

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Make no mistakes.

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,959
- Yes.
- Your Majesty.

91
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
Do not do this.

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Leave.

93
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,080
- I will take my leave.
- I will take my leave.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,440
This is ridiculous!

95
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,520
Ji North has gone too far.

96
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,360
How could Father be so foolish?

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Your Highness,

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,640
although the blade is sharp,

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,280
it will break easily
if it is too unyielding.

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,680
Retract your claws
and go with the flow.

101
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,720
That is the best strategy.

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,560
Prime Minister Gu,

103
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,160
did you already know about this?

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,560
Your Highness,
if you don't trust me,

105
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,360
what's the point of my staying here?

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Forget it.

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,680
The marriage alliance delegation
is already on its way.

108
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,120
If I make another mistake,

109
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm afraid my position
in Father's heart...

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
will be in jeopardy.

111
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Your Highness,

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,320
Prince Shu He
is still inexperienced.

113
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
He might not be able to see through
this.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
This marriage alliance
with Ji North...

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,960
is an opportunity
to support Prince Shu He.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,440
Secondly, it is an opportunity
to plant spies in our court.

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
It kills two birds with one stone.

118
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,320
However, for our kingdom,

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,880
nothing good will come out of it.

120
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Then why did Father agree to it?

121
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Your Highness,

122
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,879
this marriage alliance...

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,359
will exempt the South Kingdom...

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,840
from half the annual silver tribute
to the North Kingdom.

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
But once this precedent is set,

126
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm afraid there will be no hope
for the revival of South Hui.

127
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
What do you mean?

128
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Why don't we...

129
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
kill two birds with one stone...

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,120
and reap the benefits?

131
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,640
Commander Huo,
you were so impressive yesterday.

133
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,480
When you confronted
the Imperial Guards,

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,799
did you consider the phrase,

135
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,160
"When the clever rabbit is dead,
the hunting dog is cooked"?

136
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Shu He can reward you
for guarding the manor.

137
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,280
But can he give you
Rhino Horn Pills?

138
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,039
Your Highness, you are wise.

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,640
I am loyal to you.

140
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I will never betray you.

141
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,400
Plant this in the secret compartment
of Xiao Shu He's study.

142
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,480
After the job is done,

143
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
I'll give you the antidote
for the Blood Dove.

144
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,760
Prince Shu He...

145
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,880
has no intention of harming you.

146
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
A mere Shadow Guard has no right
to worry about a prince.

147
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Don't forget...

148
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,880
the feel
of the Blood Dove's effects.

149
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,080
When your intestines rupture,

150
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,880
you will be
no better than a stray dog.

151
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,000
I accept your command.

152
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
You may leave.

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,000
Remember
to clean up the bloodstains.

154
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,240
Don't stain Shu He's study.

155
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
The marriage alliance delegation
will arrive tomorrow.

156
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,199
Don't let the crown prince
ruin the marriage alliance...

157
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,080
between Prince Shu He
and the princess.

158
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Marriage alliance?

159
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,360
Plant this in the secret compartment
of Xiao Shu He's study.

160
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Don't forget the feel
of the Blood Dove's effects.

161
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,880
You know the best places
for some peace and quiet.

162
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
So you're hiding in this paradise.

163
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,280
But you still found me.

164
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,199
Amateur recluses hide in the wild.

165
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,360
Expert recluses hide in the city.

166
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Shu He,

167
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
you can't hide forever.

168
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
Princess Wen Jing
of the Ji North Kingdom.

169
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,720
Eunuch Huo relayed
His Majesty's verbal decree.

170
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
Tomorrow's
marriage alliance poetry meeting...

171
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,919
must be held
according to the old customs...

172
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
of South Hui.

173
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
I don't have a choice.

174
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
You say that...

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,640
like a brokenhearted man
who has been torn from his beloved.

176
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,120
Why do you have
to say it so plainly?

177
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,400
If you really want to leave,

178
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,960
I heard that the abbot
of White Cloud Temple...

179
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,840
has a secret medicine
that can fake one's death.

180
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,600
Is it because of Zi Ang?

181
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,240
After just a few months with him,

182
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,280
you're ready to give up on
what you've been planning for years.

183
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,080
Do you know...

184
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,800
why I love this place?

185
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,640
Because of the plum blossoms here?

186
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,840
When I was in trouble as a kid,

187
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,920
Zi Ang brought me here.

188
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,559
After the incident
at General Duan's residence,

189
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
he went missing.

190
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Zi Ang.

191
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Zi Ang!

192
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,520
Zi Ang!

193
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Every time I come here,

194
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm reminded of the old days.

195
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,960
His whereabouts have been exposed.

196
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
If he stays at the manor,

197
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm afraid more trouble will come.

198
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
Why don't you ask Zi Ang
to stay here for the time being?

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
That's a good idea.

200
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,400
But this is
just a temporary measure.

201
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,279
The delegation is coming.

202
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,960
There will be opposition
in the imperial court.

203
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
We need to think carefully...

204
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,080
about what we should do next.

205
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,159
The marriage alliance delegation
will arrive tomorrow.

206
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,479
Don't let the crown prince
ruin the marriage alliance...

207
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,960
between Prince Shu He
and the princess.

208
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,280
Why are you drinking alone?
(Watch on www.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

209
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,560
Your Highness is busy.

210
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,760
How do you have time
to bother with me?

211
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,080
The crown prince
searched the manor last night.

212
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,520
Knowing him,

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
he won't stop at that.

214
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,120
What does he want?

215
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
What does it have to do
with you and me?

216
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm afraid...

217
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
he will cause more trouble.

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,920
With the crown prince's
incompetent men?

219
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,120
No matter how strong you are,

220
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,040
you're no match for the elite troops
under the crown prince's command.

221
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,280
I have a villa in the suburbs.

222
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,240
You can hide there for a few days.

223
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Hide?

224
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,200
How long is a few days?

225
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Ten days?

226
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Half a month?

227
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,760
Or after you
and Princess Wen Jing are married?

228
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,240
Did Shen Song tell you?

229
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,240
A marriage between the North
and the South Kingdoms...

230
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
can stop the war.

231
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,920
I don't need Shen Song
to tell me such a big thing.

232
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
What an incredible achievement.

233
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,000
Soon after you get married,

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
you will be accomplished.

235
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Why should I stay by your side?

236
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,319
I just wonder
if Princess Wen Jing...

237
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,599
will be willing
to live in seclusion...

238
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,040
and wander the world with you.

239
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,480
I am a prince
of the South Kingdom after all.

240
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,800
Xiao Shu He.

241
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,120
Do you really want
to marry Princess Wen Jing?

242
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,400
So what if I do?

243
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
So what if I don't?

244
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
Who would care?

245
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
In the end,

246
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,080
you think I am no different
from them, don't you?

247
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,959
Who's the man on the horse?

248
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,399
I heard he is
the Crown Prince of Ji North.

249
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,079
He collected so much tax from us...

250
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,240
and took so much money from us.

251
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,599
He doesn't look like a good person.

252
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,960
- Hit him.
- Get lost!

253
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,280
Your Highness, why did you
personally come on this trip?

254
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,519
What are you doing? Put it down!

255
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,759
The people can be made to follow,

256
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,920
but they cannot
be made to understand.

257
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
It's just blind loyalty.

258
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,439
When dynasties change,

259
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
only the people will suffer.

260
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Your Highness is kind.

261
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,920
But I'm curious.

262
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,199
This Xiao Shu He managed...

263
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,200
to make the loyal Red Shadow Guards
feel ill at ease.

264
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,400
Interesting.

265
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,640
Shen Song.

266
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
I have a favor to ask of you.

267
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Have a seat.

268
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,560
Escort Zi Ang to the villa
in the suburbs.

269
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,480
Your Highness,
all your convoluted thoughts...

270
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
are hidden deep in the pear grove.

271
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Does he know?

272
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,800
He only thinks
I'm obsessed with fame...

273
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,760
and that I want
to make a name for myself...

274
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
by ending the war
between the two nations.

275
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,200
Love is stronger
than a golden jade locket.

276
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,080
I've never seen you
care so much about someone.

277
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
It's fine.

278
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
I just want to protect him.

279
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,680
If it were anyone else,

280
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,880
when have you ever cared
about what others think of you?

281
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,960
Don't let others see...

282
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
those bloodshot eyes of yours.

283
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,560
Shen Song, do you know...

284
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,079
why His Highness
chose to have his villa...

285
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
in such a remote place?

286
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,760
Back in the day,
His Highness used to stay here...

287
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
to escape the turmoil
in the imperial court.

288
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,400
There's nothing special
about this place.

289
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
But when the pear blossoms bloom,

290
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,960
the view is quite elegant.

291
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,520
If His Highness loves pear blossoms,

292
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,360
why aren't there any planted
at the manor?

293
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,480
His Highness once said,

294
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,920
"Over pear blossoms in a courtyard,
a nebulous moon hangs."

295
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,800
"Through willow catkins by a pond,
a gentle breeze flows."

296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,200
Pear blossoms shouldn't be trapped
within the palace walls.

297
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,840
His Highness's thoughts...

298
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
are truly...

299
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Do you also prefer pear blossoms?

300
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I...

301
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm a martial artist. I have
no appreciation for these things.

302
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,440
Pear wood is suitable
for making arrow shafts though.

303
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Don't take it from this pear tree.

304
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,480
It's Shu He's precious treasure.

305
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,480
There is no one around
for ten miles.

306
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,520
Zi Ang, you can be at ease here.

307
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,400
I shall take my leave.

308
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,800
Thank His Highness for me.

309
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,640
I'll teach you.

310
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,800
There are pear blossoms outside.

311
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,120
Shall I pick some for you?

312
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Shu He.

313
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Shu He.

314
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,840
This time,

315
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,960
I can't lose him again.

316
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,920
The marriage alliance delegation
from Ji North has arrived.

317
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,039
Today, Ji North is
forming an alliance...

318
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
with us through marriage...

319
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,000
and burying the hatchet.

320
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
It is worth celebrating.

321
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,959
(Princess Wen Jing,
Ji North Kingdom)

322
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,680
(Chen Zi Yong,
Crown Prince of Ji North Kingdom)

323
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720
After the wedding,

324
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,880
the two states
will have a friendly alliance.

325
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,720
I hope this will allow us...

326
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,240
to resolve our differences...

327
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,320
and work together
for long-lasting peace.

328
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,640
Your Majesty is wise.

329
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,319
The marriage alliance...

330
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,120
can exempt the South Kingdom
from paying their annual tribute...

331
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,160
and save the people
from the ravages of war.

332
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,720
It's a good strategy
to govern the country.

333
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,320
However,

334
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,840
there has been a lot of talk lately.

335
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,320
A ruler should love his people.

336
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,680
The people should live
in peace and prosperity.

337
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,320
It's for the good of the world.

338
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Now that the two states are united,

339
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,080
we can bring back a prosperous era
for the people.

340
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,640
Shu He's words please me.

341
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,640
Today is a joyous day.

342
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
Play the music.

343
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,119
Father,

344
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Zi Yong,

345
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,200
I've long heard that the garden
in Shu He's manor is beautiful.

346
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,160
Would you like to see it with me?

347
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Shu Qian,

348
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,200
go ahead if you wish.

349
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
How did it go?

350
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Your Highness,

351
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
it's...

352
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,880
It's done.

353
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,600
You're not useless after all.

354
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Your Highness.

355
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
The Rhino Horn Pill.

356
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,080
Are you making a request to me?

357
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
I wouldn't dare.

358
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,080
Commander Huo,
what are you doing here?

359
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,360
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

360
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,280
I didn't know you were here.

361
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm sorry for offending you.

362
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Mr. Shen.

363
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,480
Why didn't you show up...

364
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,360
at today's
marriage alliance poetry meeting?

365
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm just a commoner...

366
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,200
and a part
of the martial arts world.

367
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,719
I don't dare to show off...

368
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,840
in front of His Majesty
and Your Highness.

369
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,240
I see.

370
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,160
I had thought that you...

371
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
and Commander Huo...

372
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,480
were meeting to enjoy the garden.

373
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,760
How peculiar.

374
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
It's just a chance encounter.

375
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,400
I don't know why Your Highness is
in such a remote area.

376
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,080
Now that is peculiar.

377
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,800
Why is he in the manor?

378
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I was reckless.

379
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,680
The Blood Dove
acted up again yesterday.

380
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,400
I asked His Highness
to grant me the medicine.

381
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Is the poison acting up again?

382
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
How can this be?

383
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm fine right now.

384
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,760
There are too many eyes
in the manor today.

385
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,120
We'll talk later.

386
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
The poetry meeting is over.

387
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,560
Let the banquet begin.

388
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Father,

389
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,119
I heard that Shu He...

390
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,480
has a new swordsmanship prodigy
in his residence.

391
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
Why don't you invite him
to provide some entertainment?

392
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,040
We can also show our guests
from the Ji North Kingdom...

393
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,800
a glimpse of the heroes
of the South Kingdom.

394
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Father, you have sound judgment.

395
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,560
I do have a friend in my residence.

396
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,720
However, he was injured
while protecting me.

397
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,080
It would be difficult
for him to see Your Majesty.

398
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Father, allow me to report.

399
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,600
I sealed off the mill
on East Street two days ago...

400
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,960
and captured a number
of Ji North spies from there.

401
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,440
One of them escaped injured...

402
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,080
and fled into Shu He's residence.

403
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,520
I wonder if that has any connection
to your guest.

404
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Preposterous!

405
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Shu He,

406
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,240
is it true
what the crown prince said?

407
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,320
There was an intruder
the night before.

408
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,920
But the guest fought him off.

409
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
I was afraid of
worrying Your Majesty.

410
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
That's why I didn't report it.

411
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,640
Shu He, if you have nothing to hide,

412
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,280
why don't you invite this person?

413
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Could it be...

414
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,920
that the guest's identity can't
be revealed?

415
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
All right.

416
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,840
Today, important guests
from Ji North are present.

417
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,360
We must get to the bottom of this.

418
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
I'll relay the order right away.

419
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,640
But that person is badly injured.

420
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
I'm afraid...

421
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Shu He,

422
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,840
important guests are here today.

423
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,280
He's just a guest.

424
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,479
If you can't hand him over,

425
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
the reputation of South Hui
will be damaged.

426
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,280
If you hand over a different person,

427
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,600
that is the serious crime
of deceiving the emperor.

428
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,760
Think about it carefully.

429
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,760
Here I am.

430
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,080
I am Duan Zi Ang.

431
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.
