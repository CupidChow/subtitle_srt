1
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,760
He knows that I don't get involved in state affairs.

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
Yet, he invited me to a banquet with court ministers.

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,200
Then why does Your Highness look so worried?

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,081
I wonder if I'll have the chance to see the Crown Prince.

6
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,800
Zi Ang, take care of your wound first.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,600
I'll have your dinner brought here.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I'll take my leave now.

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Huo Ying.

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,480
Send a servant to the Crown Prince's manor.

11
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Deliver a message for me.

12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,400
I invite him to to meet me at Shengding House.

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,280
I will be waiting until he comes.

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,840
Come!

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Great!

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
- Great! - Wonderful!

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
- Great! - Awesome!

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,200
Come!

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,079
Sir, the incense has burned out.

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
Do you want to light another one?

21
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
Light another one.

22
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,400
Bring me a new bottle of wine too.

23
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
All right.

24
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,560
(Country)

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Crown Prince.

26
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
Grand Master.

27
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,680
Let's call it a day.

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,400
(Country)

29
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
Summon the Imperial Physician.

30
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,280
How could you be so careless?

31
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,920
- Bring me the zither in my room. - Yes.

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,759
I happened to find...

33
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,240
a nice ancient zither a few days ago.

34
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,336
I wanted to give it to you on your birthday.

35
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,600
You can have it today.

36
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Thank you.

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,240
But I've used this zither for a long time.

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,480
I don't want to replace it.

39
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
I'll give you this string then.

40
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,760
My teacher said I'm useless because I never study.

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,840
I figured you thought the same too.

42
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
To each his own.

43
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,680
If I rule this country one day,

44
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll surely be suffocated.

45
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
If you aren't here...

46
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,001
to play the zither to help me relax,

47
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,480
what will I do?

48
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,279
The Crown Prince's triumphant return...

49
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,439
shows imperial dignity.

50
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
No matter where Your Highness went,

51
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,560
the East Yue Kingdom was overpowered.

52
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,000
Your Highness is truly remarkable...

53
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,320
on the battlefield.

54
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,680
His Majesty must be pleased.

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Both Your Highnesses care so much about His Majesty.

56
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,080
The Crown Prince is out fighting for the country,

57
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,560
while the Sixth Prince relieves His Majesty's worries.

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,679
On His Majesty's birthday last month,

59
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,919
he arranged the ancient tune...

60
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,000
of the "Cloud Water Lullaby".

61
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,119
His Majesty even rewarded His Highness...

62
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
with the mountain river brocade.

63
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Mountain river brocade?

64
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Shu He.

65
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,720
Why are you so quiet?

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

67
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,320
I've been worried about your safety.

68
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,360
Seeing that you're back safely now,

69
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I was just so happy...

70
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,321
that I didn't think of congratulating you.

71
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,120
Do you only care about my safety?

72
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
So Father gave you a gift.

73
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,680
Why don't you show it to me?

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Show me the brocade that Father gave you...

75
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
as a congratulatory gift to me.

76
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,040
I've prepared a gift for you.

77
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,800
Please come to the lake, Your Highness.

78
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,480
Is this song...

79
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,120
your congratulatory gift for me?

80
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,639
Young Master Xiao has been waiting for you.

81
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,119
He has reserved the entire second floor.

82
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
No outsiders will disturb you.

83
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
This way, please.

84
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
I thought you wouldn't come.

85
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Shu Qian.

86
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
Is this song...

87
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,280
your congratulatory gift for me?

88
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
How did we end up like this?

89
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,960
I remember that you said...

90
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,160
when you rule the country,

91
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,200
you hope that I'll be by your side.

92
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,280
But why do you think that I'll be your enemy now?

93
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,480
You haven't come out for a long time.

94
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
I was scared that you...

95
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Zi Ang.

96
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
Why are you here?

97
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,880
- I... - Are you following me?

98
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,000
You only nearly escaped death two days ago.

99
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
I'm worried if you're out here alone, you...

100
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Have a seat.

101
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,240
Waiter, bring me another bottle of wine.

102
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm sorry, Zi Ang.

103
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,080
I can't keep you company tonight.

104
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,280
Shu He, you've had too much to drink.

105
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
Let me take you home.

106
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
What?

107
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,160
A prince can't get drunk...

108
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,840
or be indecent, right?

109
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,800
Shu He, you know that's not what I meant.

110
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Do you know who I'm waiting for?

111
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,760
The Crown Prince.

112
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
I waited for him all night.

113
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
No.

114
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
I waited for him for years.

115
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,040
If we were born into an ordinary family,

116
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,280
the Crown Prince and I would probably be close.

117
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,960
I've never doubted his ambition.

118
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,080
I just want to know...

119
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,200
if he still remembers this string.

120
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,160
This old string is my gift to you.

121
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,960
Congratulations to Your Highness for protecting our country's peace.

122
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,536
All I care about is music, chess, reading, and painting.

123
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't be of help to Your Highness.

124
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
It's getting late.

125
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,520
I'll take my leave.

126
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Since then,

127
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,240
I never touched the Yearning Zither...

128
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,160
or played “Linjiang Immortal” again.

129
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Zi Ang, have you heard "Linjiang Immortal"?

130
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,840
My brother doesn't understand me.

131
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,760
But you love your little brother.

132
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,240
You miss him and think of him.

133
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm sure you can understand me.

134
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,280
I thought that as the imperial family,

135
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,240
you wouldn't have any worries.

136
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,239
Since I was little, countless people have been telling me...

137
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,880
what I should do...

138
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
and what I shouldn't do.

139
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,120
Come to think of it,

140
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,880
the time we were together when we were children...

141
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,080
was the first time I could be Xiao Shu He.

142
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,320
I didn't have to be the Sixth Prince.

143
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Shu He.

144
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Shu He.

145
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
You're drunk.

146
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,560
Let me take you home.

147
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,560
But I don't blame anyone else.

148
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,320
I've been blessed with good things.

149
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Yes.

150
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,039
At least, your favorite music, chess, books, and paintings...

151
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
can relieve your worries.

152
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm talking about you.

153
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
We were able to meet again.

154
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
There were even times when I almost lost my life,

155
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,600
but you risked your life to save me.

156
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,720
Isn't that a precious gift?

157
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
You're exaggerating.

158
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,960
I believe that if our positions were reversed,

159
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,680
you wouldn't stand by and do nothing either.

160
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,800
My teacher said that one must have clean hands and a calm heart...

161
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,840
when playing the zither.

162
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
I remember the first time I saw you.

163
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,840
You were wearing white and blue.

164
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,480
Your outfit today...

165
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,440
doesn't look good on you.

166
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,360
I don't want to shoot arrows.

167
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,920
I can't aim accurately.

168
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,800
Who says you have to know archery as a prince?

169
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,640
I want to be a musician.

170
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Shu He.

171
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Shu He.

172
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,560
When everything is settled,

173
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,840
I'll tell Xiao Shu He the truth and apologize.

174
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Your Highness.

175
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Move aside!

176
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,320
Your Highness has been searching for four hours.

177
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
How about...

178
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Useless!

179
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
You're all useless!

180
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Your Highness, the autumn water is cold.

181
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:18,880
You can't do this.

182
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Your Highness.

183
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Your Highness.

184
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,480
There's nothing in the box.

185
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,040
There's nothing?

186
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
How can it be empty?

187
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Where's the string?

188
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,760
Why is there no string inside?

189
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,520
This is fate.

190
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,440
Xiao Shu He, this is fate.

191
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,480
It's not up to you or me.

192
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
If Xiao Shu He gets in the way of our plan,

193
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,480
we shouldn't keep him.

194
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,920
Why do you look so troubled?

195
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
Today is Huai Yi's birthday.

196
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,880
I wonder where he is now.

197
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,280
Is there anyone who can make him birthday noodles?

198
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,920
Sometimes, I envy you and your brother.

199
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
You have such a deep bond.

200
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,680
I'll be honest with Your Highness.

201
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
I actually envy you.

202
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,200
At least, you can still see your brother.

203
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,920
What are you going to do after you find Huai Yi?

204
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,800
We've had enough ups and downs in the past few years.

205
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
If I can really find Huai Yi,

206
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,400
I want to give him a peaceful life.

207
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,720
I want to see him get married and have children.

208
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Perhaps this way,

209
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,040
I'll be able to let go of my hatred.

210
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,559
I could always tell...

211
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,760
that Huai Yi is a blessed kid.

212
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
With my help,

213
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,960
we'll surely find him.

214
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm just afraid that the abbot...

215
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,640
might not be able to find a young monk...

216
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,240
in the vast South Hui Kingdom.

217
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
Drink this for your hangover.

218
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,040
Once you drink this medicine,

219
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
your headache will go away.

220
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,600
I waited for the Crown Prince all night at Shengding House.

221
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,400
You had already expected His Highness not to come.

222
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,680
Don't be like this.

223
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,960
I didn't expect...

224
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,800
that His Highness would really think that I'd be his enemy.

225
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,000
I guess you drank with Zi Ang all night.

226
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,840
I must say, you're the one who knows me best.

227
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
So?

228
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,200
Has Duan Zi Ang slipped up yet?

229
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
What do you mean?

230
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Did Huo Ying tell you?

231
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,056
That day when we were bathing,

232
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,840
I took the chance to look at his whole body.

233
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,800
I didn't find the mark of the Red Shadow Guards.

234
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,360
You looked at his whole body?

235
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,240
You're always so inappropriate.

236
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Even so,

237
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Shu He,

238
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,480
don't trust others so easily.

239
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Shen Song.

240
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,440
I've decided to give up on our plan.

241
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,040
What do you think about Zi Ang?

242
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,320
You two are kindred spirits.

243
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,080
That's hard to come by.

244
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,400
But his sudden appearance was too suspicious.

245
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
We can't trust him easily.

246
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,520
You know me the best.

247
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,480
Of course, you know that I'm suspicious of him.

248
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,520
We hadn't met for so many years.

249
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
It wasn't easy for us to meet again.

250
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,200
Who doesn't have their own burdens?

251
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
If he really has an ulterior motive,

252
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,616
he has had so many opportunities these past days.

253
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,040
He could've done something already.

254
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Why would he do all this?

255
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,160
He said he has let go of his hatred.

256
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm willing to believe him.

257
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
In that case,

258
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,160
Your Highness is giving up the chance...

259
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,480
to hold Prime Minister Gu back.

260
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
In the end,

261
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
he's just someone...

262
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:09,399
who wants to make up for what he couldn't do...

263
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,160
for his little brother when they were young.

264
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,600
My own brother treats me so cruelly,

265
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,839
but Zi Ang, a childhood friend, understands me so well.

266
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,080
He was even willing to save me.

267
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,720
If I really use his reputation to stir up a commotion,

268
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,000
what kind of person would that make me?

269
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,439
How am I different from those conspiring officials...

270
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
in the court?

271
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,360
If you insist on embracing a sharp blade,

272
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Shu He,

273
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,480
you have to be prepared to be hurt by the blade in the future.

274
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,320
I didn't expect that an abbot like you...

275
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,680
has to worry about accounting too.

276
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,480
Someone needs to care for the food and incense...

277
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,680
of the 300 monks in the temple.

278
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,200
Seeing that Your Highness with this account book here today,

279
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
I suppose you have a big request.

280
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
All right.

281
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,479
Since you're so straightforward,

282
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,920
I won't beat around the bush.

283
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm sure...

284
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,320
you only want the two of us to know about this account book.

285
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,200
Please look out...

286
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,960
for the person in this portrait.

287
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,240
The root of all suffering...

288
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
is greed.

289
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Your Highness.

290
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,120
Be careful of your own karma.

291
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,400
What brings Your Highness here in person?

292
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,600
I have a favor to ask.

293
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Is that so?

294
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,720
I'm looking for someone.

295
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,080
I shouldn't be bothering you with such a trivial matter,

296
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,800
but I don't make friends with the court ministers.

297
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
I don't know who can help me.

298
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,480
Who is it that Your Highness is so concerned about?

299
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
It's someone from General Duan's family.

300
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,000
He converted to Buddhism 10 years ago.

301
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,480
His whereabouts are unknown now.

302
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
The Duan family?

303
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,080
Are you here to ask for my help...

304
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,040
or to teach me a lesson?

305
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,680
Why don't you be more direct?

306
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,480
You're a smart man.

307
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,040
I don't think I have to spell everything out for you.

308
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,320
You've used this to threaten me repeatedly.

309
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,800
Are you that confident in yourself?

310
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,920
You don't have to be like this.

311
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,840
If I really have other motives,

312
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,720
I wouldn't be here today.

313
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,816
Although I don't have to attend court sessions,

314
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,520
it's not hard for me to meet with my father.

315
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
Your Highness is too impatient.

316
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,559
You should check your sword carefully...

317
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
before wielding it.

318
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,320
It could be a double-edged sword.

319
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,880
You just told me to be straightforward.

320
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
Why are you suddenly talking in riddles?

321
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,279
Your Highness is hosting an important guest...

322
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,360
in your manor lately.

323
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
- That's right. - His surname is Duan.

324
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,120
He was the one who saved Your Highness years ago.

325
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
Does Your Highness know...

326
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,360
how Young Master Duan has avoided...

327
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,120
the purge of the Duan manor all these years?

328
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,280
You can tell me.

329
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,800
When the Duan Manor was raided back then,

330
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,360
Duan Zi Ang narrowly escaped.

331
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,040
After that, he was sent to the Ji North Kingdom.

332
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,920
He was chosen to be trained to become a Red Shadow Guard.

333
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,400
He probably sneaked back to the South Hui Kingdom...

334
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,040
because of a mission.

335
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,919
Prime Minister Gu, you're still the same.

336
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,360
You really know how to tell stories.

337
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,760
Whether it's a story or not,

338
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,680
it's not up to you or me.

339
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,360
The point is what His Majesty will think...

340
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,040
when he finds out.

341
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Besides,

342
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,480
an assassination attempt on the Crown Prince...

343
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
is punishable by death.

344
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Prime Minister Gu.

345
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,960
Your Highness, don't panic.

346
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,480
I'll help you find the person you want.

347
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,880
However,

348
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,480
Your Highness has to do me a favor too.

349
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
No one can stay in the manor tonight.

350
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Understood.

351
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,200
Shu He always gets himself drunk...

352
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,360
at times like this.

353
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
Do we still have to watch over His Highness tonight?

354
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Tonight?

355
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Tonight,

356
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,761
there may be someone else who will watch over him for us.

357
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,080
What must I do...

358
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
to live up to your expectations?

359
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,520
I really can't mingle with those ministers.

360
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,320
I remember everything clearly.

361
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
They didn't hesitate to harm you like that...

362
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,040
just to gain wealth and splendor.

363
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Who is it?

364
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Your Highness.

365
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
It's me.

366
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
It's getting late.

367
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
Your shoulder hasn't recovered yet.

368
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,720
You should go back and rest.

369
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,000
I didn't mean to peep.

370
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I just saw the fire,

371
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,520
so I came to check it out.

372
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
You should go back now.

373
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,720
Are you hurt?

374
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
I'm fine.

375
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,720
Since you're not going to sleep,

376
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,200
why don't you sit with me?

377
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm sorry.

378
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,000
I embarrassed myself in front of you.

379
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,920
Don't say that, Your Highness.

380
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,480
Is Your Highness...

381
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,320
paying tribute to your mother?

382
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
She died in disgrace.

383
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,360
The one who framed her is still alive and well.

384
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Zi Ang, tell me.

385
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,560
Should I cherish my life and stay away from the court?

386
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,240
Or should I fight for power to avenge my mother?

387
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,240
I...

388
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,120
What should I do?

389
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,560
Your Highness should know my background.

390
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,880
My father fought countless battles for the country.

391
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,120
There were many times when he almost died.

392
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,040
In a stick of incense's time,

393
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,800
everything was gone.

394
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,016
At least Your Highness can still choose...

395
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,000
whether to fight or not.

396
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,280
No matter what choice Your Highness makes,

397
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,720
a mother wouldn't blame her beloved son.

398
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,799
Zi Ang, won't you think...

399
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,920
that I'm a hypocrite?

400
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,320
Why do you say that, Your Highness?

401
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,520
I always pretend to be indifferent,

402
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,000
but I never actually let go of my hatred.

403
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,040
I've never been able to tell anyone the truth.

404
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,680
Your Highness values everything greatly.

405
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
Your Highness has never hurt anyone.

406
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,200
I admire Your Highness a lot for that.

407
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,280
Actually,

408
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,360
as long as you follow your heart,

409
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,640
it doesn't matter if you're lying or not.

410
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,480
Aren't you afraid of being deceived?

411
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,600
If that person has his or her reasons,

412
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,280
it's not unforgivable.

413
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,440
You're drunk.

414
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,600
Don't cry anymore.
