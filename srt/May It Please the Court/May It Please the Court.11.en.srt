00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,889
I no longer care about

00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,435
what's true or false

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,980
or why you chose me as your lawyer.

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,610
I won't be fooled twice.

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,528
BASED ON THE ESSAY
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT BY JUNG HYEJIN

13
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,905
I am going...

14
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,949
to put you on death row myself.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,422
-REPORTER 1: She's here.
-REPORTER 2: She's out.

00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,175
(camera shutters clicking)

17
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,677
How does it feel to defend
a serial killer?

18
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,096
Attorney Noh.

19
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,516
People are up in arms on the internet,
calling you the devil attorney

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,393
and criticizing your actions.
What are your thoughts?

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,062
Are you thinking of withdrawing?

22
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,398
Why do you continue as a public defender
when you could quit?

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,531
Even those who commit
the most atrocious crimes

24
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,785
are still entitled to legal assistance
as stated in the Constitution.

25
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,955
I will simply do my best
to carry out my duties.

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,458
So you'll continue to defend
this vicious criminal

27
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,210
who killed four elderly people?

28
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,047
Yes. I plan on striving to represent
the defendant's best interests

29
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,216
devoid of any personal feelings.

30
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,009
With that kind of spirit,

31
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,513
you might even get
the serial killer acquitted.

32
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,015
I also wonder

33
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,977
what the ruling will be
for the serial killer.

34
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,605
(shutters clicking continue)

36

CHAKHEE: In the murder scenes
of Cho Hyunsik, Yoon Seokgu,

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,029
Jeon Jaeho, and Park Kangil,

38
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,449
there were no signs
of breaking and entering of any kind.

39
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,786
He had to be an acquaintance.

40
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,038
-(door squeaks)
-If you're late...

41
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,208
CHAKHEE: Those who were murdered
all opened the door for him.

42
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,793
(door squeaks)

43
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,212
(pensive music)

44
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,382
Yoon Seokgu...

45
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,637
Even when Yoon Seokgu met with the killer,
there was no sign of resistance.

46
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,432
It's clean.

47
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,059
Cho Hyunsik.

48
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,021
Even if he knew Jwa Sibaek
from Yoon Youngju's suit,

49
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,399
he wouldn't have opened the door for him
if he came to his vacation home.

50
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,067
On top of that, whiskey?

51
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,821
It doesn't make sense.

52
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,781
Chief Jeon Jaeho.

53
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,034
He knew Jwa Sibaek was the one

54
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,994
who threatened him
on the road with his car.

55
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,831
If Jwa Sibaek showed up in the middle
of the night and rang his doorbell,

56
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,126
he would've called the police
instead of opening the door for him.

57
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,880
Someone who Cho Hyunsik, Yoon Seokgu,
Jeon Jaeho, and Park Kangil

58
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,965
would gladly open the door for
without suspicion.

59
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,052
Someone who can
expertly torture them with water

60
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,555
and not leave a trace.

61
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,230
There has to be an accomplice.

62
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,359
Jwa Sibaek planned it,
and the accomplice carried out the plan.

74
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,032
How's the chief?

75
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,909
DOCTOR: He was sedated and put to sleep.

76
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,327
He's alive?

77
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,163
-Yes.
-JUNG: Goddamn it.

78
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,874
NURSE: I've never seen that doctor before.

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,461
Nothing about their interaction
felt normal, and it was late at night.

80
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,506
He was helping a full-grown man to walk,
so I felt something was wrong.

81
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,092
I was going to look into it
after checking on the patient, but...

82
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,595
Then can you confirm who he is
if you see him on the security footage?

83
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,472
Yes, I'm sure I can do that.

84
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,934
Then please help us out one more time
when we check the footage.

85
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,269
Yes, sure. Okay.

86
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,021
KYUNGJIN: Okay.
Thank you for all your help.

87
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,523
Anyway, about Chief Jeon.

88
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,402
Why is he alive? He shouldn't be alive.

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,612
What do you mean?
You should be happy he's alive.

90
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,367
I mean, it was a long time before
the nurse went over to check on the chief.

91
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,330
If the culprit wanted to kill him,
he could have done so.

92
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,790
But he survived again, right?

93
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,084
I guess he's destined
to live a long damn life.

94
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,962
And that so-called doctor.

95
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,883
He walked by the nurse's desk
as if he wanted to make sure she saw him.

96
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,677
He didn't use the emergency stairs
or try to hide himself.

97
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,845
(hums, sucks teeth)

98
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,431
And he had to know the police
would check the security footage.

99
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,600
JUNG: Either he's recklessly brave...

100
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,311
Or he's saying, "Come and arrest me."

101
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,773
When Chief Jeon wakes up,
he'll testify on who his attacker was.

102
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,026
Then we'll track the culprit down
by using the security footage.

103
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,528
In which case, Chief Jeon's testimony
will become the evidence.

104
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,364
So he's bait?

105
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,074
He wants the chief to wake up and testify?

106
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,659
What a ridiculous guy.

107
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,120
If he killed those people,
he should just turn himself in.

108
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,830
Why is he telling us
to come and catch him?

109
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,085
The one throwing the bait
may not be the culprit

110
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,880
but someone who wants
the culprit to get caught.

111

will wake up very soon.

116
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,840
Once he wakes up,
he'll tell us who attacked him.

117
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,052
We identified the culprit from the CCTV
based on the nurse's testimony.

118
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,931
And the police are screening through
the security footage from the vicinity,

119
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,683
so we'll find out where he went very soon.

Did you turn yourself in to stall for time

00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,699
with the intention
of helping the real killer?

I heard you're in charge
of Jwa Sibaek's case.

00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,894
Okay. I'll see you later.

Is something going on?

Mr. Toilet...

143
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,934
Mr. Toilet must have
abandoned me and ran off.

-(Granny cries)
-(sighs)

145

He won't even pick up his phone.

146
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,067
And he hasn't come home for days.

147
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,987
No, Mr. Jwa is...

148
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,576
He went on a business trip
far away. To an island.

149
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,246
That's why he can't be reached
and hasn't come home.

150
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957

Really?

GRANNY: Thank you.

155
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,812
So? When will you marry Mr. Toilet?

156

(sighs)

157
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,405
I do want to marry Mr. Jwa, Granny.

158
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,033
What? Did you finally make your decision?

159
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,787
But I don't know a lot about him.

160
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,081
I can't marry him
without knowing anything.

161
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,462
That's true.

162
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:54,802
So while we're on the topic, do you know
where his parents or siblings are?

163
00:09:55,803 --> 00:10:00,433
Or even friends, ex-girlfriends,
or anything else related to him.

164
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,852
(sighs)

165
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,688
Even if I did, I don't anymore.

166
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,690
I can't remember.

167
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,570
I keep forgetting stuff,
so I take medicine.

168
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,954
NAME: HAN SOONAE
AGE AND SEX: F / 72

169
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,750
Do I have some kind of bug in my head?

170
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,086
It ate away everything in there.

171
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,465
I don't remember anything.

172
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
(exhales)

173
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,554
Granny, where's your family?

174
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,973
My "family"?

175
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,854
Mr. Toilet is like my family.

176
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,815
Not Mr. Jwa, but your real family.
Where are they?

177
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,693
I have a son.

178
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,489
A son? May I meet with your son?

179
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,032
He went to school.

180
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,409
He'll be back at one o'clock.

181
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,036
School?

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,037
Yes.

183
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,707
He's in first grade in elementary school.

184
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,254
(hopeless sigh)

185
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,465

00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,180
JUNGHA PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

188
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,348
There's an accomplice.

189
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,975
Duct tape was found
at Yoon Seokgu's murder scene,

190
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,852
and Jwa Sibaek's DNA was found on it.

191
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,606
But his DNA wasn't the only one.
They found someone else's as well.

192
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,193
CHAKHEE: The DNA that couldn't
be ascertained belongs to the accomplice.

193
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,446
(deep inhale)

194
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,823
So you're saying

195
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,076
that Jwa Sibaek is simply helping
the accomplice with the crime,

196
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,954
so the real culprit who killed those
rich old men is someone else?

197
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,206
Mm-mm. Jwa Sibaek is the real culprit.

198
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,626
The accomplice is simply performing
their part of Jwa Sibaek's plan.

199
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,755
You're Jwa Sibaek's attorney, remember?

200
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,841
Jwa Sibaek was the accessory,

201
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,718
while the murderer
is the principal offender.

202
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,469
That has to be your argument.

203
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,554
Kyungju.

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,891
I told you, Prosecutor Lee.
I came here to do your job for you.

205
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,810
All you have to do is run
with this information.

206
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,062
So? Should I keep doing your job?

207
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,815
(thumps)

208
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,483
What's important is the motive.

209
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,737
As you can see from these photos,
they were all murdered through torture.

210
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,823
CHAKHEE: They were all found bound
by nylon rope with knees on the floor

211
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,867
as if they must apologize to someone.

212
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,371
These murdered elderly men opened the door
and let him in without putting up a fight.

213
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,332
The accomplice is acquainted
with all of these men.

214
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,043
So there's a high chance the accomplice
is someone around their age.

215
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,005
(deep inhale)
Considering Jwa Sibaek's age,

216
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,340
we can assume
this isn't about his personal grudge

217
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,719
but about something
that happened to someone

218
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,220
around his parents' age.

219
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,305
Mm.

220
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,434
Kyungju.

221
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,439
I heard you and Jwa Sibaek went to school
and to the training institute together.

222
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,815
(chuckles)

223
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,778
Did you come here to do my job
for me because you knew that?

224
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
Tell me everything you know about him.

225
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,073
If my source is good,
I can do my job beautifully.

226
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,327
Then you can scoop it up
and take it away as your own, okay?

227
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:14,335
I also gave it some thought when I heard
Jwa Sibaek turned himself in.

228
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,046
KYUNGJU: I thought about what he was like.

229
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,257
He was a bit of a wacko,

230
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,928
but he only acted like a mad dog
to those who were more powerful than him.

231
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,473
Otherwise, he had quite the humor.
He was a really good guy.

232
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,434
He got great grades at the institute,
but instead of going to a law firm,

233
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,644
he got into pro bono work.

234
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,563
And all of our classmates said
that we expected that from him.

235
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:42,071
You know, I hung out and drank
with Sibaek for so long.

236
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,864
But there's nothing.

237
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,784
I know nothing about him.

238
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,663
KYUNGJU: He said he spent
his childhood in the States.

239
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,290
And that his parents
were still there or something.

240
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,959
Or did he say they passed away there?

241
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,669
I'm not even sure about that.

242
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,463
Right.

243
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,174
His father used to operate
a shoe factory in Seongsu-dong

244
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,801
before they emigrated to the States.

245
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,052
That's all I know.

246
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,058
The States.

247
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,686
Shoe factory in Seongsu-dong.

248
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,315
Following the series of murder cases
of wealthy elderly men,

249
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,609
the identity of the culprit
was finally exposed

250
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,195
and put many people in shock.

251
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,783
REPORTER 1: Mr. Jwa, who turned himself in
as the culprit of the serial murders

252
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,953
has yet to reveal the motive
for his killings, has he?

253
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,289
COMMENTATOR: That's right.
Thanks to that, the main focus

254
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,041
is now on Mr. Jwa's motive for murder,

255
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,128
but we've also received reports
about the victims themselves.

256
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,255
"Reports"? What are they about?

257
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,090
Well, there were reports
from victims who were

258
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,843
allegedly sexually assaulted
for a long time by Mr. Cho.

259
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:50,347
That Mr. Yoon had resorted to violence
and blackmail as he expanded his business.

260
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:55,644
And his assault on a caddie
at a golf club has also resurfaced.

261
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,856
Also, Police Chief Jeon Jaeho,
who was recently attacked,

262
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,276
was found to have sexually assaulted
a female officer eight years ago.

263
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,903
Due to this flood of reports,

264
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,072
a fan club for Mr. Jwa
has formed on the internet.

265
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,324
A "fan club," you say?

266
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,076
Yes, after the misdeeds of these murdered
elderly men were exposed,

267
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,664
some have begun to view Mr. Jwa as a hero.

268
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,627
They believe his motive
was to punish these evil men.

269
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,338
REPORTER: Didn't Mr. Jwa
also confess to killing

270
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,632
the father of a
National Assembly candidate?

271
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,050
COMMENTATOR: That's right.

272
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,844
REPORTER: How has Candidate Jang Gido
reacted to the news?

273
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,138
(remote control thuds)

274
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,766
Jwa Sibaek.

275
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,561
This is why he turned himself in.

276
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,855
If he turned himself in
and shut his mouth,

277
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,899
he knew the media,
the police, and the people

278
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,609
would go wild with curiosity.

279
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,778
Instead of telling everyone his motive,

280
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,781
he made sure people dug up
the reasons themselves.

281
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,659
GIDO: Once people believe they've
dug out something on their own,

282
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,535
they cling onto it like idiots.

283
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,664
How's my approval rating?

284
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,918
We’re behind within the margin of error.

285
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,673
The numbers started to turn around
as rumors about Chairman Jang spread.

286
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,634
What are the rumors about?

287
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,845
"The real Jang Byungchun, the son
of an independence activist Jang Sungjin,

288
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,056
lived and died in Heilongjiang.

289
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,100
DAEHYEON: The current Jang Byungchun

290
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,228
was a famous police officer in charge
of torture back in the '70s and '80s.

291
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,189
In the '90s, he disguised his identity
with that of Jang Byungchun

292
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,024
and started running
charity organizations."

293
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,071
I think the article
from Noh Yuchul's blog is spreading.

294
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,033
Get everyone on Jangsan's legal team

295
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,577
to sue every single bastard
commenting on his blog.

296
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,416
Delete all his posts and shut down
the online forums discussing Jwa Sibaek.

297
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,836
Will do.

298
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,839
What about Noh Chakhee?

299
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,110
S SHOES DESIGN LAB

300
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,073
MAN: You're looking for Jwa Sanggil
who emigrated to the States?

301
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,493
I'm actually looking
for Mr. Jwa Sibaek's father.

302
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,995
He operated a shoe factory here

303
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,955
before going to the States
about 30 years ago.

304
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,332
He was the owner of Younggwang Shoes.

305
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,002
Did he have a son named Jwa Sibaek?

306
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,129
(sucks teeth)
Jwa Sibaek...

307
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,592
Oh, yes. I think that was his name.

308
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,553
Is there a way for me
to contact Mr. Jwa Sanggil?

309
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,846
You can't.

310
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,057
He died in the States.

311
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,225
I see...

312
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,229
So that's why Jwa Sibaek came back alone.

313
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,857
His son came back?

314
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,277
He's in Korea?

315
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:57,826
Yes, he came back about 20 years ago,
and he's now working as a lawyer.

316
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,328
(snickers)

317
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,830
Young lady, that's nonsense.

318
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:07,044
Jwa Sibaek died
when he was in first grade.

319
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
(emotional music)

320
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,639
MAN: Sanggil wanted to catch the guy
who killed his son in a hit-and-run,

321
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,767
so he placed ads in the newspapers,
and there were news articles about it too.

322
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,852
But they never caught the killer.

323
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,563
That's why he went
to the States 30 years ago.

324
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,483
His wife completely lost it
after they lost their son,

325
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,110
so they couldn't live in Korea anymore.

326
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,283
CHAKHEE: If you aren't Jwa Sibaek,

327
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,411
then who are you?

328
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,128
(mouse clicking)

329
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,598
1ST GRADER DIES IN A HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT

330
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,142
JWA SIBAEK (8 YEARS OLD)

331
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,643
(gasps in disbelief)

332
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,022
HIS FATHER, JWA SANGGIL, PUT UP A REWARD

333
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,774
OF THREE MILLION WON TO CATCH THE CULPRIT.

334
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,498
(gasps)

335
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,797
(ominous music)

336
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,299
(gasps)

337
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,342
(shrieking)

338
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,305
JAEHO: Lee Dongpil is your name!

339
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,265
You're Lee Dongpil!

340
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,686
Inspector Lee Dongpil
of the Gyeonggi Province Police!

341
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,107
No. Not me.

342
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,278
No!

343
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,071
-Then die.
-(man gasps)

344
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,448
No, not me. It's not...

345
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,034
I'm not Lee Dongpil, you bastard!

346
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,118
(screams)

347
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,626
(gasps)

348
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,388
Sir.

349
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,349
I think...

350
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,312
I just had a weird dream.

351
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,065
(deep inhale)

352
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,610
It's not a dream, Mr. Lee Dongpil.

353
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,281
WE'RE CLOSED TODAY

354
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,543
BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

355
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,713
Excuse me, is the dumpling store closed?

356
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,590
Yes, it has been for days.

357
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,843
It seemed like Mr. Shin was about
to close down his store.

358
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:07,683
-The owner is a Shin? Not a Jwa?
-Yes, I believe his surname is Shin.

359
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,934
Well then.

360
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,021
(pensive music)

361
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,990
(clanging)

362
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,118
Come on.

363
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,623
(knocks on window)

364
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,167
Damn it.

365
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,396
(Chakhee grunts)

366
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,856
(exhales)

367
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,053
(dramatic music)

368
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,561
(shutter clicks)

369
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,288
(sighs)

370
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,969
(shutter clicks)

371
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,946
(sighs)

372
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,448
(haunting music)

373
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,959
(gasps)

374
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,674
(exhales in disbelief)

375
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,024
(dark music)

376
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,073
(shutter clicks)

377
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,628
KANG CHULWOO 031) 38-7274

378
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,390
(line rings)

379
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,853
KYUNGJIN: How far along are you
in tracing his whereabouts?

380
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,064
MAN: Until now, we've identified him
leaving the hospital entrance.

381
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,858
What about the cameras in the parking lot?

382
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,277
There are many blind spots
in the ground floor parking lot.

383
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,739
I'll be able to trace him further
once I get the footage from the vicinity.

384
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,622
CHAKHEE: Detective Yoo.

385
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,545
This is Backwoods Homemade Dumplings.
I found duct tape near the cash register.

386
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,466
And the orange nylon rope used
during the murders in the owner's room.

387
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,634
And this knot.

388
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,720
This is the knot the culprit used.

389
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,057
Yes, the circumstances do look suspicious.

390
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,019
But most businesses
have duct tape on hand.

391
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,898
And while the knot does seem unique,
it's not enough to call him the culprit...

392
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,275
The owner is Jwa Sibaek's brother.

393
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,069
(dramatic music)

394
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,240
CHAKHEE: The man next
to Jwa Sibaek is Shin Chisik.

395
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,952
You said he's his brother.

396
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,620
So why is the name Shin Chisik?

397
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,747
(sighs)
Well, that's because Jwa Sibaek...

398
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,250
isn't Jwa Sibaek.

399
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,586
I went there because I knew

400
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,381
that the owner of the dumpling place
was Jwa Sibaek's brother.

401
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,801
I went in there to investigate Jwa Sibaek,
then found the duct tape and nylon rope.

402
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,136
Shin Chisik is the accomplice.

403
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,431
-Not the principal offender?
-That would be Jwa Sibaek.

404
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,394
Shin Chisik is only carrying out
the murders as instigated by Jwa Sibaek.

405
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,689
Issue a search for Shin Chisik right now.

406
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,440
Jwa Sibaek might have turned himself in

407
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,443
to stall for time
and help Shin Chisik flee.

408
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,532
Ms. Noh, aren't you Jwa Sibaek's attorney?

409
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:20,912
I'm not sure if you're trying
to defend him or put him in jail.

410
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,291
What's my intention got to do with this?

411
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,960
If you don't believe me,
go to the dumpling shop.

412
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,712
I left everything as is.

413
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:34,009
CHAKHEE: I'm sure you'll find the DNA
on the duct tape at the crime scene

414
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,344
which you couldn't identify.

415
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,224
(Jaeho breathing anxiously)

416
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,309
JAEHO: Yes.

417
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,227
It's him.

418
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,980
He tried to kill me.

419
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,275
Was Shin Chisik the one
who attacked you, Chief?

420
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,112
"Shin Chisik"?

421
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,076
Did he attack you?

422
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,370
JAEHO: No.

423
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,667
The one who attacked me was Lee Dongpil.

424
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,212
How many times do I have to tell you
that it was Lee Dongpil? Damn it.

425
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,339
(grunts, sighs)

426
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,009
See? I was right.

427
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,637
He's still alive!

428
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,850
Yes, so this man attacked you, correct?

429
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,060
Yes.

430
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,270
Then what about him?

431
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,481
KYUNGJIN: Do you not recognize him?

432
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,068
No, I've never seen him before.

433
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,281
Was he that doctor...

434
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,119
from the day Lee Dongpil attacked me?

435
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,332
And have you never heard
of the name Shin Chisik?

436
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,293
No.

437
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,129
The one who attacked me was...

438
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,548
-(finger tapping photo)
-...this bastard.

439
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,259
JAEHO: Lee Dongpil!

440
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,933
"Lee Dongpil"?

441
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,268
Me?

442
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,770
Yes.

443
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,107
You are the same person...

444
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,778
who tortured and crippled me.

445
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,447
CHISIK: It wasn't just me.

446
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,575
You tortured countless numbers of people.

447
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,955
You tortured innocent people,
got false confessions,

448
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,832
then used those confessions

449
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,834
to frame them for crimes
and sent them to prison.

450
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,253
In return...

451
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,634
you received medals
and got special promotions.

452
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,931
No.

453
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,476
I'm a torture victim.

454
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:53,815
I became an idiot who can't
even remember my own name

455
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,193
because I was tortured.

456
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,403
CHISIK: No.

457
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,281
Mr. Lee Dongpil, you can't
even remember your name

458
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,243
because you have
severe alcoholic dementia.

459
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,328
After you were released from prison,

460
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,248
you lived like a human garbage.

461
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,792
I...

462
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,169
"Prison"?

463
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,671
Why do you remember yourself
as a victim of torture?

464
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,843
Is this a petty piece of conscience
that's left in you? Or...

465
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,927
(breathes deeply)

466
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,723
Is it a way for you
to make yourself the victim

467
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,309
in order to kill them?

468
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,896
Sir.

469
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,814
I...

470
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,982
Sir...

471
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,651
What are you talking about right now?

472
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,862
You know very well what I'm talking about.

473
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,743
CHISIK: How long will you feign ignorance?

474
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,663
You killed three people, but you forget
all about it when you wake up.

475
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,500
(chuckles)

476
00:29:55,418 --> 00:30:00,381
The memory of the assailant
works just as conveniently now

477
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,301
as it did 30 years ago.

478
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,028
The police will soon find you,
Mr. Lee Dongpil.

479
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:30,161
This house is filled with evidence
showing that you murdered

480
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,164
Cho Hyunsik, Yoon Seokgu, and Park Kangil.

481
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,293
When Jeon Jaeho wakes up, he'll testify
that Lee Dongpil attacked him.

482
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:42,799
And he'll tell them
why Lee Dongpil attacked him.

483
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,553
(sniffles)

484
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,142
If I am really Lee Dongpil,

485
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,311
and if I...

486
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:02,235
really tortured you and crippled you,

487
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,323
why did you take me in?

488
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,829
Just look.

489
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:19,627
I didn't get a drop of blood on my hands
and still got rid of all of them.

490
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,215
CHISIK: I'm not the one who killed them.

491
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,676
It was you, Mr. Lee Dongpil.

492
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,305
And, for murdering them...

493
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,101
you will be sentenced to death.

494
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,024
How can things be easier than this?

495
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,950
You piece of...

496
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,327

501
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,843

503
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,360
(indistinct chatter)

504
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,238
I'd like to have a copy
of a Family Relation Certificate.

505
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,657
Is it for you?

506
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,116
No, I'm his representative.

507
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,911
His lawyer.

508
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,247
(ominous music)

509
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,216
Who...

510
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,637
are you?

511
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,520
I met someone who knows
your father, Jwa Sanggil.

512
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,982
Jwa Sibaek, his son,

513
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,861
died in a hit-and-run accident
when he was in the first grade.

514
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,572
(snickers)

515
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,991
Then who am I?

516
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,117
Exactly.

517
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,828
Who are you?

518
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,956
Once you have
my Family Relation Certificate,

519
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,624
you'll see.

520
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,504
That the person you met with was mistaken.

521
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,132
This.

522
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,723
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE (IN DETAIL)
NAME: JWA SIBAEK

523
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,349
CHAKHEE: Sure.

524
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,601
He's still alive on paper.

525
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,604
That's how you could live as Jwa Sibaek.

526
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,442
Mr. Jwa Sanggil's wife
was too grief-stricken

527
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,822
or perhaps he himself
couldn't accept his son's death

528
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,616
to register for a death certificate.

529
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:01,122
Are you saying that I'm a ghost
of a man who died 30 years ago?

530
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,585
I found a news article.

531
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,337
-(rustles)
-Jwa Sibaek, son of Jwa Sanggil.

532
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,507
The Seongsu Elementary School
first-grader died in a hit-and-run.

533
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,553
CHAKHEE: His father,
Jwa Sanggil, put up a reward

534
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,681
of three million won to catch the culprit.

535
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,266
So?

536
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,520
Does this kid resemble you,
Mr. Jwa Sibaek?

537
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,276
(thumps)

538
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,987
The police will put a search out
for Shin Chisik.

539
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,283
I found evidence
that he's your accomplice.

540
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,120
But I haven't found out
why someone you called your brother

541
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,663
has Shin as his surname.

542
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,666
(eerie music)

543
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,960
Just as you aren't the real Jwa Sibaek,

544
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,714
I'm sure there are other lies
mixed up in this.

545
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,929
Shin Chisik will be arrested in no time.

546
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,807
So you need to stop wasting time.

547
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,519
CHAKHEE: Why did you kill...

548
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,396
Chairman Jang Byungchun?

549
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,778
I already gave you the answer.

550
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,408
Because he...

551
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,954
deserved to die.

552
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,999
(dramatic music)

553
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,017
YIYEON: In his sleep?

554
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,561
(exhales)

555
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,855
He shouldn't have died
in such a peaceful way.

556
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:53,568
You shouldn't be this sad because of him.
I shouldn't have let this happen.

557
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,986
(sighs)

558
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,529
Just what is going on here?

559
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,286
KYUNGJIN: It wasn't...

560
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,956
Shin Chisik.

561
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,292
He didn't attack Chief Jeon Jaeho.

562
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,504
KYUNGJIN: Chief Jeon Jaeho
gave his testimony.

563
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,424
He said Lee Dongpil
was the one who attacked him.

564
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,426
Right here. This guy.

565
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,304
(blows air)

566
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,976
He saw Shin Chisik for the first time
while he was pretending to be a doctor.

567
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,270
He had never even heard of his name.

568
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,023
This man...

569
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,736
DALJAE: Excuse me.

570
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,988
I'm sorry.

571
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,824
What was your order again?

(exhales)

573
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,004
CHAKHEE: Shin Chisik. Lee Dongpil.

574
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,009
It's Shin Chisik.

575
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,136
He's the link
between Jwa Sibaek and Lee Dongpil.

He worked at Younggwang Shoes.

583
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,247
If Shin Chisik was acquainted
with Jwa Sanggil,

584
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,333
it means he knows
Jwa Sibaek isn't his real identity.

585
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,127
What's their relationship?

Shin Chisik and Jwa Sibaek.

587
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,300
Is Shin Chisik the hit-and-run culprit?

Is he alive?

Yes.

619
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,839
Man, this idiot.

620
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,219
I couldn't get a hold of him, so I thought
he killed himself after Heesoo died.

621
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,681
Did you know Ms. Eun Heesoo?

622
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,101
Not a lot of women at factories
have a bachelor's degree.

623
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,645
And she graduated
from the best university in Korea.

624
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,565
CHULWOO: Man, those jerks at the factory.

625
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:47,194
They bullied her and were mean to her
just because she was an educated woman,

626
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,156
but Eun Heesoo was always nice to them.

627
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,993
Later on, many of them had a crush on her.

628
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,997
But that Chisik, a guy who only
graduated middle school, won her heart.

629
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,458
She's Chisik's wife.

630
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,501
They had the wedding date set and all,

631
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,004
and they were going
to get married in their hometown.

632
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,340
But Heesoo died before the wedding.

The poor thing...

634

But what happened to her?

She was murdered.

636
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,731
By any chance, do you know
how Ms. Eun Heesoo passed?

637
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,695
The police insisted she killed herself,
but who would believe something like that?

638
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,615
We all know who killed Eun Heesoo.

639
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,078
That scumbag acted as a mole,

640
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,332
so his father rounded up
every single one of the factory workers.

641
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,836
That’s when Chisik
was arrested and crippled.

642
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,301
You're an attorney, so I'm sure
you've heard of his name too.

643
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,514
Jang Gido.

(exhales in disbelief)

646
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,991
You're standing here today
in a closed factory.

647
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,035
This place reminds me

648
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:23,415
of the factory where I took part
in the labor movement 30 years ago.

00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,710

GIDO: Have you been well?

652
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,646
It's been 30 years already.

653
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,899
It took such a long time
to keep my promise to you.

654
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,988
The world you dreamed of.
The world we dreamed of.

655
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,283
I'll make that happen.

656
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,743
-(scoffs)
-GIDO: Please keep an eye on me.

657
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,455
And see how big I can be
and how high I can go...

658
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,542
as Jang Gido the politician.

Man. Here it is.

664
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,561
It's a copy of Eun Heesoo’s
family registration and of her family.

665
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,480
Thank you. I owe you one.

Man, Ms. Noh.

667
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,942
I heard you made some trouble

668
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,862
and got demoted to being
a freebie lawyer in a hick town.

669
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,073
And your clothes look pitiful too.

670
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,785
You can still go back to Jangsan, right?

671
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,498
I mean, I need to invest
in a stock item that has a future.

672
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,418
I can't invest in something
that'll get delisted.

673
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,630
That item will hit
a new all-time high soon.

What's with my heart...

716
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,259
Granny. Your son, Eun Heejun.

It says here that
you have arrested innocent people,

771
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,988
killed them, tortured them,

772
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,032
then framed them for crimes
they didn't commit,

773
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,700
and sent them to prison.

774
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,621
That you're the famous
Torture Devil Mr. Kim.

All that?
(laughs)

778
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,800
Do you know what it means to sacrifice
personal interest for the public good?

779
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:40,514
You can barely write your own damn name,
so you'd be too ignorant to know.

780
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:46,561
To those criminals,
I was the so-called Torture Devil.

781
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:52,651
But I'm a patriot who sacrificed myself
for the public good.

782
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,487
BYUNGCHUN: But as times have changed,

783

even my wretched servant at home
is calling a patriot like me the devil.

784
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:04,663
What should I do with you?

785
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:11,211
So are you saying it's true?

786
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,297
Okay.

787
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,925
I understand it all.

788

Thank you for everything.

790
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:28,937

00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,278
Go ahead and leave.

794
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,949
I also wonder where you will end up.

00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,746
BYUNGCHUN: You said
you'd leave, so let me ask you.

802
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,998
Where are you now?

803
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,292
Heaven? Hell?

804
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,632
You made a living off the devil,
so you can't end up in heaven.

805
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,885
I'm sure you're in hell too.

806
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,514
(shrieks)

807
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,893
(shaky breathing)

808
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,228
It was tormenting for me too.

809
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,980
It was tough for me too.

810
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,274
I was frightened of my grandfather.

811
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:00,320
But I felt so bad for you.

812
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,865
So every single day
was like hell for me too!

813
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,496
(Yiyeon sobbing)

814
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,754
Jang Gido.

815
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,925
Does Jang Gido know too?

816
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,681
CHAKHEE: That Grandpa killed my grandma.

817
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,061
Tell me.

818
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,397
Does he know?

819
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,906
(Yiyeon muffled sobbing)

820
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,915
(sniffles)

821
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,918
Grandma.

822
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,046
I think I finally know what to do.

823
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,190
(pin clicks)

824
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,954
(line dials, rings)

825
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,712
CHAKHEE: Everything
I investigated is in here.

826
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,341
Jwa Sibaek's testimony helped me
find the last puzzle piece.

827
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,719
It's the perfect picture
to ruin Jang Gido,

828
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,180
the National Assembly candidate.

829
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,187
Are you blackmailing me?

830
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,065
Yes.

831
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,989
What do you think will happen
if I take this to a broadcasting station?

832
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,450
It's all in the past.

833
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,827
It has been over 30 years.

834
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,499
You stopped the investigation
of CEO Cho Hyunsik's murder case

835
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,210
because you were afraid
a 30-year-old story would be released.

836
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,505
You were afraid
Chairman Jang Byungchun's death

837
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:24,672
would become known,

838
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,967
so you made it look like a natural death
and hid the fact that he was tortured.

839
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,179
On top of that, you also framed
Park Dukman as the culprit and killed him.

840
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,473
Stop with all the nonsense.
You have no evidence.

841
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,728
You already know that Park Dukman
called me the day before his death.

842
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,647
CHAKHEE: There's no way.

843
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:46,194
Did you actually believe me
when I said he didn't tell me anything?

844
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,696
(tense music)

845
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,161
What happened 30 years ago...

846
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,289
Yes, the statute of limitations
has expired.

847
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:02,961
You’ll be ethically denounced,
but you won’t go to prison.

848
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,423
But isn’t Park Dukman's case still open?

849
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,804
I’ll stop Park Dukman’s autopsy.

850
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,682
CHAKHEE: His wife has
a borderline intellectual disability.

851
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,268
If I tell her not to do it, she won’t.

852
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,895
I’ll have him cremated immediately
and close the case.

853
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,651
(breathes deeply)

854
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,321
What do you want?

855
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,038
I'd like to return to Jangsan.

856
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,295
I want Chairman Jang Byungchun’s shares.

857
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,716
How many?

858
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,429
All of them.

859
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,848
(dramatic music)

860
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,020
(closing theme music)
