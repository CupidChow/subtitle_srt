So...

56
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,459
A man and a woman went out for drinks.

57
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,086
But the woman blacked out,
and the next day,

58
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,174
she woke up in the man's bed,
wearing his clothes.

59

What is the woman like?

62
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,476
She's unbelievably smart,
beautiful, and cool.

63
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,146
No, I mean, what's she like
when she gets drunk?

64
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,606
Is she the type who sleeps quietly?

65
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,192
Or is she the type who
throws tantrums and causes trouble?

66
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,445
I'd say she gets completely wrecked.

67
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,365
(pensive hum)

68
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,700
Then I'd say the guy was a gentleman.

69
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,952
Why?

70
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,455
He brought a hammered woman back
to his house and changed her clothes too.

71
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,207
Isn't that kind of insidious?

72
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,585
Then should he just leave
the drunk woman out on the street?

73
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,712
Besides, he probably didn't know
her address.

74
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,465
And it's not like he could leave her
at a motel all alone.

75
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,843
What if he knows where she lives?
What if her place is right next to his?

76
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,181
Then, he probably couldn't find her key
or didn't know her entry code.

77
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,934
Her clothes, remember?
Why did he change her out of her clothes?

78
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,187
Don't you think that's the point
where we can presume

79
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,189
he had some sort
of treacherous intentions?

80
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,818
Something had to be wrong with her.

81
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,448
I mean, you just said
she's the type to get wrecked. Right?

82
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,408
And?

83
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,534
When someone gets wrecked,

84
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,786
-they relieve themselves everywhere.
-Enough.

85
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,664
No, forget it. That's impossible.
It's not that.

86
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,876
People do unbelievable things
when they're drunk.

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,128
Stop, that's enough!

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,718
Ms. Noh.

92
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,637
Did you drink a lot yesterday
after Junwoo's mother's trial?

93
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,848
Did I?

94
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,476
It's not like me to drink
until I black out like that.

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,771
Well, I think you did that
because you trust Mr. Jwa.

96
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,939

00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,635
-(pen clicks)
-Jwa Sibaek had been tailing Cho Hyunsik.

140
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,889
He waited until he spotted a chance,
and then he went in for the kill!

141
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,268
If what you said is true,
he would've beaten Noh Chakhee to death.

142
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,938
You're right. In most murder cases,
the motive is usually money or women.

143
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,774
But I've never seen
a guy stab the other man

144
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,651
when they completely lose it.

145

(sighs)

146
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,115
Whether the alleged affair is real or not,
many of them actually go for the girl.

147

(scoffs)

148
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,996
Then Jwa Sibaek must be the kind of guy
who blames the other man.

149
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,957
You threw around a lot of statistics
when we were talking about the motive,

150
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,753
so why do you make an exception
for the gender of the victim?

151
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,631
Come on. This is ridiculous.

152
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,549
In order for your presumption
to make sense,

153
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,094
Jwa Sibaek and Noh Chakhee
must be deeply in love.

154
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,890
So much so that he would completely
lose it and murder someone. Okay?

155
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,808
That's the premise
we'd have to work off of.

156
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,812
So are they in a relationship?
Did they sleep together?

157
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,730
I mean...

158
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,984
How am I supposed to know
about their personal lives in such detail?

159
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,694
(scoffs)

160
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,030
Okay, fine.

161
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,240
But look at this.

162
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,367
JUNG: They live right next to each other.

163
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,370
This is practically living together.

00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,038
They're obviously in a relationship,

165
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,208
so Jwa Sibaek must have
followed Noh Chakhee

166
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,919
when she was with Cho Hyunsik!

167
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,047
Detective Jung, sir.

168
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,633
Ma'am.

169
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,844
Oh, man. You're awfully fussy. Damn.

170
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,471
(chair clonks)

171
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,683
Thank you very much
for your fun little story.

172
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,811
(exhales)
It must be tough for you.

173
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,605

SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

175
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,446
-How dare he talk down to me like that?
-(phone ringing)

176
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,074
REPORTER: This morning,
at a golf resort in Gyeonggi Province,

177
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,951
the president of
an electric company, Mr. Yoon,

178
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,203
was found murdered,
shocking the local residents.

179
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,705
According to a police source,

180
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,166
Mr. Yoon was found in his underwear
with his hands and feet tied.

181
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,669
He's presumed to have been tortured
prior to his death.

182
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,381
We'll now go to our reporter,
who is at the scene of the crime.

183
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,635
I'm standing next to this water hazard,
where Mr. Yoon, a man in his 60s,

184
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,470
was found dead.

185
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,808
The police shut down the water hazard
to conduct a crime scene investigation...

186
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,148
SEOKGU: I signed the contract.

187
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,192
You do know the terms, right?

188
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,321
What do you wish to know, Ms. Oh?

189
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,866
Did my husband kill CEO Cho?

190
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,660
How would I know something like that?

191
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,624
Is there a reason why
he'd want to kill him?

192
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,836
Now that's something
I might actually know.

193
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,298
SEOKGU: I don't think we should
discuss this over the phone though.

194
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,674
Let's set a date.

195
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,927
We have to finalize the contract
for the shopping mall construction anyway.

196
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,350
GIDO: President Yoon Seokgu...

197
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,392
(clacks)

198
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,481
Why are you so surprised?

199
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,983
(anxious sigh)
It's nothing.

200
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,995
He was murdered early this morning.

201
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,667
I saw it on TV. It was on the news.

202
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,293
I heard you met with him.

203
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,755
(uneasy music)

204
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,881
How did you...

205
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,716
He told me.

206
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,385
The night before he died.

207
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,429
GIDO: I heard you asked
to sign a new contract.

208
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,556
I did.

209
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,395
But we couldn't agree
on the terms, so I called it off.

210
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,690
Is that so?

211
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,153
DAEHYEON: Haran.

212
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,448
Come on in.

213
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,994
Let's go to the study.

214
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,135
-(bottle clinks)
-(whiskey sloshing)

215
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
Gido.

216
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,225
DAEHYEON: There can't be
any secrets between us.

217
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,145
Your past and your mistakes.

218
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,647
I need to know everything.

219
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:19,280
Is there anything I should know
regarding CEO Cho Hyunsik's murder?

220
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,661
(phone vibrates)

221
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,538
CEO CHO HYUNSIK'S WIFE

222
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,920
Hello, ma'am.

223
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,383
The campaign funds my husband
promised you before his death.

224
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,595
I think I can come up with the money.

225
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,556
GIDO: Ah...

226
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
Is that so?

227
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:54,023
By the way, I heard on the news
that President Yoon was murdered.

228
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,400
Yes.

229
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,693
I heard that too.

230
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,320
MRS. CHO: Was it the same killer?

231
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,948
(sighs)
This whole situation makes me nervous.

232
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,159
Don't worry.

233
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,414
We'll make sure we catch the culprit
who killed Uncle Hyunsik.

234
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,084
CEO CHO HYUNSIK'S WIFE

235
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,965
The campaign funds...

236
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,176
DAEHYEON: Gido.

237
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,764
Even if you said you killed
Mr. Cho, I wouldn't care.

238
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,519
But if you're hiding something
from me, I can't work...

239
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,812
The same goes for you.

240
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,067
You're hiding something from me too.

241
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,238
GIDO: Don't worry.

242
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,699
The killer will be caught,
and the case will be closed quietly.

243
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,370
(Jaeho sighs)

244
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,499
(exhales)

245
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,296
(knocks on door)

246
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,892
JAEHO: It's the same guy.

247
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,727
This is a serial murder.

248
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,646
We don't know that yet.

249
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,440
It might be a copycat crime.

250
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,151
It doesn't matter
if it's a copycat or a serial murderer.

251
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,113
(dark music)

252
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,573
They know about us.

253
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,577
What about the investigation?

254
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,290
The regional investigation unit
will take over serial murder cases.

255
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,624
When the investigation begins,

256
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,168
they'll find out about the bribes
I took from them,

257
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,129
and the way I cut them slack.

258
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,424
JAEHO: Things have changed now
that Cho Hyunsik isn't the only victim.

259
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,718
If this is determined
to be a serial murder,

260
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,431
I won't be able to use my position
to stop the investigation or the media.

261
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,729
Taking some pocket money
from people won't be such a big problem.

262
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,650
I messed around
with that girl eight years ago.

263
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,903
The reporters will dig into it.

264
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,114
JAEHO: After my case was dropped,
a suit was filed against me.

265
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,950
The world has changed.

266
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,453
The reporters and those women.

267
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,623
They'll all eat me alive.

268
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,002
If the world has changed,
maybe you deserve what's coming.

269
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,966
You got a cut of the campaign funds too.

270
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,176
Chief.

271
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,888
I never received
any of the campaign funds.

272
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,518
Both Cho Hyunsik and Yoon Seokgu

273
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,729
would have shoved
the funds down your throat

274
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,897
even if you didn't want it.

275
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,151
JAEHO: That way, they'd get something
out of you if you got elected.

276
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,737
You expect me to believe you weren't paid?

277
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,701
I'm more likely to believe
a dog on the street could talk.

278
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,455
Who would be able to prove that?

279
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,962
The ones who shoved money
down my throat are all dead and gone.

280
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,215
GIDO: You should thank the killer.

281
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,802
Now no one will be able
to flaunt their power over you.

282
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,806
Keep your mouth shut.

283
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,517
I don't care if reporters or the police
swarm in and poke around.

284
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,312
Shut your mouth and hold out
until my election is over.

285
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,940
And if I hold out?

286
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,858
The killer will have been caught.

287
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,902
(music stops)

288
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,703
Will we be able to catch them?

289
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
That's for you to decide.

290
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,375
Will you catch the killer or not?

291
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,670
GIDO: Will you catch the real culprit
to resolve the case?

292
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,382
Or will you catch whoever you can
and close the case?

293
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,845
(suspenseful music)

294
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,192

00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,784

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,267
(uneasy music)

300
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,899
Honey.

301
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,193
I need water.

302
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,281
And some disinfectant too.

303
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,366
DALJAE: Honey.

304
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,796
Honey.

305
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,967
Honey.

306
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,264
Hey, honey.

307
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,059
Honey.

Yes, well...

You said you know where my wife is.

MAN: Yes, I do know where she is.

318

Where is she right now? Where's my wife?

319
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,668
MAN: She died six months ago.

00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,090
What...

322
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,426
do you mean?

323
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,262
My goodness.

00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,225
What brings you here at this hour?

327
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,019
Chisik, you guys were closed two days ago.

328
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,188
Yeah.

329
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
I had to do something.

330
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,774
I mean, think about it.

331
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,195
If a small, local business owner
like yourself closes up shop like that,

332
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,156
how will you pay your rent
and become a homeowner?

333
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,867
I was only closed for a bit
in the afternoon.

334
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,160
Why are you here?

335
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,119
Why am I here?

336
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,913
I need about 30 dumplings.

337
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,080
How many?

338
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,665
Thirty.
(snickers)

339
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,417
Okay, sure. One second.

340
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,339
(plastic squeaking)

341
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,260
Come on, aren't you a chef?

342
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,263
How can you leave duct tape next to food?

343
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,848
This is gross.

344
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,351
I mean, it's right next to the food.

345
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,061
-(line ringing)
-Please answer.

346
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,563
She has to come today.

00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,981

348
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,317
OPERATOR: The number
you have dialed cannot be reached...

349
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,818
This is bad.

350
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,028
(sighs)

351
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,289
(pensive music)

352
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,379
(approaching footsteps)

353
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,632
Are you Ms. Choi Yoonjung?

354
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,302
How do you know my name?

355
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,681
Ah, I'm your attorney, Noh Chakhee.

356
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,601
I called you many times,
but you never picked up.

357
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,396
I thought you wouldn't come
to the trial today, but you did.

358
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,274
You never called me.

359
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:17,985
What?

360
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,362
I called you many times. Even just now.

361
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,240
I never received any calls from you.

362
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,784
What? No way.

363
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,661
That can't be right.

364
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,247
TODAY
CHOI YOONJUNG (6)

365
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,331

00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,015
COURT

370
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,560
Counselor.

371
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,687
JUDGE OH: Do you admit to the charges?

372
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,858
Your Honor. I just met
with the defendant today,

373
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,527
so I haven't had a chance
to discuss this case with her.

374
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,987
JUDGE

375
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,365
Ms. Choi, well...

376
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,827
You threw a flowerpot out of
the second story of your studio apartment

377
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,746
and made a scene at the hospital.

378
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,456
You admit to those charges, right?

379
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,250
Admit to what?

380
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,836
YOONJUNG: Are you saying
I committed some sort of a crime?

381
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,837
PROSECUTOR

382
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,506
I mean, the investigation records say...

383
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,385
What I mean is that you told the police
that you admit to your crimes.

384
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,137
YOONJUNG: When did I say that?

385
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,265
Are you framing me as a criminal?

386
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,393
(playful music)

387
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,145
DEFENSE COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

388
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,275
JUDGE OH: Defendant.

389
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,527
Is there anything you'd like to say?

390
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,780
Would you like to explain
the situation yourself?

391
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,991
Your Honor.

392
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:53,330
I actually hit my hand a few times
with a hammer because my hand was hurting.

393
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:57,876
YOONJUNG: Then I broke my wrist,
so I went to the hospital and got surgery.

394
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,090
But the day after the surgery,
my wrist began to hurt even more.

395
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,968
So I've been going to all kinds
of hospitals trying to fix this.

396
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,014
I went and got X-rays and CT scans
to see why I was in so much pain,

397
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,267
but every single hospital I visited
said nothing was wrong with it.

398
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,228
It makes no sense.

399
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,148
I'm in so much pain, so how can there be
nothing wrong with my wrist?

400
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,820
I realized that Korean hospitals
weren't going to be helpful,

401
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,948
so I thought about presenting
my case to a hospital in America.

402
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,911
You see, I wanted to look up
famous American hospitals on the internet,

403
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,749
but it was raining,
so the internet was very slow.

404
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,295
That jerk is trying to keep me
from curing this disease

405
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,132
and even made it rain.

406
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,801
(indistinct muttering)

407
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,685
The judge was asking
why you threw the flowerpot.

408
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,978
Don't go off on a tangent...

409
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,856
I was just about to get to that!

410
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,399
Wait, are you...

411
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,485
criticizing me right now?

412
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,697
No, of course not.

413
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,948
Please continue.

414
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,283
(clears throat)

415
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:20,000
So I finally got to finish my search,
but I didn't get any promising results.

416
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,711
YOONJUNG: All kinds
of hospitals were saying

417
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,338
nothing was wrong
with my wrist, but it still hurt.

418
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,133
So I told it to stop.

419
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:33,597
But it wouldn't stop,
although I kept saying, "Stop it!"

420
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:39,644
I tried to scold it and coax it,
but nothing worked.

421
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,189
JUDGE OH: Defendant.

422
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,733
Who were you talking to
when you told it to stop?

423
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,111
To my left hand.

424
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,654
(indistinct muttering)

425
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,240
(comical music)

426
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,620
(chuckles confusingly)

427
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,206
Is that why you threw the flowerpot?

428
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,334
You got angry when it kept hurting you
even though you told it to stop.

429
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,963
But I heard that a car got smashed
because of me, so I paid to have it fixed.

430
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,258
Why did you make a scene at the hospital?

431
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,179
I realized that when
the hospital operated on me,

432
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,308
they planted a chip in my wrist.

433
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:22,312
So I went there to complain
and asked them to take the chip out,

434
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,314
but they said they couldn't do it.

435
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,691
So, of course, I got angry!

436
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,402
YOONJUNG: Your Honor.

437
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,573
Are hospitals allowed to plant a chip
in my wrist without my consent,

438
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,284
and then refuse to treat me?

439
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,497
Are they?

440
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,172
(exhales deeply)

441
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,512
You admitted to your crimes,
but you paid to have the car fixed,

442
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,514
so I asserted that
as grounds for leniency.

443
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,766
As for the assault
and obstruction of business charges,

444
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,352
the hospital was in the wrong
for refusing to treat you,

445
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,938
so I said it's not a crime
to complain about that.

446
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,065
You understand what I'm saying, right?

447
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,526
Ms. Noh.

448
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,529
Are you looking down on me right now?

449
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,490
Do you think I wouldn't
be able to understand that?

450
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,743
Oh, no. Of course not.
Please come to the next trial too.

451
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,328
CHAKHEE: We'll be examining witnesses.

452
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,123
If the surveillance becomes worse,
I may not be able to come out.

453
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,416
"The surveillance"?

454
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,750
Recently, the surveillance...

455
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,002
(rustles)

456
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,837
...has become much more intense.

457
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,921
Surveillance...

458
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,382

Mr. Park, you're 50 years older than me...

488
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,226
(laughs)

489
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,103
Then why weren't you born earlier than me?

490
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,105
(all laughing)

491
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,564
KANGIL: All right, now.

492
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,858
If anyone tackles me
and steals the ball...

493
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,776
CHILD: Yes!

494
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,611
...I'll let you take
weekend soccer classes.

495
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,529
Who wants to try?

496
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,780
-Me!
-Me!

497
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,073
KANGIL: Okay, let's go!

498
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,158
(children squealing)

499
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,892
(exhales)

500
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,899
(taxi engine revs)

501
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,905
(siren wailing)

502
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,494
(thunder roars)

503
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,913
(rain pouring)

504
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,125
911 EMERGENCY SERVICES

505
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,711
(gurney clanking)

506
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,133
(emotional music)

507
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,266
(dramatic music)

508
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,606
(umbrella clanks)

509
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,753
(exhales)

510
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,257
BYUNGCHUN: Chakhee!

511
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,843
You're finally here.

512
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,728
-(children exclaiming)
-CHILD: Thank you!

513
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,691
Our children are crazy about pizza.

514
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,652
Look how they're eating it up.

515
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,820
It's not a big deal.

516
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,323
I'll help you anytime
you need legal counseling.

517
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,825
Just give me a call.

518
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,910
I'm always grateful...

519
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,038
I'm always grateful
to have another sponsor.

520
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,374
Do you play soccer?

521
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,503
Playing soccer with the kids
is another great way to help them.

522
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,592
KANGIL: Mr. Jang should be Santa Claus.

523
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,177
HAESONG CAFETERIA OPENING CEREMONY

524
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,429
He's the Korean Santa Claus.

525
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,474
Who is he?

526
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,685
The biggest sponsor
of our children's home.

527
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,354
Chairman Jang Byungchun.

528
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,442
Ah! Come to think of it,

529
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,696
the smartest girl who's ever come out
of our children's home is working

530
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,364
as a public defender in Jeongha.

531
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,199
I wonder if you might know her.

532
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,620
Her name is Noh Chakhee.

533
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,999
KANGIL: She has a hot temper,
but she's not a bad girl.

534
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,377
She used to be
a very talented lawyer in Seoul.

535
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,546
Do you know her by any chance?

536
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,509
No, I don't know her.

537
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:32,432
Now, press the message button.
Do you see this screen?

538
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah, I do.

539
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,726
Then right here.

540
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,312
Press the name of the person
you want to send the message to.

541
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,688
-Okay.
-And press it.

542
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,816
CHAKHEE: Then just type
whatever you want to say.

543
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,359
Do you see this paper plane button?

544
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,236
You press that to send the message.

545
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,281
Goodness, I couldn't even do
something as simple as that.

546
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,657
(laughs)

547
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,076
Why do you suddenly have
to send a text message?

548
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,244
(sighs)

549
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,538
It happened while I was here alone
in my vacation home,

550
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,207
so I couldn't ask anybody.

551
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,918
Mm-hmm. Wait.

552
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,796
When you called, you said you might die.

553
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,590
That? Well...

554
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,136
Since my granddaughter taught me
how to send text messages,

555
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,681
should I try sending her one?

556
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,891
Oh!

557
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,227
(chuckles)

558
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,522
I wonder what my grandpa sent me.

559
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,982
Chakhee.

560
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,734
You know that...

561
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,988
Grandpa loves you, right?

562
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,615
Of course, I do.

563
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,158
(giggles)

564
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,409
Oh, I got the message.

565
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,997
"This letter first began in the UK..."

566
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,958
Grandpa!

567
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,459
What other choice do I have?

568
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,837
It says I'll die if I don't pass it on
before the end of the day.

569
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,632
Wait, was this why you said
you were going to die?

570
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,013
You should hurry up
and send it to someone else.

572
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,973
But this is...

573
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,392
Come on, Chakhee.

574
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,435
BYUNGCHUN: Do you not have
anyone to send it to?

575
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,564
If you don't have anyone,
then send it to Gido or something.

576
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,276
No, I have someone I can send it to.

577
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,695
BYUNGCHUN: Mm.

578
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,907
(gentle music)

579
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,284
(phone vibrates)

580
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,293
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKEE
THIS LETTER FIRST BEGAN IN THE UK...

581
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,634
(insects chirping)

582
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,305
(line dials, rings)

583
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,725
Where are you right now?

584
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,518
YIYEON: Send me five million won.

585
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,229
Where are you?
I'll give it to you in person. Stay there.

586
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,356
YIYEON (yells):
Send it to me now, damn it!

587
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,108
Unless you want to see me dead.

588
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,317
All right.

589
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,736
(sighs)
Mommy will...

590
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,739
YIYEON: If you don't want to, forget it.
I'll just die, and it'll be over.

591
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,865
Yiyeon...

592
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,161
(sighs)

593
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,955
GIDO: Was that Yiyeon?

594
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,004
What did she do this time?

595
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,339
What is it?

596
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,552
Are you worried about her
or that she'll cause trouble

597
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,637
and keep you from becoming an assemblyman?

598
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,015
Both.

599
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,809
(scoffs)

600
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,521
Haran.

601
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,113
The longer you hesitate,
the more you'll be at a disadvantage.

602
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,324
GIDO: I will put on that golden pin.

603
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,743
I'll do anything to get it.

604
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,955
So it's time you made a choice.

605
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,793
Will you be my friend or my foe?

606
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,091
What if I say I'll be your foe?

607
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,095
On the battlefield, one's foe...

608
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,181
must be killed.

609
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,227
(tense music)

610
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,573
(eerie music)

611
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,202
UNDER INVESTIGATION
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE

612
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,544
KYUNGUJIN: There are
no security cameras on the way

613
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,089
into the vacation home or inside it.

614
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,134
That's precisely why it was built.

615
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,018
There's no sign of intrusion.

616
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,728
DO NOT ENTER

617
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,650
If you're late...

618
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,573
KYUNGJIN: The culprit is someone
Cho Hyunsik was acquainted with.

619
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,535
(tense music)

620
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,914
(door squeaks)

621
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:29,270
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

622
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,662
(cabinet opens)

623
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,706
(clinking)

624
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,549
(ice rattles)

625
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,643
(grunting)

626
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,729
The culprit knocked Cho Hyunsik out

627
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,566
and took him to the bathroom
to torture him with water.

628
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,410
(haunting music)

629
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:36,712
(heels clacking)

630
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,343
Cho Hyunsik came here
every weekend with a woman.

631
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,554
He probably called her first,
then came here to wait for her.

632
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,642
The woman got
to the vacation home around 9:00 a.m.,

633
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,479
and then stayed here with him
until the next day.

634
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,400
The first one to find
Cho Hyunsik's dead body was also...

635
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,819
that woman.

636
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,362
(woman screams)

637
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,910
(tense music)

638
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,999
It's someone who knew
Cho Hyunsik came here every weekend.

639
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,295
Someone who knew
that the woman would find Cho Hyunsik.

640
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,337
(breathes deeply)

641
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,633
Damn. How did they know
Cho Hyunsik's schedule?

642
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,012
Was it his chauffeur?

643
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,222
His secretary?

644
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,932
Or...

645
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,476
Was he tailed?

646
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,812
Tailed.

647
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,065
(dramatic music fades)

648
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,194
Mr. Jwa!

649
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,618
What is this?

650
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,079
YOUNGSOO: What do you think?
It's the lucky chain letter!

651
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,831
I couldn't die alone.

652
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,624
YOUNGSOO: Still, how
could you send it to me?

653
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,627
Go take it up with her, then!
She's the one who sent it to me!

654
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,628
YOUNGSOO: Damn it.

655
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,298
I mean, couldn't you just be
each other's secret Santa?

656
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,884
Why are you passing along
these ticking chain letter bombs?

657
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,886
What a train wreck of an office.

658
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,721
Secret Santa...

659
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,641
Mr. Jwa has always been a wacko,
so I'd expect this from him,

660
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,769
but why would you send this, Ms. Noh?

661
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,856
I got it from someone too.
I sent it to Jwa Sibaek to kill him.

662
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,525
I never imagined Mr. Jwa
would be capable of doing something

663
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,110
this heinous to you, my dear Mr. Do.

664
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,070
CHAKHEE: I mean it.

665
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,907
Other paralegals are concerned
about rude clients, but I'm...

666
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,825
I'm getting a headache from you guys.

667
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,453
YOUNGSOO: Who am I
supposed to send this to now?

668
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,288
I don't have anybody else to send it to!

669
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,458
Damn it, what if I die?

670
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,545
(Youngsoo groans)

671
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,963
For God's sake.

672
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,467
Gosh, I can't let our Mr. Do die.

673
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,635
YOUNGSOO: Shoot.

674
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,011
What do I do now?

675
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,555
Damn it. This is driving me insane.

676

CHAKHEE: "You got drunk
and attacked a police officer."

679
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,380
Obstruction of justice.

680
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,006
A five million won fine.

681
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,760

683
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,641
You haven't...

684
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,811
quit drinking yet?

685
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,230
I heard you went to rehab.

686
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,359
I'm going to pay the fine,
so I don't need your defense.

687
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,320
Where have you been?

688
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,241
Do you live in Jeongha now?

689
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,995
(shaky breathing)

690
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,583
Grandpa misses you a lot.

691

CHAKHEE: And so did I.

692
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,671
Mr. Jang and Ms. Oh
are looking for you too.

693
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,964
-So...
-It's because of you.

(tense music)

695

It's all because of you.

696
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,600
If it hadn't been for you,

697
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,394
I wouldn't be like this today.

698
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,937

It's all your fault!

DAEHYUN: Who is she?

703
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,336
GIDO: My daughter.

704
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,298
I can see the resemblance
between her and Haran.

705
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,383
DAEHYUN: And she's a great student.

706
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,636
(clicks tongue)
I can use this to get the media on our...

707
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,472
Was she expelled from med school?

708
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,725
Yes, after repeating
the same year many times.

709
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,560
Look for her.

710
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,146
What?

711
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,274
I have no idea where she is
or what she's up to.

712
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,444
We need to find her
before she causes trouble.

713
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,698
"Trouble"?

714
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,455
(approaching footsteps)

715
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,877
Are you all right?

716
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,090
SIBAEK: Here.

717
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,803
Iced decaf soy dolce latte, right?

718
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,306
Thanks.

719
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,769
SIBAEK: Who is she?

720
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,190
The granddaughter of
Jangsan's chairman, Jang Byungchun.

721
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,400
She's Jang Gido's daughter.

722
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,654
Why is Jang Gido's daughter at our office?

723
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,031
Why didn't she go see
one of Jangsan's countless lawyers?

724
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,201
That's what I'd like to know.

725
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,997
It's all because of you.

726
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,582
If it hadn't been for you,

727
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,084
I wouldn't be like this today.

728
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,379
What did she mean by that?

729
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,800

Did you?

741
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,573
I went to a public defender's office
because of my fine, and she was there.

742
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,951
I heard that she was fired from Jangsan.

743
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,120
But a public defender? What a mismatch.

We're sort of ridiculous, aren't we?

00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,052
Your daughter works for my dad,
and I work with you,

while the real fathers
and daughters are like enemies.

00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,352
I made some sponge cake.

I know you love them.

751

Take some home with you.

Yes.

I hear Seokgu is dead.

00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,367
Was it the same person who killed Hyunsik?

but she wouldn't pick up her phone.

00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,087

OPERATOR: The number you have dialed...

818
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,305
She really needs to be here today.

819
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,350
Judge Oh hates it when this happens.

820
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,939
JUDGE

821
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,903
Is the defendant not present?

822
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,283
Yes, I've called her numerous times,
but she won't pick up.

823
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,327
Counselor.

824
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,039
Is this how you intend
to conduct your trials?

825
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,875
Do you just give up
when the defendant doesn't pick up?

826
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,503
If she can't be reached, you should
find her and bring her here yourself!

827
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,297
Do you think this trial is a joke?

828
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,758
No, sir.

829
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,509
I'm sorry.

830
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,888
CHAKHEE: I'll make sure
to have her with me next time.

831
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,097
(softly)
I'm sorry.

DEFENSE COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

833
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,442
WITNESS

834
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,361
I mean, we tried to put up with her,
but we just couldn't take it anymore.

835
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,863
That's why we made the report.

836
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,534
Witness. The defendant
may have been somewhat rude,

837
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,662
but a hospital shouldn't flatly refuse
to treat a patient, correct?

838
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,747
That's true.

839
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,374
If her wrist was in pain,
we would fix that.

840
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,334
But you know...

841
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,379
You've met her too, so you should know.

842
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,883
Her wrist isn't what's wrong.
She's sick in the head.

843
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,220
How can an orthopedic clinic
be of any help to her?

844
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,350
I mean, how can I remove a chip
from her wrist that doesn't exist?

847
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,526
Man, did she go somewhere and die?
Why is it impossible to reach her?

848
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:57,364
If I don't bring her to the next trial,
Judge Oh will kill me.

-Shoot.

CHAKHEE: "Kang Daehan..."

852
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,622
How could I have forgotten about that?

853
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,499
Kang Daehan...

854
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,798
(light music)

855
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,096
This one.

856
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,766
And this one too.

857
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,644
Let's see...

858
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,241

(coughs)

864
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,682
Oh my, what brings you here at this hour?

865
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,933
Where are the kids?

866
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,769
Ah! They're at school.

867
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,521
At 7:00 p.m.?

868
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,941
Well, you see...

869
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,360
Daehan. Kang Daehan!

870
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,112
Daehan!

871
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,115
Where are the kids?

872
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,954
-Should I call the police?
-No.

873
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,249
They're at the children's home.
The one Soonyoung grew up in.

874
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,502
-The children's home?
-It hasn't been that long.

875
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,504
It hasn't even been a week.
Give them a call.

876
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,464
Hey!

877
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,383
You said you're practically like
Soonyoung's sister.

878
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,553
You said that you'll look after her kids,
so I sent you a million won a month.

879
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,139
But you sent them to a children's home
without even telling me?

880
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,390
God, unbelievable.

881
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,059
What if I hadn't come here today?

882
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,102
How long were you going
to keep this a secret?

883
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,104
I can't believe this nonsense.

884
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:58,068
I mean, Soonyoung said
I could send them to the children's home

885
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,611
if things got too tough, so...

886

Ah, Mr. Park.

891
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,440
It's been a while.

892
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,359
Yes.

893
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,410
(soft chuckle)

894
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,497
So does Soonyoung know
that her kids are here?

895
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,584
She does. I called her and told her
not to worry about anything.

896
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,838
KANGIL: By the way,
what's happening with Soonyoung?

897
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,798
Will she be released?

898
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,510
A talented attorney
is working on her case.

899
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,095
She'll be released.

900
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,264
Really? That's good, then.

901
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,893
That kid. She's always seemed kind of
out of it, even when she was little.

902
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,021
Her own husband...
(tongue clicks)

903
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,481
KANGIL: No, wait.

904
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:22,569
Or did she use the birth control pills
as an excuse to stab her husband?

905
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,154
(chuckles)

906
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,158
Today is Soonyoung's son's birthday.

907
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,036
I see.

908
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,122
If I had known,
I would've thrown him a birthday party.

909
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,959
CHAKHEE: Please give these to him
when he wakes up tomorrow.

910
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,294
And...

911
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,549
NOH CHAKHEE

912
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,136
This is my phone number.

913
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,513
Please ask him to call me tomorrow.

914
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,558
-I will.
-If you'll excuse me, I'll be going now.

915
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,145
KANGIL: Hey, now.

916
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,647
You just got here.
Why are you leaving so soon?

917
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,275
I hear you're a public defender
in Jeongha.

918
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,195
Let's talk about that
and catch up a little.

919
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,363
Right, well...

920
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,322
Later.

921
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:12,202
Please take good care of her kids,
just until I find a place for them.

922
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,370
Thank you.

923
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,872
That's not something
you need to worry about.

924
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,626
There's no other paradise
for children like our children's home.

925
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,420
Right. I'll get going.
You don't have to see me out.

926
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,928
-That little...
