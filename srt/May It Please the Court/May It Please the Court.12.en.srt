1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,799
(theme music)

2
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,639
(clinks)

3
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,232
(music intensifies)

4
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,029
(splashes)

5
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:45,962
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,090
EPISODE 12

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,934
(exhales)

8
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,397
(somber music)

9
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,114
I'm trying to decide what to do with this.

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,161
Should I take this to the press
and expose it?

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,664
Or use it to directly blackmail Jang Gido?

12
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,461
CHAKHEE: In here...

13
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,799
is every piece
of information I've gathered.

14
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,802
The fact that...

15
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:39,599
you're Eun Heejun,
who went missing 30 years ago

16
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,811
and was taken off the resident register.

17
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,231
That Eun Heesoo,
the older sister of Eun Heejun,

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,484
died in 1989.

19
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,862
That her husband, Shin Chisik,

20
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,617
was tortured by the police.

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,456
And that Jang Gido worked
at the factory as a mole for the police.

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,044
Of course,

23
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,299
there is also information about
Chairman Jang Byungchun's past.

24
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,511
What do you want?

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,638
(sniffles)

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,184
I need a timeline.

27
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,648
From the moment Ms. Eun Heesoo
entered university and met Jang Gido

28
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,234
to when Mr. Eun Jungho
was sentenced to ten years

29
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,819
for violating the national security law

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,698
and died in prison
from the after-effects of torture.

31
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,409
And...

32
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,746
with a mother who lost her mind,

33
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,374
how Eun Heejun, who suddenly
found himself an orphan,

34
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,793
decided to live as Jwa Sibaek

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,046
and exact his revenge...

36
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,550
thirty years later.

37
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,932
(emotional music)

38
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:08,146
What you have is the last piece
of the puzzle I'm looking for.

39
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,149
Once the story is completed,

40
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:13,985
Jang Gido...

41
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,030
will fall.

42
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,751
JEONGHA POLICE STATION

43
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,344
(siren wailing)

44
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,685
CHAKHEE: How was Grandpa...

45
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,813
when he died?

46
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,276
Did he have a painful death?

47
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,657
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,703
What I want to know...

49
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,706
is whether Jang Byungchun
was in enough pain.

50
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,417
Did he scream when he died?

51
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,046
(angry tone)
Did he beg you not to kill him?

52
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,803
I was told that he killed my grandma.

53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,347
CHAKHEE: And Jang Gido knew that.

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,393
You were right, Mr. Jwa.

55
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,479
Without knowing that, I was...

56
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,151
I was Jangsan's lapdog.

57
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,659
(sniffles)

58
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,050
Jang Byungchun...

59
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,721
was tortured to death,

60
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,974
and his body was butchered
during the autopsy,

61
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,309
but that's not enough.

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,937
I'm going to execute him further.

63
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,941
I will drag him from his grave,
bring him to court, and have him beheaded.

64
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,280
I will destroy
every ounce of honor he had.

65
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,710
What happened in 1989?

66
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,426
(somber music)

67
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,097
It was a Saturday.

68
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,270
My dad was supposed to take me fishing.

69
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,482
I was excited.

70
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,861
So I ran home
as soon as I got out of school.

71
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,198
SIBAEK: But when I got home,

72
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,868
there was a cool looking Jeep
parked out front.

73
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,371
I thought, "This is amazing.

74
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,707
A fishing trip and a Jeep?"

75
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,420
But that's when someone called my name.

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,925
SIBAEK: It was a man in black sunglasses.

77
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,261
Because he said he was my dad's friend,

78
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,431
and he gave me some pocket money,

79
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,975
I happily led the way

80
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,854
to where my dad was,
without a second thought.

81
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:43,236
-But who are you?
-Me?

82
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,114
I'm your dad's friend,

83
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,990
Mr. Kim.

84
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,493
Where's your dad?

85
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,496
(chuckles)

86
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,585
HEEJUN: Dad!

87
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,921
JUNGHO: Hey, my boy.

88
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,214
(Jungho chuckles)

89
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,594
Eun Jungho!

90
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,931
Yes? Who are you?

91
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,891
-(thwacks)
-(Jungho groans)

92
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,226
Dad.

93
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,812
Why are you doing this?

94
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,193
Shin Chisik confessed everything.
He's your son-in-law, right?

95
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,570
Let go!

96
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,822
-Heejun, go home.
-HEEJUN: Let go of my dad!

97
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,868
-Hey.
-(handcuffs clink)

98
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,120
HEEJUN: Let go of my dad!

99
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,331
-Let go of my dad!
-All right. It's okay.

100
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,000
-He'll be back soon.
-Heejun, it's okay!

101
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,168
I'll be okay!

102
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,127
Go wait at home, son!

103
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,171
-HEEJUN: Let go.
-GOON: You little turd!

104
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,630
You brat.

105
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,132
-Walk along.
-(Heejun cries)

106
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,259
-Heejun.
-Mind your own business.

107
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,265
The kid's got a temper.

108
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,808
(Byungchun chuckles)

109
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,399
(Heejun's crying continues)

110
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,154
(birds squawking)

111
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,116
(dark music)

112
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,134
CHISIK: Let's go.

113
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,560
HEEJUN: Dad!

114
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,645
(emotional music)

115
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,855
(Heejun sniffles)

116
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,276
My dad is cold. His feet are freezing.

117
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,655
(Heejun cries)

118
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,996
I had...

119
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,666
killed my father.

120
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,921
I was the one who led Jang Byungchun

121
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,260
to my dad...

122
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,477
(emotional music)

123
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,866
SIBAEK: How did he endure

124
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,244
the past 30 years by himself?

125
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,414
Why did he...

126
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,708
choose to be alone?

127
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,590
Because when those who remember are gone,

128
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,761
the truth goes with them.

129
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,433
There is no divine power in this world.

130
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,271
And every moment I took another breath...

131
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,110
was like hell.

132
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,116
I had already died...

133
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,247
thirty years ago.

134
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,023
JANGSAN

135
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,107
SHARES TRANSFER AGREEMENT

136
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,151
TRANSFEROR: JANG BYUNGCHUN
TRANSFEREE: NOH CHAKHEE

137
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,489
Chakhee.

138
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,659
Do you really have to do this?

139
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,081
Do you have to stab me in the back
when I'm at my most vulnerable?

140
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,127
(emotional music)

141
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,588
I apologize.

142
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,618
No matter what anyone says,
over the last 18 years,

143
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,416
I've cared more about you
than my own daughter.

144
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,838
I thought you knew that too.

145
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,423
(breathes deeply)

146
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,428
I wouldn't be this hurt
if it were anyone else.

147
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,763
Because it's you.

148
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,308
Because I thought of you
as my own daughter.

149
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,482
You doing this feels like
a knife stabbing my heart.

150
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,616
(thrumming music)

151
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,586
(Gido breathes deeply)

152
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,136
Think of how Grandpa adored you.

153
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,807
When you became an orphan
after losing your grandmother,

154
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,311
he took care of you for 18 years
like you were his own granddaughter.

155
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,193
But if he knew that you were stabbing
my heart like this to take his shares,

156
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,445
imagine how sad he'd be.

157
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,535
How will you face him
in the afterlife when you pass?

158
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,247
(sighs)

159
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,006
Yes.

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,134
I'm sure you're embarrassed.

161
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,015
There are moments in life
when you're blinded by greed.

162
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,975
I've been there too, so I get it.

163
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,478
But, Chakhee.

164
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,526
The wealth and fame
that you earn by immoral means...

165
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,739
only come back to you as bad karma.

166
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,744
Mr. Jang.

167
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
Yes.

168
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,832
I forgive you.

169
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,044
Everyone makes mistakes.

170
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,088
I'll give you 24 hours.

171
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,340
(tense music)

172
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,888
If you don't sign this agreement
within the next 24 hours,

173
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,098
I will hand over...

174
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,435
everything I have
to the press and the police.

175
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,440
Goodbye.

176
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,531
(heels clacking)

177
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,742
(door opens)

178
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,912
(door closes)

179
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,041
Noh Chakhee...

180
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,880
How dare she...

181
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,381
(phone vibrates)

182
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,093
YIYEON

183
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,678
SPEAKER

184
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,305
(sighs)

185
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,347
What is it?

186
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,557
YIYEON: Chakhee knows.

187
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,226
Knows what?

188
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,687
That Grandpa killed her grandma.

189
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,483
And that you knew about it.

190
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,450
(tense music)

191
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,035
(sighs)

192
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,588
(eerie music)

193
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,636
(squeaks)

194
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,015
(serious music)

195
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
Mr. Lee Dongpil.

196
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,778
DALJAE: I'm not Lee Dongpil, you bastard!

197
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,331
-HYUNSIK: Please...
-(water splashing)

198
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,584
DALJAE (yells):
I'm not Lee Dongpil, you bastard!

199
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,796
Die! Just die!

200
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,300
(panting)

201
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,804
-POLICE: Check there!
-(man moaning)

202
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,105
(moaning continues)

203
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,650
(thuds)

204
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,876
Shin Chisik.

205
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,548
Where is he right now?

206
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,843
He's your accomplice, isn't he?

207
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,182
-Shin Chisik.
-Yes.

208
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,394
He's the one who made me do all of this.

209
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,063
DONGPIL: I just did what he told me to.

210
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,567
He used me.

211
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,861
He's the bad guy.

212
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,739
That jerk is the real murderer.

213
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,408
That bastard...

214
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,287
That bastard did this to me. Scumbag.

215
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,457
That goddamn bastard. I need to kill him!

216
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,167
Damn it! That scumbag!

217
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,128
(clonking, skidding)

218
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,839
(somber music)

219
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,436
(deep exhale)

220
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,860
(sledgehammer clonks)

221
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,991
(leaves rustling)

222
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,245
(Chisik exhales)

223
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,379
(birds chirping)

224
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,551
(breathes deeply)

225
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,310
(line ringing)

226
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,897
Detective Yoo, you need to put Jang Gido
under police protection right away.

227
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,774
He's Shin Chisik's last target.

228
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm sure he'll show up
before the election is over.

229
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,987
KYUNGJIN: Shin Chisik.

230
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,572
Where is he right now?

231
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,076
I really don't know.

232
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,329
I haven't seen him since the day
of the campaign announcement.

233
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,666
Why did you turn yourself in?

234
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,919
To buy time for Shin Chisik to run away?

235
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,379
Because no one...

236
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,299
would listen to me.

237
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,304
I went to the police 20 years ago.

238
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,307
My father who died
under a false accusation,

239
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,894
my mother who was tortured into insanity,
and my sister who was murdered...

240
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,357
I wanted to bring those
who did that to my family to justice.

241
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,360
HEEJUN: Detective, please listen.

242
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,821
My father was framed.

243
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,614
-Beat it.
-HEEJUN: Please, sir. I beg you.

244
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,034
Please look into my sister's case again.
Please, Detective.

245
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,786
Come on, get this kid out of here!

246
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,454
DETECTIVE: Man, I told you it's all over!

247
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,581
Go home.

248
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,208
Please do something!

249
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,587
Catch the guys who did that
to my mom and my sister.

250
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,881
SIBAEK: But...

251
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,050
no one would listen to me.

252
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,094
Not the state.

253
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,221
Not the press.

254
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,473
No one.

255
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,769
It's funny, isn't it?

256
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,898
Now, 20 years later,
since I've become a lawyer

257
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,900
and said I've committed
a series of murders,

258
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,736
the entire world is hanging on
to my every word.

259
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,238
I'm simply keeping my mouth shut,

260
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,992
but those men's evil deeds
are being exposed to the world.

261
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,243
Isn't it funny?

262
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,207
Are you saying you made
a false confession to get revenge?

263
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,085
"Revenge"?

264
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,215
They tortured, framed, and killed people,
but all that's happening

265
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,968
is their evil deeds
being exposed after they're dead.

266
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,849
Can you really call that revenge?

267
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,937
Then what about Shin Chisik?

268
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,773
Is he also a victim of torture?

269
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,901
Is that why he urged Lee Dongpil
to commit murder

270
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,654
and kill all those people?

271
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,660
What did Lee Dongpil say
he received for killing them?

272
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,204
Money? A house? A car?

273
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,122
No.

274
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,792
SIBAEK: Lee Dongpil killed them
for nothing in return.

275
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,003
He only did it
so that he himself could get revenge.

276
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,172
And because of Lee Dongpil,

277
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,886
I lost the chance
to make them pay for what they did.

278
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,472
(dramatic music)

279
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,186
(Kyungjin exhales deeply)

280
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:17,276
So is that why
you followed and sought them out?

281
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,529
Not to kill them, but to save them?

282
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,700
They weren't supposed to die like that.

283
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,870
For the crimes they committed
in the name of the state,

284
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,164
they were supposed
to be punished by the state.

285
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,000
Not in a bathtub...

286
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,836
but in court.

287
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:43,260
Then why did Shin Chisik
kill Jang Byungchun?

288
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,763
When there was a chance
to take him to court?

289
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,979
I don't think he wanted to kill him

290
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,232
or get revenge on him.

291
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,111
(sighs)

292
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:05,449
Then, if he's not seeking revenge,
what the hell is he after?

293
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,792
THE LATE EUN HEESOO

294
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,597
HIT REFRESH WITH JANG GIDO
NEW SOCIAL WELFARE, NEW JUSTICE

295
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,307
(clinks)

296
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,607
Get rid of them
before the reporters swarm in here.

297
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,652
I think you should keep them around
until Shin Chisik is caught.

298
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,530
It's all Noh Chakhee's doing.

299
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,741
This is all a part of her plan.

300
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,870
She's trying to pressure me.

301
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,458
If the police keep following me
until the election is over,

302
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,420
the press will wonder why I'm under
police protection and start prying.

303
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,256
Then Shin Chisik's name
will be brought up.

304
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,304
For now, why don't you sign
the agreement to pacify her?

305
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,391
The election is in two days.

306
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,019
Just hold on for two days then you can
cover this all up after you're elected...

307
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:16,978
Shares?

308
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,355
Sure.

309
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,566
If that's what she wants,
I can give it to her.

310
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,777
But will it end there?

311
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,573
Noh Chakhee dared to pressure me
into giving her shares of the firm.

312
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,575
Who would have thought?

313
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,914
GIDO: She found out that my father
killed her grandmother

314
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,958
and lost her mind.

315
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,129
There's no telling what else she'll do
until the election is over.

316
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,181
JUNG (tongue clicks):
Man, do they ever go home?

317
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,483
(sighs)

318
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,737
Are you sure it's okay
to let him go like that?

319
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,907
KYUNGJIN: We have no reason
to keep him here anymore.

320
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,034
The real culprit has been caught,

321
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,745
and there's no proof of Jwa Sibaek
murdering Jang Byungchun

322
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,540
or helping Shin Chisik run away.

323
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,794
From the beginning,
all we had was his confession.

324
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,506
(tongue clicks, sighs)
I really don't like that guy.

325
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,513
(footsteps)

326
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,349
(dark music)

327
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,785
(banging)

328
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,791
(panting)

329
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,466
(clonking)

330
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,385
(panting)

331
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,017
(dark music)

332
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,293
(clacks)

333
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,800
(agitated breathing)

334
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,054
(door squeaks close)

335
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,409
What the hell...

336
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,913
have you been doing all this time?

337
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,546
Did you...

338
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,132
kill Jang Byungchun?

339
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,261
-(Byungchun wheezes)
-(rattles)

340
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,311
(thuds)

341
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,526
Was it you all this time?

342
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,489
-(Hyunsik gasps)
-(water splashes)

343
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,992
(Seokgu grunts)

344
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,037
KANGIL (choking): Please spare me...

345
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,081
DONGPIL (yells): Die! Just die!

346
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,918
Why did you do that?

347
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,004
Why?

348
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,383
I told you not to do anything.

349
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,678
I told you I'd take care
of everything, didn't I?

350
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,225
If you go around killing those bastards,
how are you any different from them?

351
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,477
How are you any different?

352
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,146
Why did you do it?

353
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,523
Why?

354
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,068
I...

355
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,196
just...

356
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,284
wanted to hear an apology.

357
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,413
But...

358
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,753
Goddamn it!

359
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,267
(deep breathing)

360
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,771
Chisik...

361
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,648
Let's turn yourself in.

362
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,441
SIBAEK: Okay?

363
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,193
Chisik.

364
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,823
I know how you feel
better than anyone, okay?

365
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,494
So I promise I'll take that bastard
Jang Gido to court, all right?

366
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,453
Chisik, you can't...

367
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,497
Come to your senses, Chisik!
You have to stop here.

368
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,583
How are you going
to face Heesoo when you die?

369
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,838
Hey. Turn yourself in, okay?

370
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,841
Answer me!

371
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,260
Okay.

372
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,803
Once Heesoo...

373
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,848
is buried.

374
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,643
CHISIK: Once...

375
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,272
I bury Heesoo

376
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,191
where she's supposed to be,

377
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,154
I'll turn myself in.

378
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,036
(shaky breathing)

379
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,608
(emotional music)

380
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,413
(clinks)

381
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,805
PATIENT NAME: HAN SOONAE
AGE: 72 / F

382
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,652
(gasps)

383
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,697
You're here, Mr. Toilet.

384
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,535
How have you been?

385
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,579
Have you been crying
because you missed me?

386
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,206
No.

387
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,125
Your fiancée told me everything.

388
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:41,047
That you went on a business trip
to an island far away.

389
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,551
-My fiancée?
-Yes.

390
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,304
She said she was going to marry you.

391
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,975
And that you're going to set a date soon.

392
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,352
Right?

393
00:30:55,353 --> 00:31:00,358
You clearly said you were going
to marry Mr. Toilet, right?

394
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,612
Yes.

395
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,784
(light music)

396
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,121
Are we getting married?

397
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,665
(chuckles)
Yes, I guess we are.

398
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,166
Man, that's a surprise.

399
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,544
Well, all right.
Where are we getting married?

400
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,131
I thought a wedding in a wheat field
with huge pots would be cool.

401
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,674
Okay, that sounds fine.

402
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,759
You don't like that?

403
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,804
How about a traditional wedding, then?
With a pair of wedding ducks.

404
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,055
CHAKHEE: Okay, sure.

405
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,223
You don't like that either?

406
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,310
Okay. How about a skydiving wedding?

407
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,980
It's very extreme,
like the marriage we'll probably have...

408
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,481
Are you going to keep going?

409
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,191
That's a scary face.

410
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,818
Such a cold city gal.

411
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,445
You're rather cynical.

412
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,363
(giggles)

413
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,574
It's been a while
since I've seen that face.

414
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,242
(elevator dings)

415
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,372
If you don't like the sky,
what about the sea? Under the sea.

416
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,750
We'll have Mr. Octopus marry us. Yes?

417
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,792
(crackles)

418
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,546
(wrapper crinkles)

419
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,055
(chuckles)

420
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,641
Our Mr. Octopus seems a bit flat.

421
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,851
(can crackles open)

422
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,280
CHAKHEE: It'll be hard to get a retrial

423
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,033
for Mr. Eun Jungho's case.

424
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,411
(deep inhale)

425
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,704
I know.

426
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,457
I failed to do so 12 years ago as well.

427
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,628
The most important piece of evidence
is the prosecutor's case file, but...

428
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,464
it's about 12,000 pages.

429
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:53,554
If I had it, I could apply for a retrial
and actually win too.

430
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,226
The prosecutor on Mr. Eun Jungho's case

431
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,353
was hired by Jangsan
as a legal advisor, right?

432
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,021
(Chakhee sighs)

433
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,525
Someone at Jangsan must have heard
that Mr. Eun's case was being reopened

434
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,904
and so brought the prosecutor over
to their side, as well as the case file.

435
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,699
I was naive.

436
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,910
They were all on the same side,

437
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,622
but I had asked the prosecutor
for the case file.

438
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,835
(chuckles)

439
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,212
Did you know that that prosecutor
is Judge Oh Sungtaek?

440
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,007
-Yes.
-Seriously?

441
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:34,053
I had no idea such an ordinary-looking
grandpa judge was that kind of a jerk.

442
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,059
Well, I'm the fool who couldn't
see through Jang Byungchun either.

443
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,146
Right? Ms. Book-smart.

444
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,656
That case file is at Jangsan.

445
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,367
All 12,000 pages of it.

446
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,914
The file remains all because
you applied for a retrial back then.

447
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:06,586
And Jangsan probably thought
they'd need it later and so kept the file.

448
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,048
Can you get the file?

449
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,260
If I get Jangsan's shares, then yes.

450
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,139
Only Jang Gido, Director Oh Haran,
and the four shareholding partners

451
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,224
have access to that library.

452
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,987
1 HIT REFRESH WITH JANG GIDO

453
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,211
(uneasy music)

454
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,635
(rustles)

455
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,316
TRANSFEROR REPRESENTATIVE: JANG GIDO
TRANSFEREE: NOH CHAKHEE

456
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,235
(pen clacks)

457
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,158
(rustling)

458
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,370
The shares.

459
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,456
I have no problem giving them to you.

460
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,252
GIDO: But how can I know
that you'll stop there?

461
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,547
When you've already
stabbed me in the back.

462
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,340
You're right.

463
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:39,011
There is no guarantee that
my file will be buried forever.

464
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,557
CHAKHEE: I will use it for the rest
of my life to blackmail you.

465
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,268
If necessary,
I will stab you in the back again.

466
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,730
Just as how you and Chairman Jang
stabbed me in the back.

467
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,111
Accept it.

468
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,534
The wealth and fame
that you earn by immoral means

469
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,329
only come back to you as bad karma.

470
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,169
The crazy dog bit her master.

471
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,590
I was going to give you a chance
to come to your senses,

472
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,260
but you're going
to drag this out to the end?

473
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,262
I thought the one holding the leash...

474
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,848
was the master.

475
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,229
(rips)

476
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:33,983
GIDO: Too bad.

477
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,820
That leash just broke.

478
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,116
(rustling)

479
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,583
(door opens, closes)

480
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,044
(sighs)

481
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,679
(exhales)

482
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,976
Now I have no choice
but to beat her to the punch.

483
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,147
If Noh Chakhee speaks up
about the past first, it's all over.

484
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,195
Contact every media outlet you can.
I'm holding a presser in 30 minutes.

485
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,824
Also, get Park Dukman's body
from the hospital

486
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,326
and send it to a funeral home.

487
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,621
I don't care if you give money
to his wife or threaten her.

488
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,666
Get his body cremated today.

489
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,752
Today?

490
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,546
If his wife refuses,
just set the body on fire.

491
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,135
Noh Chakhee will corner me
by using Park Dukman.

492
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,429
Once they do an autopsy on him,

493
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,057
it will ruin my entire life,
let alone the election.

494
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,520
The same goes for you.

495
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,232
(tense music)

496
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,404
(camera shutters clicking)

497
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:06,492
I am here today to make
a painful confession to you all.

498
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,120
The rumor about...

499
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,417
how my late father was a police officer
who tortured people 30 years ago...

500
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,504
is true.

501
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,757
Over the past 30 years,

502
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,846
he had a troubled life
full of regret and remorse.

503
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,682
He always wanted

504
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,269
to apologize to his victims
and ask for their forgiveness.

505
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,562
He was too late.

506
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,941
I, Jang Gido, sincerely apologize

507
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,445
to the victims, their families,

508
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:48,659
and the citizens of Jeongha on his behalf.

509
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,125
(camera shutters clicking)

510
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,837
(thuds)

511
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,135
(weeps)

512
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,311
(indistinct chatter)

513
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,194
(sniffles)

514
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:31,869
Please forgive me and my father

515
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,249
for our crimes.

516
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,802
(phone vibrates)

517
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,181
DIRECTOR OH HARAN

518
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,308
Hello?

519
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,770
Jang Gido is on his knees.
He's holding a press conference right now.

520
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,272
I know. I'm actually at the scene.

521
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,859
How did you know he was going
to hold a press conference?

522
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,695
I kept my word.

523
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,865
Will you take my offer now?

524
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,284
Fine.

525
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,703
Let's see what you have.

526
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,672
We're getting good responses.

527
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,051
The video of you crying on your knees
is all over the internet.

528
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,303
I think we'll end up ahead
in the approval ratings

529
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,721
if this keeps up for another day.

530
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,559
Is that so?

531
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,895
As you said, we emphasized
the labor movement you took part in

532
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,606
with "sincere apology"
and "compensation" as keywords.

533
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,859
"To make up for
his father's crimes of police torture,

534
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,278
the son makes his way to the factory.

535
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,531
He accepts his faults
and moves toward the future."

536
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,660
Daehyeon.

537
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,790
Was it always this easy to be forgiven?

538
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,503
If I had known, I would've done it sooner.

539
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,926
People who have no right to forgive...

540
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,390
forgave me on behalf of the victims

541
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,643
and are feeling good
about their generosity.

542
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,813
GIDO: I kneeled and shed tears,

543
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,399
and they flatter themselves
as if I did it for them.

544
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,443
That's why offenders

545
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:32,823
submit their letters of apology
to the judge,

546
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,494
and cry in front of the public,
instead of to the victims.

547
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,288
(scoffs)

548
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,124
Those fools.

549
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,210
(knocks on door)

550
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,674
Park Dukman's body
disappeared from the hospital.

551
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,763
EMERGENCY
PATIENT TRANSFER

552
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,017
Are you sure this is okay?

553
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,148
We have to secure Mr. Park Dukman's body

554
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,610
to charge Jang Gido
with conspiracy to murder.

555
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,155
Noh Chakhee.

556
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,492
She wasn't after the shares
in the first place.

557
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,621
She used it as an excuse
to pressure me and buy time.

558
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,751
She pressured me
and led me to hold a press conference.

559
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,879
So that I would apologize
with my own mouth.

560
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,884
Where are Park Dukman's wife and kid?

561
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,638
Kidnap them for all I care.

562
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,432
Do whatever it takes to get his body.

563
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,186
Butler Kim.

564
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,689
(anxious breathing)

565
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,859
Get Butler Kim and Dr. Yoon.

566
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,031
What are you waiting for? Do it now!

567
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,075
Gido.

568
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,494
It's just one day.

569
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,456
I just need to hold out for one more day.

570
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,709
They're all like vermin.

571
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,921
Noh Chakhee, her dad, and Jwa Sibaek.

572
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,676
I should have done whatever I could
to crush them sooner.

573
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,805
(squeaks)

574
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,021
(eerie music)

575
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,565
(sighs)

576
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,030
Sir, do you see the black SUV behind us?

577
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,365
-Yes.
-If you can throw them off our tail,

578
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,159
I'll pay you double,
no, four times the fare.

579
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,077
-Really?
-Yes.

580
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,791
(tires screech)

581
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,636
PREDICTION FOR THE 22ND
JEONGHA GENERAL ELECTION

582
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,976
How did it go?

583
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,189
Park Dukman's wife and child
were transferred hospitals yesterday.

584
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,817
We haven't been able to find them yet.
They're not at home.

585
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,904
Noh Chakhee must have hidden them away.

586
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,533
What about Noh Chakhee? Where is she?

587
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,161
We lost her too.

588
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,537
(Daehyeon groans in pain)

589
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,084
(agitated breathing)

590
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,293
You useless idiot.

591
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,921
You can't do anything right.

592
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,174
(tense music)

593
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,389
SUNGGU TEXTILES EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION
NAME: JANG GIDO

594
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,227
Here's Park Dukman's autopsy consent form.

595
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,270
I have obtained his body as well.

596
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,314
Once I get the warrant,
I can get the autopsy done.

597
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,274
Jang Gido must be

598
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,610
going out of his mind
because of you right now.

599
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,531
He got down on his knees at a presser
because he was scared of you,

600
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,908
but he still failed to stop the autopsy.

601
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,994
But this case will take some time.

602
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,746
As you know, even if the autopsy reveals

603
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,165
the in-prison doctor
who killed Park Dukman,

604
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:15,212
you'll need proof that Jang Gido paid
Park Dukman or anyone else he hired.

605
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,006
-Are you saying you can't do it?
-Yes.

606
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,592
CHAKHEE: If by some chance,
Jang Gido gets elected tomorrow,

607
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,929
it'd be more favorable for you to have him
arrested for conspiracy to murder

608
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,389
before his term begins.

609
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,765
You're right.

610
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,810
It's obvious what he'll do
once his term begins

611
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,437
and he gets immunity from arrest.

612
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,732
He'll use his power as an assemblyman
to lobby, drag it out,

613
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,358
and eventually bury the case.

614
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,740
Fine. I will take over the leash
on Jang Gido.

615
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,409
What do you want?

616
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,330
The prosecution case file on Eun Jungho
in Jangsan's library.

617
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,583
Let me have it.

618
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,419
That's it?

619
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,254
Yes.

620
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,548
Why?

621
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,093
I'm going to bring
Chairman Jang Byungchun to justice.

622
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,597
Goodness.

623
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,059
You put on this big show just so
you could bring a dead person to justice?

624
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,983
It'd be easier to believe you
if you asked for his shares.

625
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:31,413
If Jang Gido ends up in prison,
I will give you his shares in Jangsan.

626
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,835
I need a safety measure too, don't I?

627
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,713
You need to get something in return,
so I can use it to blackmail you

628
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,131
when I need to.

629
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,389
I will have the case file delivered to you
when and where you want it.

630
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,225
Thank you.

631
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,853
Sure.

632
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,449
I'm sorry about what happened
to your grandmother.

633
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,412
I mean it.

634
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,546
(heels clacking)

635
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,342
(vehicle approaching)

636
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,395
(grunts)

637
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,736
Good job today.

638
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,030
You too.

639
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,741
(breathes deeply)

640
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,495
But I do wonder where
Mr. Shin Chisik might be.

641
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,334
I think I know where he might be.

642
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,129
Shouldn't you report it
to the police, then?

643
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,755
He promised me that

644
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,216
he'll turn himself in
after burying my sister.

645
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,971
I'm going to go get him.

646
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,858
-(footsteps)
-(shovel clinks)

647
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,287
(exhales)

648
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,467
SIBAEK: Chisik.

649
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,182
(emotional music)

650
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,318
MY BELOVED WIFE
EUN HEESOO

651
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,612
(birds squawking)

652
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,885
(grunts)

653
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,856
(exhales)

654
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,905
You did well.

655
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:56,952
Chisik.

656
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,295
MY BELOVED WIFE
EUN HEESOO

657
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,424
(slurps)

658
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:27,149
I'm Jang Gido.
Please consider me. I will do my best.

659
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:32,154
GIDO: I'm Jang Gido.
Please consider me. I will do my best.

660
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,490
Please consider me.

661
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,789
Thank you.

662
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,002
Gido.

663
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,505
You should go get some rest now.

664
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,550
DAEHYEON: Your approval rating
took the lead again last night,

665
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,928
and you were also winning
in the 9:00 a.m. tally.

666
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,222
If nothing happens today, you'll win.

667
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,432
"If nothing happens"?

668
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,560
What if something does happen?

669
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,354
Noh Chakhee...

670
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,732
Who knows what Noh Chakhee might do?

671
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,027
We have no idea where she is
since she left the campaign office.

672
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,782
That girl might be plotting something
behind my back.

673
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,700
Gido.

674
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,453
We'll cross that bridge later.

675
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,413
Go get some rest.

676
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,087
Come on.

677
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,804
(handle clonks)

678
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,352
(grunts)

679
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,770
(sighs)

680
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,195
(exhales)

681
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,998
(phone vibrates)

682
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,418
(sighs)

683
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,547
(dark music)

684
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,391
CHISIK: Mr. Kim.

685
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,893
Do you remember me?

686
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,563
Back in 1989,

687
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,358
I worked at Sunggu Textiles.
My name is Shin Chisik.

688
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,861
You don't recognize me?

689
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,658
How could I possibly remember you?

690
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,371
Seeing how you tied me up like this
and are trying to intimidate me,

691
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:52,669
I guess you're one of the vermin
from back then.

692
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,630
"Vermin"?

693
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,091
That's right.

694
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,344
While everyone was busy
tightening their belts

695
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:06,766
to improve the economy and industrialize,

696
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,689
you keep asking for more pay,
to have the weekends off, and such.

697
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,026
BYUNGCHUN: Whining like mere children.

698
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:21,448
Doesn't that make you vermin
that eats away at the state?

699
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,118
Regrets.

700
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,623
Guilt.

701
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,295
Don't you feel anything like that?

702
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,841
(exhales)

703
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,009
Regrets?

704
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,845
I do have one.

705
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:50,518
I should have killed you all then.

706
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,647
BYUNGCHUN: But I couldn't.

707
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,443
-(clacks)
-(anxious breathing)

708
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,086
CALLING...

709
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,341
CHISIK: I'll send you the address.
Come alone.

710
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,343
If you don't come now,

711
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,514
that video goes on the internet.

712
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,685
(dark music)

713
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,399
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

714
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,528
-Yes.
-Where are you?

715
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,738
Is everything okay?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

716
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,324
I went to see Chisik.

717
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,410
Did you find him?

718
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,414
I lost him.

719
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,790
(sighs)

720
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,960
Detective Yoo called me.
They've located Mr. Shin Chisik.

721
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,628
(dark music)

722
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,340
(engine roars)

723
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,135
(suspenseful music)

724
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,573
(haunting music)

725
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,437
(snickers)

726
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,023
It's been a long time.

727
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,408
GIDO: You dared...

728
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,497
You dared to kill my father...

729
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,377
CHISIK: I'm sorry.

730
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,422
I never meant to kill Mr. Kim Dukwoo.

731
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,344
You say you didn't mean to kill him.

732
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,098
And yet, you tortured him, filmed it,

733
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,227
and now you're using it to blackmail me.

734
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,359
In here...

735
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,947
is the original copy
of the video I sent you.

736
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,950
CHISIK: I already destroyed the tape.

737
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,077
GIDO: What do you want?

738
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,621
Money?

739
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,498
(snickers)

740
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,875
I don't need any money.

741
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,758
I want to forgive you.

742
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,806
You want to forgive me?

743
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,100
I wanted to forgive your father as well.

744
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,145
If he had apologized...

745
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,773
If he had given me an apology,

746
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,068
I was determined to forgive him.

747
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,153
But...

748
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,281
(Chisik sighs)

749
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,120
I really...

750
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,208
didn't mean to kill Mr. Kim.

751
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,085
I just...

752
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,796
Why did my father need to apologize
and ask to be forgiven

753
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,215
by some complete vermin like you?

754
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,097
-(electricity buzzing)
-(grunting)

755
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,689
(switch squeaks, clonks)

756
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,612
(Chisik panting)

757
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,240
Grasshoppers can at least
be sources of food.

758
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,244
But vermin like you, who eat away
at the state, are no use at all.

759
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,747
(Dukwoo laughs)

760
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,417
Let's see.

761
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,753
(grunting in pain)

762
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,180
I'm not vermin.

763
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,892
I'm human, just like you.

764
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:44,229
You're a crippled factory worker
with a middle school education at best.

765
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,858
In what way are you a human like me?

766
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:54,280
We may be the same species biologically,
but that doesn't make us equal.

767
00:58:55,323 --> 00:59:00,119
The world has become a crazy place
because you fools don't realize that.

768
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,832
Because you forget
your place and run wild.

769
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,334
What about Heesoo, then?

770
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,512
Did you kill her without batting an eye
because she was vermin too?

771
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,307
Eun Heesoo killed herself.

772
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,519
That's because you tried to molest her.

773
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,065
No.

774
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,655
She killed herself
because she was molested.

775
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,867
GIDO: You couldn't have Heesoo.

776
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,204
But I did.

777
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,001
In the end, I'm the winner.

778
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,254
(scoffs)

779
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,884
Not once did I think...

780
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,139
that Heesoo was mine.

781
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:07,562
Heesoo belonged to herself,
not to anyone else.

782
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,732
CHISIK: And I...

783
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,153
don't believe what you say.

784
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,491
Enough nonsense. Just tell me.

785
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,494
How much do you want?

786
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,662
An apology.

787
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,167
All I need...

788
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,503
is a word of apology.

789
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,674
"Apology"?

790
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,094
"Apology"?

791
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:48,227
For God's sake. Just leave me alone!

792
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,981
You goddamn vermin.

793
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,903
GIDO: I kill one and another one
pops up to annoy me still.

794
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,531
There's no end to scum like you.

795
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,159
Die!

796
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,120
Die, for God's sake!

797
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,298
You people...

798
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,802
never change.

799
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,681
I pity you.

800
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,436
Chisik!

801
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,399
(gasps)

802
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,279

(coughs)

808
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,839
HEESOO: Chisik!

809
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,142
Let's take one together.

810
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,436
Oh, no. That's okay.

811
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,396
Hey, you should take one. Come on.

812
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,401
PHOTOGRAPHER: All right.

813
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,237
Come on, move closer.

814
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,947
-You're not in the shot.
-Just take it.

815
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,908
PHOTOGRAPHER: Get closer.

816
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,044
What?

817
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,421
Damn, I missed it.

818
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,215
Come on, do it again. Okay?

819
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,849
(peaceful music)

820
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,649
PHOTOGRAPHER: All right, ready?

821
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:43,027
One, two, three!

822
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,554
(siren wailing)

823
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,145
(tires screech)

824
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,315
(Jung gasps)

825
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,487
(Jung curses)

826
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,995
What do you think you're doing?
Let go of me!

827
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,707
Chakhee, call the firm.

828
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,627
I want every available lawyer
at the police station!

829
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,753
GIDO: Do it now!

830
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,214
(car doors close)

831
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,049
(car engine starts)

832
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,096
(car engine revs)

833
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,150
(emotional music)

834
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,133
(somber music)

835
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,012
Think carefully.

836
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,057
The election will be over in two hours.

837
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:40,895
In two hours, I'll become a member
of the National Assembly.

838
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:46,192
And once I do,
I can easily have you fired.

839
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:52,573
You've got the wrong person.
That bastard jumped off the building.

840
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,908
I didn't push him!

841
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,039
I have nothing else to say to you.
Get the chief.

842
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,127
I am Jang Gido.

843
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,506
I will be the assemblyman of Jeongha.

844
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:11,008
You think you can arrest me
without a single piece of evidence?

845
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,052
-What do you think you're doing?
-(handcuffs clink)

846
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,638
Mr. Jang Gido.

847
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,350
"Mr. Jang Gido"?

848
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,477
Yes. Mr. Jang Gido.

849
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,980
These two videos here.

850
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,191
KYUNGJIN: Do you know
how many people have watched them?

851
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,860
GIDO: For God's sake.
Just leave me alone!

852
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,947
KYUNGJIN: Shin Chisik was filming
your conversation in real-time.

853
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,490
GIDO: You goddamn vermin.

854
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:35,992
KYUNGJIN: It's 4:00 p.m. right now,

855
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:39,412
and Jeongha is showing the highest
voter turnout rates in the country.

856
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,833
You know, people who didn't want to vote
or those who were too busy to vote

857
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,711
are all rushing to the polls right now.

858
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:48,504
Why do you think that is?

859
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:55,177
What's certain is that it's not because
they want to vote for you.

860
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:57,722
No.

861
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,266
No.

862
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,018
That can't be true.

863
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:04,729
This must be fake.

864
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:12,319
You're pulling a trick on me
to get me to make a false confession.

865
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,699
I was winning until this morning.

866
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,492
I am the assemblyman.

867
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,746
I, Jang Gido,
am the assemblyman of Jeongha!

868
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,331
Get the chief in here!

869
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,708
Get the chief in here!

870
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,001
(banging on window)

871
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,295
(hysterical)
Get the chief in here!

872
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:32,465
(doorknob clanking)

873
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,632
Open the door!

874
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:35,968
Get the chief!

875
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,763
I said, get the chief in here!

876
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,932
Open the door! Open it!

877
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,060
You damn vermin!

878
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:48,606
The so-called vermin video
is evoking public outrage.

879
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,816
He called the victims vermin.

880
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,486
The video sure was shocking.

881
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:54,403
Yes, that's right.

882
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,323
The video of Jangsan's former chairman
before his murder

883
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,535
and the video of his son, Mr. Jang,
the former National Assembly candidate,

884
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,246
are inciting the public's interest
and rage toward

885
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,956
police torture in the past.

886
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,084
Especially shocking is that
the unknown torture expert

887
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,378
Mr. Kim, turned out to be
the chairman of a major law firm

888
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:15,174
and had been calling himself
a social activist working for the people.

889
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,259
The wealthy senior citizens
who were murdered

890
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,970
also turned out to be ex-police officers
who tortured people,

891
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:24,391
and even the president has ordered
a thorough investigation of this case.

892
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,562
(door opens)

893
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,069
(door squeaks close)

894
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,531
(uneasy music)

895
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:44,954
GIDO: Chakhee.

896
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:51,377
Go back to Jangsan
and assemble a team of attorneys.

897
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:58,384
Gather the best attorneys at the firm,
assemble a team, and take the lead.

898
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,428
You're the only one I can trust.

899
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:06,308
Chakhee.

900
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,270
Please get me a suit.

901
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,982
GIDO: I think I'll have to hold
a press conference soon.

902
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:17,528
I've got to get down on my knees
and shed tears in front of the reporters

903
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,572
and apologize.

904
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:25,953
I think the reason why I'm locked up
in here is because I didn't apologize.

905
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,461
I'll give you Grandpa's shares.

906
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,297
I'll give you all of them.

907
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:41,051
If you get me out of here,

908
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:44,430
those shares were like
flesh and blood to him,

909
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,848
but I will give them all to you.

910
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,099
I promise.

911
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:52,021
So please get me out of here.

912
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:53,856
Okay?

913
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:07,161
I'm sharing my cell
with this terrifying, sick bastard.

914
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,497
He's giving me a hard time,
and I can't take it anymore.

915
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,792
Will you talk to him for me?

916
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:22,259
I'll give you Jangsan's shares,
so will you tell him to stop harassing me?

917
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,181
Grandpa would also want you to do that.

918
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,941
Chakhee. I will give you the shares.

919
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,567
A team of attorneys...

920
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,571
Please assemble
the best team of attorneys!

921
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:43,989
GIDO: Chakhee!

922
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,866
Chakhee!

923
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:58,545
For murdering Cho Hyunsik,
Yoon Seokgu, and Park Kangil,

924
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:03,884
Lee Dongpil, the accused,
is sentenced to death.

925
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,139
I only...

926
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:14,853
I only did what that man told me to do.

927
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,064
That...

928
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:22,569
crippled bastard Shin Chisik
made me a murderer.

929
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,363
He deserves to be sentenced to death.

930
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,699
I'm not a murderer!

931
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,742
Why are you calling me a murderer?

932
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:29,660
Let me go!

933
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,911
Let me go, you bastards.

934
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,205
Where is that bastard?
Bring me Shin Chisik!

935
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,749
DONGPIL: Bring
that crippled bastard to me!

936
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:41,463
Jang Gido is sentenced
to ten years in prison,

937
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:47,511
and Oh Daehyeon is sentenced
to three years in prison.

938
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,347
(crowd chattering in disagreement)

939
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:03,527
ICE CREAM
500 WON EACH! 2,000 WON FOR FIVE

940
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:09,283
(wrappers rustling)

941
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:12,953
(grunts)

942
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,288
God, that almost killed me.

943
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,998
(freezer door slides close)

944
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,333
Found it.

945
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:22,629
EUNHEE SUPER

946
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,304
Hey now, pay before you eat.

947
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:35,017
Come on, don't be so cheap, okay?
It's just ice cream.

948
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,854
You took over 12,000 won from me yesterday
when we played Go-Stop.

949
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,148
They're completely different matters.

950
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,776
Come on. Just consider this
a cut from your winnings.

951
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:44,860
Unbelievable.

952
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,280
A cut depends on me, it's not up to you.

953
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,616
Whatever. I'm broke. Sue me.

954
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,076
I don't believe this.

955
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,244
-Seriously. Jeez.
-SIBAEK: Wait a second.

956
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:56,413
What's going on?

957
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:58,499
Look at you, Granny.

958
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,172
You're all dressed up
for your son's entrance ceremony.

959
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,924
(chuckles)

960
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,217
Listen.

961
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,846
Do you think my son will be embarrassed
because I'm too old?

962
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,225
No way. If he is,
I'll give him a good scolding.

963
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,147
By the way, Mr. Toilet.
I never realized this before.

964
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,442
-You look a lot like my son.
-What?

965
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:31,865
When my son is all grown up,
I imagine he'll look just like you.

966
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,242
Is that right?

967
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,702
That means Heejun is incredibly handsome.

968
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,954
(chuckles)

969
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,122
(shyly)
That's right.

970
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:39,957
SIBAEK: Granny.

971
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,626
I talked to Heejun this morning, you know.

972
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,589
He said he loves you very much.

973
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,800
Really?

974
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:52,052
Yes, he said he loves you this much.

975
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,429
(chuckles)

976
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,265
How come he never says that to me?

977
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,851
He told me instead because he's shy.

978
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,894
Granny.

979
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,021
Look at you.

980
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,400
You're all dressed up today too.
Are you going somewhere?

981
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,155
I'm going to Heejun's
entrance ceremony too.

982
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,615
Is that right?

983
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,534
(chuckles)

984
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,787
My dear boy will be so happy today.

985
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,874
He'll be much happier
to have young parents like you come

986
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,084
instead of his old mom.

987
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,294
Come on.
(tongue clicks)

988
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,504
Shall we?

989
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:28,797
Yes, let's go.

990
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,009
(humming)

991
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,851
EUNHEE SUPER

992
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,733
(engine revs)

993
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,367
YOUNGSOO: We've met before.

994
01:14:58,535 --> 01:14:59,870
My name is Do Youngsoo.

995
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,038
All right.

996
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,292
-YOUNGSOO: Goodness, hello.
-YIYEON: Hi.

997
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:08,462
YOUNGSOO: Hello.

998
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,387
Ms. Han, look. That's your son over there.

999
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,515
That's good. His fiancée is next to him.

1000
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:22,893
His fiancée is going
to do something very cool now.

1001
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,812
All rise for the judge.

1002
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,484
(door closes)

1003
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:33,654
JUDGE

1004
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:37,115
DEFENSE COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

1005
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,576
Are the defendant
and his attorney present?

1006
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,120
Yes, Your Honor.

1007
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,484
As I was preparing for this retrial,

1008
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:17,739
I looked through almost 12,000 pages
of investigation and trial records.

1009
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:23,620
And I felt deeply ashamed
as someone who practices law.

1010
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:24,913
PROSECUTOR

1011
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,833
I empathized with the despair
that Mr. Eun Jungho must have felt

1012
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,170
and cried with him
as a citizen of this country.

1013
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,508
Mr. Eun Jungho appealed
to the prosecutor and judge

1014
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,469
that he was tortured
into making a false confession,

1015
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:43,307
but no one listened to him.

1016
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,976
Even while coughing up blood
from the after-effects of torture,

1017
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,146
the last thing he said before he died

1018
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,066
was that he could forgive the torture

1019
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,360
but could never forget the despair
that he felt in court.

1020
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:00,699
I sincerely hope that this courtroom today

1021
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,827
will become a place
where the state repents the violence

1022
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,039
that it inflicted upon an individual
and fights to discover the truth.

1023
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,793
And that it...

1024
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,590
reverses its ruling
from the past to recover

1025
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,676
the victim's honor.

1026
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:26,808
(dramatic music)

1027
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,810
Your Honor.

1028
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,688
CHAKHEE: In regards to Mr. Eun Jungho

1029
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,816
who died after being falsely accused
under the power of the state.

1030
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,235
In regards to the past
that wasn't settled properly

1031
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,237
which led to the evil deeds of this day.

1032
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:43,867
And finally, in regards to how we now
have a chance to correct it.

1033
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,286
I will now begin my defense.

1034
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,333
If it may please the court.

1035
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,924
(bright music)
