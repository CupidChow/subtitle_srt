1
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:45,962
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,548
EPISODE 4

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,352
All right.

4
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,945
BASED ON THE ESSAY
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT BY JUNG HYEJIN

5
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>Help me.</i>

6
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,831
Mr. Jwa! Mr. Jwa! Mr. Jwa!

7
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,959
Open your eyes. Mr. Jwa!

8
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,213
You're awake!

9
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,512
Are you all right? Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

10
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,224
Jwa Sibaek?

11
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,936
Is that my... name?

12
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,732
What are you talking about?
You don't remember?

13
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,112
Who am I?

14
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,574
And where am I?

15
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,537
Come on, you're starting to scare me.
You really don't remember?

16
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm joking.

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,877
Damn.

18
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,881
Jeez.

19
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,549
You do know that you're a weirdo, right?

20
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,593
I'm weird?

21
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,136
So are you.

22
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,526
I fell on my back.

23
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,529
So why is my nose bleeding?

24
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,950
An unlucky person will break their nose
even if they fall on their back.

25
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,078
Well...

26
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,831
Oh, boy.

27
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,383
Here.

28
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,385
How many fingers?

29
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,641
It was one, but now it's two.

30
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,979
-Any headache, nausea, or dizziness?
-No. Not at the moment.

31
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,106
You're fine, then.

32
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,321
If I start showing symptoms later,
will you pay for my hospital bill?

33
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,656
I guess I'll have to.

34
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,495
Wait. I didn't think of it before.

35
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,456
But why are you here
at this time of day? This is my place.

36
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,128
-Well...
-Have you been stalking me?

37
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,089
-Just curse at me instead.
-I mean,

38
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,591
how else could you have been here
at that exact moment?

39
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,094
Are you an alien? Did you hear my voice
and jump through space?

40
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,553
I did jump.

41
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,846
What?

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,810
That's my apartment.

43
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,270
What?

44
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,983
That's my apartment.

45
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,652
-What?
-That's my apartment.

46
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,779
That's your apartment?

47
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,115
Yes.

48
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,616
Here's what happened.

49
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,203
You were having a can of beer,

50
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,790
then you suddenly started flying
a stingray-shaped kite.

51
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,293
The kite got stuck in the power lines,

52
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:58,172
and you were making a fool
of yourself trying to get it down.

53
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,759
I was watching you just out of sympathy.

54
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,094
There's this old saying.

55
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,139
"When you see
a child playing alone near water..."

56
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,432
How long?

57
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,309
How long have you lived there?

58
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,020
For two years?

59
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,523
After dropping me off the other night,
you drove off in the opposite direction.

60
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,233
Was that all just a show?

61
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,611
-Yes.
-Why?

62
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,988
Hold up.

63
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,449
Because you didn't
want to carpool with me?

64
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,491
Yes.

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,702
I can't believe this.
Do you hate me that much?

66
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,245
No, I don't hate you...

67
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,455
This is ridiculous.

68
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,082
How do you even stand
to work with me in the same office?

69
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,001
Well, that wasn't
something I could help...

70
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,628
Forget it. I hate being
around you too, so please leave.

71
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,629
Hold on a minute.

72
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,798
Look.

73
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,300
I just saved your life

74
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,719
and injured the back of my head
and my nose in the process.

75
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:48,514
You should at least
say thank you, don't you think?

76
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,517
Did I ask you for your help?

77
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,187
You did.

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,938
"Help me."

79
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,316
For goodness' sake.

80
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,567
Is he really an alien?

81
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,570
Well, so...

82
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,740
Thanks so freaking much. Happy?

83
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,868
-Yes.
-Okay, then. Go.

84
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,827
-Fine.
-Yes, go.

85
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,745
-I'm going.
-Go on.

86
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,497
-I said I'm going.
-Yes, so go.

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,915
-Yes, I'm going.
-Go.

88
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,625
I'm going right now.

89
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,629
Just to avoid any misunderstandings,

90
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,757
when you're out here,
I keep my curtains closed,

91
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,717
and I don't even go near my balcony, okay?

92
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,136
So, what I'm trying
to say is don't worry...

93
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,306
Look. I get that you hate me.
You don't have to tell me twice.

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,474
No, it's not that I hate...

95
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,518
Save it. Just go.

96
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,728
-Fine, I'm going.
-Yes, go.

97
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,938
-Go on.
-I said I'm going.

98
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,855
-For God's sake.
-Go!

99
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,608
My head hurts.

100
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,793
You know what they say.

101
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,464
"If someone hates you for no reason,
give them a reason to hate you."

102
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,094
You're going to give me a ride
to work from now on, got it?

103
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,096
I don't hate you, Ms. Noh.

104
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,892
I just don't like you.

105
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,772
So why? Why don't you like me? Why?

106
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,902
God.

107
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,946
Just open the door.

108
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,531
Okay.

109
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
Ah!

110
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,494
And if you don't want to give me a ride
every day, find a used car for me.

111
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,204
Something that makes me
look down-to-earth.

112
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,831
Why a used car?

113
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,167
I told you. I had a revelation.

114
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,128
I left all my worldly desires
behind at Jangsan.

115
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,007
Mm. Then what are those
shiny things? They look expensive.

116
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,510
-Is that a Fen...
-No. These are like souvenirs.

117
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,347
Souvenirs to remind me of how
obsessed I was with earthly joys.

118
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,974
Pfft! Shall we?

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,185
Ms. Noh Chakhee.

120
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,232
I'm sorry about lying.

121
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,527
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

122
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,196
-I just...
-Mr. Jwa.

123
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:16,204
I've met far more people
who don't like me than those who do.

124
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:21,125
The fact that you don't like me
doesn't particularly hurt my feelings.

125
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,295
Let's go.

126
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,463
All right.

127
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,220
KUMSHIN ELECTRIC

128
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>What?</i>

129
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,855
Are you out of your damn mind?

130
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,232
You bastard!

131
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,070
Oh, no. Are you all right?

132
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,697
Uncle.

133
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,492
You still throw ashtrays
in this day and age...

134
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,454
No, listen. This idiot told your wife
that I signed a contract with CS

135
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,206
at a lower price.

136
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,041
She kicked me off the construction project

137
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,918
for the shopping mall
in the business district.

138
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,256
Did she?

139
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,176
You think it's funny? Damn it.

140
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,179
Keep your wife
under control, will you?

141
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,806
That damned woman has no manners.

142
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,015
Uncle.

143
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,935
Please watch what you say
if you don't want to sound ignorant.

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,731
Pfft.

145
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,941
Listen.

146
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,735
You've got to convince your wife for me.

147
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,488
Or we could have dinner together.

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,783
I have to get in on
this shopping mall construction.

149
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,744
Before I do,
I want you to find someone for me.

150
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,459
God, Hyunsik.

151
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,254
How did he end up like this?

152
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,840
Do you have a suspect?

153
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,676
The guy who went to prison before.

154
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,263
I think his name was Dongpil.

155
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,974
Dongpil, Dongpil...

156
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,476
Ah! You mean Lee Dongpil?

157
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,187
I want you to find him.

158
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,064
Why?

159
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,483
You think he's the one who did it?

160
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,068
I'm not sure.

161
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,363
Maybe he did.

162
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,787
Or maybe he will.

163
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,251
Mr. Han,
what are you doing over there?

164
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,727
You see,

165
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,606
my wife just started having contractions.

166
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,277
She's having our first daughter.
I have to get to the hospital,

167
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,112
but I can't seem to remember.

168
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,533
I don't remember how to drive.

169
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,872
I have to get to my wife,
but I don't remember how.

170
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,173
The hospital called.

171
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,967
She had a healthy baby girl.

172
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,972
They're both doing well.
Don't worry, and let's go back inside.

173
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,853
Is that true?

174
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
Yes.

175
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,441
I'll take you to see them later.

176
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,070
Thank you, sir.

177
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,155
Thank you.

178
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,951
But, sir.

179
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,290
Who are you, and why
are you being so nice to me?

180
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,922
I said I'm Noh Chakhee, a lawyer.

181
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,135
Sir. I'm your lawyer, remember?

182
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,973
<i>Ah! Miss Noh, who made
me coffee at the office the other day?</i>

183
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,392
"Miss Noh..."

184
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,601
Well...

185
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,603
You've been fined two million won

186
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,898
for sending obscene pictures
to a young mother in her 30s.

187
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,817
You need to come down here
for a consultation.

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,404
<i>I don't know
anything about that. I didn't do it.</i>

189
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,947
Yes. You think it's unfair, right?

190
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,032
Then come in and talk with me.

191
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>I'm a busy man.
Don't make me come and go!</i>

192
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,495
<i>You take care of it, Miss Noh.</i>

193
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,123
If you don't come,
you'll have to pay two million won.

194
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,084
<i>I didn't do it, so why
would I have to pay that money?</i>

195
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,628
If you don't want to,
come in for the consultation!

196
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>You make it go away, Miss Noh!</i>

197
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,468
<i>If I'm fined, I will sue you!</i>

198
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,013
God.

199
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,639
Ms. Noh.

200
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,017
Yes?

201
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,645
-What's this?
-Well...

202
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,025
The employee from the prosecutors' office
asked me many times to make sure

203
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,193
that you get the memo.

204
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,444
"Birth registration"?

205
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,114
-Public defenders handle this too?
-Well, they normally don't.

206
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,450
That's probably why
the prosecutor made a special request.

207
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,536
Wow, they're trying to get me
to do all kinds of things for free.

208
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,997
I'm not obligated to do it, right?

209
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,291
No, I guess not.

210
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,341
But you should.

211
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,063
This kid has totally messed up her life.

212
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,816
She abandoned not just one
but two of her own babies?

213
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,653
Why do I have to clean up
after such an irresponsible kid?

214
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,032
<i>Dad!</i>

215
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,494
-Chakhee, your dad will come back soon...
-Let go of me, Grandma!

216
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,038
-Dad!
-Come now, Chakhee!

217
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,122
Dad!

218
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,332
Goodness.

219
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,085
Why did you have me
if you were going to abandon me?

220
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,253
Don't cry.

221
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,880
Why did you have me
if you were going to abandon me?

222
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,465
He will come back soon.

223
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,425
Dad!

224
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,470
Don't cry. He will come back soon.

225
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,766
<i>Dad!</i>

226
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,490
KUMSHIN ELECTRIC

227
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,628
<i>When you address the ball...</i>

228
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,756
<i>...your arms should be
in a Y position, as I said before...</i>

229
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,884
Oh, my dear niece-in-law.

230
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,219
No. I should address you as Director Oh.

231
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:53,684
What brings the director of
Yulhu Construction to this humble place?

232
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,186
Don't be so sarcastic.

233
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,106
I'm here to make an offer
that's beneficial to you.

234
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,528
It's a new contract.

235
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,823
We can keep the same terms
for two more years.

236
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,870
Gosh, my niece... I mean, Director Oh.

237
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,954
On one condition.

238
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,957
After two years, we sign a new contract
at a price that's 20% lower.

239
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,543
Yes, of course.

240
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,921
As long as I can take
on the shopping mall construction.

241
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,925
But why the sudden change of mind?

242
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,932
The death of Cho Hyunsik.

243
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,643
What?

244
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,355
What does my husband have
to do with it? You know, don't you?

245
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,943
I actually don't.

246
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,075
He met with the police chief
and put a stop to the investigation.

247
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,410
<i>Jojoong Daily</i>
was going to cover the case,

248
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,996
but it never made the paper either.

249
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,084
CEO Cho Hyunsik of Kangsung Pharm is dead.

250
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,878
And yet, no one is even
mentioning it in the media.

251
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,339
It's my husband's doing, isn't it?

252
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,344
Well, I'm not really sure.

253
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,762
In that case,

254
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,226
-I can't accept the terms of the contract.
-Wait. Listen, I...

255
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,818
I wonder why Gido did that.

256
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,738
I'll leave the contract with you.

257
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,992
Call me if you change your mind.

258
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,174
What on earth is going on?

259
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,510
What does he have to do with Gido?

260
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,889
He would even reject the offer
for the mall construction?

261
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,228
CORRECTION OF HOPE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

262
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,494
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,458
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to yourself, Ms. Lee.

264
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,919
And to those two babies
that you abandoned.

265
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,050
Why did you do it?

266
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:37,264
When I told my boyfriend
I was pregnant, he kicked me out.

267
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,975
He said the baby might not be his.

268
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,188
So I went to a single moms' shelter.

269
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,523
What about your family?

270
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,442
My mom...

271
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,987
ran away from home

272
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,032
when I was seven because
my dad beat her when he was drunk.

273
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,702
Then, my dad started beating me,

274
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,288
so I also left home
when I was in middle school

275
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,040
and wandered from place to place.

276
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,169
I somehow managed to track down
my mom and contact her,

277
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,255
but she said the baby was my own problem.

278
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,301
So I had the baby in the shelter.

279
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,764
But I didn't know what to do after that.

280
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,397
Is that your excuse
for abandoning your own babies?

281
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,276
Ms. Lee.

282
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,780
If you get pregnant
and have babies like this,

283
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,490
you're not just damaging your body.

284
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,368
What are the babies
going to do without their mom and dad?

285
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,329
If you can't take care of them,
you shouldn't have them!

286
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,264
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

287
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,146
Ms. Lee.

288
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,443
You got off with probation last time.

289
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,406
But because this is your second offense,
you will have to serve time.

290
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,825
You won't be able to avoid it.

291
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,495
Okay.

292
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,919
But I will strongly appeal to the judge
to consider your family background

293
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
and the irresponsible fathers
of the babies.

294
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,511
Do you have any questions?

295
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,722
No.

296
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,364
This is the contact number of
a baking school director that I know.

297
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,909
When you get released, give them a call.

298
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,411
They'll teach you how to bake.

299
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,377
I should go now.

300
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,672
I wanted to have them.

301
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,136
My babies.

302
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,932
I didn't want to abort them.

303
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,896
I wanted to protect them.

304
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,650
That's why I had them.

305
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,292

Hello? Is this
the child protection center?

310
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,286
<i>Yes, how can I help you?</i>

311
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,622
Hi, my name is Noh Chakhee.
I'm a public defender.

312
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,042
I'm calling about Ms. Lee Yujin's baby.

313
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,336
<i>I was just going to call you.</i>

314
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,213
<i>Her baby is healthy and doing well.</i>

315
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,507
<i>We have a great couple
waiting to adopt him,</i>

316
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,510
<i>but there's nothing we can do
without his birth registration.</i>

317
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,722
<i>Since his mom is in the detention center,
we weren't sure what to do.</i>

318
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,557
Um...

319
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,891
I'll...

320
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,479
find a way to register his birth today.

321
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,648
<i>That'd be great. Thank you.</i>

322
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,776
Sure. I'll call you as soon as it's done.

323
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,944
Bye.

324
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,201
Man, maybe I shouldn't
have gotten involved.

325
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,163
I've never registered a birth before.

326
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,216
Name, signature,
and resident registration number.

327
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,136
Name, signature,
and resident registration number.

328
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,809
I'm here to get
a certificate of detention.

329
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,269
I see. One moment, please.

330
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,485
I'm here to get a birth certificate.

331
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,111
I see. May I see some identification?

332
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,115
The baby's mother is in a detention center
and couldn't come here herself.

333
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,533
I'm here on her behalf.

334
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,744
Here. It's her certificate of detention.

335
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,038
CERTIFICATE OF DETENTION
NAME: LEE YUJIN

336
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,208
Hi, I've received a request
for a birth certificate.

337
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,961
Right, but the baby's mother
couldn't come.

338
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,172
I see. All right.

339
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,344
You can get the certificate
after speaking with her doctor.

340
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,307
Mommy!

BIRTH CERTIFICATE FORM

345
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,297
Oh!

346
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,468
Name.

347
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,554
I didn't ask the baby's name.

348
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,891
I can't go to the detention center now.

349
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,353
God, what do I... name him?

350
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,689
His family name can be Lee after his mom.

351
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,065
For his first name...

352
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,984
For his first name...

353
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,902
Miteum.

354
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,196

00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,701
Damn.

358
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,411
His name...

359
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,328
<i>My babies.</i>

360
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,665
I didn't want to abort them.

361
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,960
I wanted to protect them.

<i>Hi, Ms. Noh.</i>

367
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,702
I registered the baby's birth certificate.

368
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,204
<i>Thank you.</i>

369
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,122
It was nothing.

370
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,916
I hope...

371
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,628
the baby will find a good family.

<i>Hi, Mr. Park.</i>

373
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,049
Did you get my text?

374
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,176
It's so humanitarian.
A total tearjerker, right?

375
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,719
That's right.

376
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,471
I bet I'm the first public defender

377
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,683
to register a birth certificate
for a defendant.

378
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,059
It's a good story, you know?

379
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,478
I'm an unmarried woman,
and I registered a birth certificate.

380
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,771
I'm telling you.

381
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,858
When I named the baby myself
and handed in the birth certificate form,

382
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,278
I felt such a strong sense of duty
as a public defender,

383
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,571
and it felt so rewarding.

384
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,656
Exactly. What if I hadn't done it?

385
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,492
That baby would have stayed at
the orphanage instead of getting adopted.

386
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,785
What?

387
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,079
It's not enough?

388
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,123
Why?

389
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,542
But this was a really special case.

390
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,335
But why...

391
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,170
Just unbelievable.

REPORTER PARK BYUNGJAE, JOJOONG DAILY

393
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,550
I'm a public defender. What more can I do?

394
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,303
Do I have to defend
a wrongfully executed man

395
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,556
and make him come back to life
to get an article written about me?

396
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,016
Young lady from the third floor?

397
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,142
Oh, my goodness.

398
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,562
You're waiting for Mr. Toilet, aren't you?

399
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,314
"Mr. Toilet"?

400
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,443
I saw you two going to work
and coming home together every day.

401
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,069
You mean Mr. Jwa Sibaek?

402
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,446
Yes, Mr. Toilet.

403
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,240
When are you guys going to get married?

404
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,035
Gosh. We're definitely not like that.

405
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,042
Why isn't he here yet?

406
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,878
Toilet already left.

407
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,796
He's gone to work.

408
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,423
Sorry?

409
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,133
I saw him leave.

410
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,468
He's gone to work?

411
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,641
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

412
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,643
-Hello?
-<i>Mr. Jwa.</i>

413
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,144
You left for work without me?

414
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,315
-I'll be working outside the office today.
-Outside?

415
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,983
Where?

416
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,361
Do I have to tell you that now?
I'm in a hurry.

417
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,445
<i>No. Well...</i>

418
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,115
What did you say to the corner shop lady?

419
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,784
What did I say?

420
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,204
She asked me
when we were going to get married.

421
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,627
-I didn't even want to carpool with...
-<i>Whatever.</i>

422
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,544
I'm hanging up!

CALL ENDED

Junwoo.

425
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,638
You do understand that I
can't help strangers, right?

426
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,141
I can only help someone I'm close with.

427
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,689
Gosh, you have tiny hands.

428
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,357
Like a baby.

429
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,069
Hey.

430
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,822
Your mom might go to prison
because of you,

431
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,490
but you can't even let me hold your hand?

432
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,411
Are you just going to sit back
and let her go to prison?

433
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:18,381
Once I get to know you
a little better, I'll help your mom.

434
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,252
What on earth? That's my car.

435
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,964
What the hell?

436
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,174
Come here.

437
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,013
Who the hell are you?

438
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,225
I'm Junwoo's lawyer.

439
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,311
He doesn't have a lawyer!

440
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,938
He does, you bastard!

441
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,067
-Nice!
-Nice shot!

442
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,819
Okay.

443
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,281
Good.

444
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,370
It turns out
Lee Dongpil died three years ago.

445
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,333
-He died three years ago?
-Yes.

446
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,961
His body was unclaimed,
so it was cremated by the state.

447
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,337
How come?

448
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,797
What about his wife and kids?

449
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,258
His wife divorced him
soon after he went to prison,

450
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,259
and after his release,

451
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,220
his alcoholism became worse,
so his children severed ties with him.

452
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,264
That idiot wasted his life away.

453
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,934
If it wasn't Lee Dongpil, who did it?

454
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,311
There's no one else
who'd do something so crazy.

455
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,195
Damn it.

456
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,739
Sir.

457
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,491
Please move to the
other side of the hazard

458
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,909
and hit your next shot from there.

459
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,786
Why bother? Give me the ball.

460
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,040
-Wait, it's dangerous to hit it from here.
-Move over.

461
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,925
Are you okay? Oh, my goodness.

462
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,887
The ball went that way
because your face is a hazard.

463
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,222
This is why you caddies need to be pretty.

464
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,808
Even the ball knows.

465
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,977
Hello? I'm calling you
from hole number 12.

466
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,021
There has been an accident.
We need immediate help.

467
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,566
Don't make a fuss over it.
It's just a nosebleed.

468
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,153
Hey.

469
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,821
What?

470
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,032
Police station?

471
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,871
THE PEOPLE'S POLICE WITH THE BEST SERVICE

472
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,052
Mr. Jwa Sibaek!

473
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,517
Let me see. You must be a mess.

474
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,020
What? You're fine.

475
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,231
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

476
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,691
When I heard it was a mutual fight,

477
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,944
I thought somebody did
what I couldn't and beat you up.

478
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,695
There was
nothing mutual about it!

479
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,454
There's a teenage boy
named Park Junwoo in the lounge.

480
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,957
Could you take him to my apartment?

481
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,833
Please.

482
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,130
Are you going to be all right without me?

483
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,298
Yes.

484
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,968
I'll be all right if you're not here.

485
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,096
Ah... You're still obnoxious
even in this situation.

486
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,225
Okay, then. Good luck defending yourself
without a competent lawyer.

487
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,394
Yes. I appreciate this.

488
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,062
Yes. All right.

489
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,390
What happened? Did you get him to settle?

490
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,519
It looked like if he refused to settle,
I'd have to visit you in jail.

491
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,854
He...

492
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,522
They say hatred is a form of attachment.

493
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,025
I'll be generous
and be your attorney, Mr. Jwa.

494
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,277
-He settled.
-He did?

495
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,446
Why?

496
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,741
With the damage you did to his face,
he could have sued you.

497
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,327
Well, you must be
very disappointed, Ms. Noh.

498
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,454
But that's what happened.

499
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,167
I've always had this feeling about you.
You speak like a bookworm,

500
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,253
but you act like a martial artist.

501
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,255
Yes, I've switched specialties.

502
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,758
There are a lot of fools in the world
that words don't work on.

503
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,593
Who the heck is that guy anyway?

504
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,511
Junwoo wouldn't say anything either.

505
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,680
You beat the crap out of him.
So why did he settle?

506
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,183
Ms. Noh.

507
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,646
I want you to take over Junwoo's case.

508
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,942
-What?
-To be exact, it's his mother's case.

509
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,819
Since I switched to martial arts today,

510
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,988
I won't be able to work
on her case anymore.

511
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,908
Why should I?
I'm already busy with my own cases.

512
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,035
Now you want me to take yours too?

513
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,287
Yes, that's what I'm asking.

514
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,872
And that's what I'm refusing.

515
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,874
If you don't take over her case,

516
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,960
she'll have to find a new public defender
and start over from the beginning.

517
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,172
Then she will end up going to prison
on the day of Junwoo's surgery.

518
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,426
Will you let a 14-year-old boy
go into surgery without his mom?

519
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,553
Then why did you do it?

520
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,015
Whoever that guy is,
you shouldn't have beaten him up.

521
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,102
That bastard needed a good beating!
I had no choice.

522
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,687
Jeez, seriously.

523
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,607
I always knew you were reckless,

524
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,568
but you're much more reckless
than I thought.

525
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,364
But I have a plan.

526
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,993
What, me? Me?

527
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,994
-Me?
-Yes.

528
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,621
Mr. Jwa.

529
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,166
I'm the former ace of Jangsan.

530
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,585
I'm not human. I'm a Shih Tzu.
Have you forgotten already?

531
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,380
A Shih Tzu?
Who said that kind of nonsense?

532
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,426
You said it yourself. You had a revelation
and became a public defender.

533
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,930
You said that instead of providing
rich people with legal services,

534
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:45,601
you'd spread the love and justice
of the law to the underprivileged.

535
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,688
And that, in the name of justice,
you would punish the villains.

536
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,399
Just take the kid and go.
I fed him <i>tteokbokki</i>, and he fell asleep.

537
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,987
Don't think for a second
that I'll take over your case.

538
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,738
Go.

539
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,867
-But your revelation...
-Hush.

540
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,994
You said you'd help out the...

541
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,082
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

542
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,460
Good morn...

543
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
Hello.

544
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,468
Hello.

545
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,221
-Is she your mother?
-Yes.

546
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,812
She thanks you
for taking care of me the other day.

547
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,355
Oh, not at all.

548
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,608
Don't mention it.

549
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,735
Hi, Junwoo.

550
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,947
Please sit down.

551
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,117
What's going on?
Why is Junwoo's mother here?

552
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,536
Ah!

553
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,955
I can no longer be her attorney,

554
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,501
and you, the one that I counted on,
also refused to defend her case.

555
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,715
So she will now have to go to prison.

556
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,426
And Junwoo...

557
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,597
will also have his surgery on his own.

558
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,350
I need to let them know that.

559
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,061
You're right.

560
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,064
It'll be better for her to learn about
the situation as soon as possible.

561
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,942
Well, then, good luck.

562
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:35,711
I CAN NO LONGER BE YOUR ATTORNEY

563
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,464
OKAY... I UNDERSTAND

564
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,469
He can hear people's thoughts,
and he even knows sign language...

565
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,186
Mr. Park. To what do I owe this pleasure?

566
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,230
<i>I'm calling you
about an article.</i>

567
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,564
Oh, gosh.

568
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,733
You're writing an article?

569
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,901
Yes.

570
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,821
I was never interested
in the work of public defenders,

571
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,615
but I looked into it because of you.

572
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,411
-I think I can write a special feature.
-My goodness. A special feature?

573
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,330
But it hasn't been long
since I became a public defender,

574
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,583
so I don't have a good enough story
for a special feature yet.

575
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,420
<i>You work
with Attorney Jwa Sibaek, right?</i>

576
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,383
-"Jwa Sibaek"?
-<i>I did a little research.</i>

577
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,219
<i>He has an excellent reputation.</i>

578
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,763
<i>And he's handled a lot of famous cases.</i>

579
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,183
<i>I'd love to interview him.</i>

580
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,811
Could you give me his phone number?

581
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,689
Look.

582
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,025
I don't know any Jwa Sibaek or Woo Sibaek.

583
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,735
If you want his number, ask someone else.

584
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,737
-Did you have breakfast?
-Seriously.

585
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,072
I'm doing all the hard work,

586
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,199
but Jwa is going to be
the star public defender.

587
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,118
-Don't skip breakfast.
-Okay.

588
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,079
Mr. Do, did you eat...
I see that you have.

589
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,997
Yes.

590
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,750
No, wait.

591
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,838
All the cases
that he recklessly jumps at...

592
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,675
turned out to be good stories.

593
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,306
Excuse me, Mr. Jwa.

594
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,268
Can I have a minute?

595
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,188
Well, tell me what the case is about.

596
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,314
Oh!

597
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,399
Wait a minute.

598
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,361
Why the sudden change of mind?

599
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,446
"Sudden change of mind"?

600
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,697
It's called compassion.

601
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,618
I can't just let a 14-year-old
go through surgery without his mom.

602
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,453
-Am I wrong?
-Hmm...

603
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,622
So what happened to his mother?
What's her case?

604
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,589
Damn it. Man, this sucks.

605
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,596
Yes?

606
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,224
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

607
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,892
Yes, go ahead.

608
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,648
<i>My son's surgery
has been scheduled.</i>

609
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,567
Oh, really? That's great.

610
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,779
<i>But I don't have
enough money to pay for it.</i>

611
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,738
Right.

612
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:13,661
<i>I was wondering
if I could get my unpaid wages.</i>

613
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,580
Ah. You know, I'm happy for you.

614
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,167
If Junwoo's surgery
has been scheduled, he should have it.

615
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,379
The thing is, I don't have
any money. What to do?

616
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,175
Well... Didn't I tell you?

617
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,678
All my cash has dried up.

618
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,889
Damn.

619
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,059
Come on, I told you.
I got fired from my job last month.

620
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,772
When my old man heard that I messed up
at work and got fired, he cut me off.

621
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,695
<i>He really needs surgery
for his ear this time.</i>

622
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:54,910
<i>If you could just give me
my unpaid wages, I can afford it.</i>

623
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,371
<i>Please, I beg you.</i>

624
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,006
Jeez, this woman is making me
look like a complete jerk.

625
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,550
Look, woman.

626
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,929
Do you want me to commit
some credit card fraud to pay you?

627
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,016
Do you think I'm a scumbag
who won't pay you when I have money?

628
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,270
If I were, I wouldn't have hired
a mute like you as my housekeeper!

629
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,189
<i>Please, I beg you.</i>

630
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,566
You should be grateful.

631
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,945
Look here. I clearly told you.

632
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,365
If you want to get paid,
either wait or just sue me.

633
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,493
<i>Please, I beg you. Please.</i>

634
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,003
That hurts! What the hell are you doing?

635
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,755
Jesus.

636
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,388

00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,653
You knew this,
and all you gave him was a nosebleed?

642
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,989
You should have poked his damn eyes...

643
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,865
God, seriously.

644
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,659
Wait a second.

645
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,579
Why did that bastard settle
when you beat him up?

646
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,916
Didn't he want to put you
behind bars for hitting him?

647
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,712
Article 287 of the Criminal Code.

648
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,798
A person who entices or kidnaps
a minor shall be sentenced

649
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,800
to no more than ten years of imprisonment.

650
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:19,096
Wait, who enticed and kidnapped a minor?

651
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,016
I've known him for a while.

652
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,894
I just took a boy I know
out for a milkshake.

653
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,147
How is that enticing and kidnapping?

654
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,941
I have an itch here.

655
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,192
Why is it itchy?

656
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,069
-Gosh.
-Oh, damn it.

657
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,033
Listen, dude. I mean, sir.

658
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,077
If my old man finds out,
he's going to beat me to death.

659
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,248
Just this once.
Please let it slide just this once, okay?

660
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,129
Okay. That lady stole my money.
I'll settle with her.

661
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,590
This is all about that, isn't it?

662
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,051
Didn't you hear what the officer said?

663
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:02,306
She stole stuff like diapers,
formula, and baby clothes before.

664
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,350
It's habitual theft!

665
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,893
She'll receive aggravated punishment!

666
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,562
Then she'll end up in prison for sure!

667
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,441
Wow! That total scumbag.

668
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,360
Yes.

669
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,278
Because of that total scumbag,

670
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,073
a single mom who has worked hard
to raise her son might go to prison.

671
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,575
Will you just let that happen?

672
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,536
Okay.

673
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,914
I get that he's a scumbag.

674
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,792
I get that it'd be wrong
if she ended up in prison.

675
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,709
But...

676
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,088
what's the possibility
of winning this case?

677
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,093
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT
INDICTMENT

678
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,427
THE DEFENDANT HAS COMMITTED
A THIRD ACT OF LARCENY

679
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,139
What's your plan?

680
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,059
She was charged under the Act on
Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes.

681
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,521
The minimum sentence for habitual larceny
under that act is 18 months.

682
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,815
Under the Act on Aggravated Punishment,

683
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,150
whether it's you, me,
or a public defender general,

684
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,735
there's no way she'll just be fined.

685
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,655
So how do you plan on stopping her
from going to prison?

686
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,283
The Criminal Code
also covers habitual larceny.

687
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,785
Under the Criminal Code,

688
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,663
a fine would be possible and
incarceration would be four to six months.

689
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,958
But the prosecutor would charge her under
the act that hands out a harsher sentence.

690
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,960
And that's exactly what he did. Now what?

691
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,045
Are you going to go
to the prosecutor and badger him

692
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,756
into changing the charge
to simple larceny under the Criminal Code?

693
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,844
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

694
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,679
My plan was to request
a change of indictment.

695
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,681
Oh, you do it if you want. I can't.

696
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,935
I could stay on as her attorney,

697
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,480
but my relationship with Yoon Dochang
might cause problems at the trial.

698
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,691
So why on earth did you hit him?

699
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,277
A minute ago, you said
I should have poked his eyes out.

700
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,155
I can't do it.

701
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,824
Why don't you look for some nutjob
who will ask the prosecutor

702
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,950
to change the indictment?

703
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,245
Let's say I was willing
to make myself be that nutjob in court

704
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,664
and asked the prosecutor
to change the indictment.

705
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,541
What if he says no?

706
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,751
That'd be the end of it.

707
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,669
You're right.

708
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,505
It's obvious he won't do it,
so why bother?

709
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,133
At least, there will be
a precedent for such a request.

710
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,595
If you've committed petty theft before
for your survival,

711
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,681
they put you in prison for a year
under the Act on Aggravated Punishment.

712
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,893
-We can't let that happen anymore.
-Mr. Jwa.

713
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,396
Do you know how I kept my win rate
above 90% at Jangsan?

714
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,859
I didn't fight battles
that were certain to lose.

715
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,570
Now, you're asking me
to do this on your behalf?

716
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,863
This trial I'd obviously lose?

717
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,324
You don't lose
because you're likely to lose.

718
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,284
You lose because you don't try.

719
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,333
ATTORNEY JWA SIBAEK
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

720
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,259
Ms. Noh.

721
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,304
Mr. Jwa told me.

722
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,390
Hmm. What did Mr. Jwa tell you?

723
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,812
You took time out of your busy schedule
to come and pick me up the other day.

724
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,860
Here.

725
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,449
Thank you.

726
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,994
You let me watch a movie
and made me <i>tteokbokki</i>.

727
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,289
It really wasn't a big deal.

728
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,625
Goodbye.

729
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,589
Goodbye.

730
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,472
That's a great drawing.

731
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,727
Listen.

732
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,146
You told Junwoo to draw this, didn't you?

733
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,523
Yes.

734
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,277
I told him he'd have to thank you anyway,
so he should thank you now.

735
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,989
Do you really think I'll roll over
because of a little drawing?

736
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,955
That's a nice portrait of you.

737
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,094
Mr. Jwa. Let me make one thing clear.

738
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,847
I am not going to ask
for a change of the indictment.

739
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,265
Don't get your hopes up.

740
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,559
I'm just going to defend her. That's it.

741
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,437
Okay, understood.

742
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,899
Don't smile. It bothers me.

743
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,359
Okay, I won't.

744
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,114
-Hmm?
-Hmm!

745
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,130
COURT IN SESSION

746
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,465
Your Honor.

747
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:51,053
The defendant's employer clearly told her
that he'd pay her if he had money.

748
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,638
Then, in his closet,

749
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,933
there was more than enough money
to pay her wages.

750
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,270
Your Honor. I am not denying
that the defendant committed larceny.

751
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,355
I am only pleading

752
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,566
that you consider the heart of a mother
who acted out of desperation

753
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,861
to get her son the surgery
he had been waiting a long time for.

754
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,112
Your Honor.

755
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,740
The reason why her son
couldn't have his surgery

756
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,534
was because the defendant
stole her employer's money.

757
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,373
She has already committed larceny twice,
which makes her a habitual offender.

758
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,584
Your Honor.
Her previous larceny was a long time ago.

759
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,545
Once she stole baby formula
to save her son from starving,

760
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,382
and next was when she stole
about 100,000 won

761
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,842
to take her sick son to the hospital.

762
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,886
The defendant is hearing-impaired.

763
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,473
Please consider how hard it must've been
for her to raise a son without a husband.

764
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,268
Your Honor, don't you see?

765
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,104
Every time the defendant committed theft,

766
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,398
she emphasized the fact
that she's hearing-impaired

767
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,066
and appealed to pity to be released.

768
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:50,237
And as a result, the scale of her theft
is getting bigger each time.

769
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,323
She only appeals to pity
and doesn't show remorse for her actions.

770
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,158
I urge you to give her
a severe punishment.

771
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,583
Your Honor. She must be given
an exemplary punishment this time.

772
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,877
Otherwise, her son

773
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,715
will learn that he can simply steal
when he has no money.

774
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,051
He will follow her in her footsteps
and end up in court as well.

775
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,328
<i>Like father, like daughter.</i>

776
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,414
Who do you think she learned this from?

777
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,916
I didn't steal it.

778
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,544
-It really wasn't me!
-Listen here, girl.

779
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:53,300
Are you telling me this magically went
into your bag by itself?

780
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,761
I really...

781
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,306
I really didn't steal it.

782
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,434
See?

783
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,230
Instead of reflecting
on yourself, you're lying.

784
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,649
I wonder how you're going to turn out.

785
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:17,115
You're raising your granddaughter alone,
so you need to pay extra attention.

786
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,452
Are you going to let her
go to prison just like her dad did?

787
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,668
Is it true
that you didn't steal it?

788
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,756
Okay.

789
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,218
All right, then. Let's go.

790
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,846
Ma'am!

791
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,473
You can't just leave.

792
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:48,313
She says she didn't steal it.
What more do you want me to do?

793
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,608
Man, this is a serious problem.

794
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,571
If you coddle her like this,
what do you think she will learn?

795
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,993
I don't know what she will learn from me,

796
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:08,625
but I believe she has much more to learn
from our dog than from you.

797
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,091
Your Honor.

798
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,595
I request a change of the indictment.

799
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,515
What did you say?

800
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,642
Your Honor.

801
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,979
If the defendant receives aggravated
punishment as indicted by the prosecutor,

802
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,857
she will have to serve a prison sentence
for 18 months or more.

803
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,400
Then there will be no one left

804
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,027
to take care of her teenage son
who's having surgery soon.

805
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,198
She is a single mother who has been
fighting hard to raise her son alone.

806
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,160
What exactly would the state gain
by giving her such a harsh punishment?

807
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:49,833
Therefore, I request that the prosecutor
indict her under the Criminal Code,

808
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,793
not the Act on Aggravated Punishment.

809
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,380
Good job.

810
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,601
Prosecutor, Counselor. Come forward.

811
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,360
This is unprecedented.
Are you aware of that?

812
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,695
Yes, I'm aware.

813
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:23,116
Prosecutor. Are you willing
to consider changing the indictment?

814
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,786
Nonsense. The defendant's act
of larceny has already become habitual.

815
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,873
It's legitimate to charge her
under the Act on Aggravated Punishment.

816
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,791
I know. I'm aware of that.

817
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,252
But she committed the previous larcenies

818
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,172
to survive and raise her son
by herself, didn't she?

819
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:41,843
Prosecutor, can't you reconsider
changing the indictment?

820
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,595
Your Honor.

821
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,263
That's impossible.

822
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,478
Prosecutor, all three of us know
that it's possible.

823
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,483
Your Honor, if he refuses
to change the indictment,

824
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,401
I will continue
to argue my case until he does.

825
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,070
I don't care if it takes 24 hours or 48.

826
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,614
What, you're going to pull
a filibuster here?

827
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,865
Yes, let's see who rolls over.

828
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,829
Go back to your seats.

829
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,668
COURTROOM 415

830
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,711
When Sim Chong's blind father

831
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,797
asked women to breastfeed
his starving daughter,

832
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,841
would it have been right for the law
to punish him for larceny?

833
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,593
Even our ancestors

834
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,846
were generous with a blind man
who was raising his child alone.

835
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,558
That's the affectionate nature of Koreans.
What can we do?

836
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,436
I mean, she stole money
to buy baby formula.

837
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,106
Would you send her to prison
for stealing a loaf of bread?

838
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,190
Who is she, Jean Valjean?

839
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,526
This is Korea.

840
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,780
The defendant's son is just a teenager,
the future generation of this society.

841
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,907
To someone, this may be about

842
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,867
whether the indictment
can be changed or not.

843
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:53,373
But this can destroy
a young boy's entire world.

844
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,295
Will you make him live

845
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,964
his entire life feeling guilty about
sending his mother to prison?

846
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:05,802
Children feel guilty just looking
at the wrinkles on their mom's face.

847
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,473
Do you have to make him
visit her in prison after his surgery?

848
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,977
Your Honor!

849
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,276
Prosecutor, Counselor. Come forward.

850
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,328
Prosecutor. Let's change the indictment.

851
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,541
Your Honor. I can't.

852
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,419
Now I want to do it even less.

853
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,338
Don't you feel bad for the defendant?

854
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,756
Her son is getting surgery soon.

855
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,425
If you send her to prison,
would you feel good about that?

856
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,093
That's her problem.

857
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,845
She must be punished for her crime.

858
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:49,763
Sangman!

859
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,598
Just do it.

860
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,266
The kid is having surgery soon.

861
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,143
You're really going
to send his mom to prison?

862
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,229
-This is a ridiculous...
-Do it!

863
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,065
Change it.

864
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,823
Counselor.

865
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,285
The indictment will be changed this time,

866
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,121
but this is an infringement
of the prosecutor's discretionary power.

867
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,916
If you believe that the application
of the Act on Aggravated Punishment

868
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,167
is a blind spot in the law,

869
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,878
request adjudication on constitutionality.

870
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,672
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Your Honor. I'll keep it in mind.

871
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,508
Go back to your seats.

872
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,759
Yes, Your Honor.

873
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,484
Your Honor.

874
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,278
I initially charged the defendant

875
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:52,909
with a violation of the Act on
Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes.

876
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,954
However, I hereby request
a change of indictment

877
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,751
and charge her with simple larceny
under the Criminal Code.

878
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:30,780
Thanks to Ms. Noh, the trial went well.
You'll only have to pay a fine.

879
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,828
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

880
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,663
<i>This is all thanks to you.</i>

881
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,373
<i>You saved my life.</i>

882
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,045
She thanks you.
She says you saved her life.

883
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,091
It's not a big deal.
I just did the right thing.

884
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,634
Thank you, Ms. Noh.

885
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,053
Come on. Stop it, guys.

886
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,556
You should go home now.

887
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,017
-Goodbye.
-All right. Take care.

888
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,226
Bye.

889
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,774
Thank you, Ms. Noh.

890
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,196
Are you seriously thanking me right now?
What are you going to do about this?

891
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,364
Everyone will think
I'm a total nutjob after this.

892
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,534
I will find a way to make it up to you.

893
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,412
Well...

894
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,915
Pork rinds and soju?

895
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,253
You said you'd make it up to me.

896
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,672
Then start now, and do it right. Okay?

897
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,882
Let's go.

898
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,479
Get up.

899
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,022
Yes, sir.

900
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,745
Are you done?

901
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,708
Do you know why
a worm squirms when it's stepped on?

902
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:06,960
What?

903
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,629
Because you didn't step on it hard enough.

904
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,590
You have to crush it
so it can't even squirm.

905
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,931
You pathetic idiot.

906
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,935
You were taken to the police because
you couldn't even crush a damn kid?

907
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,106
Just get out of my sight.

908
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,865
Hi, Gido.

909
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,826
Have you looked into Lee Dongpil?

910
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,412
Oh, I'm still looking.

911
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,247
I heard you met with Haran.

912
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,999
What?

913
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,834
Oh, yes.

914
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,086
She changed her mind
and came by with a new contract.

915
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,546
What about the contract terms?

916
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,424
<i>Come on, you don't have
to concern yourself with that.</i>

917
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,136
Where are you right now?

918
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,888
I came to the resort to play golf.

919
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,308
<i>Why?</i>

920
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,889
Please. Please don't kill me.

921
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:27,850
Why?

922
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,353
I'm sorry for everything.

923
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,314
I'm sorry for...

924
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,482
For what?

925
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,026
Everything. Everything.

926
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,279
Don't be dramatic.
It's just a little water.

927
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,726
Damn it.

928
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,589
Hmm?

929
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,966
Mm, what's this?

930
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,970
What is this?

931
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,743
You're up.
