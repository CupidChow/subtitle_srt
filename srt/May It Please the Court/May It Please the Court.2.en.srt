LAWYER IDENTIFICATION CARD

16
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,001
I'd like a consultation
with Ms. Lee Soonyoung.

17
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:29,002
I'm a public defender.

18
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,046
(paper rustles)

19
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:33,632
She already consulted with her attorney.

20
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:36,218
Ms. Lee already has an attorney?

21
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,220
Yes, a female attorney.

22
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,013
A female...

23
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,477
-I'd like to sign up for a visit.
-COP: She can't see you right now.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,980
Ms. Lee tried to kill herself
after she met with her attorney.

25
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:51,942
She attempted suicide?

26
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,201
(sighs)

27
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,913
(somber music)

28
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,166
Soonyoung.

29
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,962
Lee Soonyoung.

30
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:28,311
Chakhee.

31
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:31,314
(exhales)

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,234
CHAKHEE: Then can you do as I say?

33
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:36,486
Anything.

34
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,239
I'll do anything you say, Chakhee.

35
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:41,700
Fine.

36
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:44,286
In that case...

37
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,458
Kill yourself.

38
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,294
(dramatic music)

39
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:53,879
(gasps)

40
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,046
What?

41
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,506
Kill yourself.

42
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,967
If you want to save yourself
and your kids.

43
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,053
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:05,056
You have to make this case
as big as possible.

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,560
Kangsung Pharm
will make up a reason for why

46
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:10,270
you would've wanted to stab your husband.

47
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:13,690
CHAKHEE: They will dig
into your past and your husband's.

48
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,359
Before they use the media
to turn the public opinion against you,

49
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,986
you have to beat them to it.

50
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,116
The pill's side effects
made you stab your husband,

51
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,244
and then you tried to kill yourself,
feeling guilty and wronged.

52
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:29,205
That is the story that will intrigue
the media and make the news.

53
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:32,334
Do you understand what I'm saying?

54
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:35,503
(serious music)

55
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:44,763
(exhales)

56
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:46,431
I only wanted you to pretend.

57
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,059
Look at those marks on your neck.

58
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,896
(sniffles)

59
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,564
I did what you told me.

60
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:57,609
But the underwear turned out to be
much tougher than I thought.

61
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:58,860
It just wouldn't break.

62
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:01,988
SOONYOUNG: I actually thought that I
was going to die for a minute there.

63
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:05,408
Soonyoung.

64
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:08,536
CHAKHEE: Listen to me carefully.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,123
I will tell you what's going
to happen from here on out.

66
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:19,714
Your suicide attempt
will be disclosed to the media.

67
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,634
You and your husband were orphans
who built a happy family together,

68
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:25,512
but it all fell apart
because of the side effects of the pill.

69
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:28,139
Suddenly, you became
this woman who stabbed her husband,

70
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:32,560
and now your kids
might become orphans, just like you.

71
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:37,232
Consumed by guilt,
you tried to take your own life.

72
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,609
This is going to be our side of the story.

73
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:41,569
Kangsung Pharm

74
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,990
will try to drag you
and your husband's names through the mud.

75
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,701
They'll likely pounce on
how you're both orphans.

76
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:51,204
They'll make an issue out of you two
living together before getting married

77
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:52,998
and make up stories
about marital problems.

78
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,625
Money, gambling, a mistress, anything.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,213
They'll make up any reason why
you would've wanted to stab your husband

80
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:05,093
because they want this case
to be about your personal affairs,

81
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,887
not about the side effects of their pills.

82
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,144
But if you want to get out of here

83
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:18,189
and get them to pay
for your husband's hospital bills

84
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:21,526
and your kids' college tuition,
you have to be strong and deal with it.

85
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:25,822
You have to come forward to stop them
from producing those defective pills.

86
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:29,826
It's not just your family
that you're saving.

87
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,746
You are saving other victims like you.

88
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,545
I'll trust you with everything.

89
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,839
I'll do anything you say.

90
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,136
This is all I can do for you.

91
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:51,014
(mellow music)

92
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,475
-What?
-From this moment on,

93
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,769
we will never see each other again.

94
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,564
-Why?
-This is the best I can do.

95
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:03,026
If I stay on as Kangsung's attorney,
remember what I said?

96
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,528
I'll have to make you
actually want to kill yourself.

97
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:13,286
Your suicide attempt ended in failure,

98
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,955
and Kangsung Pharm will now fire me.

99
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,251
Because I made a reckless move
to keep your mouth shut but failed.

100
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,757
CHAKHEE: They will think my threats
still worked on you in a way,

101
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,801
so they won't lose anything
even if they fire me.

102
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,180
I had no idea.

103
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,225
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,229
I knew I was going to be fired
before I even talked to you.

105
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:40,730
You don't have to be sorry.

106
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:42,524
(sighs)
But still...

107
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,651
Soonyoung.

108
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,487
Someone better...

109
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:49,405
Well, maybe not better.

110
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:53,284
Someone as good as me
will take over your case.

111
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,287
From now on, do as he says.

112
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,705
(sniffles)

113
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,626
But I like you better.

114
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,963
(snickers, deep inhale)

115
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:11,219
Get well soon. Eat lots of food,
and don't try anything funny.

116
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:15,932
I'm going.

117
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,894
(gentle music)

118
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,068
Thank you.

119
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:39,330
I don't owe you anything anymore.

120
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,332
Owe me?

121
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,377
You paid my tuition
for my first semester in college

122
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,296
with your pay from the sock factory.

123
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,839
(exhales)

124
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,091
You paid that back a long time ago.

125
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,597
You wasted your youth on my tuition.

126
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,266
This is for that.

127
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:03,188
(emotional music)

128
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:17,160
CHAKHEE: Please, sir.
I beg you. She's coming.

129
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,370
MAN: All right. Calm down.

130
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:23,583
But if your tuition isn't paid by 5 p.m.,
your enrollment will be canceled.

131
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,751
(anxious exhale)

132
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,211
Please wait just a little longer.

133
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,508
Soonyoung, where are you?

134
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,927
(sighs)

135
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:37,013
(Chakhee cries, sniffles)

136
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,684
(light switch clicks off)

137
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:46,814
(sighs)
Look, it's seven o'clock already.

138
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,901
MAN: I'm sorry,
but I can't wait any longer.

139
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,866
-(Soonyoung panting)
-Soonyoung.

140
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,744
(panting intensely)

141
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,122
Just a second.

142
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:04,958
(rustles)

143
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,751
(whimpers)

144
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:13,007
Go on.

145
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:14,884
SOONYOUNG: Give it to him!

146
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,764
(Chakhee whimpers)

147
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:25,019
(emotional music)

148
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,318
(sighs)

149
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,788
(engine starts)

150
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:47,417
(footsteps, thumps)

151
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,672
(window rolls down)

152
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,594
Get out.

153
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:06,936
SIBAEK: I don't know how you coerced
Ms. Lee into attempting suicide,

154
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,023
but I won't let you do
whatever you want anymore.

155
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,567
What is it that I want?

156
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,527
To give up being a human to win?

157
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,824
If you're a human being, act like one.

158
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,078
Mr. Jwa, you seem
to have forgotten already.

159
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:25,496
I'm not human.

160
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,456
I'm a dog.

161
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,874
A Shih Tzu.

162
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:31,002
Ah, that's right.

163
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:32,920
Are we done here?

164
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,214
How many more people
have to die before you stop?

165
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,634
SIBAEK: You drive an imported car
and wear luxury watches and clothes

166
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,804
bought with the money you make
from people's blood, sweat, and tears.

167
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:45,224
Does that make you happy?

168
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,855
You work as a public defender
and wear a watch you bought

169
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,607
with the chicken scratch
the state pays you

170
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,233
for defending rapists,

171
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:57,570
drug offenders, and robbers.
Compared to that, I feel...

172
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,823
pretty good.

173
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:01,991
All right, then.

174
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:08,915
(car door closes)

175
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:11,209
(car engine starts)

176
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:18,883
DAEHYEON: Gido.

177
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,928
You need to hire more women
and at least one disabled person.

178
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,764
JANGSAN LAW FIRM

179
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:25,848
Is it bad?

180
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:30,895
Agora is similar in size to Jangsan,
and they hired even more women this year.

181
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:35,358
DAEHYEON: They hired people with
diverse majors and even a blind lawyer.

182
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:36,359
Meanwhile, Jangsan

183
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,904
has the most imbalanced gender ratio
in the field with the new lawyers.

184
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:43,282
You always choose men
from the top three schools in the country.

185
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:46,953
Come on. You don't even have
anyone over the age of 30.

186
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:48,830
(papers rustle)

187
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:49,914
I understand.

188
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,875
I'll hire a few more women.

189
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,421
Your firm takes on a lot of lawsuits
that are in favor of corporations.

190
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:58,339
That will be a pain
if people start to nitpick.

191
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,883
With this kind of personnel,
you won't make assemblyman.

192
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,136
DAEHYEON: You won't even
be picked within the party.

193
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:05,012
With this new demand for innovation,

194
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:06,889
everyone's just trying
to appease the citizens.

195
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,641
It sucks, but what can you do?

196
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:10,810
You have to at least pretend
to care about ESG.

197
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:12,395
(Daehyeon inhales)

198
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,481
Create a team just for ESG
and also start holding webinars.

199
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,942
You can do some pro bono work
and promote the firm that way.

200
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,362
Is there anyone
who could be the front man for ESG?

201
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,198
"ESG"?

202
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:25,575
(gulps)

203
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:28,619
I think I know just the person.

204
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,208
(Chakhee chuckles, sniffles)

205
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,086
Grandma, let's have a toast
to celebrate my promotion.

206
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,172
I made partner at the firm.

207
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,633
-Here.
-(paper cup swishing)

208
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,599
(sniffles, exhales)

209
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:50,766
Grandma.

210
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:54,187
You know Soonyoung, right?

211
00:12:55,605 --> 00:13:00,234
To protect my friend,
I broke the promise I made with you.

212
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:01,360
A LOVING GRANDMOTHER
CHO KANGYI

213
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:02,904
But you're still proud of me, right?

214
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,239
If I had turned a blind eye to Soonyoung,

215
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:09,076
you would have come back
just to beat me with a fire stick.

216
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,286
(chuckles)

217
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:16,751
Grandma, I'll keep my promise next time.

218
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,419
Jangsan's shares.

219
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:23,132
I'll make sure to get them, hmm?

220
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,346
(grunts)

221
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:33,476
Uncle Kyungsub, how have you been?

222
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,894
THE LATE JI KYUNGSUB

223
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:36,229
How about you, Aunt Hyunsook?

224
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:39,524
THE LATE KIM HYUNSOOK

225
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:41,234
(Chakhee sighs)

226
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:48,824
Eun Heesoo.

227
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:53,496
My grandma talks a big game,
but she's a sweetheart inside.

228
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:57,667
She's also an amazing cook.
Ask her to make you the...

229
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,462
Her handmade dumplings.
They're really good.

230
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:05,424
I can't have them anymore
even if I want to.

231
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:09,512
(plastic crinkles)

232
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,180
Well, anyway...

233
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,515
(grunts)

234
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,977
EUN HEESOO

235
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:22,108
Please take good care of my grandma.

236
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:56,434
SIBAEK: I always wondered
who was bringing you flowers.

237
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:04,942
Granny.

238
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:08,362
I guess I'm not the only one
who's been talking to your neighbors here.

239
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,991
Go figure.
(gasps)

240
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:14,910
I can't believe Noh Chakhee
is your granddaughter.

241
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:19,206
You need to give her a good talking-to
the next time she comes!

242
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,917
Your granddaughter is running wild
these days. Did you know that?

243
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:29,925
What?

244
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,888
-(tongue clicks)
-(phone vibrates)

245
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,851
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

246
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:47,693
Hello?

247
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,695
CHAKHEE: Mr. Jwa Sibaek,this is Noh Chakhee.

248
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,947
What is it?

249
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:53,699
CHAKHEE: Can we meet today?

250
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,708
(sizzles)

251
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,545

00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:17,390
(Chakhee exhales)

254
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:19,809
Did you call me here to watch you eat?

255
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:23,979
Who said you had to watch?
You can eat too.

256
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,023
I'll say this first.
A settlement with Kangsung...

257
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,401
The food here is really great.

258
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:32,113
But they don't serve single portions.
You have to order at least two.

259
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:37,576
Are you telling me that you called me here
so you could order pork rinds?

260
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:40,871
Yes.

261
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,793
Well, you got your food,
so I can go, right? Goodbye.

262
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:49,630
CHAKHEE: Ah! Have a seat. Do you
really think I called you here for that?

263
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:51,632
Sit.

264
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:59,348
I heard you've been assigned
to Ms. Lee Soonyoung's case.

265
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:00,891
Yes.

266
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,145
Good.

267
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:05,896
Very good.
(slurps)

268

(breathes deeply)

271
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,573
Mr. Jwa.

272
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,784
I am very drunk right now.

273
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,455
-And?
-That's why I'm doing this.

274
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,296
What's this?

275
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,008
It's a data file of the side effects
of Kangsung's pills.

276
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:37,762
CHAKHEE: This will put you
in a dominant position in the lawsuit.

277
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,389
It's the data they don't
ever want to be discovered.

278
00:17:41,432 --> 00:17:44,351
You're their attorney,
so why are you giving this to me?

279
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:47,605
I'm no longer on the case.

280
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,108
On account of Ms. Lee's
failed suicide attempt.

281
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:54,403
So you're holding a grudge,
and you want to get back at them?

282
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,113
Maybe.

283
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:57,948
CHAKHEE: In any case,

284
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,453
I am way too drunk to,
you know, think straight right now.

285
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:08,501
If Jangsan finds out about this,
they won't stand for it.

286
00:18:10,294 --> 00:18:13,839
They won't find out if you keep quiet.
And it's not like the suit will drag on.

287
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:15,883
Well, even if they
find out later, it won't matter.

288
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:19,637
Because I will have gained
everything I wanted by then.

289
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:22,598
Cheers.

I could open up with how
I don't deserve this position...

299
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:09,770
but I won't bore you
with that kind of empty talk.

CHAKHEE: The last seven years,

301
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:14,984
I worked harder than anyone
to stand here today.

302
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:19,405
I will more proactively understand
the needs of our clients

00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,760
Weren't you the one who told me
to act like a human being, Mr. Jwa?

324
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,721
-So...
-(cell rattling)

325
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,848
...is this your idea of being human?

326
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,435
Oh, I am certainly still human.

327
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:32,603
(gasps)

328
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:36,482
I gave you the file on the side effects,
but you stab me in the back like this?

329
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:40,235
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-(gasps in disbelief)

330
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,571
I've turned over a new leaf.
Didn't you see it that day?

331
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,908
I had a guilty conscience,
so I gave you that valuable data

332
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,869
asking for nothing in return,
and this is how you repay me?

333
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,914
So are you satisfied now?

334
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:55,417
"A guilty conscience"?

335
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,128
As far as I remember,
you were very drunk that night.

336
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:01,590
You handed over the file
because you were holding a grudge

337
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,510
against Kangsung Pharm
and were dying to get back at them.

338
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,720
You call that turning over a new leaf?

339
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:08,222
(scoffs)
Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

340
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:11,141
If I held grudges against Jangsan
over something trivial like that,

341
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:12,810
I wouldn't have an office there.

342
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:15,145
Also, who gets drunk on one shot of soju?

343
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,940
I drink half a bottle
with dinner all the time.

344
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:19,775
Boy, you have a drinking problem.

345
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:21,944
(laughs in disbelief)
This is driving me crazy.

346
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,362
(sighs)

347
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,825
Why did you give me the file
if you weren't seeking revenge?

348
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:30,035
I already told you.
How many times do I have to say it?

349
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,912
I have turned over a new leaf.

350
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:34,790
I thought it'd be less embarrassing
to give it to you if I was drunk.

351
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:35,916
Don't you get it?

352
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,377
Do you expect me to believe that?

353
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,170
You expose your client's weaknesses

354
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,922
without blinking an eye
just to win a case.

355
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,299
But you suddenly had a guilty conscience

356
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,844
over a lawsuit potentially worth
tens of billions of won?

357
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:48,512
All while eating pork rinds?

358
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,722
(exasperated sigh)

359
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,309
Look, Mr. Jwa.

360
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:56,895
(tongue rolls)

361
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,857
I really wasn't going to tell you this,
but I guess I have no choice.

362
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,282
Lee Soonyoung attempted suicide
because I told her to.

363
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:11,827
Yes, I know. You instigated her suicide.

364
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,412
No. That's not what I meant.

365
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:16,498
I did it for Soonyoung's sake.

366
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,001
Well, that's what all criminals say.

367
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,669
That they did it for the victim.

368
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,755
Soonyoung and I are friends.

369
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:24,590
I did that to help her.

370
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:26,133
Forget it.

371
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:29,470
CHAKHEE: Once you win the lawsuit
against Kangsung, you'll know the truth.

372
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:32,264
So, go. Go tell Detective Jung.

373
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,849
You are Soonyoung's attorney.

374
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:36,518
Tell him that you asked her,
and she denied it.

375
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,062
Go on.

376
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,481
Why should I?

377
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,357
(chuckles)
All right, look.

378
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:46,403
This is all just a misunderstanding
that came from my goodwill

379
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,197
to help out a friend.

380
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,575
So let's straighten it out together. Okay?

381
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:56,580
You're the only one who's
misunderstanding things here, Ms. Noh.

382
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:58,082
I didn't turn you in.

383
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,377
-So that's how you're taking this?
-What?

384
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:04,963
It's up to you
whether you want to believe me.

385
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,465
(sighs)

386
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:10,344
-What are you doing here, then?
-Right.

387
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:14,098
The data file on the side effects.
There are about three pages missing.

388
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,934
-I came to ask you for them.
-Wow!

389
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,979
This guy really knows
how to make my blood boil. Wow!

390
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,316
Okay. You want the data? Okay.

391
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,653
-I'll give you those three missing pages.
-Yes.

392
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,822
After I kick your butt. You little...

393
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:32,574
-Jesus.
-(exhales)

394
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,493
(sharp exhale)

395
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:37,496
I guess I caught you at a bad time.

396
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,374
Maybe next time, then. Farewell.

397
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:41,875
No, wait. Mr. Jwa.

398
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:42,918
-Yes?
-CHAKHEE: Hold on.

399
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,254
-No.
-Wait, Mr. Jwa!

400
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:47,381
Listen. Talk to the detective
before you leave.

401
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:49,591
Hey. Mr. Jwa!

402
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:52,386
(yells)
Hey! Don't go, you jerk! Hey!

(inhales)

406
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:03,397
Detective Jung.
What are you trying to pull here?

407
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,358
You know that abetment
to suicide is hard to prove.

408
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,193
And yet,
without a single piece of evidence,

409
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,486
you made an emergency arrest?

410
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:15,409
Ms. Lee Soonyoung attempted suicide
on the day she consulted with you.

411
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:17,161
How is that evidence?

412
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:18,829
Am I the only person she saw that day?

413
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:21,707
CHAKHEE: It only constitutes
abetment to suicide

414
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,919
if she was never going to attempt suicide,
but she did because of me.

415
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,631
Ms. Lee Soonyoung stabbed her own husband.

416
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:33,385
Now, she's in prison, and her kids
may have to grow up as orphans.

417
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,846
Anyone would want to die
in such a situation.

418
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:37,931
(sighs)

419
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,643
Who told you to arrest me?

420
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:46,023
You know you
can't charge me with anything.

421
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:48,192
You'll have to release me
in 48 hours anyway.

422
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:50,736
So on whose order
are you putting on this show?

423
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,905
(sighs)
Since you know how this works,

424
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:55,365
I guess we don't need to chat.

425
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:58,994
JUNG: So why don't we skip formalities
and get you back in the cell?

426
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:01,872
You have 36 hours left.

427
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:05,250

This is exhausting.

I'm an attorney.

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:18,388
Huh?

434
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:19,973
Ms. Noh Chakhee.

435
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:22,726
I'm surprised.
I didn't think you'd be so obedient.

436
00:25:23,977 --> 00:25:26,480
What do you think you're doing
without any evidence?

437
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,941
Bring a warrant
if you want to take Ms. Noh.

00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:30,484
Let's go.

(playful music)

442
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,878
You get me into trouble
and then get me out of it?

443
00:25:50,462 --> 00:25:53,757
Well, like I said,
I'm not the one who reported you.

444
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,218
And I rescued you out of sympathy.

445
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,428
"Sympathy"?

446
00:25:58,512 --> 00:26:00,722
I thought you were smart,
but you're a total fool.

447
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:02,474
Excuse me?

448
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,643
You're a hunting dog, aren't you?

449
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:07,354
"The hunting dog will be eaten
when the hunt is over."

450
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:10,357
I guess Jangsan is done with their hunt.

451
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,486
Seeing how none of the countless lawyers
under Jangsan have come to your aid.

452
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,239
-Hunting dog?
-(scoffs, exclaims)

453
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:19,741
It's hard to make someone
you helped hate you,

454
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:21,785
but you somehow managed to do it, sir.

455
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:25,163
Whether it was for your revenge
against Kangsung Pharm

456
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:29,918
or a sudden guilty conscience,
it's true I did get the file from you.

457
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:33,171
So we're even now, okay? Even.

458
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:38,510
Maybe you had a guilty conscience.
Why else would you come here at this hour?

459
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:40,721
Did you realize what you did wasn't cool?

460
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:47,227
It really wasn't you who turned me in?

461
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,939
As far as I know,
there are countless people

462
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:53,442
who want to put you in prison.

463
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:55,527
Shall we?

464
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,488
Forget it. Let's say bye here.
We'll probably never see each other again.

465
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:00,198
Sure. Goodbye, then.

I mean, who...

470
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,218
Who is it?

471
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:22,846
Who told you to arrest me?

472
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,307
Was it Ms. Oh Haran?

473
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:27,517
Mr. Cho Hyunsik?

474
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:31,605
Even if someone did put me up to it,
do you think I'd tell you?

475
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:34,983
You know, your sister's eviction suit
over her piano school.

476
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,236
I could still turn it around
if I wanted to.

477
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:40,572
What's it going to be?

478
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:48,789
The order came

She doesn't have any other choice.

573
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:29,355
It was a good decision.

574
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:32,108
DAEHYEON: Ms. Noh has a good backstory,

575
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:33,776
but if people found out she was hired

576
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,446
through her connections with the chairman
and was even made partner,

577
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:37,989
they'd say she got special treatment.

578
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:40,909
Right.

579
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:43,745
But you still need at least
one female partner.

580
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:47,874
If the management committee disapproves,
create a similar position.

581
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,418
You can just fire her after the election.

582
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,296
I'll do that.

583
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:55,507

Don't worry.

587

She's a smart kid.

588

Well, you said you were a lawyer,

593
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:24,953
so I tried to find a good place around
the legal town in the Southern District,

594
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,747
but there's nothing available there.

595
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,917
Still, the court
is pretty close by, you know.

596
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,963

599
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,220
there just aren't many places available.

00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,265
-I'll take any place but this.
-Your things are already inside.

601
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:46,641
I can take them back out.

602
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,309
I want to live near skyscrapers.

603
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:52,564
You know, where I don't see
these roof tiles or bricks.

604
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:54,065
Skyscrapers.

605
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,236
Well, if you insist, I'll try to find one.

606
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,862
But there just aren't...

607
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:00,780
Please try.

608
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:03,575
You see, I have a fear of low heights.

609
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:06,077
Sorry? "A fear of low heights?"

610
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,830
I'm scared to live in a low place

611
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,124
because it makes me feel like
my life is ruined.

612
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:12,584
Please, sir.

613
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:14,294
But...

614
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:17,255
this is still

615

Hello. I'm Attorney Noh Chakhee.
I'll be working here starting today.

I look forward to it.

You haven't heard
that I would be coming today?

676
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:56,158
-Ah, I see. Are you a public defender?
-Yes.

677
00:40:56,242 --> 00:41:00,663
I'm afraid all the cubicles
are already taken in this office.

678

You know what? Over there.

679
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,793
I think they have available space
in the Northern District office.

680
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:10,172
The Northern District? That's...

681
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:13,134
The one in the apartment complex?

682
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:14,385
Yes. That's the one.

I thought everyone ran away
because they think I'm a wacko.

693

Well, we have a new attorney
joining the firm.

694
00:41:49,003 --> 00:41:52,381
No one from the legal town office
wanted to come here,

How long will you pay
for maintenance costs by yourself?

you don't have much left each month.

You know?

702
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,653
So please be on your best behavior, okay?

703
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:14,612
All right.

704
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:17,949
I'll make them fall completely in love
with me this time, okay?

-What's this?

709
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,215

711

What brings you here?

712
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,701
Didn't you say
we'd never see each other again?

713
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:03,911
Is that my desk?

714
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:09,208
Ah, that's for the new attorney.

715
00:43:10,793 --> 00:43:13,671
My name is Noh Chakhee.
I'll be working here starting today.

00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,214
I look forward to it.

717
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:17,008
Sorry?

718
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:19,510
What is all this about?

719
00:43:19,593 --> 00:43:22,805
You were shooting a mukbang the other day.
Is this a candid camera this time?

720
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:25,558
I told you. I've turned over a new leaf.

721
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:26,767
And?

722
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:29,270
When I handed over the data
of the side effects to you,

723
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:30,479
I had a revelation.

724
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:34,734
I shouldn't be providing rich people
with legal services in exchange for money.

725
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:36,068
CHAKHEE: I should be spreading

726
00:43:36,152 --> 00:43:39,488
the justice and love of the law
to the underprivileged...

727
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:42,116
I find the Flat Earth Theory
more believable.

728
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:45,828
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm a different person now.

729
00:43:45,911 --> 00:43:48,706
I intend to be a kind legal helper
to the people,

730
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:51,709
so let's try to get along while I'm here.

731
00:43:52,293 --> 00:43:53,127
CHAKHEE: Okay?

732
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:54,837
Mr. Do.

733
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:57,006
Throw out the flowers.

734
00:43:57,089 --> 00:43:58,841
Okay. Are flowers regular waste?

735
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:01,093
Let's give our neighbors the vase.

CHAKHEE: Is this
the only coffee you have?

741
00:44:20,654 --> 00:44:22,615
You don't even have
a capsule coffee machine?

742
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:24,492
What? Capsule coffee?

743
00:44:25,117 --> 00:44:26,952
Our clients don't like that kind of thing.

744
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:28,829
They think it tastes like scorched rice.

745
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:31,874
There's takeout coffee outside.
Want me to get you an Americano?

746
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:33,417
No, I'll get it.

747
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:40,341
She said she had
some kind of revelation, right?

748
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:42,426
Do you think
she joined a cult or something?

749
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,636
Well, you know.

750
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:47,098
The one where they give
all their money to the cult leader.

751
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:50,101
Maybe the cult leader ordered her
to come work with us.

752
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,186
SIBAEK: You're right.

753
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:55,523
-What?
-She's doing as the cult leader said.

754
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,236
Why did you offer to get her coffee?

755
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,154
I'm sorry.

756
00:45:03,197 --> 00:45:04,281

00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:22,049
You mean, a public defender?

761
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:23,509
You asked me to spare you.

762
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:25,177
You don't like it?

763
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,805
It's not that. It's just...

764
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:29,974
unexpected.

765
00:45:30,057 --> 00:45:33,060
Go work as a public defender
for a year down in Jungha

766
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:34,812

so take good care of him.

770
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,447
I will. Please don't worry.

00:45:46,782 --> 00:45:49,201
We'll be founding
a new institution for ESG soon.

Come back to the firm
after building your career for a year.

773
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:56,375
I'm sorry?

774
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:59,211
As I hear, the win rate
of the public defenders is 3%.

804
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,274
(rain pouring)

805
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:48,862
This is obscene acts in public.
This is theft.

806
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:52,157
Property damage, defamation.

807
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:55,411
God, they're all petty offenses.

808
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,832
I mean, how am I supposed to become
the new face of Jangsan with these?

809
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,257
It's tacky, but let's follow tradition.

810
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:09,967
Sorry? What tradition?

811
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:13,429
We'll be off work soon and it's raining.
Let's have a welcome party.

812
00:48:13,512 --> 00:48:15,139
YOUNGSOO: For who...

813
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,141
For you, Ms. Noh? Right.

814
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:19,935
What would you like
to eat, Mr. Do? My treat.

815
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:21,979
Well, since it's raining,
how about pajeon ?

816
00:48:22,062 --> 00:48:23,063
(coughs)

817
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:24,606
Actually, I have plans.

818
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,359
YOUNGSOO: It's raining,
and I'm having pajeon with a friend.

819
00:48:27,443 --> 00:48:28,986
-Well...
-Next time, then.

820
00:48:30,696 --> 00:48:32,698
Since it's raining... Sorry!

821
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:35,492
(door opens)

822
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:36,785
What are you sorry for?

823
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:40,331
CONVENIENCE STORE

824
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:43,584
Whoa, it's raining hard.

825
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:44,877
Have a good night, then.

826
00:48:46,253 --> 00:48:47,421
Good evening.

827
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:48,672
Mr. Jwa.

828
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:51,967
Where do you live?

829
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:53,552
I live in Susangdong.

830
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:54,803
Really?

831
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:56,597
Good. I live there too.

832
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,890
Give me a ride, will you?

833
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,602
Why should I...

834
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:04,605
It's raining, and I
don't have a car or an umbrella.

835
00:49:05,147 --> 00:49:06,815
-And?
-That's why.

836
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:11,111
This country doesn't produce any oil.
If you let me ride in the passenger seat,

837
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:13,322
we'll be saving energy
and protecting the environment.

838
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:14,740
It's a win-win.

839
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:17,451
But I don't see how it's a win for me.

840
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:19,828
Man, you're so calculating.

841
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:21,830
I just wanted to protect
our environment together.

842
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:25,084
I'll protect the environment on my own.

843
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,377
I'll be going now.

844
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:33,467
(clears throat)

845

HYUNSIK: Get in.

847
00:49:50,442 --> 00:49:51,652
Mr. Cho.

848
00:49:52,778 --> 00:49:54,947
It's raining. Get in.

849
00:50:00,494 --> 00:50:01,912
(car door closes)

850
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:06,708
(engine revs)

851
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,264
I'm sorry, Mr. Cho.

852
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:22,975
I should have closed your case
over the birth control pills.

853
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,354
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.

854
00:50:28,814 --> 00:50:29,815
"Didn't mean to"?

855
00:50:31,316 --> 00:50:33,902
This is why I hate people
without a background.

856
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:37,072
Hey.

857
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:39,658
I could sue you
for obstruction of business.

858
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:45,372
That's how the world works.

859
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:48,542
It's merciless to those who have nothing.

860
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:53,338
That's why people like you
need someone like me.

861
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,051
Join Kangsung Pharm's legal team.

862
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:01,305
HYUNSIK: You can work
as our legal advisor for a year.

863
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:04,349
You can, of course, work as
a public defender at the same time.

864
00:51:08,562 --> 00:51:11,148
(uneasy music)

865
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,484
You know what I did
with Yoon Youngju. It's nothing hard.

866
00:51:19,114 --> 00:51:22,618
You've been waiting for me
to reach out my hand to you.

867
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:24,953
I know it very well.

868
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:34,421
Mr. Cho.

869
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:39,218
Please remove your hand.

870
00:51:40,385 --> 00:51:42,721
(heavy dark music)

871
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:46,058
They took away
your apartment, car, and office,

872
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:49,603
and sent you to the sticks to work
as a public defender for a pittance.

873
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:52,648
HYUNSIK: If I remove my hand,
you won't even have that.

874
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,192
Are you okay with that?

875
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,531
Mr. Cho.

876
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:06,995
Please remove your hand.

877
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:11,166
(snickers)
Right.

878
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,337
HYUNSIK: I like...

879
00:52:15,754 --> 00:52:17,339
that you're feisty.

880
00:52:17,965 --> 00:52:19,216
And that's why...

881
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:23,053
I crave you even more.

882
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:27,766
To Grand Hotel.

883
00:52:28,558 --> 00:52:30,435

What the hell?

892
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,459
What? Who the hell are you? Let me go.

CHAKHEE: Stop!

899
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,248
I'm okay, so please stop.

900
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:45,510

902
00:54:15,874 --> 00:54:17,084
Are you okay?

903
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:25,133
Are you crying?

904
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:29,012
Why would I cry
because of that old pervert?

905
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:31,390
Darn that perverted bastard.

906
00:54:31,765 --> 00:54:35,018
I should've knocked all his teeth out.
All I gave him was a headbutt.

907
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:37,979
(sighs in disappointment)

908
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,749
This wouldn't have happened if you agreed
to protect the environment with me.

909
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,043
Are you blaming me for it right now?

910
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:01,128
I am.

911
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:04,673
Right, I'm sorry.

912
00:55:04,756 --> 00:55:06,133
I should've given you a ride.

913
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:10,554
If you weren't going to,
why did you follow me?

914
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:12,931
I didn't follow you.
I was just on my way home.

915
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:14,224
(chuckles)

916
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:16,768
That makes me feel worse.

917
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:20,814
I'm sorry.

918
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:24,109
Don't be.

919
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:28,071
We both know that this isn't your fault.

920
00:55:29,573 --> 00:55:31,658
Use this. I'll testify.

921
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:34,786
You saw how I did it.

922
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:38,039
I expose my client's weaknesses
without blinking an eye to win a case.

923
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:43,086
It'll work because Cho Hyunsik
has a long history.

924
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:47,132
I'm not going to use you as his weakness.

925
00:55:47,257 --> 00:55:49,676
Why not? This is good.

926
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:53,972
I'm trying to win the lawsuit
to help the victim who's been wronged,

927
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:56,391
not to create another victim.

928

I'm a lawyer who knows what's right.

930

You think you're so great.

931
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:06,485
I don't think. I am great.

932
00:56:08,904 --> 00:56:10,030
You even have good ears.

933
00:56:10,113 --> 00:56:11,198
They're pretty good.

934
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:15,952

00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:32,511
Well, yeah.
This is the only place I could get.

939
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:33,929
Where do you live?

940
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:39,059
It's...

941
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:41,728
very far from here.

942

943
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:47,234
I wanted to carpool
and protect the environment.

944
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:48,527
That's too bad.

945
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,904
Right. Too bad.

-So...
-I'm fine.

952
00:57:17,931 --> 00:57:18,807

Hello?

(groans)

969
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,024
CHAKHEE: Seriously.

970
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,443
He's got to be kidding me.

971
00:58:55,862 --> 00:58:58,823
-(insects chirping)
-(man moaning in pain)

972
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:24,015
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

973
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:26,351
(ominous music)

974
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:27,686
(sniffles)

975
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:34,442
(phone clacks)

976
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,654
(labored breathing)

977
00:59:40,198 --> 00:59:42,575
(muffled yelling)

978
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:47,914
(begging)

979
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:50,709
I'm sorry for everything.

980
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:53,878
Please don't kill me.

981
00:59:54,713 --> 00:59:55,880
MAN: Are you really sorry?

982
00:59:55,964 --> 00:59:59,175
I'm sorry for everything.
I deserve to die for what I did.

983
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:01,094
MAN: Do you really think so?

984
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:04,764
Yes, of course. I...

985
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:07,392
Whatever it is, I'm so sorry.

986
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:08,977
Okay? Please.

987
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:13,565
-MAN: Then die.
-Huh?

988
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:17,819
(burbling)

989
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,739
(water splashing)

990
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:33,126
(tense music)

991
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:53,229
(siren wailing)

992
01:00:55,774 --> 01:00:57,525
(car door opens)

993
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,912
(sighs)

994
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:19,464
-Where is it?
-This way.

995
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:27,138
(camera shutter clicking)

996
01:01:28,848 --> 01:01:30,683
-Sir.
-Hey, did you have breakfast?

997
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:32,060
No, I came straight here.

998
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,607
(sighs in disbelief)

999
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:43,196
(haunting music)

1000
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:45,114
This knot. It's not common.

1001
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:47,575
Cause of death?

1002
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:51,412
We'll have to do an autopsy to be sure,
but it looks like drowning.

1003
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,838
Hey, doesn't he look like...

1004
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:00,755
I know, right?

1005
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,466
He looks like he was tortured with water.

1006
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:06,511
(sucks teeth)
You know,

1007
01:02:07,512 --> 01:02:10,974
he's in a position that makes him look
like he's apologizing on his knees.

1008
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:19,357
(tense music)

1009
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:23,820
(clinks)

1010
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:30,660
(suspenseful music)

1011
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:39,836
(door squeaks)

1012
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:48,344
(car engine starts)

1013
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:51,264
(cranks)

1014
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:52,891
(clonks)

1015
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:56,895
