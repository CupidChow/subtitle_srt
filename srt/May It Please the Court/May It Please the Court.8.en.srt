JEONGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

3
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:48,463
(EPISODE-8)

4
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:02,395
What happened?

5
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:05,398
Mr. Do, did that ex-convict
really hit you?

6
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:07,692
No, it's a bug bite.

7
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,235
You got me.

8
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,558
BASED ON THE ESSAY
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT BY JUNG HYEJIN

9
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:14,365
Hmm. I had to go on a trial
and go undercover today

10
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,575
so I had no time for lunch.

11
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,118
With all the interviews and reports,

12
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,746
I'm seriously busy today,
so don't start with me.

13
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:23,207
I didn't know you had two jobs.

14
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,460
A lawyer and a spy?

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,672
Stop joking and get me some food.
I told you I didn't even have lunch.

16
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,259
What's so important
that you had to skip a meal?

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,095
Should I get you some instant noodles?

18
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,180
Mr. Jwa!

19
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,223
I said no instant noodles in the office.

20
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,978
She's starving, okay?
A person is starving.

21
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,274
And what about you?
What did you eat in the office, Mr. Do?

22
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,870
DEFAMED HIS REPUTATION

23
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,665
<i>The one
who threatened the police chief.</i>

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,876
It was Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

25
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,288
It wasn't you.

26
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,084
You didn't kill them.

27
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,089
So why...

28
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:00,972
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

29
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,522
These are both samples of prime suspects.

30
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,691
- Please handle them with extra care.
- Okay.

31
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,111
I'll compare them with the DNA
found at Yoon Seokgu's murder scene.

32
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,280
I'll call you when I get the results.

33
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,499
DETECTIVE JUNG JAEGEUN

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,584
Hello?

35
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,544
They got the police chief.

36
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,796
What? What do you mean they got him?

37
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,196
Where's the chief?

38
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,907
The ambulance took him to the hospital.

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,537
I guess it wasn't his time to go yet.
His neighbor found him and gave him CPR.

40
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,790
They thought he had stopped breathing,
so they called the cops and waited.

41
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,000
But he was still alive.

42
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,171
He's unconscious, but he's still alive.

43
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,633
Let me take a look at the scene first.

44
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,176
Let's go.

45
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,596
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

46
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,641
FORENSIC SERVICES
POLICE

47
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,759
There's no need to look.
I'm sure Jwa Sibaek's the culprit.

48
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,985
What he did to the chief
the other day was a warning.

49
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,947
He killed Cho Hyunsik
after threatening him.

50
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,324
He killed Yoon Seokgu
after threatening his son.

51
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,868
And he tried to kill the chief
after threatening him.

52
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,371
He's a psycho who broadcasts
his murders beforehand.

53
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,498
Where was Mr. Jwa yesterday?

54
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:53,209
Why are you asking me?

55
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,087
Didn't you put a tail on him
following the chief's orders?

56
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,048
Right. I did.

57
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,302
Hey.

58
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,054
Where was Jwa Sibaek last night?

59
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,348
What?

60
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,059
Are you sure?

61
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,769
I got it.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,438
Where was he?

63
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,108
Apparently, he was at home.

64
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,823
But who knows? He could've left
the lights on and gone out the back door.

65
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,781
If he knew that
the police were on his tail,

66
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,117
he would also know
that it'd give him an alibi.

67
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,760
He could've used that to his advantage.

68
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,664
Come on, I'm sure it's him.

69
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,582
I mean, there's no way it's not him...

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,626
I submitted Jwa Sibaek
and Jang Gido's DNA samples

71
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,988
to the National Forensic Service.

72
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005
What?

73
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,923
Wait, when did you get that?

74
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,677
I'm having them compared to the DNA found
at the scene of Yoon Seokgu's murder.

75
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,598
We can accuse Mr. Jwa of the murders
after we get the test results back.

76
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,145
Man.

77
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,235
There's no sign of intrusion
this time either?

78
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,447
No. So far, we haven't found any.

79
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,285
Cho Hyunsik, Yoon Seokgu,
Park Kangil, Jeon Jaeho.

80
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:15,333
They all opened the door themselves
which means they knew the person.

81
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,793
They all knew Jwa Sibaek, didn't they?

82
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,253
Besides Mr. Jwa...

83
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,090
there's another person
they were much closer to. Isn't there?

84
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,264
At first, she asked me to search for
a case from eight years ago, so I did.

85
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,018
Then a few days ago, she asked me
to send her the file, and I refused.

86
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,230
But it seems like she came
to the office yesterday and took the file.

87
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:43,152
JANGSAN LAW FIRM
CEO JANG GIDO

88
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,197
She took Chief Jeon Jaeho's case file?

89
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,699
Chakhee did?

90
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:50,701
I believe so.

91
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,499
Send her the address
of the campaign headquarters.

92
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,209
Tell her to stop by this afternoon.

93
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,044
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:10,679
Gido.

95
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,807
I found it.

96
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,393
A substitute.

97
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,854
RESUME
NAME: JWA SIBAEK

98
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,189
Jwa Sibaek.

99
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,735
He's a public defender working
in the same office as Noh Chakhee.

100
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,320
He's got a great reputation.

101
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,198
He was named public defender of the year
for three years straight.

102
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,576
He excelled on the bar exam
and at the training institute.

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,664
The defendants that he represented
all gave him great reviews.

104
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,544
He's a well-respected
public defender in Jeongha.

105
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,422
If someone like him is on our side
for your campaign,

106
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,550
it'll work very well
along with your retrial case.

107
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,511
They have the same eyes.

108
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,766
He and Heesoo.

109
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,894
What?

110
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,776
His family background?

111
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:09,488
They moved to the US when he was eight.

112
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,450
He has no siblings,

113
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,453
and his father died a few years
after they emigrated.

114
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:19,290
He came back to Korea
by himself when he was around 20.

115
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:21,959
Around?

116
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,170
There's no record of his teenage years.

117
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
His Korean university records

118
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,272
and his career as an attorney
after the bar were all I could find.

119
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,511
But I'm sure
that won't be a problem.

120
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,306
He moved to another country 20 years ago.

121
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,141
Of course, he wouldn't have
proper records.

122
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,727
And he got his early education there too.

123
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,406
Yes, what is it?

124
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:56,243
<i>The police chief has been attacked.</i>

125
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,954
Where?

126
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,498
<i>At his farmhouse.</i>

127
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,751
- Is he dead?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

128
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,254
He's in a coma, but he's still alive.

129
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,674
Okay.

130
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,680
He's quite determined to live,
unlike the others.

131
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:23,646
<i>The one
who threatened the police chief.</i>

132
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,316
<i>It was Mr. Jwa Sibaek.</i>

133
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,528
About Chief Jeon Jaeho's case.

134
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,532
I'm going to request a retrial.

135
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,503
It's from eight years ago.
Hasn't the statute of limitations expired?

136
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,040
Ms. Choi Yoonjung filed an appeal before,
so we still have about three months.

137
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:47,670
You'll need enough evidence
for the request to be accepted.

138
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,837
It won't be easy.

139
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,964
I know.

140
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,842
But now that I know,
I can't just ignore it.

141
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,847
If people at Jangsan find out...

142
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,559
Chief Jeon is not like other clients.

143
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,811
They're concerned
with owners of corporations,

144
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,145
not some police chief.

145
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,829
They won't lose anything
even if I request a retrial for his case.

146
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,484
What about CEO Jang?

147
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,903
Do you think he'll approve?

148
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,447
What do you think, Mr. Jwa?

149
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,992
About me requesting a retrial.

150
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,619
What are your thoughts about it?

151
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,540
Well...

152
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,087
The passing of time
doesn't erase a person's crime.

153
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:35,426
Even if the person in question dies.

154
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,275
<i>You've reached your destination.
Ending the navigation.</i>

155
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,694
Are we at the right place?

156
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,536
HIT REFRESH WITH JANG GIDO

157
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,667
Thanks for the ride.
I'll see you back at the office.

158
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,544
Sure.

159
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,159
NEW POLITICS PARTY
HIT REFRESH WITH JANG GIDO

160
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,787
GIDO FOR JEONGHA
JEONGHA NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE 1

161
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,871
Excuse me.

162
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:47,039
Yes?

163
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:49,625
I'm here to see CEO Jang.

164
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,502
You mean Candidate Jang?

165
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,836
He's upstairs.

166
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,715
Ah...

167
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,175
Chakhee.

168
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,428
Oh!

169
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:12,606
GIDO FOR JEONGHA

170
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,108
What's the matter?

171
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,359
Does it feel weird?

172
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,323
You'll get used to it soon.
Assemblyman Jang Gido.

173
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,037
Don't worry.

174
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,040
There won't be any issues
with you returning to Jangsan

175
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,458
even if I'm not there.

176
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,170
No, that's not what I was thinking.

177
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,088
Chakhee.

178
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:40,008
The election is about to start,
and I'm counting on you.

179
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,886
I need your help.

180
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,722
Of course.

181
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,350
I'll help you in any way I can.

182
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,519
Speaking of which,

183
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,732
I heard you took
Chief Jeon Jaeho's case file.

184
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,986
Yes.

185
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,488
Why?

186
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,243
There was something I needed to check
regarding the lawsuit.

187
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,036
What lawsuit?

188
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,874
Don't do it.

189
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,418
Whatever it is.

190
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,965
Chief Jeon is in the hospital.
He's in a coma.

191
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,427
Someone attacked him last night.

192
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,847
He was attacked?

193
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,557
Last night?

194
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,185
Chakhee.

195
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,105
That case is from eight years ago.

196
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,029
If you start poking around
after all this time,

197
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,067
you'll only hurt you and your client.

198
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,569
I'm sure you know

199
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:44,239
that people will forgive you
for anything once you're dead.

200
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,241
I'm saying this for your sake.

201
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,413
You don't belong here.
You belong in Jangsan.

202
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,974
Bide your time, then return to Jangsan.

203
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:59,171
Don't try to become someone
that isn't you.

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,263
I heard you met with Yiyeon.

205
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,474
Yes.

206
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:11,725
I was going to tell you.

207
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,395
I want you to keep an eye on her
and fill me in on what she's up to.

208
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,525
Make sure she stays out of trouble
until the election is over.

209
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,027
I will.

210
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,030
And about Jwa Sibaek.

211
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,784
- I'm sorry?
- You work in the same office, right?

212
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,119
How is it?

213
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,999
Detective Jung told me
he had some trouble with CEO Cho.

214
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,585
What do you think of him?

215
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:41,922
I don't know.

216
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:45,175
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

217
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,178
It seems like
he's a well-respected public defender.

218
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,127
That's why I'd like to have him
help me with my campaign.

219
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,892
With your campaign?

220
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,062
Do you think he'll take my offer?

221
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,524
No.

222
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:03,443
As far as I know,
he's not interested in politics...

223
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,528
Is that so?

224
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,577
I guess we'll have to see.

225

HOWEVER, THE JUDGMENT ABOVE

<i>That case is from eight years ago.</i>

228
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,898
If you start poking around

229
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,262
after all this time,
you'll only hurt you and your client.

230
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,325
Mr. Jwa.

231
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,537
Chief Jeon Jaeho is in the hospital.
He's in a coma.

232
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,123
Really?

233
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,499
What happened?

234
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,629
Someone attacked him.

235
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,882
I see.

236
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:12,346
I'm really angry at that person
who did that to him.

237
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,393
I thought Chief Jeon
deserved to be punished.

238
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,521
You're right. He has to be punished.

239
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,523
Properly.

240
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,444
Instead of dying
before he pays for what he did.

241
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,326

<i>- You tramp.</i>

Turn yourself in.</i>

243
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,665
<i>Do you realize that you're
a disgrace to all other women?</i>

244
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,208
What the hell?

00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,129
What's wrong?

247
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,474
- Who is this?
<i>- Does being a lawyer make you special?</i>

248
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,650

Are you here to see me?

I'm here to see Yiyeon.

Oh, she's in the dispensary.

Noh Chakhee. What are you doing here?

Hey.

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,164
Thank you.

thanks to you.

- No more stealing dough for me.
- Good for you.

Come visit.
I'll bake a lot of your favorite pastries.

Do you even know what my favorites are?

271
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,059
That girl is such a brat.

272
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,646
Hey, watch it. Don't you call her a brat.

273
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,481
Well, it's true.

274
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,109
I mean, she shouldn't
treat her dad that way.

275
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,696
She's done nothing wrong.
It's all my fault.

276
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,699
She has every right to treat me this way.

277
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,957
Yonggeun. How many times
are you going to do this?

Keep it up, and you'll
tear your lungs into shreds!

279
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,503
Go to a shelter, okay?

280
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,005
It gets really cold at night now.

281
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,008
I told you. Antibiotics are not a cure.

282
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,261
Jeez, okay. All right.

283
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:47,477
I'm telling you. This is the last time.
I won't care if you die out on the street.

Come on.

285
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,793
Did my dad send you? To watch me?

286
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,754
No.

287
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,382
I'm here to get an apology.

288
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,176
It's all because of you.

289
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,597
If it hadn't been for you,
I wouldn't be like this today.

290
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,515
It's all your fault!

291
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,854
Ah, that?

292
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,564
I apologize.

293
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,316
Satisfied?

294
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,737
Why is it my fault?

295
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,155
What did I ever do to you?

296
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,615
I already apologized.

297
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,034
I don't want to talk about it.

298
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,077
I'll pay the fine, so go.

299
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,166
No, not until you talk to me.
Why do you live like this?

300
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,501
Why did you drop out? You were doing fine.

301
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,212
Whether I was doing well at school

302
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,339
or wishing that I was dead
every single day.

303
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,549
How would you know?

304
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,176
I don't. I don't know.

305
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,762
You can't keep blaming me
for something I don't know about.

306
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,305
So tell me.

307
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,515
Then I'll decide whether
to understand or forgive you.

308
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,435
I told you.

309
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,145
I have nothing to say to you.

310
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,940
You know how much
my grandmother adored you.

311
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,610
But you didn't even come to her funeral.

312
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,782
After she died, you acted
like she never even existed.

313
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,910
How could you do that?

314
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:34,584
"How could I do that?" That's a question
you should ask someone else.

315
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,214
The person that you love so dearly.

316
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,864
Gosh. How can I help you?

317
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,243
Excuse me, sir.

318
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,499
Attorney Jwa Sibaek?

319
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,876
Here you go.

320
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,465
What a cozy little office.

321
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,594
Is that Ms. Noh's desk?

322
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,804
What's this regarding?

323
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,524
A policy adviser?

324
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:43,695
CEO Jang Gido of Jangsan is running
for the National Assembly in Jeongha.

325
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,614
He'd like to meet you.

326
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,706
There's no doubt that he'll become
Jeongha's assemblyman.

327
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,708
And once he does,

328
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:00,628
he will give you active support
for your pro bono work.

329
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:08,803
Please join his election campaign.

330
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:11,890
You can have any position you want.

331
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,027
My defendant will be here soon.

NEW POLITICS PARTY
OH DAEHYEON

333
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,322
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,158
Mr. Do.

335
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:38,375
I understand.

336
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,169
Third time's the charm.

337
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:46,383
I'll see you again.

338
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,379
I don't think it's going to be easy.

339
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:07,362
No? He wouldn't be appealing
if he agreed easily.

340
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,573
I'm going to visit a children's home
with my father soon.

341
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,993
Try and arrange a meeting
with Jwa Sibaek there.

342
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,828
Yes, sir.

343
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,500
And the person who tipped off Park
about the illegal funds...

344
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,585
was Haran.

345
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,840
I don't know how she got it, but she even
gave him the transaction records.

346
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,385
That's so like her.

347
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:34,681
I take my eyes off her for one second,
and she comes at me to bite off my finger.

348
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,144
I want you to keep an eye on her.
Find her weakness or whatever else.

349
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,855
Keep her on a tight leash
until the election is over.

350
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,356
If that doesn't work,

351
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,486
sleep with her for all I care.

352
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,367
God.

353
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,872
Sometimes, I can't tell
whether you're joking or not.

354
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,588
And about Yiyeon's assault,
there was another informant.

355
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,840
Find out who it is.

356
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,010
Yes, sir.

357
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,659
"How could I do that?" That's a question
you should ask someone else.

358
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,496
The person that you love so dearly.

TALK: NEW MESSAGE

361
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,502
Welcome
to our real-time livestream!

362
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,963
The murderer disguised as a lawyer.

363
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,925
Ladies and gentlemen.
I've finally caught Noh Chakhee.

364
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,887
- Who are you?
- Why did you kill Cho Hyunsik?

365
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,809
Cho Hyunsik. Why did you kill him?

366
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,976
I know you killed him.

367
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,064
Not so fast. We have a lot to talk about.

368
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,276
You slept with Hyunsik, didn't you?

369
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,071
You went to a hotel with him
that night too and killed him, right?

370
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,032
Talk to the camera.

371
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,909
Get her face.

372
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,249
- What the hell?
- Keep filming.

373
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,747
Pick it up.

374
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,884
If you have anything to say,
call that number.

375
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:52,920
Yes, sir.

376
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,506
- Get out of here.
- Let's go!

377
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,558
Are you okay?

378
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,149
You're not okay.

379
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,671
The man who spread false rumors
about you last time has been caught.

380
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,455
I reported his channel,
and it's been taken down,

381
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,129
but I guess you were doxxed
by another channel.

382
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,794
I'll find them all and have them deleted.

383
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,879
- So...
- Thank you.

384
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,968
I should get going.

385
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,832
Are you okay?

386
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,669
Yes.

387
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,464
Why are you always okay?

WHO'S HINDERING THE MURDER INVESTIGATION
OF THE KANGSUNG CEO?

390
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,860
JANG, THE LATE CHO AND YOON
CLOSELY BONDED, WITH KIM IN THE SHADOWS

391
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,968
Kim?

392
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,094
Who wrote this?

393
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,138
He's a dismissed reporter, Noh Yuchul.

394
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:09,974
He posts articles about Jangsan
every now and then.

395
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:12,997
Why is this my first time seeing one?

396
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,397
Because Jangsan's legal team
has new articles deleted right away.

397
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,816
That's why
they never have much influence.

398
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,401
Who is this Noh Yuchul?

399
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,863
He's Attorney Noh Chakhee's father.

400
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,955
Thank you. It looks delicious.

401

2 NEW MESSAGES

YOON DOCHANG
WIRE TRANSFER 100,000,000

403
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,894
Hey.

404
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,604
Yes? What is it?

405
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,818
YOON DOCHANG
WIRE TRANSFER 200,000,000

406
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,370
Ms. Noh Chakhee.

407
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,373
No. If it's about last night,
please don't say anything.

408
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,919
Yoon Dochang has paid
300 million won to his victims.

409
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,171
Really?

410
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,425
Yes. I just heard the news from
Junwoo's mother and Ms. Kim, the caddie.

411
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,763
I guess he was afraid of going to prison
even after what he did. That bastard.

412
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,974
Now, shall we begin?

413
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,308
Shall we?

414
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,357
Is this the police?

415
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,068
Yes, I want to report someone
who lured and kidnapped a minor.

416
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,369
Nice shot! What did I tell you, Moron?

417
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:56,122
This is why you
never win, idiot. Give it here.

418
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,999
Hey.

419
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,293
I'll give you the money.

420
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,376
But seriously, man.

421
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,131
Your father died at a golf resort,
and you still want to play golf for money?

422
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,508
Cut the crap and just give me the money.

423
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,260
You have a big mouth for a loser.

424
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,928
Mr. Yoon Dochang.

425
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,267
What?

426
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,436
Damn it, let go of me!

427
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,646
No, I already paid them
the settlement money!

428
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,106
What are you arresting me for?

429
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:24,734
Let go of me! Damn it!

430
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,818
Man!

431
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,738
Mr. Yoon Dochang
has requested a lawyer.

432

JANGSAN LAW FIRM
CEO JANG GIDO

433
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,491
- For what?
- He's being questioned

434
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,035
for luring and kidnapping a minor.

435
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,286
What should we do?

436
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,788
Ignore him.

437
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,373
Yes, sir.

438
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:45,046
About that online channel.

439
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:49,592
The one that spread rumors
about Attorney Noh.

440
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,303
Why was it taken down?

441
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:55,056
Someone reported the channel.

442
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,350
What about the ones that doxxed her?

443
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,684
It's being handled.

444
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,896
You may go.

Yes, sir?

449
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>You didn't think
to tell me about this situation?</i>

450
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,856
What are you...

451
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,818
I'm talking about the unpleasant rumors
about you and Mr. Cho.

452
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,445
I'm sorry.

453
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,239
I informed the firm's legal team.

454
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,908
Just know that they're taking care of it.

455
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,660
Okay.

456
00:33:57,743 --> 00:34:00,746
<i>I'm going to visit a children's home
with my father this weekend.</i>

457
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,500
I'd like to meet Jwa Sibaek there.

458
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:10,339
I see. All right.

459
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,143
Ow!

460
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,065
Who the hell are you?

461
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,151
Where am I?

462
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,447
What the hell were you doing to me?

463
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,615
Sir.

464
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,036
Please come to your senses.

465
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,205
I asked, who the hell are you?

466
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,332
It's me.

467
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,376
I'm your friend.

468
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:59,096
If I hadn't been there for you,
you would've frozen to death on the street

469
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,890
or starved to death.

470
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:08,397
Think carefully
about what I have done for you.

471
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,583
Drink up.

472
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,555
You're in agony, right?

473
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,643
You don't know why,

474
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,146
but you're uncontrollably angry, right?

475
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,984
But...

476
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:58,948
I'm not the one you should be angry at.

477
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,201
I'm sorry, sir.

478
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,495
I did it again.

479
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:05,913
It's okay.

480
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,253
Do what you want.

481
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,297
What...

482
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,466
"What I want"?

483
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,471
Lee Dongpil.

484
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:31,689
Lee Dongpil did this to you.
You have to find him and get your revenge.

485
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,779
I'll help you.

486
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,795
Are you sure you want to come?
I can pick up the kids' stuff by myself.

487
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:59,049
I told you. I do feel bad
about the director's death,

488
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,052
but I didn't like him enough
to cry about it.

489
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,724
I'm going to take the kids
to see Ms. Lee Soonyoung next week.

490
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,975
You should come with us.

491
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:08,934
No thanks.

492
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,729
I'll see Soonyoung after I win my case
and she gets released.

493
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,441
Ms. Lee talks a lot about you.

494
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,735
That girl.

495
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,863
I've told her repeatedly that she
should pretend like she doesn't know me.

496
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,242
You should come.

497
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:28,579
Didn't you see those gossip videos?

498
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:30,539
What do you think they'll say
if I go with you?

499
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,001
"Why did Lee Soonyoung's lawyer visit her
after encouraging her to commit suicide?"

500
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,294
Good lord.

501
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:37,254
If that kind of fake news
starts spreading,

502
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,881
it won't be good for my case.

503
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,800
I don't want any more
ridiculous headlines until I win.

504
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,890
Ms. Noh, do you know
that you're a very funny person?

505
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,895
So are you.

506
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,527
No, I'm not.

507
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,947
You are too.

508
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,242
HAESONG CHILDREN'S HOME

509
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,716
It looks like
they're filming something today.

510
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,044
It does.

511
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,674
Is that why you're decked out
in designer clothes today?

512
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,384
No, no, no, no.

513
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,718
Chakhee.

514
00:38:25,552 --> 00:38:26,553
Grandpa!

515
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,597
Grandpa.

516
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,934
You're here.

517
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,729
You haven't been here
in a while, have you?

518
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,106
- Right.
- Yes.

519
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:44,571
By the way,
who is this handsome young man?

520
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,241
Ah, I work with him in the same office.

521
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,118
Oh...

522
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,788
<i>Wow!</i>

523
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:55,416
What a nice car.

524
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,171
Who are you?

525
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,552
Here.

526
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,772
But who are you?

527
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,066
Me?

528
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,485
I'm your dad's friend.

529
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,654
Mr. Kim.

530
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,829
I'm Jwa Sibaek.

531
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:37,166
You are?

532
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:43,088
Please look after my dear Chakhee.

533
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,176
She hasn't been
a public defender for that long.

534
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,804
I'm sure she still has a lot to learn,
and she probably makes mistakes.

535
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:55,684
But please, don't be too hard on her.

536
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,936
Sure. I'll do that.

537
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:04,693
Now, shall we go inside and see Gido?

538
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,861
- Shall we?
- Yes.

539
00:40:05,944 --> 00:40:07,780
Let's head inside.

540
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,115
In a minute. I just...

541
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,408
I'll see you later, then.

542
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,005
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

543
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,800
Did you know?

544
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:12,219
What?

545
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,513
The fact that Jang Byungchun
and Jang Gido were coming.

546
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,349
Did you know?

547
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,146
Yes.

548
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,152
How long do you plan
on playing Jangsan's lapdog?

549
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,533
Attorney Jwa Sibaek.

550
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,459
I'm glad you're here.

551
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,294
I should thank Chakhee.

552
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:53,343
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Jang Gido.

553
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,895
Right.

554
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:15,866
I'd like to talk to you
about something if that's okay.

555
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,994
All right.

556
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,544
Pass me the ball next time.

557
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:34,801
I can imagine what you
must think about me and Jangsan.

558
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,679
Among the lawsuits
that the firm has handled,

559
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,850
if you look at the ones
that were promoted on the news,

560
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,061
it looks like we're extremely
in favor of corporations

561
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,480
and we'll do whatever we can for money.

562
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,774
Isn't that true?

563
00:42:53,111 --> 00:42:54,780
I'm not going to deny it.

564
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,533
But now that I'm running
for the National Assembly,

565
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,493
that's going to change.

566
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,454
Jangsan will have an ESG sector,

567
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:06,250
and we will pursue public interests
much more than we currently do.

568
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,837
Because that will help you
win the election?

569
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,090
That's right.

570
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,842
If you join me by my side, Mr. Jwa,

571
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:20,180
I'll give you as much support
as you need in your pro bono work.

572
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,684
All you need to do is use me.

573
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,814
Why me?

574
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:33,026
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

575
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,697
Before I became
a senior partner at Jangsan.

576
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,450
I was a much more idealistic
and innocent lawyer.

577
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:44,788
You're telling me there was a time
when you were like that?

578
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,415
Yes.

579
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:49,084
There was.

580
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,589
I want your hands
off the Kangsung Pharm case

581
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,133
and the files about
the pills' side effects.

582
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,219
If you do that, I'll think about it.

583
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,314
I can do that.

584
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:13,859
Is there anything else you want?

585
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,196
How about a free legal aid center
with about five billion won?

586
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,282
Okay.

587
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,785
If I win the election...

588
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:26,955
I will.

589
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:54,816
I crossed the line before.

590
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,260
I didn't have to say it like that.

591
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,486
I'm sorry.

592
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,447
No, it's my fault. I should've told you.

593
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,784
I'm sorry.

594
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,369
Chakhee.

595
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,871
The pastries are ready.

596
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,040
Shall we go have a taste?

597
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,419
Why don't you join us, Mr. Jwa?

598
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,171
No. He...

599
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:17,254
I will.

600
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,063
Here.

601
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,737
You know Dukman, right?

602
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:47,202
He's learning how to bake.
So he visits here every weekend

603
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:49,329
to make bread for the children.

604
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,790
You've become a human being.

605
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,293
What, was I an alien before?

606
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,878
It's a compliment.

607
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,812
Well, it certainly didn't seem like one.

608
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,766
Here, try this.

609
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,435
Thank you.

610
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,524
That watch.

611
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,738
It's a valuable watch.

612
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:27,200
Grandpa. You're actually wearing
the same watch.

613
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,038
What does your father do?

614
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,625
He was a shoe factory manager.

615
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:37,919
Really?

616
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,466
There must be a patriot in your family.

617
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:45,427
That watch is for patriots?

618
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:51,099
Yes. It's given to patriots by the state
in recognition of their contribution.

619
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,144
Listen, Mr. Jwa.

620
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,189
Do you know how to play Go?

621
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,191
Yes, I know the rules.

622
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,486
In that case, you should come
to my house sometime.

623
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,363
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

624
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:09,701
Play a game of Go with this old man.

625
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,704
Of course, it would be my pleasure.

626
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,717
BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

627
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:30,514
Sir.

628
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,059
Please don't lose
the phone number I gave you.

629
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,230
Call me at that number anytime,
and I'll come for you.

630
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,441
Okay, thank you.

631
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,822
BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

632
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,669
Who was that?

633
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,927
He comes to help me
with work sometimes in the evenings.

634
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,014
What are you doing here so late?

635
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:15,600
I'm hungry.

636
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,190
- How's the restaurant doing these days?
- The restaurant?

637
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,025
I make enough to feed myself.

638
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:26,862
It was closed
when I came by the other day.

639
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:30,907
Was it?

640
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:35,829
What's going on? Why did you close it?
You don't want to make money?

641
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,209
I sometimes go
to the doctor's office or the bank.

642
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:43,962
Maybe that's why.

643
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,431
Jang Gido of Jangsan.

644
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,226
He's running for the National Assembly.

645
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:02,272
Is he?

646
00:49:03,064 --> 00:49:04,232
He asked me...

647
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,069
to help him with his campaign.

648
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,489
I'm going to do it.

649
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:16,620
And I'm also going to be
seeing Chairman Jang Byungchun.

650
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,332
So...

651
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,004
you should just focus on the restaurant.

652
00:49:39,517 --> 00:49:40,602
It's good.

to get yourself a position in his party?

713
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,991
I just showed my support
when he announced his campaign

714
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:23,950

715

the rent and keep you in shape, Mr. Do?

My God, Mr. Do. Don't let him fool you.

I'm not sure.

732
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,627
At the hospital, you said
you needed me as a testifier.

733
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,630
And today, you arrested me
as a prime suspect in a murder case.

734
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:03,800
Did you find evidence
that I'm the murderer in the meantime?

735
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,098
Yes. Let's see. Where should we begin?

736
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,770
This footage is from one month
before Cho Hyunsik was murdered.

737
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:18,731
This car that's following Cho's car
for over 30 minutes.

738
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,733
It's your car, right?

739
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:25,780
- Were you tailing Cho Hyunsik?
- Yes.

740
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,157
To win the trial.

741
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,867
You know as well as I do

742
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,071
that he had his fair share
of skeletons in his closet.

743
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,998
I knew that following him was illegal,

744
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:38,167
but I did it to stop him
from selling EveSense.

745
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,313
Those pills have serious side effects.

746
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,674
So you're saying you followed
Kangsung Pharmaceuticals' CEO

747
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:48,303
- because of your lawsuit against them?
- Yes.

748
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,724
You almost assaulted Cho Hyunsik
two days before he was murdered.

749
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,560
No, I wasn't trying to assault him.
I was trying to rescue someone.

750
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:57,603
When I was leaving work,

751
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,690
I saw Ms. Noh Chakhee
get into Cho Hyunsik's car.

752
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:05,653
I had seen him hit her before,
so I was watching them closely.

753
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,280
And while I was following them,

754
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,700
Ms. Noh seemed to be in danger
just as I expected, so I stopped his car.

755
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:15,079
I pulled Cho Hyunsik out,
but I didn't assault him.

756
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,999
So it was a coincidence?

757
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,959
Yes.

758
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,342
What's your relationship
with Yoon Dochang?

759
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,802
He was the opposing plaintiff
for a case that I handled.

760
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,513
And you offered to take
the case first, didn't you?

761
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,935
Did you know that Yoon Dochang was
the son of the murdered Yoon Seokgu?

762
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,146
I did offer to take the case,

763
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,815
but I didn't know that his father
was Yoon Seokgu.

764
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,028
Then why did you make the offer?

765
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,076
I get hearing-impaired people
in my office from time to time.

766
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:58,581
I joined a club to learn sign language,
and that's where I met Mr. Park Junwoo.

767
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,584
When he told me about
his mother's situation, I felt bad.

768
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:02,919
Yes.

769
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,963
So I offered to take her case for free.
Because that's my job.

770
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,093
Why did you assault Yoon Dochang?

771
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,761
Because he deserved it.

772
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,098
- Sorry?
- Yoon Dochang

773
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,101
used the lawsuit as an excuse

774
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,437
to lure and kidnap Junwoo who is a minor.

775
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,149
I saw it with my own eyes and tried
to get him out in a hurry, and...

776
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,235
Sure.

777
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,778
I ended up throwing a few punches.

778
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,075
If it was for a reason like that,

779
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:38,079
- shouldn't you have reported him?
- Yes, I did.

780
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:39,414
So this was a coincidence too.

781
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,708
The plaintiff of the case
that you coincidentally offered to take

782
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,128
just happened to be the son
of the murder victim.

783
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,713
Yes.

784
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,925
Right.

785
00:57:51,008 --> 00:57:52,260
Okay.

786
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:56,973
Let's see how long this
"coincidence" would last.

789
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,113
About Jwa Sibaek.

790
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:14,699
Yes, we're getting very good responses.

791
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,982
He's been arrested on suspicion
of Yoon Seokgu's murder.

792
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,124
How did that happen?

793
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,919
His DNA was found at the murder scene.

794
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,383
That must've been Yoo Kyungjin's work.

795
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,719
Find out which prosecutor is on the case.

796
00:58:35,636 --> 00:58:37,013
Okay.

RELIABLE POLICE OF THE CITIZENS

799
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,531
Where's Detective Yoo?

800
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,326
What do you need her for? It's all over.

801
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,203
Jwa Sibaek is the undeniable culprit.

802
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,164
He was with me, the night
when Yoon Seokgu was murdered.

803
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:05,416
You've just arrested someone
with an alibi!

804
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,086
Attorney Noh.

805
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,715
Jwa's DNA was found
at the scene of Yoon Seokgu's murder.

806
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,343
I'm 100% sure we'll get a warrant.

807
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,346
So you can visit him in prison.

808
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,972
Uh...

809
00:59:32,693 --> 00:59:35,571
These are my credit card statements
from the day before Yoon's murder.

810
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,782
At 00:34, pork rind restaurant.

811
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,742
At 1:48, karaoke bar.

812
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,244
At 2:23, taxi.

813
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:44,205
When we got home,
we went to Mr. Jwa's place.

814
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:47,917
We had a few more drinks,
and I fell asleep around 3:30.

815
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,503
Then I woke up around 6:50.

816
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,548
Mr. Jwa was definitely with me
in his apartment at 7:00.

817
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,801
We had breakfast,
and I went back to my place around 8:10.

818
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:00,388
It's three hours to go to Yoon's resort
and return to Mr. Jwa's apartment.

819
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,557
And that's if you drive
as fast as possible.

820
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,059
You think he murdered Yoon
and came back within 20 minutes?

821
01:00:05,726 --> 01:00:06,978
That's physically impossible.

822
01:00:07,853 --> 01:00:08,854
Yes, all right.

823
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:15,111
Until 2:23 here on these records,
I'll believe that you were with him.

824
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:19,949
But how can I believe
that you were with him afterward?

825
01:00:21,158 --> 01:00:24,245
Ms. Noh, you've already lied to me once.

826
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:29,959
And those times that you remember.
Don't you think they're too exact?

827
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,169
I'm a lawyer.

828
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,214
When I was at Jangsan,
I divided my time by six minutes.

829
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,550
It's my habit to check the time.

830
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,636
If you don't believe me,
why don't we bring in a lie detector?

831
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,929
I'd have no problem with that.

832
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:45,600
Mr. Jwa Sibaek's DNA was found
at the scene of Yoon Seokgu's murder.

833
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:46,683
Perhaps...

834
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:51,439
the one who killed CEO Cho Hyunsik
and tried to kill Chief Jeon Jaeho

835
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,190
was also Mr. Jwa.

836
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,901
Before
the victims were murdered,

837
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,654
they all had some kind
of trouble with Mr. Jwa.

838
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,657
Who knows?
Maybe that's his pattern of murder.

839
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,243
I thought you were different,
Detective Yoo.

840
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,330
But maybe you should write novels instead,
just like Detective Jung.

841
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,874
Does DNA take priority over alibis?

842
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,253
If you're planning on omitting
my alibi to get a warrant,

843
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,963
you'd better prepare yourself.

844
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,342
God, I really don't understand.

845
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,345
Why are you doing all this?

846
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,937
SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

847
01:01:34,815 --> 01:01:37,401
Sir, I have something
to talk to you about.

848
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,906
SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

849
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,622
Damn it.

850
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:03,678
On the 2nd day
of the month, from 17:35 to 18:10,

851
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:07,390
you followed Police Chief Jeon Jaeho's car
and threatened him, right?

852
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,018
Who? Police Chief Jeon Jaeho?

853
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,021
You followed him down the road
to Ganghwa and threatened him.

854
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,316
It was all recorded on his dashcam.

855
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,569
That was Chief Jeon?

856
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,447
You're saying you didn't know?

857
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:25,658
Correct.

858
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:33,040
Then why did you follow his car
and threaten him?

859
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:38,003
I was prepared for a fine
or penalty points for menacing driving.

860
01:02:39,004 --> 01:02:42,216
- So you did it knowing you'd get caught?
- Yes.

861
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,511
- Why?
- That imported car.

862
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:50,808
Chief Jeon Jaeho's car was threatening
a small car with a baby on board.

863
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:53,269
Both the driver
and the baby seemed very startled.

864
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:56,564
I got angry and followed him
to yell at him.

865
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,274
To warn him not to not drive like that.

866
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,820
You're unbelievable, aren't you?

867
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,574
Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

868
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,285
So you're saying
that was a coincidence too?

869
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,454
Yes, I'm afraid so.

870
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:14,874
I threatened him just as much
as he threatened that small car,

871
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,085
glared at him, and went on my way.

872
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,755
If you checked
his dashcam footage, you'd know.

873
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,428
We found packaging tape at the scene
of Yoon Seokgu's murder.

874
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:29,722
And on it we found three different DNAs.

875
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,640
One was Yoon Seokgu's.

876
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,226
One was yours.

877
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,897
And the other one
has yet to be identified.

878
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:42,401
Now, why did you kill Yoon Seokgu?

879
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,530
I didn't kill him.

880
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:50,284
I was probably at home
with Ms. Noh Chakhee at that time.

881
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:55,915
If so, how can you explain your DNA
that was found at the murder scene?

882
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,044
Isn't it your job to figure that out?

883
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,256
I'm sure there were countless DNA samples
at the scene, not just mine.

884
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,342
But only mine was singled out. Why?

885
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:12,306
Because you illegally collected
my DNA sample without a warrant.

886
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,267
Do you think my DNA
being found at the scene

887
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,269
proves that I killed Yoon Seokgu?

888
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,604
Why would I do that?

889
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,398
Detective Yoo.
Why would I kill Yoon Seokgu?

890
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,609
Is there a motive for this murder?

891
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,028
I don't have a motive,
but I do have an alibi.

892
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,783
You found my DNA among numerous others
at the murder scene.

893
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:33,619
Are you accusing me
of murdering Yoon Seokgu based on that?

894
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:38,082
Does DNA take priority
over alibis, Detective Yoo?

895
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:48,467
You bastard. You think you're so smart.

896
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,886
Your DNA was found at the scene.

897
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,596
- That means it's over.
- Get in here!

898
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,056
- Sir!
- Come on.

899
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:55,325
- Please stop.
- Don't do this.

900
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,350
Back off!

901
01:04:56,433 --> 01:04:57,726
We'll get a warrant for sure.

902
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,729
You attacked the chief, didn't you?
Spit it out, you bastard!

903
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,481
- Get him out of here.
- Sir!

904
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,819
The request for a warrant...

905
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,656
was rejected.

906
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,034
Damn it. Why?

907
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:15,744
I'm not sure.

908
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:18,163
God damn it!

909
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,876
Seriously?

910
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,753
Damn it!

911
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,645
RELIABLE POLICE OF THE CITIZENS

912
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:06,503
Let's go.

913
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,176
SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

914
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:22,811
Let's go.

915
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,772
I'm only going to ask you this one time.

916
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,902
Cho Hyunsik, Yoon Seokgu, Park Kangil.

917
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,282
Did you kill them all?

918
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,551
Yes.
