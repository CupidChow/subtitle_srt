EPISODE 9

3
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,137
Let's go.

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,306
I'm only going to ask you this one time.

5
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,145
Cho Hyunsik, Yoon Seokgu, Park Kangil.

6
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,274
Did you kill them all?

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,071
BASED ON THE ESSAY
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT BY JUNG HYEJIN

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,783
Yes.

9
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,960
Did you just say, "Yes?"

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,424
SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

11
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,219
Just kidding.

12
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,432
If I said yes,
were you going to believe me?

13
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,184
Good grief.

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,519
Why wouldn't I believe you?

15
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,436
What?

16
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,108
I never knew that you
thought of me as a serial killer.

17
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,736
Why did you threaten
Chief Jeon Jaeho with your car?

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,739
Gosh. I just saw the imported car
threatening a small car,

19
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,659
so I was just bringing justice. Okay?

20
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,702
People like that recognize
the error of their ways

21
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,371
when they're put in other people's shoes.

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,707
And I had no idea Chief Jeon Jaeho
was the owner of that car.

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,920
Then why was your DNA found
at Yoon Seokgu's murder scene?

24
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,421
I'd like to know that myself.

25
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,091
Man, why was my DNA found there?

26
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,343
Do I have a twin brother
I don't know about?

27
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,220
Are you kidding me right now?

28
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,180
What?

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,766
The police just said
I'm not the culprit and let me go.

30
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,102
Ms. Noh Chakhee,
you seem quite disappointed.

31
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,353
Yeah, tell me about it.

32
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,480
You should've been arrested
and sent to prison

33
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,649
where you'd only get
to eat rice with beans.

34
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,943
Beans are expensive,
so they don't serve that anymore.

35
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,153
-What the...
-What the...

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,114
That's right. While we're at it,
I was just released.

37
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,075
Where is it?
Didn't you bring some tofu for me?

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,618
Hey, what's with you?

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,997
This won't do. Then at least treat me
to soybean stew instead.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,832
-Me? Treat you?
-Well, I can't pay.

41
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,458
I don't have any money on me.

42
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,002
I appreciate your offer. Let's go.

43
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,671
What the heck? What's wrong with...

44
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,464
Hurry up.

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,510
For goodness' sake!

46
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,231
What's this?

47
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,693
What you'll wear today
at my campaign announcement.

48
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,487
So what is the meaning of this?

49
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,781
You'll be the wife
of an assemblyman from now on.

50
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,118
Stop wearing brand-name clothes
just so you can show off.

51
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,120
I downgraded the brands.

52
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,247
Have you gone insane?

53
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,461
You have no idea how crazy I can be.

54
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,175
Haran.

55
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,970
You're pretty,
so you look good in anything.

56
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,390
So I'd like you to wear this.

57
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,618
Why aren't you eating?

58
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,665
How can I eat anything
when I'm sitting with a serial killer?

59
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,708
Oh, no. Too bad.

60
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,336
In that case, may I have your <i>sundae?</i>

61
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,214
How dare you?

62
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,100
Hello?

63
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,274
Yes, I understand.

64
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,489
Mr. Jang's campaign announcement
is at ten o'clock.

65
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,824
He wants me to come with you.

66
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,622
Me?

67
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,165
Why should I go?

68
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,126
Was I the one who joined
his election campaign?

69
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,212
Ambitious geezer here was the one
who went crazy for power and signed up.

70
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,049
I already got Kangsung Pharm's files,
so I don't think I have to go.

71
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,884
Listen here.

72
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,929
I'm the one who shouldn't be there.

73
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,597
Thanks to you committing serial murder,

74
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,142
I had to stay up all night
at the lounge of the police station.

75
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,103
I printed out my credit card statements,
looked for a prosecutor,

76
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,023
and now, I have to drag you
to the campaign announcement!

77
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,649
Why?

78
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,067
What do you mean, why?

79
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,320
Why did you stay up all night
at the police station?

80
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,322
Why did you look for a prosecutor,

81
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,907
and why did you print out
your credit card statements?

82
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,617
Well, it's because...

83
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,910
Because...

84
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,082
you do not believe that I'm the killer.

85
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,835
See? I didn't do it.

86
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,135
It's good.

87
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,386
Unbelievable.

88
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,767
TRADITIONAL SUNDAE SOUP

89
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,645
I'll be going now.

90
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,855
You're doing what?

91
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,357
I have to be somewhere.

92
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,401
What? You have to go
to the campaign announcement.

93
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,403
You really have to go.

94
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,991
Yes, sure. Thanks for the food.

95
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,410
I'll be dead meat if you don't.
You better answer your phone.

96
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,411
Sure.

97
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,412
You better answer.

98
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,330
Okay.

99
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,712
1 HIT REFRESH WITH JANG GIDO

100
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,134
We have 15 minutes left
until the announcement,

101
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,720
and we have zero members
of the press here.

102
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,640
I think we lost them to Kwon Youngho.

MAY 16, MONDAY

104

Even a kindergarten talent show
would have a bigger audience.

105
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,955
Where are you going?
I'm about to announce my campaign.

106
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,666
Do I have to play house
when there isn't a single reporter here?

107
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,501
To avoid embarrassment,

108
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,504
you should've at least bribed
some reporters and had them come.

109
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,325
-The door is open. Let's go.
-Let's go.

110
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,618
Hey, hurry up. We're moving.

111
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,370
Finally, it's about time. Let's go in.

BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:18,080
Dear citizens of Jeongha
and members of the press.

118
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,627
You're standing here today
in a closed factory.

119
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,630
This place reminds me

120
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,634
of the factory where I took part
in the labor movement 30 years ago.

121
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,846
I didn't want to forget my resolve
from my college days at that textile mill

122
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,972
when I dreamed of a world

123
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,433
where people who earn their bread
by the sweat of their brow

124
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,726
are treated with respect.

125
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,647
To fulfill my promise
and the resolve of those days,

126
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,940
I decided to announce

127
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,861
my campaign for the National Assembly
right here in this place.

128
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,558
Goodness.

129
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,311
What brings you here, Mr. Jwa?

130
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,064
I heard Gido is announcing
his campaign now.

131
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
I came to play a game of Go.

132
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,821
This old man has lots of guests today.

133
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,342
My wife always puts our family...

134
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,804
<i>- The number you have dialed...</i>
- You still can't reach Mr. Jwa?

135
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,057
I got him out of jail so he could come.

136
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,434
Where did he run off to?

137
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,733

you have dialed cannot be reached...</i>

Is that how it goes?

142
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,552
My goodness...

143
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,391
How come I didn't see that?

144
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,102
You sometimes miss things
that are right in front of you.

145
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,479
You're right.

146
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,397
Right.

147
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,402
Mr. Jwa, you're also someone
who's difficult to see through.

148
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,574
I have a knack
for discerning people's character.

149
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:03,454
But, Mr. Jwa, you don't
seem to be black or white.

150
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,289
I'm not sure what you are.

151
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:10,252
Your eyes say you're white,
but when you smile, you're black.

152
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:16,592
I'm not sure if others fall
for your smile, Mr. Jwa.

153
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,887
But I can see it.

154
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,308
Your smile is fake.

155
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,854
Yes.

156
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,232
That's the smile I'm talking about.

157
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,194
Now, Mr. Jwa.

158
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,366
Would you be so kind
as to take back a move for me?

159
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,660
A move like that, Mr. Jwa,

160
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,746
would make you white again.

161
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,502
If I take back a move,
do you think you'll be able to beat me?

162
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,672
I'm not sure.

163
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,592
I think whether or not I win
is in your hands.

164
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,637
Will you kill me or let me live?

165
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,099
What should I do?

166
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,770
Should I kill you or let you live?

167
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,858
What would you gain
from killing an old man like me?

168
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:21,323
Won't you take a move back
and let me live?

169
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,045
Okay. I'll take back a move.

170
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,219
Goodness, thank you.

171
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,847
Now that you've taken a move back,
why don't we take a short break?

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,142
Have some of this.

173
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,396
This mung bean
pancake is delicious.

174
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,237
Mr. Shin.

175
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,364
You should stop cleaning up and join us.

176
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,408
Yes, sir.

177
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,493
I'm almost done.

178
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,631
Why don't I formally introduce you two?

179
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,594
This is a sponsor
of our children's home.

180
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,388
He's such a great cook,

181
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,351
so he visits me from time to time
to make mung bean pancakes,

182
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,938
cabbage pancakes, and even dumplings.

183
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,481
He's the owner of a dumpling place.

184
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,651
A sponsor of the children's home?

185
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,361
Nice to meet you.

186
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,780
My name is Shin Chisik.

187
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,369
And this is someone who's helping
my son with his election.

188
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,622
He also stopped by to play a game of Go

189
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,624
to make sure this old man
doesn't get bored.

190
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,044
My name is Jwa Sibaek.

191
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:39,587
If you kill me like this,
that will make you a murderer.

192
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,091
You'll be sentenced to death,
and you will die as well.

193
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,093
BUTLER KIM

194
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,346
<i>Mr. Jang...</i>

195
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,430
Yes?

196
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,184
<i>I think
the chairman has passed away.</i>

197
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,688
What?

198
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,943
<i>He was murdered
in the basement...</i>

199
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,300
Where's my father?

200
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,897
Turn on the lights.

201
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,175
Is this the police station?

202
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,928
A person has died...

203
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,349
Are you crazy?

204
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,729
We'll report this later.

205
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,899
We can't leave him like that.

206
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
What?

207
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,821
Go.

208
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,493
And get some clean pajamas for him.

209
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:22,458
And get some dry towels
and other things to wipe his body.

210
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,590
Can we do that?

211
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,598
We can.

212
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,988
I was almost there.

213
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,329
It was right around the corner.

214
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,922
Dr. Yoon.

215
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,428
I need you to come
to my father's vacation home right now.

216
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,141
My father has passed away.

217
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,897
I'll explain in more detail
when you get here.

218
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,192
Come right now.

219
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,280
Mr. Kim, you called
the police earlier, right?

220
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,367
I turned off your phone,

221
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,452
so they'll investigate
by tracking your cell phone.

222
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,580
They'll locate the vacation home soon
and come here.

223
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:36,086
When the police get here,
tell them the facts as you saw.

224
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,135
"The facts"?

225
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
Yes.

226
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,059
What did you see?

227
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,062
I...

228
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,525
came over to lay out
the bedding for the chairman.

229
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:04,573
But the chairman wasn't
in the bedroom or the living room.

230
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,869
So I looked for him around the house.

231
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,581
I thought it was odd
that the basement door was open.

232
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,459
So I went down there.

233
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,341
And I found the chairman in that state...

234
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,427
No, tell them what you saw,
just the facts.

235
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,391
-Sorry?
-That's not what you saw, Mr. Kim!

236
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,150
You came to tend to my father,

237
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,445
and you saw that he
had passed away in his bedroom.

238
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,074
You were shocked, so you called me first.

239
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,078
When I arrived,
you called the police to make a report.

240
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,915
Then your battery died,
so your phone cut off.

241
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,507
That's what you saw, Mr. Kim,
and those are the facts.

242
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,636
Isn't that so?

243
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,897
Police!

244
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,531
I'm Choi Taesik
from the Jeongha Police Station.

245
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,866
You reported that someone died, right?

246
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,120
Yes.

247
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,374
My father has passed away.

248
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,054
Excuse me.

249
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,724
- You were the first one to find him?
- Pardon?

250
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
Yes.

251
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,812
I found him in the base...

252
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:46,610
I mean, I found him in his bedroom
and made a report in a state of shock.

253
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,531
Then my phone battery died.

254
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,422
My father's doctor will come soon
and diagnose his death.

255
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,674
His doctor?

256
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,060
Put up a police line in front
of the bedroom and call the NFS.

257
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,019
Yes, sir.

258
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,150
Let's leave.
This is a scene of an incident.

259
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,823
UNDER INVESTIGATION

260
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,953
Dr. Yoon, you're here.

261
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,165
He's my father's doctor.

262
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,796
Why does he have his own doctor?

263
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,717
We notified the police
that it was a false alarm,

264
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,970
and his doctor is here now,
so you can stop now.

265
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,190
If I had known who you were beforehand,
I wouldn't have made such a mistake.

266
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,109
I apologize.

267
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,070
May your father rest in peace.

268
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,875
Man...

269
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,794
-Here?
-No, I'm good.

270
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,257
The warrant request was rejected
because of Jang Gido.

271
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,302
He's running for
the National Assembly in Jeongha.

272
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,930
He recruited Jwa Sibaek
for his campaign.

273
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,849
And his approval rating is high.

274
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,977
Everyone says he's going to be elected.

275
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,856
So if Jwa Sibaek
were to be labeled a serial killer,

276
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,900
it would get troublesome for Jang Gido.

277
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,407
Why are you looking at me like that?

278
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,451
It's not like I only sit around
and make stuff up.

279
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:05,373
The day before Chief Jeon was attacked,
he gave me orders to tail Jang Gido.

280
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,418
He said Jang Gido is someone
who'd be capable of killing

281
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,254
Cho Hyunsik or Yoon Seokgu
in order to become an assemblyman.

282
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,590
What do you think, Detective Jung?

283
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,259
Do you think Jang Gido
went around killing people?

284
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,639
I'm sure a high and mighty man like him
wouldn't have gotten blood on his hands.

285
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,140
He put someone up to it.

286
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,810
Someone who was well-acquainted
with the victims.

287
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,523
Someone who can torture people efficiently
and leave no trace.

288
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,818
Who could that be?

289
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,785
Lee Dongpil is...

290
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,828
Sir.

291
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,164
Sir, what did you say?

292
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,125
Lee Dongpil is...

293
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,210
Yes?

294
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,965
Lee Dongpil is...

295
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,928
alive.

296
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,681
"Lee Dongpil is alive"?

297
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,477
I confirmed his death
to be of natural causes.

298
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,730
An ambulance will come in about two hours.

299
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,569
Thank you.

300
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,156
I owe you one, Dr. Yoon.

301
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,594
Mr. Kim.

302
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,432
What was your daughter's name again?

303
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,728
It's Ayoung.

304
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,104
I see.

305
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,732
She's about to graduate, right?

306
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,483
Has she found a job?

307
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,695
No, not yet.

308
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,698
Is that so?

309
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,577
Then have her send her resume to Jangsan.

310
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,747
Why didn't you ask me before?
We're like family.

311
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,333
Thank you.

312
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,335
I'm a little tired.

313
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,298
Please wake me when the ambulance comes.

314
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,799
Yes, sir.

315
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,010
I'll prepare the guest room.

316
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,595
No.

317
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,016
I'll stay in my father's room.

318
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,561
What?

319
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,296
Goodbye.

320
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,633
Father.

321
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,168
ATTORNEY JWA SIBAEK
WHERE ARE YOU? WHY AREN'T YOU PICKING UP!

322
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,978
Man.

323
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,284
Mr. Jwa.

324
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,037
What's going on? Why couldn't I reach you?

325
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,873
Why was your phone off?

326
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,666
I mean, I was really...

327
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,465
Is something wrong?

328
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,969
Ms. Noh.

329
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,225
Let's do this another time.

330
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,728
Another time.

331
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,031
But...

332
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,373
Now you're blatantly
staying out overnight?

333
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,584
Fine.

334
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,670
I accept that
you'll become an assemblyman.

335
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,423
If I continue to play the enemy,
you'll shoot me down

336
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,884
and remove me from my position
as executive director of Yulhu.

337
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,886
I accept all that.

338
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,723
However, if you start
treating me like a war trophy...

339
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,350
I was out at the vacation home.

340
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,561
My father passed away.

341
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,247
Are you all right?

342
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,587
I can't believe you're worried about me.

343
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,261
His funeral will begin right away,
so get ready for that.

344
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,139
And call Daehyeon to come home.

345
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,560
I need to get some sleep.

346
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,582
I was going to visit you at home...

347
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,126
Why? Because you feel bad?

348
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,087
Were you going to come
with a box of drinks or something?

349
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,299
It says Jeon Jaeho is in the hospital now.
That's why you wanted to see me.

350
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,095
Yes, I was going to tell you that.
Please sit.

351
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:38,099
I had forgotten everything,
but you made me remember!

352
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,936
I wasn't living a fantastic life,
but I had forgotten everything!

353
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,023
You came and dug it all back up!

354
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,859
And now you're going to tell me
to give up on the retrial?

355
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,780
Please calm down and have a seat.

356
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,293
At first, I didn't believe what you said.

357
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:10,048
You did me wrong in the past,
so I thought it was all just empty words.

358
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,344
But, Ms. Noh, you believed me.

359
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,014
My lawyer
before you said I was insane.

360
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:22,977
But you believed that there
actually was a chip in my wrist.

361
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,605
So I wanted to believe what you said.

362
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,981
But...

363
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,695
Did Jangsan tell you to stop?

364
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,032
Yes, I'm sure.
You were Jangsan's minion back then too.

365
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,409
I'm going to request a retrial.

366
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,081
But no matter what the truth is,
as long as Jeon Jaeho is hospitalized,

367
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,124
you'll be criticized
for requesting a retrial.

368
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,130
No matter what he did, he's now
a poor man who could die any day.

369
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,594
That's why I wanted
to ask for your permission.

370
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,764
To ask if you would be all right
with being criticized.

371
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,061
You're not pretending
to be concerned about my best interests

372
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,855
to make me give up
on the retrial, are you?

373
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,107
Of course not.

374
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,528
Are you sure you're all right
with me requesting a retrial?

375
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,786
I'm sorry.

376
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,622
Once I get an idea in my head, I just...

377
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,126
I misunderstood.

378
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:33,548
In most cases like this one,
the victim is the one who gets criticized.

379
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:39,303
However, there will be people
who believe what you say.

380
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,389
I don't care about being criticized.

381
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,893
I already got enough unfair criticism
eight years ago.

382
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,692
Jeon Jaeho may die soon, but he should die
as a culprit, not a victim.

383
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,239
Then I'll go ahead and request a retrial.

384
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,287
Ms. Noh, are you okay
with being criticized because of me?

385
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,247
I think...

386
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,420
I'll feel better
once people begin to criticize me.

387

Yes, Mr. Jang.

<i>Chakhee. Grandpa passed away.</i>

391
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,743
What?

392
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,704
He passed away in his sleep.

393
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,750
Come to the vacation home with Yiyeon.

394
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,420
Excuse me.

395
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,756
Excuse me?

396
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,509
Are you going to turn in this document?

397
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,556
Are you going to turn this in?

Yiyeon.

400
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,430
What brings you here?

401
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,978
You still have more to say?

402
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
Grandpa...

403
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,528
passed away.

404
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,661
Really?

405
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,163
Was he struck by lightning or something?

406
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:21,507
He passed away
in the vacation home in his sleep.

407
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,969
"In his sleep"?

408
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,725
He shouldn't have died
in such a peaceful way.

409
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,951
I don't know what happened
between you and Grandpa,

410
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,911
but this is unacceptable behavior.

411
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,414
Grandpa...

412
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,376
He's dead now.

413
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,175
Wait here.

414
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,677
I'll get changed.

415
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,232
Sit down for a bit.

416
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,942
You should sit while you wait.

417
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,074
I'm sorry.

418
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,992
I...

419
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:39,001
You shouldn't be this sad because of him.
I shouldn't have let this happen.

420
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,172
Why are you saying this?

421
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,758
Does it make you feel less guilty?

422
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,843
Does it make you feel less sorry?

423
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,305
You left and never looked back.

424
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,351
If you make out the man
who took me in to be a bad person,

425
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,144
does it make you less of a jerk?

426
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,816
Fine. Just as
your garbage of an article says,

427
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,778
Chairman Jang Byungchun
might really be a bad person. However!

428
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:11,742
At least to me,
he wasn't nearly as bad as you.

429
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,120
He was a much better person than you.

430
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,671
Everyone else can criticize the chairman,
but you have no right.

DEATH CERTIFICATE

433

NATURAL DEATH CAUSED BY CHRONIC ILLNESS

434
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,052
After discussing it
with family members,

435
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:57,765
we've decided to hold
a simple and humble funeral.

436
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,434
Director Oh.

437
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,895
Where's Yiyeon?

438
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,189
We came together. She'll be here soon.

439
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,107
What will you do now?

440
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,860
The man who adored you is gone.

441
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,664
<i>The funeral director who shrouded
the deceased reported to the police.</i>

442
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,960
<i>He supposedly died from natural causes,
but odd marks were found on his body.</i>

443
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,462
<i>We'll open an investigation.</i>

444
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,631
<i>Please put off the funeral until then.</i>

445
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,722
Gido, open the door. Hey.

446
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,809
Gido, what's going on?

447
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,645
Gido!

448
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,488
Why are detectives here?

449

Daehyeon.

450
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,910
Listen closely.

451
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,541
Once you walk into this bedroom,
you'll be joining me on this boat.

452
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:11,255
You'll either get on this boat
and arrive at the port with me or drown.

453
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,425
It'll be one of those two.

454
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,764
What will you do?

455
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,611
Since my granddaughter taught me
how to send text messages,

456
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,156
should I try sending her one?

457
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,454
I wonder what my grandpa sent me.

458
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,999
"This letter
first began in the UK..."

459
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,500
Grandpa!

460
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,169
What other choice do I have?

461
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,839
It says I'll die if I don't pass it on
before the end of the day.

462
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,678
Ms. Noh.

463
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,019
The funeral has been postponed,
so you should go.

464
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,271
What?

465
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,900
You'll hear about the details later,

466
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,152
so you should go home
and wait for someone to call.

he'll be an assemblyman.

Hmm...

470

He's good-looking.

He's good-looking?

Look. Isn't he good-looking?

473

He's much better than Kwon Youngho.

What a relief, Granny.
You forgot everything.

So, Granny,
do you think he'll get elected?

476
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,774
He'll most likely get elected, right?

477
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,110
What if it isn't most likely?

478
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,405
What do you mean?

479
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,414
Granny.

480
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:13,460
No matter what happens from here on out,
no matter what others say,

481
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,090
don't believe what they say,
and just believe me. Okay?

482
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,928
Of course, I'll believe you.
Who else would I believe?

483
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,180
That's good, then.

484
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,891
And don't go off the deep end.

485
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,644
I couldn't go any deeper if I tried.

486
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,856
At times like these,
I'm sure your IQ is 150.

487
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,567
What are you saying?

488
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,027
Hey, where's the lady
from the third floor going?

489
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,242
Can you make kimchi stew? I'm eating.

490
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,536
You got it.

491
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,254
It's so obvious.

492
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,757
You haven't had anything to eat, have you?

493
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,844
<i>You haven't had
anything to eat, have you?</i>

494
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:09,725
If you stop eating
just because you're sad,

495
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,229
your grandma will be more heartbroken
than you are right now.

496
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,857
Let's go. Okay?

497
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,486
Let's go.

498
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,613
Let's go and eat.

499
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,927
It'll get cold. Dig in.

500
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,361
My goodness.

501
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,532
Why haven't you had anything to eat?
You must be starving.

502
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,660
I cooked lots of rice. Eat up.

503
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,289
Here, eat this.

504
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,086
Hey.

505
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,004
Young lady...

506
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,923
Are you crying?

507
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,969
No.

508
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,639
Goodness.

509
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,724
What's wrong?

510
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,143
Don't cry.

511
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,858
Come on.

512
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,902
It's because your kimchi stew
isn't any good.

513
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,656
That's impossible.

514
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,036
I guess I didn't put in
enough beef-flavored seasoning.

515
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,914
Is that why?

516
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,752
Granny, your secret was seasoning?

517
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,213
I'm sorry.

518
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,596
Oh, no.

519
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,646
Gosh, what to do?

520
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,343
I'm sorry.

521
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,640
Why are you sorry?

522
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,748
JEONGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

523
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,836
Hello? Attorney Noh Chakhee speaking.

524
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,421
<i>I...</i>

525
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>I think I made a mistake.</i>

526
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,885
Who are you?

527
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:37,099
<i>I did confess and say
that I killed him, but no.</i>

528
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,475
<i>I don't think this is right.</i>

529
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,726
Is that you, Dukman?

530
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,479
I didn't do it.

531
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,106
Wait, what are you talking about?

532
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,108
Chakhee, I...

533
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,610
Hello?

534
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,154
Hello? Park Dukman. Hello?

535
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,908
Uh...

536
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,369
What was that?

537
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,124
NOH YUCHUL

538
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,334
Yes?

539
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,044
<i>Hey, Chakhee, Dukman...</i>

540
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,131
<i>Dukman was just arrested
without a warrant.</i>

541
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,716
He called me.

542
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,634
What's the charge this time?

543
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,137
<i>No, Chakhee. No.</i>

544
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,513
<i>Dukman didn't do this.</i>

545
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,724
Both you and Dukman keep saying that.

546
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,267
What didn't he do? What's the charge?

547
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,061
Dukman supposedly killed someone.

548
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,938
Murder?

549
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,815
Park Dukman?

550
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,484
And the victim is Chairman Jang Byungchun.

551
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,031
Who did he kill?

552
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,700
<i>Well, no, it's...</i>

553
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,496
Are you saying...

554
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,378
Park Dukman was arrested
without a warrant for killing Grandpa?

555
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,255
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

556
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,466
<i>Jang Byungchun was killed by someone else.</i>

557
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,009
<i>Jang Gido is framing him.</i>

558
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,554
<i>This could be a stumbling block
for Jang Gido's candidacy,</i>

559
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,639
<i>so he's trying to turn Dukman
into the killer</i>

560
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,767
<i>and put an end to this case.</i>

561
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,853
<i>Let's meet. Let's meet and talk.</i>

562
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,147
<i>Chakhee?</i>

563
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,857
<i>Chakhee!</i>

564
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,487
Hey!

565
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,446
Over here!

566
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,239
Hey! Can you call my lawyer?

567
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,450
I have something to say.

568
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:21,828
Noh Chakhee.
Can you call Attorney Noh Chakhee?

569
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,623
Call Noh Chakhee! Noh Chakhee!

570
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,792
1 HIT REFRESH WITH JANG GIDO

571
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:32,297
Members of the press,
thank you all for gathering here today.

572
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:39,221
I, Jang Gido, stand here today to prevent
my father's name from being disgraced.

573
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:45,227
This morning, the culprit who confessed
to murdering my late father

574
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,648
was found dead at the detention center.

575
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,527
And Candidate Kwon Youngho's camp
is spreading

576
00:51:55,028 --> 00:52:00,242
terrible rumors about my late father
without any evidence or proof.

577
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,078
<i>I ask of you, Mr. Kwon Youngho.</i>

578
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,705
<i>Please stop your negative campaigning.</i>

579
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,333
<i>Instead of attacking the weakness
of my devastating situation,</i>

580
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,462
<i>please run in this election
by using your strengths.</i>

581
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,964
<i>A fair and...</i>

582
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,853
CEO JANG GIDO

583
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,193
Yes, Mr. Jang.

584
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,780
I understand.
I'll come over right now.

585
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,328
I'll go with you.

586
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,415
I have some business to attend to as well.

587
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,094
1 JANG GIDO

588
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,267
Thanks for the ride.

589
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,729
Call me when you're done.

590
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,158
<i>It's true.</i>

591
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,536
Park Dukman went
into the vacation home to steal.

592
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,206
When he came across my father,
he killed him by accident.

593
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,501
Then he laid him on the bed
out of fear that he would get caught.

594
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,547
The funeral director
made a report to the police

595
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,800
because he saw signs of murder
as he was shrouding him.

596
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,052
After the investigation,

597
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,513
they found stolen items
at Park Dukman's place,

598
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,558
and that's why he made a confession.

599
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:54,564
The police told me
that Park Dukman called you.

600
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,610
Yes, I think he called
after he was arrested.

601
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,279
What did he say?

602
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:11,164
Just that he made a mistake.
He rambled on and then hung up.

603
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,208
That's all?

604
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,960
Yes.

605
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,005
Park Dukman must have named you
as his lawyer.

606
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,468
He even wanted to see you the night
before he died in the detention center.

607
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,180
Do you have any idea why?

608
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,599
No.

609
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,184
I was the only lawyer he knew,

610
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,103
so that's probably why
he wanted to see me.

611
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,730
Is that so?

612
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,653
Chakhee.

613
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,781
My election campaign is about to begin.

614
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:50,495
I'll hold my father's funeral
on the day I'm elected.

615
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:56,251
I'll put the assemblyman's badge
before my father's grave.

616
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:01,047
So don't do anything
that'll make Grandpa...

617
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,675
sad.

618
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,783
Do you think...

619
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,996
Mr. Jang will get elected as assemblyman?

620
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,707
If nothing happens, he'll be elected.

621
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,877
Everyone is certain
that Jang Gido will win.

622
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,345
Isn't that what you wanted?

623
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,600
I'm not sure what I want.

624
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,308
Aren't you coming?

625
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,896
I have to be somewhere.

626
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,483
At this hour?

627
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,527
Yes.

628
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,074
You should go inside.

629
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,913
Do you think...

630
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,753
Dukman really killed Grandpa?

631
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:14,097
I doubt that it was Mr. Park Dukman.

632
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,165
Okay, fine. All right.

633
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,167
Is that so? Okay, I get it.

634
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,211
