The report was made at 21:30,
and Choi Taesik was dispatched.

644
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,669
When he got there,
the chairman was in his bedroom,

645
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,256
looking like he had died in his sleep,
and his doctor came.

646
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,551
Jang Gido said his father succumbed
to his long-term illness,

647
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,261
so Choi Taesik backed off.

648
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,640
But then, the funeral director
who was shrouding the chairman's body

649
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:53,143
called the police and said that
it didn't look like a natural death.

650
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,730
Then, after that,
Park Dukman was arrested.

651
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:01,193
And once we found the valuables he stole
from the vacation house, he confessed.

Jang Gido must've seen it, then.

His father's body was in the basement
where he had been tortured and killed.
