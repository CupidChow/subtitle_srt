1
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:45,962
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT

2
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,674
EPISODE 3

3
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,239
BASED ON THE ESSAY
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT BY JUNG HYEJIN

4
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,804
Did you bring the car?

5
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,764
It's behind the restaurant.

6
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,602
Hey, stop!

7
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,564
That's for a customer.

8
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,609
You asked me to bring the car over
so early in the morning. Whose car is it?

9
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,905
Are you hungry?
Should I steam some more dumplings?

10
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,199
No thanks. I'm off.

11
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,326
No, wait. They'll be done in no time.

12
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,538
I noticed before
that Mr. Do really enjoys them too.

13
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,961
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

14
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,255
Chisik, steam me a whole bunch.

15
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,757
-Why?
-We have a new attorney.

16
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,927
-Really?
-Yes.

17
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,470
Hey, that's great news.

18
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,349
Mr. Do was worried that people
avoided that office because of you.

19
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,605
What's the new attorney like?

20
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,815
She's a bit...

21
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,485
odd.

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,488
Odd?

23
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,490
She's really odd.

24
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,537
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

25
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,422
Good morning.

26
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,216
Hello.

27
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,300
Hand.

28
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,927
Mm-hmm?

29
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,262
These are silk, so tell them
to be extra careful with them.

30
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
This one is tweed.

31
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,480
Right, I need one iced decaf dolce latte.
With soy milk instead of dairy milk.

32
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,821
I told you not to put on that apron.

33
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,865
You're getting treated like a servant.

34
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,250
You need to get your own coffee.

35
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,377
And get your clothes washed
on your own time.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,922
-Why?
-Why? What do you mean, why?

37
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,343
Why should I waste time getting coffee
or going to the cleaners? Time is money.

38
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,803
Isn't that why we have a secretary?

39
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,887
Where?

40
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,182
Where?

41
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,476
There is no secretary here.

42
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,104
Ms. Noh, you don't have
a private secretary here in this office.

43
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,230
If you want to save time,

44
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,524
do your laundry at home
and quit drinking coffee.

45
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,111
So you're saying Mr. Do isn't a secretary?

46
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,487
No.

47
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,571
Okay.

48
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
Mr. Do.

49
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,333
How much?

50
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,627
How much will it cost?

51
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,089
-Sorry?
-How much

52
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,550
will it cost for me to have you?

53
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,636
How much can you give me?

54
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,682
-Youngsoo.
-I need money. I really do.

55
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,063
How much...

56
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,066
How much can you give me?

57
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,903
I can give you 400,000...

58
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,613
a month.

59
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,159
Deal.

60
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,539
A decaf soy latte, right?

61
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,418
I'll make it quick.

62
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,963
Okay.

63
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,051
Okay.

64
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,014
What the hell was that?

65
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,099
Do you think money can solve everything?

66
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,021
Oh, I think Mr. Do would find
that remark to be quite rude.

67
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,566
All I did was offer him extra pay
for the extra work he's doing for me.

68
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,151
There's no need to theorize about

69
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,236
how materialism has taken over
in this day and age.

70
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,740
Unbelievable.

71
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,586
Make some time for dinner on the 3rd.

72
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,880
We're having dinner
with CEO Park and his wife.

73
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,215
Why?

74
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,302
Mr. Park is a member
of the nomination committee.

75
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,977
You were serious about running
for the National Assembly?

76
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,188
What's next? Provincial governor?

77
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,941
And what's after that? President?

78
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,696
I'm not doing it.

79
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,116
I don't have any intention
of becoming an assemblyman's wife.

80
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,618
Can't you just play along?

81
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,496
Just play along? For whose benefit?

82
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,292
It took two years to get the central block
at the business district.

83
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,461
Just as my shopping mall
is about to go up,

84
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,213
you're telling me to play
<i>Queen of Housewives?</i>

85
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,175
Yes. Play <i>Queen of Housewives.</i>

86
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,676
Cut the crap.

87
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,722
If I were that kind of woman, you
would never have been able to marry me.

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,642
And if you hadn't married me,
your father would still be...

89
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,771
a broker for day laborers.

90
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,955
POLICE CHIEF JEON JAEHO

91
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,587
Yes, Jaeho.

92
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,591
<i>Mr. Cho was murdered
at his vacation house.</i>

93
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,717
Really?

94
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,638
CEO Cho was murdered?

95
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,973
<i>Yes.</i>

96
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,642
<i>Come by the station this afternoon.</i>

97
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,477
I'll be there.

98
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,980
Did he say CEO Cho died?

99
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,275
I think so.

100
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,862
Congrats.

101
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,115
You'll no longer have
to clean up after him.

102
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,828
Haran.

103
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,249
A man died.

104
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,461
Can't you respond
like a human being for once?

105
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,381
I can't pretend to care like you do.

106
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,477
The woman Mr. Cho called
to his vacation home

107
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,938
found him in the morning
and made the report.

108
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,901
Have you found any leads on the culprit?

109
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,320
We found nothing.

110
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,740
Seriously?

111
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,993
Nothing?

112
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,870
No.

113
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,414
The culprit was very careful.

114
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,417
It looks like Mr. Cho
opened the door for the culprit.

115
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,212
And they didn't even touch
the safe in the house,

116
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,548
so they're most likely an acquaintance.

117
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,303
Someone whose sole purpose
was to kill Mr. Cho.

118
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,806
As you can see in the photos,
he wasn't simply killed.

119
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,768
He was tortured,
and then he was put in that position.

120
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,355
Why did they do that?

121
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,482
And why that position?

122
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,615
They probably wanted an apology...

123
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,578
for a sin Uncle Hyunsik committed.

124
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,955
What sin?

125
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,667
I'm not sure.

126
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:33,299
What kind of sin did Uncle Hyunsik commit
against the culprit who killed him?

127
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,888
You know what Mr. Cho was like.

128
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,516
He committed more sins in his life
than you could count on both hands.

129
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,855
I guess so.

130
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,611
Will you be all right?

131
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,448
The election is around the corner.

132
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,117
Once Mr. Cho's stories get out...

133
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,542
You should worry about yourself first.

134
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,065
All right.

135
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,235
Don't worry about the investigation.

136
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,028
Right.

137
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,657
We have Mr. Cho's call history.

138
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,537
The last person he talked to
was one of your attorneys at Jangsan.

139
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:51,127
The call went on for about ten seconds
while he was being tortured.

140
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,508
OUTGOING CALL, ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

141
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,761
Ms. Noh. The defendant is...

142
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,432
Your client is here for a meeting. Yes.

143
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,392
"Client"?

144
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,352
Is that so?

145
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,650
Yes. This way. Come on in.

146
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,986
Oh...

147
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,114
Mr. Lee Guidong.

148
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,075
You were in the isolation wing
for a long time.

149
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,744
Yes.

150
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,245
Right.

151
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,290
In the isolation wing,
you and Mr. Kang Myungsub,

152
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,251
a schizophrenic patient
who was hospitalized for ten years...

153
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,669
What's this? Chips?

154
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,547
You began to fight over chips.

155
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,175
Then Mr. Lee Guidong kicked
Mr. Kang Myungsub with his foot.

156
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,094
Because of that, Mr. Kang Myungsub
suffered from a stomach perforation

157
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,097
and passed away in the emergency room
from acute sepsis.

158
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,182
Is this correct?

159
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,561
I'm not quite familiar
with the name of the disease.

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,816
All I know is that he died
because of Guidong.

161
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,985
Ah...

162
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,696
Mr. Lee Guidong.

163
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,198
Guidong.

164
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,365
Mr. Lee Guidong.

165
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,366
Guidong.

166
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,577
Mr. Lee, let's stop eating that.

167
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,287
That's mine!

168
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,790
-That's mine! No!
-No!

169
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,334
-My goodness.
-Good Lord.

170
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,502
There, there.

171
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,378
It's yours. There, it's yours.

172
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,630
It's mine.

173
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,883
-Oh, no. I'm... My goodness.
-I'm fine. I'm okay.

174
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,011
Goodness. I'm so sorry.

175
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,639
Mr. Lee Guidong.

176
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,891
Gosh, it got all over you.

177
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,353
Is this why you hit Mr. Kang Myungsub?
Because he touched your chips?

178
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,314
They were mine, but that idiot stole them.

179
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,566
So you got angry.

180
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,193
Yes.

181
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,362
Mr. Lee.

182
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,240
Do you know that Mr. Kang Myungsub died?

183
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,743
Mr. Kang is dead.

184
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,620
Did you know that?

185
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,375
Am I bad?

186
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,252
Am I...

187
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,504
Am I bad?

188
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,968
-No!
-I have to get beaten!

189
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,887
-I have to get beaten if I am bad!
-My goodness! Stop it.

190
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,639
That's enough.

191
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,309
-I'm a bad person! I have to get beaten!
-That's enough. There, there.

192
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,645
That's enough.

193
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,814
There.

194
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,401
My Guidong is a good boy. There, there.

195
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,988
Yes, that's enough.

196
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,074
There, there.

197
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,002
Oh, man. What a day.

198
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,938
Ma'am, I looked over his case.

199
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,565
Mr. Lee has an IQ of 67.

200
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,442
Right?

201
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,819
He can't conduct himself properly
in social settings.

202
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,030
Yes, you're right.

203
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,199
Back when he was in college,

204
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,577
he made deliveries on his motorcycle
in the early mornings

205
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,871
to make some money
for our living expenses.

206
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,874
He became like this
after he got into a hit-and-run accident.

207
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,253
Before that, he never failed
to get a scholarship...

208
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,923
Yes, anyhow, that's his condition now.

209
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,425
The judge will take
his condition into consideration.

210
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,720
But despite his condition, a man has died.

211
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,805
Right.

212
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,183
First off, what's most important
in cases like these

213
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,477
is how well you settled the case
with the bereaved family.

214
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,854
Have you met with the victim's family?

215
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,941
Well, the thing is...

216
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,192
He didn't have any family.

217
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,111
Both of Mr. Kang Myungsub's parents
have passed away,

218
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,072
and his son has no confirmed address.

219
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,532
So he was cremated without a funeral.

220
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,870
Yes, which is why I feel
even sorrier for him...

221
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,873
Don't. Mr. Lee should be thankful
that the victim doesn't have any family.

222
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,918
There is nobody who wants him punished.

223
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,002
What?

224
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,673
However, although the deceased
doesn't have any bereaved family,

225
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,758
there is someone else
that still wants to punish him.

226
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,551
Who...

227
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,639
The state wants to punish Mr. Lee
even though he doesn't have the capacity

228
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,140
to understand what he has done.

229
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,018
According to precedents, the accused
were mostly given prison sentences.

230
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,730
But that'll change if I defend him.

231
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,482
Sorry?

232
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,151
I won't let Mr. Lee Guidong go to prison.

233
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,070
My goodness. But how?

234
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,822
Now, how are we going to send Mr. Lee

235
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,449
to a psychiatric institution
instead of a prison?

236
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,035
We must show the judge.

237
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,829
Words aren't going to cut it.

238
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,456
I'm not sure what you mean by that...

239
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,875
I'm talking about
how slow Mr. Lee Guidong is,

240
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,461
how he's completely unaware
of what he has done,

241
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,631
how he's unable to make sound judgment
regardless of the time and place.

242
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,176
I mean, that's why he hit his attorney
on her head to take back his ice cream.

243
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,679
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,723
No, that's why it's a relief.

245
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,141
-What?
-Look, Your Honor.

246
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,269
As you can see, Mr. Lee Guidong
only follows his instinctive desires.

247
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,896
Mr. Lee didn't intend to kill Mr. Kang.

248
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,773
He had merely acted on instinct.

249
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,028
We'll put on a show to amuse the judge.

250
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,823
Goodness. I'm not so sure...

251
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,783
You don't need to know the specifics.

252
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,786
Just remember this.
"My son has a great public defender

253
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,580
so he won't have to go to prison."

254
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,373
Just be thankful.

255
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:26,712
I'll just put
my full trust in you, Ms. Noh.

256
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,172
Okay.

257
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,139
The page won't turn.

258
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,349
Don't be so sure of anything.

259
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,894
You'll only end up hurting
the elderly lady.

260
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,230
A psychiatric institution?

261
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,107
He won't make it there.

262
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
You're right if you consider
the precedent cases.

263
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,786
But we're talking about me.
I'm Mr. Lee's attorney.

264
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,413
Good grief.

265
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,707
You're like a little baby.
Completely oblivious.

266
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,920
The state is much harsher
than you think it is.

267
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,798
That's especially true for the consultees
who end up coming here.

268
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,176
The rich consultees of Jangsan...

269
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,513
Those rich clients live
in a completely different country.

270
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,723
In Jangsan, sure.

271
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,767
"However, the defendant shows remorse..."

272
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,811
"However, they settled
with the bereaved family..."

273
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,730
"However, the defendant
was too drunk to remember..."

274
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,482
These arguments can get them released.

275
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,235
But it's impossible here.

276
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,694
You don't know anything.

277
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,575
Is that the excuse public defenders use
for having a 3% win rate?

278
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,203
-What?
-You shouldn't denounce the state

279
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,996
that's paying you six million a month.

280
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,081
Wait.

281
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,917
You've been working for over two years,
so you get eight million, right?

282
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,004
That's how much a section chief
of a big corporation makes.

283
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,591
Nobody gets on you for your 3% win rate,
and you get paid eight million a month.

284
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,802
Look at how benevolent the state is.

285
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,887
Yes, sure. To me, it is.

286
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,224
However, to the consultees
who end up here,

287
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,727
the state is neither benevolent nor fair.

288
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,104
You don't know anything.

289
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,481
Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

290
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,942
Do you know why the world is fair?

291
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,026
Why?

292
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,654
Because it's unfair to everyone.

293
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,948
Sure, one person's dad
might be an assemblyman

294
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,575
while another's is an ex-con.

295
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,285
But that's just how the world works.

296
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,537
However, at times,

297
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,582
those consultees who would never
get another chance with a "however,"

298
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,127
get to meet
a great public defender like myself.

299
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,754
If you think about it that way,
it could mean the world is fair.

300
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,799
A fair world,
because it's unfair to everyone.

301
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,926
What kind of bull is that?

302
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,553
You just got that?

303
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,513
I've been talking bull
for about five minutes.

304
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,142
Now, go on your way. I'm busy.

305
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,603
I will.

306
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,854
Ah!

307
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,358
Thanks for this.

308
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,445
This makes it so much easier.

309
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,780
<i>Name, Jwa Sibaek.</i>

310
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,324
Occupation, lawyer.

311
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,455
It rained on that day, so it wasn't easy
to identify the license plate number

312
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,832
with the footage on Cho Hyunsik's dashcam,

313
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,585
but it was identified via the CCTV footage
of a nearby alley.

314
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,380
-Jwa Sibaek?
-Yes.

315
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,675
-A lawyer?
-Yes.

316
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,387
I've heard that name somewhere.

317
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,642
PUBLIC DEFENDER
JWA SIBAEK

318
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,976
I'm an attorney.

319
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,187
Ah!

320
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,152
PUBLIC DEFENDER
JWA SIBAEK

321
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,405
It was Noh Chakhee.

322
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,200
She was in Mr. Cho's car.

323
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,671
That's mine!

324
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,632
-That's mine!
-My goodness.

325
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,352
No, this is so wrong.

326
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,854
I can't spend a year like this. Come on.

327
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,077
REPORTER PARK BYUNGJAE, JOJOONG DAILY

328
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,750
Hello, Mr. Park. Have you been well?
This is Noh Chakhee from Jangsan.

329
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,672
Why don't we meet up?
I have a great news topic for you.

330
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,633
No, it's not something
I can discuss now.

331
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,760
Okay.

332
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,563
-Director Oh.
-Yes?

333
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,738
Y CONSTRUCTION SUSPECTED OF BRIBING
OFFICIALS TO WIN BID FOR BUSINESS DISTRICT

334
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,830
-Who wrote this?
-Park Byungjae from <i>Jojoong Daily.</i>

335
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,499
Park Byungjae?

336
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,254
So you can run one photo
of the public defender's office's front

337
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,506
that sits by an apartment complex.

338
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,758
And the office here.

339
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,844
Include a photo of me
talking to a client by my desk

340
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,889
and a solo shot of me doing
the interview in my office.

341
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,265
I think that's about it.

342
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,393
The headline can read,
"Large Law Firm's Ace Attorney

343
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:38,148
Worth 45,000 Every Six Minutes,
Turns Public Defender for a Small City."

344
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,316
Something like that.

345
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,236
It'll probably draw more readers
if you throw in numbers into the headline,

346
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,738
so please do that.

347
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,240
Everything sounds good. This sounds great.

348
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,911
But why should I write this article?

349
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,666
I should have brought that up first.
I got ahead of myself.

350
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,709
So...

351
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,795
How much?

352
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,257
Are you trying to bribe me
to write this article?

353
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,635
Yes.

354
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,013
I need to get going.

355
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,557
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,352
That was too blunt of me,
wasn't it? Please sit.

357
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,562
Jeez.

358
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,111
What can I do to get
you interested in my story, Mr. Park?

359
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,322
Well, two years ago,

360
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,242
when you were sued for damages
after spreading false information,

361
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,828
the evidence on your phone
was omitted by gross negligence.

362
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,747
Would that be enough for you
to take an interest in my story?

363
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,959
Are you threatening me?

364
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,794
Well, my feelings are hurt.

365
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,047
Mr. Park, have you forgotten already?

366
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,926
I worked so hard
to save you from that lawsuit.

367
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,512
Oh, come on.

368
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,806
Fine.

369
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,685
Then, as a token of my gratitude,
I'll just work on the article itself.

370
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,021
I don't want to take money for your story,

371
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,024
only to get another threatening offer
like this two years from now.

372
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,444
Okay. It's not like I'm asking you

373
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:10,115
to turn a drug dealer into an angel
or write some other fake news like that.

374
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,119
Bring me an actual story.

375
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,913
The article you just suggested
only shows the circumstances.

376
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:23,128
What has the ace of Jangsan done
in the midst of the common folk?

377
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,756
If you show me something you've done,
I'll look at that and write an article.

378
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,092
Right now,

379
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,761
I'm working on a case involving
a man with an IQ of 67

380
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,513
who killed another man in an altercation.

381
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,641
If you look at the precedent,
it's obvious he'll be imprisoned.

382
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,937
However, I'm going to have him sent
to a psychiatric institution instead.

383
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:48,361
Again, let's discuss this
when the results are out.

384
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,993
This is Park Byungjae
of <i>Jojoong Daily.</i>

385
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,412
<i>This is Director Oh Haran
of Yulhu Construction.</i>

386
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,371
Director Oh.

387
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,873
Goodness. Yes.

388
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,125
-Mr. Park? Mr. Park, one second...
-Yes. Right.

389
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,460
-It's fine.
-I'm not done yet.

390
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,920
Wait, Mr. Park.

391
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,723
Yes, okay. I understand.

392
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,310
That was Reporter Park.

393
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,606
Noh Chakhee asked him
to write a story about her.

394
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,942
Did she?

395
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,819
She wanted to do
an interview ahead of time

396
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,239
because she'll become a star
among public defenders.

397
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,284
It's obvious that she doesn't want
to be stuck there for a year.

398
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,206
If she'll return
to the ESG department anyway,

399
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:46,002
she can make up some story
and return as a pro bono icon.

400
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,421
How amusing. She doesn't know her place.

401
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,133
And...

402
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,429
Haran called Reporter Park...

403
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,688
Haran, it's been a while.

404
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,816
Was it you? Did you put him up to this?

405
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,406
Would you leave the room?
I have to talk to my husband.

406
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,325
Sure.

407
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,749
Excuse me.

408
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,634
Y CONSTRUCTION SUSPECTED OF BRIBING
OFFICIALS TO WIN BID FOR BUSINESS DISTRICT

409
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,429
-Sit.
-Did you think I wouldn't know?

410
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,180
Of course, I knew you would.

411
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,516
I told Mr. Park to write it
for you to notice.

412
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,186
I can always stop articles like these.
You can't force my hand like that.

413
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,521
I know.

414
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,064
It won't be enough.

415
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,734
That's why I prepared the next story.

416
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,948
"Yulhu Construction is under suspicion
of lobbying MH during the bidding process

417
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:01,369
of the central block
in a large business district."

418
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,790
That's the story you've read so far.

419
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,543
The prosecution is in the process
of investigating to confirm

420
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,881
if there was any type of lobby in
from Yulhu Construction.

421
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,300
How's that?

422
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,260
That's the next article.

423
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,887
Are you threatening me by saying

424
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,139
that the prosecution
will come after Yulhu Construction?

425
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,933
Now, the next article.

426
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,769
"Following the investigation,

427
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,565
the Central District Prosecutors' Office
has arrested a certain Director Oh

428
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,485
of Yulhu Construction for embezzlement
and professional negligence."

429
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,488
Should I go on?

430
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,200
The next article is
about Director Oh, who went to prison

431
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,203
-after getting sentenced to three years.
-What are you trying to do?

432
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,622
You already know what I want to do.

433
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,707
You can't send me to prison.

434
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,625
Haran.

435
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:53,254
I could've sent you to prison whenever
I wanted for at least a decade now.

436
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,632
I was the one who cleaned up

437
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,468
after the corruption
Yulhu Construction was involved in.

438
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,846
I did that because you wanted me to.

439
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,392
Did you forget?

440
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,186
You can't become an assemblyman
if I go to prison.

441
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,355
No, not right now.

442
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,817
But do you think that'll be the case
in five years? What about in ten years?

443
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,571
However, if you go to prison now,
you'll never take over Yulhu Construction.

444
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,534
There are people swarming around you,
waiting for you to fall flat on your face.

445
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,042
Dinner is on the 3rd.

446
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,504
Don't forget.

447
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,596
BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

448
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,852
Hey, Mr. Kang, have you been well?

449
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,187
It's me, Noh Chakhee of Jangsan.

450
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,981
Yes.

451
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,650
-I'll take half kimchi and half meat.
-Sure.

452
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,945
So you heard the news.

453
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,531
Right, yes. I'm working
as a public defender right now.

454
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,616
I mean, that's why I called.

455
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,326
How did this ace at Jangsan

456
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,164
become the savior of the average Joes
in the blind spot of the legal system?

457
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,707
This great journey...

458
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,041
You must be busy.

459
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,878
Okay, then. Give me a call
when you're free. I'll be waiting.

460
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,421
Yes, okay.

461
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,507
Man. Kang, this jerk.

462
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,801
I guess he forgot who saved him
from the defamation suit.

463
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,264
So Noh Chakhee is no longer
a Jangsan attorney. Is that it?

464
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,268
Excuse me.

465
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,270
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,981
What was your order again?

467
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,733
Half kimchi, half meat.

468
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,943
-That's right. I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

469
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,782
An incoming order.

470
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,285
The order was...

471
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,079
What did she say?

472
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,798
What would you like?

473
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,136
Half kimchi, half meat.
How many times do I have to order?

474
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,429
Yes, all right.

475
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,182
-I'll get those ready for you quickly.
-Okay.

476
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,643
Man. This is driving me insane.

477
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,443
The king-sized dumplings are on the house.
You should try some.

478
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,653
Sorry about earlier.

479
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,781
You don't need to...

480
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,325
Thank you.

481
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,461
Hey. This...

482
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,172
Why? Is there a problem with the dumpling?

483
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,632
No.

484
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,303
It tastes just like the dumplings
made by someone I used to know.

485
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,973
Is that so?

486
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,644
My gosh. It's just like
how Grandma used to make them.

487
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,521
Please enjoy.

488
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,106
I will.

489
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,031
I can't believe it.

490
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,157
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT

491
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,077
<i>It was over
a simple bag of chips.</i>

492
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,039
We probably wouldn't have had
to face this unfortunate incident.

493
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,001
The defendant, who has
the intelligence of a six-year-old,

494
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,422
and the victim,
who tried to take the defendant's chips,

495
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,886
may both just be victims
of their unfortunate, ill-fated destiny.

496
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,556
Honorable Judge.

497
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,977
So please, have mercy on him.

498
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,647
Okay, good.

499
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,400
-Hello, ma'am.
-Yes. Hello.

500
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,651
Hi, Mr. Lee.

501
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,903
Ma'am.

502
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,907
Can you put this on him?

503
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,866
Sorry?

504
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,661
Goodness, no.
I can't take something like this.

505
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,040
He needs to put this on
for me to create his story.

506
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,708
What?

507
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,376
Put this on him.

508
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,756
-Mr. Lee, you have to do well today.
-Uh-huh.

509
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,134
Let's see. Your hair.

510
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,015
Okay.

511
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,103
Mr. Lee, this is your favorite
bag of chips, right?

512
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,188
It looks good.

513
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,191
Mr. Lee, don't let anybody take this.

514
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,945
If someone tries to take it from you,
get angry at them like a tiger. Okay?

515
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,947
Okay. I won't let anyone take it.

516
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,490
This is mine.

517
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,911
Ma'am, don't worry.

518
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,454
You wouldn't know this,

519
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,623
but if I had taken on
Mr. Lee's case at Jangsan,

520
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,625
I'd be getting paid
hundreds of millions of won.

521
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,503
But I'm doing this for free right now.

522
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,632
My gosh. Thank you, Ms. Noh.

523
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,008
Goodness.

524
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,594
How can I repay your kindness?

525
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,516
Well, if you want to repay my kindness...

526
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,060
When a reporter comes by
to interview you later,

527
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:04,565
tell them about the abundant gratitude
you felt today, just as you felt it.

528
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,943
Okay.

529
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,322
Therefore, the defendant, Lee Guidong,

530
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,283
is charged with the suspicion
of causing death by bodily injury

531
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,285
under Article 259 of the Criminal Code.

532
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,581
PROSECUTOR

533
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:25,294
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, DEFENDANT

534
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,679
Your Honor.

535
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,391
Mr. Lee has an organic brain disorder
caused by a head injury,

536
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,477
and he currently has
the intelligence of a six-year-old.

537
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,356
What would happen if you took
a bag of chips away from a child?

538
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,817
The child may cry, throw a fit,

539
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,319
or even shake around
their cute little hands.

540
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,030
Well, the defendant's hands

541
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,490
aren't cute and little.
They're as big as pot lids.

542
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,125
But does that mean the child is trying
to kill the person who took the chips?

543
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,627
Mr. Lee's frontal lobe
was damaged in an accident.

544
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,588
So when the bag of chips
was taken from him,

545
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,174
he probably had no choice
but to react instinctively.

546
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,177
Just like this.

547
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,688
Get angry. Roar.

548
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,364
Mr. Lee, you have to go, "It's mine."

549
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,451
It's okay. You can have it, Ms. Noh.

550
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,787
I like you, Ms. Noh.

551
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,748
You bought me clothes and combed my hair.

552
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,625
No, not that.

553
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,627
You have to yell and hit me.

554
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,212
Right here. You have to push me around.

555
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,465
I don't want to hit you, Ms. Noh.

556
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,052
No, Guidong.

557
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,602
Your Honor. The bag of chips
isn't important at all.

558
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,686
What's important is that

559
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,731
the victim, Mr. Kang Myungsub,
does not have any bereaved family

560
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,817
Mr. Lee can apologize to
and settle the case with.

561
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,871
Gosh, Ms. Noh. Thank you so much
for your hard work today.

562
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,831
Yes, sure.

563
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,543
Ma'am, I turned in the notes
from Mr. Lee's doctor

564
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,378
and the victim's personal information.

565
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,421
I'm sure the judge
will look over everything.

566
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,424
I mean, even if we wanted to settle,
there aren't any bereaved families.

567
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,010
Thank you, Ms. Noh.

568
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,888
You have my full trust.

569
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,766
We'll get going.

570
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,518
-Goodbye.
-Say goodbye.

571
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,980
I like Ms. Noh. I love these chips.

572
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,482
Yes, that's right.

573
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,025
-Yes, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

574
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,490
Why would you like me?

575
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,828
Man, that chip performance
definitely would have worked.

576
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,873
Damn it, Guidong. Why did you come
to your senses at that moment?

577
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,292
God, this is seriously driving me insane.

578
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,835
What are you doing?

579
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,088
What's it to you what I do?

580
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,842
Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

581
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,470
Do you still hold the opinion
that Mr. Lee Guidong

582
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,306
will end up being imprisoned?

583
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,142
-Yes.
-Man, darn it.

584
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,268
Wait, no.

585
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,021
If he was going
to be imprisoned from the start,

586
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,273
then my defense
wouldn't really matter, right?

587
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,568
That's right.
It doesn't matter if I did well or not.

588
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,777
The state is already harsh,

589
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,697
so they were already going
to lock up Mr. Lee. That's right.

590
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,240
Right?

591
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,327
Wasn't the state benevolent?

592
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,953
What are you saying?

593
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,748
The state is much harsher
than you think, Mr. Jwa,

594
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,042
especially for those
who come to our office.

595
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,252
The laws are different
for the poor and the rich.

596
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,671
Since when has it been like that?

597
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,550
I wonder. If you're that curious,
go look online to see

598
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,136
when the law started treating
the rich and the poor differently.

599
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,013
Be on your way now.

600
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,475
-Go.
-Okay.

601
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,192
I paid for that shirt for nothing.
It was all for nothing.

602
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,320
Hello?

603
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,988
<i>Is that you, Chakhee?</i>

604
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,824
-Mr. Jang.
-<i>So?</i>

605
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,035
How's life as a public defender?

606
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,371
I'm doing my best.

607
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,288
<i>I see.</i>

608
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,667
<i>You recently met with CEO Cho, right?</i>

609
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,098
Mr. Jang,

610
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,726
I'm not sure what you heard from Mr. Cho,
but it's all a misunderstanding.

611
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,062
-I can explain everything in per...
-<i>Uncle Hyunsik...</i>

612
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,982
is dead.

613
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,530
What?

614
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,783
He was killed at his vacation house
two days after he met with you.

615
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,536
<i>The man you were with on that day.</i>

616
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,663
<i>Who is he?</i>

617
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,629
Mr. Jwa, CEO Cho was mur...

618
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,720
I just heard.

619
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,471
We need to talk.

620
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,729
Mr. Jwa.

621
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,982
You're in a lawsuit against Kangsung,
and that incident happened with Mr. Cho,

622
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,734
so things might get troublesome for you.

623
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,696
That day, it was all because of me...

624
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,072
Cho Hyunsik.

625
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,950
Did I...

626
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,120
kill him?

627
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,879
There will be no trouble,
so don't worry about it.

628
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,353
SEOUL SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

629
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,729
How do you know each other?

630
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,565
We work in the same office.

631
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,233
-That's all?
-Yes.

632
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,695
You're involved in a suit against Kangsung
that's worth billions of won?

633
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,948
-Yes.
-And the opposing attorney is Noh Chakhee.

634
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,620
Despite all that,
when Ms. Noh Chakhee got arrested

635
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,456
for suspicion of instigating
Ms. Lee Soonyoung's suicide,

636
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,792
Mr. Jwa, you were Ms. Noh's attorney.

637
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,713
Then she got fired from Jangsan
and became a public defender.

638
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,923
But of all places,

639
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,010
she started working in the same
law office as you.

640
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,346
I find you two suspicious.

641
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:54,225
On top of that, on the day Cho Hyunsik
met with Ms. Noh Chakhee

642
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:59,313
and was in the same car with her,
you also happened to be on your way home.

643
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,314
Is that correct?

644
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,566
Yes.

645
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:08,864
As you are well aware, Mr. Jwa,
most murder cases have one of two motives.

646
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,449
Money or women.

647
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,367
However,

648
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:17,706
you and Cho Hyunsik have entanglements
that involve both money and a woman.

649
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,042
That's why

650
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,838
I thought very rationally
about this situation.

651
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,131
Sure.

652
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,385
You and Ms. Noh are in love.

653
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,803
Oh, my.

654
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,432
Ms. Noh gets fired from Jangsan,

655
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:38,018
and then she begins to work with you
in the same office.

656
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,563
That's when Cho Hyunsik

657
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,857
offers Ms. Noh the chance
to become his mistress.

658
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,652
That's why she was
in the car with Mr. Cho.

659
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,196
Then, Mr. Jwa, you found out about it.

660
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,908
You chased after Mr. Cho
and made him stop the car.

661
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,995
Enraged, you drag Mr. Cho out of his car.

662
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,122
You tried to attack him.

663
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,541
But Ms. Noh stopped you, so you couldn't.

664
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,170
And you were probably concerned
about nearby security cameras too.

665
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,172
I'm sure the chauffeur
was watching as well.

666
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,215
-Hmm.
-I mean, think about it.

667
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,593
Mr. Jwa, your anger...

668
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,760
Hmm?

669
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,596
...didn't die down that easily.

670
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,808
So I couldn't contain my anger
and murdered Cho Hyunsik.

671
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,726
Is that it?

672
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,228
Doesn't the story
work itself out perfectly?

673
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,817
Isn't it more like you have
to make the story come together

674
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,360
because that's what you assume?

675
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,239
I mean, everything
matches up too perfectly.

676
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,873
If you want to make me a suspect,
bring me the evidence.

677
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,625
Not some story.

678
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,543
You're good at writing stories.

679
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,136
SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

680
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,055
-Good morning.
-You're here.

681
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,184
Ooh!

682
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,437
Good. Very nice.

683
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,942
Ms. Noh. I printed out Mr. Lee Guidong's
sentence and left it on your desk.

684
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,902
Of course, he got institutionalized.

685
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,709
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT
CRIMINAL DEPARTMENT 10

686
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,007
1 YEAR AND 6 MONTHS PRISON SENTENCE

687
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,134
Damn it, it's a flop.

688
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,804
I didn't think the state was like that,
but it's rather harsh.

689
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,140
How can they send
someone like him to prison?

690
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,684
Right? The state is rather harsh.

691
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,103
Well, back when you were with Jangsan,

692
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,149
people who embezzled tens of billions
all got freed on probation.

693
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,319
Are you already picking a fight?

694
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,778
Of course not. I wouldn't dare.

695
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,365
I wanted to brief you
on different laws for the rich and poor...

696
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,450
I got a call.

697
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,743
Take it. Please.

698
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,661
Hello? This is Attorney Noh Chakhee.

699
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,455
<i>Yes, Ms. Noh.</i>

700
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,833
It's me. Guidong's mother.

701
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,085
Right. How can I help you?

702
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,339
I know this is
very presumptuous of me, but...

703
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:58,927
<i>You're the only one
I can ask for help.</i>

704
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,030
I thought you didn't drink instant coffee.

705
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,867
Ah.

706
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,328
I have no other choice
if I want to connect

707
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,621
with the clients at our office.

708
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,164
Hmm.

709
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,545
You should... do her that favor.

710
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,340
What favor?

711
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,512
Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

712
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,140
I get that you hear all kinds of stuff,
but how can you eavesdrop on my call?

713
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,975
Ah! I just overheard.

714
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,524
It sounded like Mr. Lee Guidong's mother.

715
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,736
It's not like I sold her a home appliance.
I don't offer customer service for trials.

716
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,821
What?

717
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,573
I'm sure you've done lots of favors
for the clients at Jangsan.

718
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,409
It's normal customer service.

719
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,745
Sure, because they paid me
a lot of money for that service.

720
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,081
But this trial
was a total loss on my part.

721
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,084
I bought Mr. Lee's shirt, chips, and food.

722
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,545
Why should I deliver money
for his commissary fund?

723
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,504
Wait.

724
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,840
If you knew it was a loss,
why did you buy him a shirt,

725
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,425
chips, and even food?

726
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,342
Why do that?

727
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,427
It was to...

728
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,679
win the trial.

729
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,724
But I didn't think Mr. Lee
would stab me in the back...

730
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,900
Anyway, I'm not going
to give her free customer service.

731
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,153
And I'm not obliged to,
so let's stop here.

732
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,364
Then don't do it for free.

733
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,826
If you like money that much,
then you can ask to be paid.

734
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,288
If Mr. Lee's mother
called you herself,

735
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,082
it would seem she really
doesn't have anyone else to ask.

736
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,835
If you request that she pay a fee,
she'll pay you.

737
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:58,839
Wow!

738
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,340
What a great idea.

739
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,176
Why didn't I think of that?

740
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,479
Oh, my. Thanks for calling, Ms. Noh.

741
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,523
I'll go to the detention center to pass on
the money for his commissary fund.

742
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,068
But I'll have to charge you a fee.
Is that all right with you?

743
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,761
Jwa, that jerk.

744
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,415
14-1 BUSEOK-GIL, HANSOL-EUP, JUNGHA-SI

745
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,805
Hello?

746
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,349
Ma'am.

747
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,440
Goodness. You're here, Ms. Noh.

748
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,609
Oh, my.

749
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:53,537
I would do it myself if I could,
but my leg is like this.

750
00:47:55,372 --> 00:48:00,878
I thought you might have to visit
the detention center sometime soon.

751
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,796
Uh-huh.

752
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,590
Yes.

753
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,758
So, well...

754
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,891
How much will the extra fee be?

755
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,521
Ma'am, we would normally
charge you an extra fee,

756
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,816
but because this was my first case,
I received government aid.

757
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,944
So you don't have to worry.

758
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,113
Is that so?

759
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:33,243
Goodness. What a relief.

760
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,706
You see, I've been worried sick
about how much

761
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,250
that fee might cost me.

762
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,799
Well, here you go.

763
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,721
It's for Guidong's
commissary fund.

764
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:59,686
I had given him a month's worth of money,
but he already spent all of it.

765
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,106
Why? What did he spend it on?

766
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,525
I have no idea either.

767
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,613
Someone might have stolen it from him

768
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,531
or he might have spent it all
on something.

769
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,912
Yes, ma'am.
I'll make sure Mr. Lee gets this.

770
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,246
-Okay.
-Okay.

771
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:19,998
Right.

772
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,292
-Oh, my.
-Well...

773
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,963
You know, this is...

774
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,048
Goodness.

775
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,717
Well, this is...

776
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,179
This really isn't much.

777
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,685
You bought Guidong a shirt

778
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,564
and came here for free,

779
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,777
but this is all I can give you.

780
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,738
Please know that...

781
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:58,996
my gratitude is much greater
than what I can offer

782
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,706
in return.

783

GREEN GRAPE CANDY

784
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,582

785
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,010
Open.

786
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,096
-Why...
-Please.

791
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,991
Well...

792
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,534
How do you do that?

793
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,371
-Do what?
-Apply for a visitation.

794
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,623
How do you do that?

795
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,128
I'm sure you visited countless clients
when you were at Jangsan.

796
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,964
I visited them, but I never applied.

797
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,759
-What?
-Do you think the ace of Jangsan

798
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,969
had time to be concerned
with applying for that?

799
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,515
My secretary did it.
I just went and visited them.

800
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,392
Were you royalty or something?

801
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,895
It sounds like how the royal servants
used to clean up the mess

802
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,605
after the king went number two.

803
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,149
Fine, then don't tell me.
It's not even a big deal.

804
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,277
Come on.

805
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,114
Tell me.

806
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,657
Please tell me.

807
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,701
You said it's not a big deal.

808
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,330
Case number.

ATTORNEY VISITATION APPLICATION
NOH CHAKHEE

810
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,084
It really is no big deal.

811
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,628
Next time you come,
make sure you apply online first.

812
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,673
Otherwise, the reservations might be full,
so you might have to wait a while.

813
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,633
So why didn't you?

814
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,346
Yes, sir.

815
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,723
You must put your full trust in me.

816
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,350
Yes, sir.

817
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,768
Good, turn it in.

818
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,978
Yes, sir.

819
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,020
Good.

820
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,523
And be polite. Two hands. Good.

821

ATTORNEY-PRISONER INTERVIEW ROOM

822
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,786
What? Mr. Lee,
what happened to your socks?

823
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,039
He stole it. An idiot did.

824
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,292
Someone stole your socks?

825
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,212
Your mom sent you underwear
and undershirts too, right?

826
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,589
Were those stolen too?

827
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,340
My underpants weren't stolen.

828
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,342
It's okay. All right.

829
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,136
I got it.

830
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,556
Hey, Mr. Lee. You know...

831
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,393
Your mom gave you
a month's worth of money for your fund.

832
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,519
How did you use it up?

833
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,022
I bought this.

834
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,986
Mr. Lee...

835
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,450
No matter how slow you are,
how can you buy a watch with that money?

836
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,660
Why did you get that watch?

837
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,122
Because I had to know the time.

838
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,498
What time?

839
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,836
The time to go see my mom.

840
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,756
The time to leave this place.

841
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,228
So that's why you bought that watch?
To count the time until you leave?

842
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,647
Yes.

843
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,609
Mr. Lee, do you know how to tell time?

844
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,736
-I do.
-What time is it?

845
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,325
It's 1:08.

846
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:16,503
Mr. Lee. You knew how to read a watch
before your hit-and-run accident.

847
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,257
Your mom said you were
a good student who won scholarships.

848
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,967
I don't know.

849
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,638
Look.

850
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,100
The short hand is for the hour.

851
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,519
Each mark signifies one hour.

852
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,521
Look. Do you see this long one?

853
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,564
That one is for the minutes.

854
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,817
Each mark signifies five minutes.

855
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,318
Now, let's go back.

856
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:44,781
Let's say this short one went forward
ten marks. Then what time is it?

857
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,828
-Ten o'clock.
-Yes. You're right.

858
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,747
Then what if this long one
goes forward double the marks.

859
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,915
How many minutes is that?

860
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,294
Double minutes.

861
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,503
Uh...

862
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,297
Well...

863
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:04,050
Okay. Do you see
how the watch is looking angry?

864
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,218
It's angry.

865
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:10,849
Yes, when this watch gets angry 30 times,
I'll visit with your mom.

866
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,560
Can you stay healthy until that day?

867
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,021
Yes. I'll stay healthy.

868
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,858
Okay.

869
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,695
Then I'll get going now.

870
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,744
Ms. Noh, you are...

871
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,216
...a good person.

872
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,600
No, I'm not a good person.

873
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,063
You're wrong. You are a good person.

874
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,566
Other people beat me up.

875
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,611
They steal my stuff.

876
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,155
They think I'm an idiot.

877
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,993
But, Ms. Noh, you're kind.

878
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:17,499
You taught me how to read a watch
and you bought me a shirt.

879
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,502
You're kind.

880
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,671
So I know.

881
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:32,222
Ms. Noh, you are a good person.

882

Are you Attorney Noh Chakhee?

885
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:08,550
<i>When he heard that you'd be visiting,
he told me to make sure you got this.</i>

GREEN GRAPE CANDY

887
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,375
My fee for my first case is just amazing.

888
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,545
Instead of a stingray-skin wallet,
I got a stingray-shaped kite.

889
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:05,148
<i>Mr. Lee made this kite
during the occupational therapy class.</i>

890

<i>When he heard that you'd be visiting,

891
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,704
Wow!

892
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,085
It's flying really high.

893
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,762
Chakhee.

894
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,139
Are you done writing?

895
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,058
Yes.

896
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,311
Come and hold this.

897
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:59,994
Write everything about how you miss
your grandma and how sad you are,

898
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,288
then let it fly away into the sky.

899
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,082
Okay?

900
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,126
All right.

901
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,420
Here we go.

902
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,056
Don't cry anymore from now on.

903
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,311
With this, let's say goodbye
to your grandma.

904
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,314
It's all right.

905
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,525
Don't cry.

906
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,236
You'll be all right without her.

907
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,446
You have me.

908
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,074
Don't worry about anything.

909
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,328
Grandpa will keep you safe,
my dear Chakhee.

910
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,090
Oh!

911
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,350
What do I do?

912
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,360
What do I do now? Come on.

913
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,215
Okay.

914
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,850
Ow.

915
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,894
All right.

916
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,037
Oh!
