What's this? Wait, who are you?

170
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,029
Move aside!

171
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,532
ATTORNEY NOH CHAKHEE

172
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:49,492
I found you, you meddling wench.

173
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:50,618
Damn you!

174
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:52,578
SANGGU: Where is she?

175
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:53,663
What the...

176
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,250
Where the hell is Noh Chakhee?

177
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,211
GIDO: As you can see,
Attorney Noh Chakhee has had

178
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:04,840
the best timesheet and win rate
for three quarters in a row.

179
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:07,885
Throughout the seven years
that Ms. Noh has been with Jangsan,

180
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,680
she has far exceeded her peers
in terms of her performance.

181
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:13,224
Attorney Noh Chakhee and Ma Sanghan

182
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,561
are both being reviewed
for promotion to partner.

183
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:20,898
But I'm sure nobody will protest
Noh Chakhee making partner.

184
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:22,483
(door squeaks open)

185
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:26,237
About that timesheet,
can you really trust that?

186
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:30,616
It doesn't make any sense.
How can anybody work 760 hours?

187
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:32,368
(sighs)

188
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,120
I know she's dying to be a partner,

189
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:37,164
but how can she falsify her hours
just because she's the one filling it in?

190
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,083
It's clear to everyone

191
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,752
that Ms. Noh will do anything
to become a partner.

192
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:43,879
So can you really trust this?

193
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:49,510
If anyone felt that her timesheet was off,
I'm sure someone would've spoken up.

194
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:53,139
However, up to this day,
none of our clients have shown

195
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:55,433
any dissatisfaction
with the fees Ms. Noh charged.

196
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:56,642
SANGGU: I said come out!

197
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:58,311
-(door slams open)
-Where on earth is Attorney Noh?

198
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,313
Where did you hide her?

199
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:01,856
For God's sake.

200
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,858
Are you hiding her? Are you?

201
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:06,027
Are you all messing
with me right now? Damn it.

202
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,404
-Jesus Christ!
-(paper rustles)

203
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,656
CHEONGSAN-RI TRADITIONAL SUNDAE SOUP

204
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,329
(slurps)

205
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,664
(satisfied exhale)

206
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,960
You're not eating this, are you?

207
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:24,003
(mutters)

208
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:27,673
I introduced you to the baking
school's director to learn how to bake.

209
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:29,884
I don't want to learn about bread.

210
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,552
I just want to make some dough, damn it.

211
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:35,306
Hey, are you here to check

212
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:37,475
whether I was kneading dough
or stealing dough?

213
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,936
Why should I care what you do
with your damn dough?

214
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:42,605
Exactly.

215
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:44,732
It doesn't matter at all.

216
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,234
The moment you betrayed us
and left, we became strangers.

217
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:49,320
DUKMAN: Right? That's the case. Yes.

218
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:50,655
(sighs in disbelief)

219
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:55,159
At two o'clock in the morning on the 23rd,
in the alley behind the Grand Hotel,

220
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,744
the supposed "accident" with a Porsche.

221
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:58,704
-It was you, right?
-(coughs)

222
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,458
And you took money from the driver
to stay quiet about the accident?

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,711
Was the driver this person?

224
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,673
KANGSUNG PHARM CEO CHO HYUNSIK
AWARDED BAEKHO SERVICE AWARD

225
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,549
No idea.

226
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,135
And this woman was in the passenger seat.

227
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,972
-No idea.
-CHAKHEE: You really don't know?

228
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,517
-I don't know!
-Then I should call someone who does.

229
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:21,560
Suit yourself.

230
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:26,023
Hello, Detective Jung.
It's me, Noh Chakhee.

231
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,401
I'm here with Park Dukman.

232
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,695
CHAKHEE: Yes.
(chuckles)

233
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:32,780
He intentionally hurled himself at my car.

234
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,907
I have the evidence on my dashcam.

235
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,325
Where am I?

236
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,703
The intersection
near Sangwoo Electronics...

237
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:40,579
(whispers)
I remember now. Hang up. I remember them.

238
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:42,540
I know the people in the photos.

239
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,917
I know everything.
I know them both, so please hang up.

240
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,711
I beg you. Okay? Please.

241
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:48,045
Gotta make a call to hang up.

242
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:49,380
(playful music)

243
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,965
Now, let me ask you again.

244
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:52,425
(phone clacks)

245
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:53,926
At 2 a.m. on the 23rd,

246
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:57,096
you jumped in front of
Kangsung CEO Cho Hyunsik's car.

247
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,307
He paid you off to stay shut
about the accident, correct?

248
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,520
He asked you to turn a blind eye
to the woman who was sitting next to him.

249
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:06,230
So what if that's the case?

250
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:08,482
Will you buy me an apartment
if I rat on him?

251
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,152
-I'll pay for your meal.
-Hey!

252
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,573
You just hit me with your car.
Look at what happened to my forehead.

253
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,782
Right here! That stings.

254
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,160
Look at the scratch right here.
Look at my precious face.

255
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,871
DUKMAN: I'm a guy
who makes a living with my good looks!

256
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:24,582
How can you try to call it even
over some rice soup?

257
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,167
This is highway robbery.

258
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,378
I guess I should
actually call Detective Jung.

259
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,509
(heels clacking)

260
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:36,886
(sighs)

261
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,053
I'm getting married.

262
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,517
DUKMAN: The woman
I'm marrying is pregnant.

263
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:46,562
So this was the last time
I was doing something like this.

264
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:47,938
It really was...

265
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,648
Hey!

266
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:53,444
If I learned the law like you,
I could've been a judge, a prosecutor,

267
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:55,112
or any other damn thing!

268
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,614
But stealing is all I learned to do!

269
00:17:56,697 --> 00:17:59,158
This is the only thing I know
how to do. What else can I do?

270
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:00,618
Damn it, that's just who I am.

271
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:03,120
Do you really think that's the case?

272
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,041
-Of course.
-Then learn how to bake.

273
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,376
Be a baking dad, not a con artist dad.

274
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:11,378
CHAKHEE: Stop making excuses.

275
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:14,381
It's repulsive.
(tongue clicks)

276
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:16,634
(phone vibrates)

277
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:22,890
Hello?

278
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:25,851
Really?

279
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:28,646
Okay. Tell them I'll be in soon.

280
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:40,366
(exclaims)

281
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,328
It looks like Ms. Noh
is getting busted for real this time.

282
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:46,247
(groans)

283
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,414
GIDO: Mr. Kwak.

284
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:50,000
As you're fully aware,

285
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:54,505
all the other law firms gave up
on the lawsuit that Ms. Noh took on.

286
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,258
But Ms. Noh helped you win.

287
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,718
Please take that into consideration.

288
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:05,057
That's why I was going to give her
about 10% for winning the case.

289
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,892
-SANGGU: But look!
-(paper rustles)

290
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:11,188
This is ridiculous, damn it.
This is too much!

291
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:14,275
Working 120 hours in one week?

292
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,485
How much does that cost?

293
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:19,697
You all charge 45,000 won for 6 minutes.

294
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:21,907
Hey. Look at me, Attorney Noh.

295
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:26,620
Look. Is the word "pushover"
written on my face?

296
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:29,164
My fee was properly charged
according to my timesheet.

297
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:30,708
Yes, exactly!

298
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,085
SANGGU: You say it
was properly done, so I'm telling you

299
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:35,379
to bring me evidence of that!

300
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,673
Do you have to take things this far?

301
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,717
-Yes!
-HARAN: Of course, he should.

302
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:44,847
I'm sure Ms. Noh wants to clear this up
more than anyone. Isn't that so?

303
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:46,682
Let's check and make sure.

304
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,017
Play it.

305
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,436
That's right.

306
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,645
SANGGU: Damn it.

307
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:53,022
(clicking)

308
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:57,860

JANGSAN LAW FIRM

310
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:08,162
Skip ahead.

311
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,544
-Keep going.
-(mouse clicks)

312

(sighs)

313
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,390
Fast forward to 22:30 on the 17th.

314
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:29,767
-(mouse clicks)
-(sighs)

315

-I knew it.

316
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,898
(scoffs)

317
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:47,159
SANGGU: What the...

318
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,956
(victorious music)

319
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:03,759
The result is out.

320
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,679
Ms. Noh always fired
the interns she didn't like.

321
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:08,514
This time, it's her turn.

322
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:10,391
Come on. I doubt they'll fire her.

323
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:12,142
LAWYER: So? How many hours?

324
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:17,481
She's blinded by her desire to win,
so I'd say at least 90 hours.

325
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,608
To be exact, 100...

326
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:22,486
and 24 hours.

327
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,405
What? Did you say 124 hours?

328
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,324
-That's unbelievable.
-That's insane.

329
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,750
Bring the car around.

330
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:42,881
I'm glad we resolved the misunderstanding.

331
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:43,966
Sure.

00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,690
LAWYER: How can she not change one bit?

335
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,358
INTERN: She's here.

336
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:09,700
She's relentless.

(softly)
Mr. Kwak.

343
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:34,558
Hey.

344
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:38,103
Goodness, don't mention it.
I should thank you.

345
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:43,192
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've lost my precious building.

346
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,152
SANGGU: Anyway, after what happened today,

347
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:47,988
will they finally make you
a partner there, Ms. Noh?

348
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,449
If they don't give it to you,
then next time,

349
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,701
I'll take my weapons over
and make a huge scene.

350
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:54,536
So you'll be fine?

351
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,038
(cackles)

352
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:57,748
All right, I get it. Okay.

353
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,501
I'll send over some rockfish,
so let's have dinner soon.

Ms. Noh, Ms. Lee Soonyoung called.

361
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:30,697
Lee Soonyoung?

362
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:33,450
Yes. She said she was Lee Soonyoung
from Jungha.

363
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:35,953
Is today my birthday?

364
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:37,913
No, ma'am.

365
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:39,873
Tell her I'm busy.

366
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:43,001
I did, but she said
that it was extremely urgent.

367
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:46,421
SECRETARY: She kept
pleading to speak with you.

(clanks, beeps)

369
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:52,886
It's me.

370
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,721
SOONYOUNG (voice breaks): Chakhee?

371
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,349
Is that really you, Chakhee?

372
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,725
Yes.

373
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:01,311
SOONYOUNG: Chakhee.

374
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,148
I'm busy. Make it short.

375
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:06,191
(Soonyoung sobs)

376
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:08,068
SOONYOUNG: Well...

377
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:11,029
I know that you're busy.

378
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:14,616
I really didn't wantto call you either, but...

379
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,079
But can you please come over?

380
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,291

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,630
(weeping, sniffles)
I really don't remember.

384
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,509
My husband...

385
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:35,804
I don't believe it. I just...

386
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:40,642
It was something like
a scary ghost, not my husband.

387
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,687
(exhales)
Soonyoung.

388
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:46,899
Yes?

389
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:48,734
Do you have a lot of money?

390
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,700
I charge 45,000 won for 6 minutes.

391
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:59,286
And if I go to Jungha,
you'll have to pay my travel expenses.

392
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,246
Can you afford that?

393
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:05,209
(somber music)

394
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:07,461
I just...

395
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:14,468
You're the only attorney I know.

396
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:21,683
SOONYOUNG: You are the most capable person

397
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:23,060
I know...

398
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:27,272
I'm sorry.

399
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:30,192
If you're going to apologize, don't call.

400
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:32,569
Either find an attorney you can afford

401
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:35,447
or accept the public defender
that the state gives you.

402
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:37,282
Bye.

403

(gloomy music)

404
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,422
SOONYOUNG (weeping):
I really don't remember.

405
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,842
I apparently stabbedmy husband with a knife.

406
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,930

412
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,492
Don't be so cheap.
It's just one ice cream.

413
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:06,413
You took over 11,300 won from me yesterday
when we played Go-Stop.

414
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,957
They're completely different matters.

415
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,793
Come on. Just consider this
a cut from your winnings.

416
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:15,630
(gasps)
A cut depends on me, it's not up to...

417
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,466
Whatever. I'm broke. Bye.

418
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:18,759
GRANNY: I don't believe this.

419
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:23,346
What on earth do you do for a living?
You don't even have 1,000 won on you?

420
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,598
-Me?
-GRANNY: Yeah.

421
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:27,267
You go out every morning in a suit,

422
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,313
so you don't seem
like you don't have a job.

423
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:33,732
Are you involved in a pyramid scheme?

424
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:37,486
A pyramid scheme?
Please, Granny. Good grief.

425
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:38,862
I'm a lawyer!

426
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:41,615
What now? A lawnmower pyramid scheme?

427
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:43,784
Come on, how can you say that?

428
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:47,079
Your IQ seems to be over 150
when we play Go-Stop.

429
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:49,206
I'm a lawyer.

430
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,583
Someone who defends people.
Don't you know?

431
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,126
You're a lawyer?

432
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,169
Yes.

433
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:55,796
GRANNY: If you're a lawyer,

434
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:59,716
then my doggy Ddol is a judge,
you bonehead.

Cut the bull.

438
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:09,226
Just make sure you pay
your rent on time. Got it?

439
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,936
Got it. Happy now?

440
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:11,853
I'm leaving.

441
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:12,938
Go.

What do you think you're doing?
Don't do that! Go!

443
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,569
What a little jerk.

444
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:21,905
Good grief, a lawyer? Please.

445
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:23,824
Oh, man. A lawyer?

446
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:25,700
I guess that makes you a judge.

How are things going?

I'm on my way to meet
Ms. Yoon Youngju's attorney.

00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:02,571
Why? Are you not confident enough to win?

457
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,281
I'm confident that I will win.

458
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:05,198
GIDO: And yet?

459
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:09,911
It would be more advantageous for Kangsung
to settle the case out of court.

460
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:12,539
GIDO: CEO Cho Hyunsikisn't easy to deal with.

462

I do.

What's your best-selling
birth control pill?

471
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:46,698
Birth control pills?

472
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:48,825
EVESENSE, MYSENSE, D-DAY

473
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:53,622
This one is quite effective
despite its low estrogen levels

474
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,624
so a lot of ladies prefer this product.

475
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,835
The contraceptive effect is solid
for this one, but it's a bit strong.

476
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,796
PHARMACIST: And this one.
You know the actress Oh Yura, right?

477
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,050
She's been advertising it lately.
It's the best-seller at the moment.

478
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,510
It's also the one
the company promotes the most.

479
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,096
-It's made by Kangsung Pharm.
-Yes.

480
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,598
It's been out for only a few months,

481
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:13,808
but a lot of people ask for it
after seeing the ad.

482
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,310
-I'll take this.
-PHARMACIST: Sure.

483
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:17,812
Do you take one pill a day?

00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,607
I'm sure the one taking the pill
will know for herself.

00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:41,127
(water pouring)

488
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:42,921
PHARMACIST: Wait, why are you taking that?

489
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:44,464
(gulps, exhales)

490
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,592
Why are you taking a birth control...

491
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:50,929
Can you take two pills a day?

492
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:52,597
Oh, my.

493
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:56,810
No?

494
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,188
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

495
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:05,110
(blows air)

496
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:08,321
(door opens)

497
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:10,156
YOUNGSOO: Good grief. Hey.

498
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,617
I told you not to eat
instant noodles in the office!

499
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:15,412
Oh, stop.
There's nothing wrong with eating noodles.

500
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:18,832
(groans)

501
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:20,834
What else have you been eating?

502
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:22,419
(gasps)

503
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,213
I feel something.

504
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,590
Mr. Do, I feel weird.

505
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:29,426
It must be the side effects.

506
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:31,553
(lid clanks)

507
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,347
It's because you
always eat food made with flour.

508
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:36,266
That's called irritable bowel syndrome.

509
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:38,310
No. I just had two birth control pills.

510
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:40,103
-You had what?
-SIBAEK: Birth control pills.

511
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:43,690
I think they're starting to kick in.
I'm starting to feel weird.

512
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,236
This is exactly why
everyone says you're a wacko.

513
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,822
And that's why other attorneys
refuse to join this office.

514
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:54,242
Meanwhile, the judicial district office
has no empty seats!

515
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,412
Is that why it's always just you and me?

516
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,122
Why would you take those?

517
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,541
Boy, you're full of anger.

518
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:04,169
Maybe not.

519
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:05,295
I'm fine.

520
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:07,922
(heels clacking)

521
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,467
What's that sound?

522
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,593
(heels clacking)

523
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:12,635
Am I hearing things?

524
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,931
(savvy music)

525
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,851
(door opens, squeaks close)

526
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,144
CHAKHEE: Mr. Jwa Sibaek?

527
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,064
Are you Mr. Jwa?

528
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:26,941
No. Over here.

529
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:49,631
Mr. Do. Do we have anything
like caramel macchiato?

530
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,049
We only have instant coffee.

531
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,634
Okay. Get back to work.

532
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:54,427
I'll get you some coffee.

533
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,723
SIBAEK: So you want to settle?

534
00:32:59,307 --> 00:33:00,266
Yes.

535
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,518
For how much?

536
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:03,561
Twenty-five million won.

537
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:06,064
(playful music)

538
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:09,567
Mr. Do, are you sure
we don't have any caramel macchiato?

539
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:10,944
My blood sugar level just tanked.

540
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,112
We still don't.

541
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:13,488
Okay. Get back to work.

542
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:19,494
That watch on your wrist probably costs
around 25 million.

543
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:22,956
Are you saying you want to settle the case
for the amount you paid for a watch?

544
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,001
Yes.

545
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:32,757
You already know
how much Ms. Yoon demanded

546
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,509
from Kangsung for compensation.

547
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:35,718
Or are you unaware?

548
00:33:35,802 --> 00:33:36,970
I know. It was 500 million.

549
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:39,597
Yes. So if it were you,
would you settle the case

550
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:41,683
for 25 million, Ms. Noh?

551
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,935
I wouldn't if I knew I could win.

552
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:49,149
But you don't seem
to have any intention of winning.

553
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:50,608
(exclaims in disbelief)

554
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:52,944
Why do you think so?

555
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,071
CHAKHEE: If you wanted to win,

556
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:58,366
you wouldn't have demanded
an absurd amount like 500 million won.

557
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:02,370
We'll see if that amount
is absurd or not once we're in court.

558
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:05,248
Enjoy your coffee and show yourself out.

559
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:09,252
Kangsung's birth control pills
don't have any side effects.

560
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:13,590
You're making a mistake
by believing Ms. Yoon's lies.

561
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,801
You mean these?

562
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,095
Have you ever tried them?

563
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,598
SIBAEK: I tried some just now.

564
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:25,226
I began to feel kind of weird, so I think
that must be the side effects kicking in.

565
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,186
Isn't that so, Mr. Do?

566
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:28,688
-Yes, he really took some.
-(chair rattles)

567
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:36,029
Ms. Yoon Youngju heard it and saw it.

568
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,114
SIBAEK: Park Hyungchul
of the New Drug Team

569
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:41,576
called CEO Cho Hyunsik to inform him
about the pill's serious side effects

570
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,244
and sent him every single reference file.

571
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:46,456
Ms. Yoon reported this
to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety

572
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:48,374
and was fired just a week later.

573
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,461
Isn't it all a little too on the nose
to call it a coincidence?

574
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:56,841
So where is this evidence
that Ms. Yoon heard this and saw this?

575
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,762
It doesn't exist anymore.
I'm sure they deleted everything.

576
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:03,139
CHAKHEE:
Ms. Yoon only claims that they did.

577
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:04,807
There was no evidence to begin with.

578
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:06,684
Oh, is that so?

579
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:08,353
Gosh, this is bad.

580
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:11,814
Since there's no evidence,
I'm sure Kangsung will win this case.

581
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:13,691
They will.

582
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:15,026
-Mr. Do.
-Yes?

583
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:16,653
-We lost again.
-Darn.

584
00:35:16,736 --> 00:35:17,737
Darn.

585
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,239
Huh? Wait a minute.

586
00:35:19,322 --> 00:35:21,324
(sucks teeth)
But isn't it weird?

587
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:26,538
If you're going to win, why on earth
do you want to settle the case now?

588
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:33,962
For the same reason you filed a lawsuit
knowing that you'll lose this case.

589
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:35,922
CHAKHEE: Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

590
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:38,550
Just accept the settlement offer.

591
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,052
Kangsung will definitely win this lawsuit.

592
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:44,931
Once they win the lawsuit that would have
nullified Ms. Yoon Youngju's dismissal,

593
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:47,183
even if you sue Kangsung Pharm

594
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,352
over the side effects
of this birth control pill,

595
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:50,520
we'll still win.

596
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:53,856
Ms. Yoon's report
will have turned out to be false already.

597
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,817
And besides, the pills

598
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,988
don't have any side effects to begin with,
despite whatever you may be feeling.

599
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:01,990
If you file a lawsuit
over the side effects,

600
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,908
we'll file a cross action as well.

601
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:06,828
For obstruction of business
by spreading false information.

602
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:10,748
The amount of our claim
for damages will be astronomical.

603
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:13,668
Do you think the supposed victims,
that you'll somehow find,

604
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:16,129
will have that kind of money?

605
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,882
-Mr. Do.
-Yes?

606
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:21,259
Am I being threatened right now?

607
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:24,596
I'm only sharing the truth
that I'm sure you're already aware of.

608
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,557
Aren't you the one
who is already aware of the truth?

609
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:31,185
Kangsung Pharm's
birth control pills do have side effects.

610
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:32,395
And they're very serious.

611
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:35,356
And they're still selling them
despite knowing about the side effects.

612
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,569
If you people win this lawsuit,
these pills will stay on the market,

613
00:36:39,652 --> 00:36:42,030
and Kangsung Pharm
will continue to make

614
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:44,282
more and more money
with people's lives on the line.

615
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,367
Hey, Ms. Noh Chakhee.

616
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:50,288
You know the harm they can cause,
yet you're still defending Kangsung.

617
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:52,457
I guess the rumor is true.

618
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:56,836
That you're the ace of Jangsan
with the glorious 92% win rate.

619
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:59,339
Someone who'll bite anyone
her master tells her to.

620
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,341
You're just Jangsan's dog.

621
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,803
Which breed?

622
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:08,348
I find Shih Tzus cute, so that'd be nice.

623
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,435
Man, I like Shih Tzus too.

624
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:14,520
(tongue clicks)
Anyhow.

625
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:15,772
SIBAEK: My client

626
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:20,777
doesn't have any intention of settling
this case for the price of your watch.

627
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,695
Farewell, then.

628
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,117
What would Ms. Yoon say if she found out
you turned down the settlement offer?

629
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:31,412
Though I'm not sure
if my words will ever reach her anyway.

630
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,041
But if you're really concerned
about your client,

631
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:37,251
I'd like you to pass this on to her.

632
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:39,212
CHAKHEE: That she has...

633
00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:44,342
no idea of the things I'm capable
of doing to win this case.

634
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:49,138
That settling the case right now
might be her last chance to save her life.

635
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,184
You had the second-best score
on the judicial exam

636
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:54,310
and graduated with honors.

637
00:37:54,894 --> 00:37:57,355
You declined offers
from big-name law firms

638
00:37:57,438 --> 00:37:59,190
and decided to defend people
free of charge,

639
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:01,567
then became a public defender
two years ago, correct?

640
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,362
(Chakhee hums)

641
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:10,118
How did the ace of the Judicial Research
and Training Institute, end up becoming...

642
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,328
(laughs)

643
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:15,164
...a public defender with a 3% win rate?

644
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:20,795
CHAKHEE: Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

645
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:26,175
You aren't the only one who can prattle on
about someone's background.

646
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,137
(scoffs)

647
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:31,389
(groans)

648
00:38:31,472 --> 00:38:33,516
CHAKHEE: I'll see you around.

649
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:40,314
(Chakhee winces)

650
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,108
Wait.

651
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:50,575
SIBAEK: It's fine.

652
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:51,868
It's okay. It's all right.

653
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,371
(gasps)

654
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:58,166
Mr. Jwa!

655
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,083
Relax.

656
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,377
-(squeals)
-(bones crackle)

657
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:02,670
CHAKHEE: Wait, what was...

658
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:04,380
What do you think you're doing?

659
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,924
It looks like you sprained your neck.

660
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,178
It may seem fine now, but if you
leave it like that, it'll become chronic.

661
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:12,221
So make sure you visit a hospital.

662
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,182
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:17,393
YOUNGSOO: Are you insane?
What do you think you're doing?

664
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:19,520
SIBAEK: Treatment.
It's Chuna manipulation.

665
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:20,855
Do you want me to do it for you?

666
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:24,525
(children squealing in distance)

667
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:27,278
What's wrong with that guy?
He's a total lunatic.

668
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:31,199
It feels good.

669
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:32,658
-(children approaching)
-(gasps)

670
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:39,957
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. Go on your way.

671
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,586
-CHILD: It's over here!
-I can't believe this nonsense.

672
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:53,095
(sighs)

673
00:40:02,522 --> 00:40:04,273
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

674
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:14,617
SOONYOUNG: But can you please come?

675
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:18,204
I apparently stabbedmy husband with a knife.

676
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:21,165
(exasperated sigh)

677
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,383
(Chakhee sighs deeply)

678
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,679
(car beeping in hazard)

679
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:40,977
(pensive music)

680
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:46,607
(exhales seriously)

681
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:06,335
JUNGHA
SEE YOU AGAIN

682
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:08,671
HYUNSIK: You want meto settle with Yoon Youngju?

683
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:09,589
CHAKHEE: Yes.

684
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:13,092
You should settle the case for 50 million
along with her reinstatement.

685
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:16,053
(scoffs)
Forget all this nonsense, man.

686
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:20,641
If I let these wenches have their way,
there's no way I can run my business.

687
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:21,934
What's wrong?

688
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:24,270
You don't think you can win?

689
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:27,064
-I can.
-Then what's the problem?

690
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:28,900
There's a precondition for me to win.

691
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:30,943
Please confirm that I'm not

692
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,988
your personal attorney,
but for Kangsung Pharm.

693
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:36,866
Which one will cost me less?

694
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:38,409
The attorney for Kangsung.

695
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,914
I don't care. Do whatever will cost less.

696
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,042
Make sure you win this case.

697
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:47,877
Yes, sir.

698
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:55,384
You have stated that the plaintiff
habitually came to work late

699
00:41:55,468 --> 00:41:56,969
and didn't show proper conduct at work.

700
00:41:57,053 --> 00:41:59,221
Then why did you give her
the highest grade

701
00:41:59,305 --> 00:42:01,807
in every single quarterly evaluation?

702
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:04,727
On top of that, the plaintiff
had received earlier this year...

703
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,686
SIBAEK: Right here.

704
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:08,397
She even received a bonus
for excellent performance.

705
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,441
(paper rustles)

706
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:11,901
Those numbers are meaningless.

707
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:15,738
It's our custom
to give a perfect score to everyone.

708
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,991
It's...

709
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:21,827
So it's meaningless.

710
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:23,913
SIBAEK: That's the case, everyone.

711
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,373
Wait.

712
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:29,126
The plaintiff had awful conduct
at work and lied habitually.

713
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,004
So it wouldn't have been strange
for her to be fired at any time.

714
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:37,301
Yet you gave her a meaningless
perfect score and even a bonus?

715
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:41,764
Don't you think the witness himself
should be reevaluated for his bad conduct?

716
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:42,890
Your Honor.

717
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:44,934
JUDGE: Attorney.

718
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:49,105
SIBAEK: Yes.

719
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:57,196
As evidence, I submit the evaluation form

720
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:59,824
where you will find
the plaintiff's usual conduct at work.

721
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:02,034
As you can see,

722
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,163
the plaintiff had always received the best
evaluation from her immediate superior.

723
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:10,835
She had no motive
to falsify a report out of spite.

724
00:43:11,544 --> 00:43:13,379
On top of that, the defendant asserted

725
00:43:13,462 --> 00:43:16,424
that the plaintiff demanded money
in return for her false report.

726
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:20,302
However, there is no evidence anywhere
that proves she demanded money.

727
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:25,391
The plaintiff made an anonymous report
because she couldn't turn a blind eye

728
00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:27,727
to the serious side effects
of her company's product.

729
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:31,313
As a result, she was unfairly fired.

730
00:43:32,398 --> 00:43:35,985
If a whistleblower such as our plaintiff
is treated this way by the public

731
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:39,947
then who will stand up for justice?

732
00:43:41,824 --> 00:43:42,950
Who?

733
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:48,873
I rest my case.

734
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:55,046
COURT OF KOREA

735
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:00,301
Witness.

736
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:04,930
In the last quarter, you received
the top score for your evaluation.

737
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:05,931
Is that correct?

738
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,349
Yes.

739
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:11,771
Do you believe you were worthy
of such a score?

740
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:15,066
-Sorry?
-According to your colleagues,

741
00:44:15,149 --> 00:44:17,818
you often came late and left early.

742
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:21,030
CHAKHEE: However, your superior
Director Park Hyungchul,

743
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:25,951
gave you the top score on your evaluation
and thus helped you receive a bonus.

744
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:28,412
Not only that, but he also gave you
the ID and password

745
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:30,414
that gave you access
to confidential information.

746
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:33,876
Why do you think Director Park Hyungchul
would have done such a thing?

747
00:44:36,212 --> 00:44:38,089
I'm not so sure...

748
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,507
By any chance...

749
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:43,177
are you two in a special relationship?

750
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,386
SIBAEK: Your Honor.

751
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,888
She's leading the witness.

752
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:47,306
Attorney.

753
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:49,308
(serious music)

754
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:52,561
CHAKHEE: Witness.

755
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:56,398
At 2 a.m. on the 23rd of last month,

756
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:59,985
you were with a man
at the Grand Hotel, correct?

757
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:06,534
For the past year,
you've been having an affair with him.

758
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:07,618
SIBAEK: Your Honor.

759
00:45:07,993 --> 00:45:10,996
Her private life and her unfair dismissal
from Kangsung Pharm

760
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,623
have nothing to do with each other.

761
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:14,083
The defendant's attorney

762
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:18,337
is attacking the plaintiff's honor
by using her unrelated personal life.

763
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:19,755
JUDGE: Attorney.

764
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:22,341
Please get to your point.

765
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:25,052
Who were you with inside your hotel room?

766
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:38,983
Let me answer on her behalf.

767
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:42,236
The man she's been having
an affair with for the past year,

768
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,906
the man she was with
at the Grand Hotel on the 23rd is...

769
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,874
CEO Cho Hyunsik
of Kangsung Pharm.

770
00:45:54,957 --> 00:45:57,585
(indistinct murmuring and gasps)

771
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,049
Your Honor.

772
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:06,051
A month before the plaintiff's dismissal,

773
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:08,971
Kangsung CEO Cho Hyunsik had demanded
that they end their relationship.

774
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:11,015
So the witness had held
a grudge against him

775
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:13,851
and decided to make
a false report as revenge.

776
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:16,270
JUDGE: Witness.

777
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:18,480
Is this all true?

778
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,234
(sighs)

779
00:46:23,986 --> 00:46:25,279
Answer the question.

780
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:32,119
Yes.

781
00:46:33,162 --> 00:46:34,830
(chattering)

782
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:42,254
But it's true that
the birth control pills have side effects.

783
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:43,881
I definitely heard it.

784
00:46:43,964 --> 00:46:46,759
At least one person committed suicide
due to the side effects,

785
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:49,011
and two people started having
troubling incidents.

786
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:51,597
I heard the director calling the CEO...

787
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:54,391
I saw papers on the side effects too!

788
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:58,646
Did you overhear their phone conversation
in room 1014 of the Grand Hotel?

789
00:47:05,152 --> 00:47:06,237
Your Honor.

790
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,073
There's no record of the conversation
she supposedly overheard.

791
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:12,243
CHAKHEE: The papers
she saw also do not exist.

792
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:15,329
There is no evidence of the side effects
of the birth control pill.

793
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:19,333
But the plaintiff has a perfect motive
to make a false report

794
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,335
against Kangsung Pharm.

795
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:22,753
I rest my case.

796
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:27,591
(mouthing expletives)

797
00:47:33,347 --> 00:47:34,598
-Damn you!
-(hard slap)

798
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:36,684
GIDO: Uncle.

799
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:38,727
Are you insane?

800
00:47:38,811 --> 00:47:41,188
I'm about to get divorced
from my wife because of you!

801
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:45,150
If your wife wants a divorce,
it's not because of me.

802
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:47,152
It's because you had an affair.

803
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:49,571
-What now? You little...
-You need to stop.

804
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:51,865
CHAKHEE: Mr. Cho.

805
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:53,075
If the trial gets prolonged,

806
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:56,996
the media will latch on the side effects
of the pills whether they are true or not.

807
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:59,665
Once people begin
to talk about the side effects,

808
00:47:59,748 --> 00:48:01,041
it'll obviously hinder sales.

809
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:05,045
If the sales drop,
how much will your company suffer?

810
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:07,673
Your alimony will cost you much less.

811
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:10,050
You might even be able
to reconcile with your wife

812
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:12,761
with a new handbag,
just as you always have.

813
00:48:12,928 --> 00:48:14,471
How dare you talk back to me...

814
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:16,515
Uncle. She's right.

815
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:18,017
You said it yourself.

816
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,185
You said she had to win
at the lowest cost possible.

817
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:21,854
I didn't tell her to win it like this.

818
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,648
Let's go get some lunch.

819
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:26,066
HYUNSIK: But...

820
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:28,110
-Damn it. That little...
-Let's go.

821
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:29,153
Good work.

822
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:34,366
(tense music)

823
00:48:37,077 --> 00:48:38,412
Interesting.

824
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:44,626
BYUNGCHUN: Goodness.

825
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,754
You aren't bruised.

826
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:48,672
Did it hurt a lot?

827
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:51,425
I'm fine.

828
00:48:53,385 --> 00:48:56,764
How can you slap her like that
just because you got angry?

829
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:58,307
Byungchun.

830
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:02,061
My wife is about to divorce me
because of what she did.

831
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:03,896
Why is that because of her?

832
00:49:03,979 --> 00:49:07,274
-It's because you had an affair.
-Man, seriously.

833
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:11,111
If he ever does that to you again,
you can call me.

834
00:49:12,196 --> 00:49:13,489
Okay.

835
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:19,703
You're choosing a new partner soon, right?

836
00:49:20,454 --> 00:49:21,663
GIDO: Yes.

837
00:49:21,747 --> 00:49:24,541
Chakhee and Ma Sanghan
are the candidates.

838
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:25,793
Let Chakhee do it.

839
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:30,672
Ma Sanghan isn't any better
than Chakhee at anything he does.

840
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,883
How did he become a candidate?

841
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:35,094
This girl has zero background.

842
00:49:36,136 --> 00:49:40,224
She was never qualified to work here,
but you insisted on giving her a job.

843
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:41,392
BYUNGCHUN: "Background"?

844
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:43,185
What background?

845
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:45,270
Because she went to law school
outside of Seoul?

846
00:49:45,354 --> 00:49:46,688
Because she's a woman?

847
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:49,108
She's the granddaughter
of your housekeeper.

848
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,486
She was a mere maid
at your vacation house.

849
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,488
Because you keep acting like this,

850
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:56,949
she thinks she's really
your granddaughter or something.

851
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:59,326
She doesn't know her place
and keeps acting up.

852
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:02,621
There's even a rumor
that she's actually your granddaughter.

853
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:05,249
If that's the rumor,
then let people continue to believe it.

854
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:06,250
Oh, come on.

855
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,252
HYUNSIK: Byungchun.

856
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:12,297
If you keep insisting she can't do it
because of her background...

857
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:15,259
BYUNGCHUN: Then okay, fine.

858
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:17,845
Then how's this for her proper background?

859
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:20,013
Chakhee.

860
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:24,309
Do you want Grandpa's shares?

861
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:29,565
Should I give you my shares?

862
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:35,112
(uneasy music)

863
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:41,660
JUNGHA DISTRICT COURT PUBLIC DEFENDER

864
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:43,620
SIBAEK (softly): Ms. Kim Minyoung.

865
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:47,040
Is there anyone else you remember?

866
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,336
YOUNGJU: No. That's about everything
I heard on the phone call.

867
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,965
When I opened the file
on the side effects,

868
00:50:55,048 --> 00:50:57,843
I thought I should download it first,
then read it over later,

869
00:50:57,926 --> 00:50:59,386
so I didn't get a good look.

870
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,139
That's my biggest regret.

871
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,725
No, don't worry. It's okay.

872
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:08,562
SIBAEK: We can first meet
with the people on this list to see

873
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:11,773
if we can start a class action
to get compensation for the side effects.

874
00:51:12,482 --> 00:51:13,942
Have some coffee.

875
00:51:14,026 --> 00:51:15,694
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

876
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:19,448
BIRTH CONTROL PILL
CLINICAL TRIAL PLAN APPROVAL

877
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:21,700
Wait, this person...

878
00:51:22,743 --> 00:51:23,660
What is it, Mr. Do?

879
00:51:23,744 --> 00:51:26,121
She's the owner of the snack bar

880
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:29,249
who recently stabbed
her husband with a knife.

881
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:34,963
(haunting music)

882
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:36,381
SIBAEK: Lee Soonyoung...

883
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:39,801
(knocks on door)

884
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:41,720
(doorknob clanks)

885
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,487
JANGSAN LAW FIRM

886
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,738
GIDO: Where is Grandpa?

887
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:01,323
CHAKHEE: He went home safely.

888
00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:04,076
GIDO: What do you think?

889
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:08,455
Do you want... Grandpa's shares?

890
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:11,458
No.

891
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:14,169
I've never even thought of that…

892
00:52:14,253 --> 00:52:15,128
GIDO: Why not?

893
00:52:17,422 --> 00:52:18,423
Dream big.

894
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:20,592
You're more than worthy.

895
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,137
I'll do my best.

896
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:29,226
I liked your little performance
with Kwak Sanggu.

897
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:32,729
Sorry?

898
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:34,815
What an unbelievable coincidence.

899
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:38,777
He decides to barge in
and put on a show right on the day

900
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,238
the management committee
was discussing the partnership.

901
00:52:44,491 --> 00:52:45,325
CHAKHEE: I'm sorry.

902
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:46,743
No, great job.

903
00:52:47,786 --> 00:52:51,081
Thanks to the show, people found out
that your timesheet was real.

904
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:53,041
You took a detour,
made an irrational move,

905
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:56,837
and got slapped by the client,
yet you managed to win the case.

906
00:52:57,754 --> 00:53:00,841
You know that Cho Hyunsik will be a part
of the management committee, right?

907
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:02,509
Yes.

908
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:05,929
Finish up the Kangsung trial.

909
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:08,348
Then the partnership will be yours.

910
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:11,935
His company will win the trial.

911
00:53:13,312 --> 00:53:15,397
(dark music)

912
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:21,403
That's only for the trial
to nullify her dismissal.

913
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:26,575
(rustles)

914
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:32,205
This is the file Yoon Youngju saw
on the side effects of the pill.

915
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:34,541
(dramatic music)

916
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:35,751
I see.

917
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:38,128
Everything she saw and heard is true.

918
00:53:38,754 --> 00:53:40,922
Kangsung's pill does come
with side effects,

919
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:43,091
like auditory, visual hallucinations,
and delirium.

920
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:47,512
Kangsung Pharm has only found
about four or five cases thus far.

921
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:49,181
There's no telling how many there are.

922
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:54,227
The police have yet to connect
the cases to the side effects of the pill.

923
00:53:56,188 --> 00:53:58,148
We must stop it before they do.

924
00:54:00,692 --> 00:54:02,277
In Jungha recently,

925
00:54:02,361 --> 00:54:05,822
an owner of a snack bar
stabbed her husband with a knife.

926
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:11,036
She participated in the clinical trial
held before the launching of the product.

927
00:54:12,746 --> 00:54:15,332
(tense music)

KANGSUNG PHARM CONFIDENTIAL

929
00:54:18,877 --> 00:54:20,003
GIDO: Do you recognize her?

930
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:23,090
I heard you spent a few years together
in the children's home.

931
00:54:23,548 --> 00:54:24,549
Yes, you're right.

932
00:54:25,592 --> 00:54:26,927
Meet with her.

933
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:32,391
Meet her and find a motive
for her to want to kill her husband.

934
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,976
GIDO: If you can't do that,
settle with her.

935
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,561
Shut Lee Soonyoung's mouth

936
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:39,231
before the media or the police
begin to talk about the pills.

937
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:43,527
Can you do that?

938
00:54:45,946 --> 00:54:46,988
I think...

939
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:50,992
I can do this.

940
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:56,206
(intense music)

941
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:07,634

SOONYOUNG (relieved chuckle):
Thank you, Chakhee.

946
00:55:37,998 --> 00:55:39,875
I knew you would come for me.

947
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,460
Soonyoung, listen up.

948
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:47,132
Do you want to get out of here?

949
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:51,178
Yes.

950
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:53,805
Do you want to save
your kids and your husband?

951
00:55:58,268 --> 00:55:59,895
Then can you do as I say?

952
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:02,564
Anything.

953
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:05,817
I'll do anything you say, Chakhee.

954
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:11,573
(tense music)

955
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:26,796
Kill yourself.

Hello?

00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:51,988
OFFICER: Is thisMs. Lee Soonyoung's attorney?

960
00:56:56,117 --> 00:56:56,993
Yes.

961
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,870
I'm Ms. Lee Soonyoung's attorney.

962
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:02,791
OFFICER: Ms. Lee attemptedto take her own life earlier this morning.

963
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,086
(dramatic music)

964
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:07,170
Did she die?

965
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:13,593
Yes, I understand. I'll do that.

966
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:22,394
(exhales)

967
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:27,190
JANGSAN LAW FIRM

968
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:39,869
(knocks on door)

969
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,962
Wow.

970
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:52,382
(loud clapping, laughs)

971
00:57:53,049 --> 00:57:56,636
How did you do it?
So Lee Soonyoung tried to kill herself?

972
00:57:57,429 --> 00:58:01,391
I only explained everything
she was about to experience in the future.

973
00:58:01,474 --> 00:58:05,186
If she heard
what you'd do to win that case...

974
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,148
I'd kill myself too.

975
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:10,150
GIDO: Good work.

976
00:58:10,984 --> 00:58:13,403
The partnership will be announced
in a few days, so get ready.

977
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:15,322
Thank you.

978
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:16,531
HYUNSIK: However...

979
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:21,536
I want your hands off the Kangsung case.

980
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:24,706
I don't know if you're crazy
for money or the position,

981
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:27,125
but one irrational decision was enough.

982
00:58:28,835 --> 00:58:30,545
-Mr. Cho.
-I'm making you partner

983
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:32,255
because of your commendable efforts.

984
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:33,423
So...

985
00:58:35,508 --> 00:58:38,011
you better be grateful, okay?

986
00:58:38,637 --> 00:58:39,638
HYUNSIK: Go now.

987
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:42,098
Yes, sir.

for Jangsan's future the next 25 years.

998
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:35,610
For the last seven years,

999
00:59:35,944 --> 00:59:38,363
this attorney has never spared
her energy or heart for Jangsan

1000
00:59:38,446 --> 00:59:40,949
and showed only the best performance.

ATTORNEY NOH, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR PARTNERSHIP PROMOTION!

1006
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:21,281
I could open up
with how I don't deserve this position...

1007
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:24,868
but I won't bore you
with that kind of empty talk.

1008
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,953
CHAKHEE: The last seven years,

1009
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:30,081
I worked harder than anyone
to stand here today.

1010
01:00:31,499 --> 01:00:33,835
I will be working even harder from now on

1011
01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:38,089
to fulfill my responsibilities and duties
as a partner at Jangsan,

1012
01:00:38,673 --> 01:00:40,467
so that my efforts won't be in vain.

1013
01:00:40,925 --> 01:00:44,554
I will more proactively understand
the needs of our clients

1014
01:00:44,637 --> 01:00:47,766
to provide them
with the utmost legal service...

1015
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:49,017
Ms. Noh Chakhee.
