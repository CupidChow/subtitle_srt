Mr. Do. Would you please give me
Ms. Choi Yoonjung's address?

14
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,381
She won't answer.
I should go and get her myself.

15
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,133
Yes, I'll send it to you right now.

This is Attorney Noh Chakhee.

DAEHAN: This is Daehan.

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,231
Hi. You must have gotten
my number from the director.

20
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,025
-You know who I am, right?
-DAEHAN: Yes.

21
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,236
You're my mom's lawyer friend.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,364
I got the birthday gift you sent me.

23
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,366
Thank you.

24
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,617
It was my pleasure.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,661
I'm going to find a place
for you guys to stay.

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,622
And you'll be able to see
your mom soon, so don't worry.

27
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,374
Take good care of your sister.

28
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,167
I'll come to see you this weekend.

29
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,796
All right. Yes, call me
if you need anything.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,464
All right.

31
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,715

(paper rustles)

35
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,729
Mr. Jwa.

36
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,772
Yes?

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,108
Are you free this weekend?

38
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,612
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,365
What does that mean?

40
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,287
It means my answer will be different
depending on what you need my time for.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,039
What is this, Schrödinger's cat?

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,002
No. It's Schrödinger's Shih Tzu.
Why do you ask about this weekend?

43
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,547
If you're free, can you come with me
to the children's home?

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,215
I'm going to go see Soonyoung's kids.

45
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,430
I thought her children
were staying with their neighbor.

46
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,514
Exactly.

47
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,559
That's what I thought, so I paid her
a million won every month.

48
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,812
Then she sends the kids away
without even discussing it with me.

49
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,647
I don't think
she was even going to tell me

50
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,608
if I hadn't visited them
for Daehan's birthday.

51
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,613
Which children's home are they staying at?

52
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,782

-(phone vibrates)

56
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,501
How did an orphanage director
end up like this?

57
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,671
Hey. How did it go?

58
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,465
DETECTIVE 2: We went
to the director's house.

59
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,383
There was no sign of intrusion.

60
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,220
But one of the boys
from the children's home

61
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,347
was found asleep
in the director's house this morning.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,224
A boy from the home? How old is he?

63
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,350
Is he in high school?

64
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,809
DETECTIVE 2: No, he's ten.

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,977
Ten?

66
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,023
(haunting music)

67

KYUNGJIN: You know this person, right?

68
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,820
Who is she?

69
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,950
The lawyer for Kangsung Pharmaceuticals.

70
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,035
KYUNGJIN: You know him too, right?

71
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,119
Yes.

72
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,707
He was my attorney. Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

73
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:16,673
How did Attorney Jwa Sibaek
come to represent your case?

74
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,758
(Youngju sighs)

75
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,179
After I got fired,
I didn't know what to do.

76
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,683
I was thinking about hiring a lawyer,

77
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,977
and that's when I got a call
from Attorney Jwa.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,896
YOUNGJU: He said
he'd take my case for free.

79
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,234
(serious music)

80
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,862
Are you saying he contacted you first?

81
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,906
Yes.

82
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,995
Is that a problem?

83
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,162
Did Mr. Jwa Sibaek...

84
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,500
know about your affair
with Mr. Cho Hyunsik?

85
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,420
(embarrassed sigh)

86
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,423
No. I never told anyone about that,

87
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,136
but the lawyer for Kangsung
somehow found out and used it in court.

88
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,432
You're saying Attorney Noh Chakhee
revealed that fact in court?

89
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,934
Yes.

90
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,019
That's how...

91
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,063
YOUNGJU: And I saw it.

92
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,191
Mr. Cho slapped her
across the face after the trial.

93
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,986
Attorney Jwa saw it too
as we were leaving the court.

-(door closes)
-Hello.

96
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,203
(phone vibrates)

97
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,542
Yes, Sungtae.

98
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,501
SUNGTAE: Kyungjin.

99
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,628
I'm in Jeongha right now,

100
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,590
and the scene reminds me
of the golf course murder case.

101
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,050
Who's the victim?

102
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,844
SUNGTAE: Director of a children's home.
He was found on the beach.

103
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,138
He was tied up with nylon rope

104
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,599
and died by drowning too,
just like the other cases.

105
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,769
But he had a different social background
and resided in a different city.

106
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,480
I don't think
we can call this a serial murder.

107
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,107
(sighs)
Right. Thanks, I'll go down there myself.

108
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,485
-Bye.
-(phone beeps)

109
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,653
"There seems to be
a gap between the law and reality.

110
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,155
I will take it into consideration."

111
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,824
If the judge says that,
you're off the hook.

112
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,867
I see.

113
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,371
They don't sell general insurance to
forklift drivers. That's not your fault.

114
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,330
Right, yes.

115
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,041
Although a suspended sentence
means you're guilty,

116
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,250
at least there isn't a fine.

117
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,045
Right, thank you.
I better get going, then.

118
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,004
Just one thing.

119
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,422
-Yes?
-CHAKHEE: Well...

120
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,843
The press might want
to interview you later.

121
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,054
If they do, please tell them
about how grateful you felt

122
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,681
because of all the hard work
I put in on your behalf.

123
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,808
Tell them honestly.

124
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,060
Okay. Well, call me, then. Bye.

125
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,771

CHAKHEE: What?

130
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,617
Why do I have so many messages?

131
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,286
DO YOUNGSOO

132
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,580
-Yes, Mr. Do.
-YOUNGSOO: Ms. Noh.

133
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,082
Are you done with the trial?

134
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,751
Yes, it just ended.
By the way, did something happen?

135
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,921
Well, someone just posted
a rumor about you online.

136
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,883
-A rumor?
-They didn't mention you by name.

137
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,137
But it's pretty obvious
that they're talking about you.

138
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,848
I'll send you the link right now.

139
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,392
(exhales)

140
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,476
What...

141
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,895
What rumor?

142
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,230
What's going on?

143
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,983
WHO KILLED CHO HYUNSIK,
AN AFFAIR WITH HIS LAWYER?

144
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,484
MAN: That lawyer worked at Jang***

145
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,486
-for seven or eight years.
-What the hell is this?

146
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,240
MAN: During that time, she handled
all of Kangsung Pharmacy's cases.

147
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,327
She actually won a case
right before Cho Hyunsik was murdered.

148
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,663
(chuckles)
And do you know how she did it?

149
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:42,128
She revealed Cho's affair
with his secretary right there in court...

150
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,463
(sighs)

151

JANGSAN LAW FIRM
CEO JANG GIDO

152
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,135
We'll need to use Noh Chakhee soon,
but this will totally ruin her image.

153
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,387
We can always find a substitute.

154
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,980
The fact that we've been cleaning up after
Kangsung Pharm won't do us any good.

155
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,233
If Chakhee takes the fall for it,
that's a good thing for us.

156
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,530
While people chew her out
about an affair and all,

157
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,492
I will continue to work on the retrial,

158
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,871
and all of our lawsuits
in favor of corporations

159
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,998
will become Attorney Noh Chakhee's...

personal agenda.

00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,799
Gido.
(sucks teeth)

162
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,220
You didn't do this, did you?

163
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,931
Does it matter who did it?

164
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,433
(phone vibrates)

165
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,026
Hello?

166
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,447
I got it.

167
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,535
(breathes deeply)

168
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,580
Your plan to build your image
at the children's home may not happen.

169
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,379
The director was found murdered.

170
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,839
DAEHYEON: That was
his employee on the phone.

171
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,008
She asked if we could still come and film.

172
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,184
Tell her we'll be there.

173
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,520
(serious music)

174
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,605
Are you sure?

175
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,232
Their director was murdered.

176
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,944
The kids lost their father.

177
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,737
For the second time.

178
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,575
GIDO: They lost their birth father
and now their father figure.

179
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:42,081
"Assemblyman Jang Gido shall become
the children's dependable shield."

180
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,835
(rustles)

181
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,295
(blows air)

182
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,132
(yells)
Ms. Noh!

183
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,342
(groans)

184
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,137
Come on, not in the office.

185
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,264
Sorry.

186
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,351
Jeez, you can't smoke in here.

187
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,146
Man, I'm going to sue all of them.

188
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,023
Those bastards. Cho Hyunsik and I...

189
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,984
They entangled me
with Cho Hyunsik of all people?

190
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,944
(agitated exhale)

191
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,950
I'll shut down the channel
for spreading false information,

192
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,535
so don't worry.

193
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,162
(sighs)

194
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,915
He's just a gossip influencer
with no actual impact.

195
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,961
Once he's sued, he'll change his attitude
in an instant and apologize.

196
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,671
But what happens until then?

197
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,258
People believe what they want to believe.
Something interesting and scandalous.

198
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,177
Why should I be
their topic of conversation?

199
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,637
My only crime is working hard.

200
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,555
(exasperated sigh)

201
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,101
Maybe your crime is that
you worked too hard at Jangsan.

202
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,897
Are you picking a fight with me?

203
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
No.

204
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,655
I'm sorry. That was insensitive of me.
I shouldn't have said that.

205
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,991
SIBAEK: The police are on the case,
so the murderer will be caught soon.

206
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,576
Then their motive will come to light,

207
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,453
and the public attention
will shift to that.

208
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,998
This won't last long.
It'll blow over soon, so don't worry.

209
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,209
Man.

210
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,878
Who the hell killed Cho Hyunsik?

211
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,214
(Chakhee sighs)

212
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,388
(munching)

213
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,974
(slurps)

214
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,228
(serious music)

215
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,944
I don't know why, but I'm always hungry.

217
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,070
Would you like some more?

218
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,489
No, it's okay. I've had enough.

219
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,079
So what next?

220
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,206
CHISIK: Should I take you home?

221
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,001
Do you know where I live?

222
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,962
Yes.

223
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,090
I...

224
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,552
can't remember anything.

225
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,053
That's okay.

226
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,932
You'll remember soon. You always do.

227
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,810
When you wake up or...

228
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,396
all of a sudden while eating.

229
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,318
-Do you really think so?
-If you want,

230
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,697
I can take you to a doctor right now.

231
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,073
No.

232
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,494
I want to go home.

233
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,622
Sure.

234
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,419
Listen.

235
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,422
Why are you so nice to me?

236
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,842
DALJAE: When I think about
what would've happened to me

237
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,844
if you hadn't been here

238
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,514
every time I lost my memories...

239
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,184
I guess it's because I've
been through the same thing.

240
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,397
That room.

241
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,025
(dark music)

242
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,860
That room where everything
is painted black

243
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,612
so you can't even tell
if it's day or night.

244
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,530
-(grunts)
-(water burbling)

245
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,950
The stench of the bathwater.

246
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,911
(burbles)

247
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,915
The stench of your own blood.

248
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,124
(panting)

249
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,170
The continuous vomiting from fear.

250
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,588
(gasping for air)

251
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,340
CHISIK: That room.

252
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,676
And the beast-like shrieks

253
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,054
-coming from the next room.
-(yelling)

255

But above all, Mr. Kim.

256
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,103
(cigarette sizzles)

257
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,694
The smell of Mr. Kim's cigarettes.

258
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,113
(haunting music)

259

(Daljae wretches)

260
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,997
It's okay.

261
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,624
(Daljae vomits)

262
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,501
You're going to be okay.

263
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,673
Those bastards
will pay for what they've done.

264
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,972
(dark music)

265
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,306
"Those bastards"?

266
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,185
The bastards who made you into a fool
who can't even remember...

267
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,397
his own name.

268
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,566

Can I help you?

00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,309
Yes.

281
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,728
Hello. I'm a police officer.

282
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,356
I'd like to ask you
a few more questions about the case.

283
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,024
PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID, YOO KYUNGJIN
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

284
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,988
-Here.
-Gosh.

285
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,823
Thank you.

286
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,700
(slurps)

287
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,494
(both sigh)

288
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,204
(sucks teeth)

289
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,123
I already told the detectives
everything I know this morning.

290
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,251
They talked to
the other employees as well.

291
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,505
Yes, I know. We just want to be thorough.

292
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,257
Do you...

293
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,680
recognize this person, by any chance?

294
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,101
He was here a few days ago.

295
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,061
You met him?

296
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,481
He came to make a donation.

297
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,150
Siba...

298
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,153
It's not that.

299
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,699
His name sounded like a swear word.
What was it again?

300
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,242
Sibaek. Jwa Sibaek.

301
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,119
Yes, you're right. Sibaek.

302
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,038
He even had an uncommon last name,
and he said he was a lawyer.

303
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,290
Ah...

304
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,252
KYUNGJIN: So you saw him.

305
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,714
(rustles)

306
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,803

307
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,862
CHAKHEE: Are you having
a campfire or something?

308
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,741
SIBAEK: Yes.

309
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,285
Soon, it'll be time to light a candle

310
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,163
and write a thank you letter
to your parents.

311
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,664
Do you want to join me?

312
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,501
I can't. I don't have any.

313
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,297
Did they pass away?

314
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,215
No.

315
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,843
I've got nothing to thank them for.

316
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,179
(chuckles)

317
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,513
That sounds like you.

318
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,850
What about you, Mr. Jwa?

319
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,268
Are your parents alive?

320
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,188
No.

321
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:50,736
CHAKHEE: I have nothing to thank them for,
and you don't have parents to write to.

322
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,655
What's next on the program?

323
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,032
Let me guess.

324
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,742
A foot washing ceremony?

325
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,203
No.

What is this, the 1980s?

328
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,712
The 1980s?

329
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,465
Yes.

330
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,841
The '80s.

331
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,927
It still is...

332
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,097
somewhere.

333
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,849

SEONGGANG HOSPITAL

335
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,689
Thank you.

336
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,691
Since Yoon Seokgu is dead,

337
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,401
you can't file a criminal suit
against him.

338
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,654
But you can file a lawsuit for damages.

339
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,990
Unless his son gives up his inheritance,

340
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,326
I'm going to see it through,
so please don't worry.

341
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,912
Just focus on recovering.

342
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,668
I'll call you when the lawsuit
is set in motion.

343
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,171
Naeun really needs this help.

344
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,508
She has no parents and so she supports
her younger sibling by herself.

345
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,011
She has to be
compensated for this, Mr. Jwa.

346
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,430
Of course. Please don't worry.

347
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,766
Thank you, Mr. Jwa.

348
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,643
Thank you so much.

349
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,771
I think...

350
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,065
that bastard got what he deserved.

351
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,319
I don't know who killed him,

352
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,114
but I'm grateful to them.

353

(scoffs)

355
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,299
Maybe your crime is that
you worked too hard at Jangsan.

356
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,593
(sighs)

357
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,680
As if his hands are completely clean.

358

-What?
-Look here.

361
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,939
PANSEOK: Miss Noh.

362
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,691
-What is this?
-(rustles)

363
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,696
The government expects me
to pay two million won?

364
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,034
I told you that you needed to come in
for counseling, or that you'd be fined.

365
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,369
I'm not going to pay for this.

366
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,579
PANSEOK: No.

367
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,291
I'll starve to death if I do! Good God.

368
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,043
No. I can't pay for this.

369
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,171
I don't care if you sue me or kill me.

370
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,631
My God.

371
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,966
(Panseok throws tantrum)

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,135
(groans)
So much drama every day.

373
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,054
God.

374
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,680
Throwing a tantrum won't help you.

375
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,016
They'll seize your property
if you don't pay.

376
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,394
I can't. I don't have any money.

377
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,482
I don't have a penny
to my name. Dear God...

378
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,943
(sobbing)

379
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,946
Sir.

380
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,909
My, you must be very upset.

381
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,328
Sir, did you have lunch?

382
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,874
Not yet.

383
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,169
SIBAEK: You shouldn't skip meals.

384
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,296
Mr. Do. Order some sundae soup, will you?

385
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,508
Here.

386
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,343
Thanks.

387
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,846
You haven't eaten anything today?

388
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,390
PANSEOK: No.

389
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,476
-(chopsticks clink)
-Here. You can have some of mine too.

390
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,561
-Thank you.
-Sure.

391
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,854
-Here.
-PANSEOK: You should eat.

392
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,857
-No way. I'm so full, you know.
-Okay.

393
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,777
-SIBAEK: I already had a big lunch.
-PANSEOK: Go on and eat. Okay.

394
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,904
So you're saying
you didn't send the pictures, right?

395
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,947
That's right.

396
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,783
Someone must have hacked
into your phone, then.

397
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,576
Don't worry.

398
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,413
I'll look into the whole thing again.

399
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,040
-PANSEOK: I feel relieved now.
-SIBAEK: Right.

400
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,044
You see, you just got
a heartless person as your lawyer.

401
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,047
Some people are like that, sir.

402
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,217
-You know, they're cold by nature.
-PANSEOK: Right.

403
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,677
Please, eat up.

404
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,185
Sir. I know it's unfair,
but the sentence is already finalized.

405
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,938
So you need to pay the fine.
But don't worry.

406
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,941
You don't need to pay it all at once.
You can pay it in installments.

407
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,403
I will ask the prosecutor,
so you can pay it little by little.

408
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,364
And if that's still too hard for you,

409
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:09,119
I'll contact social services
and figure out a way to help you.

410
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,121
So don't worry too much, sir.

411
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,290
(exhales in disbelief)

412
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:19,880
Mr. Lawyer, God bless you.
I hope you stay healthy and strong.

413
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,049
Thank you so much.

414
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,053
My pleasure, sir. Take care.

415
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:26,970
PANSEOK: Yes.

416

-This way. Yes.
-PANSEOK: Yes.

417

SIBAEK: Please get home safely, sir.

418
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,560
YOUNGSOO: I'll walk him out.

419

(exhales)

420
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,273
Did you have to make me out
to be a bad person like that?

421
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,317
CHAKHEE: I'm Miss Noh
and you're Mr. Lawyer?

422
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,279
I was going to explain everything
to Mr. Kang like you did.

423
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,782
But I couldn't reach him,
and he wouldn't come for counseling.

424
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,659
And today, you had to butt in
and beat me to it.

425
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,203
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,955
You're a great public defender.

427
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,583
But because I'm far kinder than you are,

428
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:01,546
I made you look like a relatively ordinary
and coldhearted defender.

429
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,006
-Sorry.
-Oh, my God.

430
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,885
Well, it's like you're
the third smartest kid at school,

431
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,847
but your classmate is number one
in the entire country.

432
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,641
I'm so sorry, but I love...

433
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,102
-Oh, no.
-Have you gone crazy?

434
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,145
I'm so jealous of you, you know.

435
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,688
You're constantly learning firsthand

436
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,526
what it is to be a good public defender
by working with me every day.

437
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,946
Whereas I had no one to learn from,
so I had to teach myself.

438
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,281
What's the matter with you today?

439
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,617
Come on.
Make me a cup of coffee, will you?

440
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,576
Why should I?

441
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,039
Look at how much you're growing
as a public defender, thanks to me.

442
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,834
It's the least you could do
in return, isn't it?

443
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,086
Don't even think about it.
I'm not making your coffee.

444
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,130
Come on. I got you coffee many times.

445
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,549
Iced decaf soy dolce latte.

446
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,426
Did I ever ask for it?

447
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,304
-Are you going in there to make coffee?
-I'm going to have Solomon's Seal tea.

450

from a café every time.

453
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,991
That's not very fair to me,
don't you think?

454

TAESIK: We need you
to come down to the home.

479

of a children's home in a country town,

480
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,150
they haven't made a connection

00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,488
I suppose not.

483
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,283
Park had a gambling problem.

484
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,536
He'd been a gambler for over 20 years.

485
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,788
He even borrowed money from loan sharks.

486
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,958
There's probably a lot of people
who want him dead.

487
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,419
You'll find plenty of motives
for his murder as you investigate.

488
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,256
Is that what you think?

489
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,466
Do you think the one
who killed Cho and Yoon

490
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,802
had nothing to do with this?

491
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,638
I'm not sure.

492
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,098
(anxious exhale)

493
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,724
(breathes deeply)

494
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,687
Well, Park Kangil was like a peasant.

495
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,651
He was close with Lee Dongpil.

496
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,029
I think I should look for him.

497
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,826
It couldn't hurt.

498
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,495
Lee Dongpil could be the next target.

499
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,375
While I look for him,
you keep an eye on the media.

500
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,752
JAEHO: See if there's
anyone prying into it.

501
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,462
Don't worry.

502
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:35,302
Whatever it is, it won't get out
until the election is over.

503
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,053
Of course, it shouldn't.

504
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,598
I'll call you once I look for Lee, then.

505
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,266
Okay.

506
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,851
(phone beeps)

507
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,604
(exhales)

508
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,022
(phone clacks)

509
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,129
GIDO: Lee Dongpil.

510
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,884
That Lee Dongpil
was a master at water torture.

511
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,723
"Lee Dongpil"?

512
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,391
Park Kangil was murdered.

513
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,687
The next target may be Lee.

514
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,858
As far as I can remember,
he went to prison in 1989 or 1990.

515
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,860
Find out what happened to him after that.

516
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,528
Yes, sir. I will.

517
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,030
What about Yoo Kyungjin?

518
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,948
Yes. I checked her background.

519
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,743
She lived in the countryside
until high school.

520
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,120
Then she went to the police academy
and became an officer.

521
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,665
Please take a look.

522
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,919
Her father is a public official,
and her mother is a high school teacher.

523
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,129
She's an only child,
has never been married,

524
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,589
and isn't seeing anyone right now.

525
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,927
She has no trouble
with money, family, or men.

526
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,970
No gambling or drinking problems either.

527
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,264
Did you dig enough?

528
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,519
Yes, I dug as deeply as I could,
but I didn't find anything.

529
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,478
She's...

530
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,522
completely straitlaced.

531
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,606
Jeez.

532
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,817
And the investigation?

533
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,486
I don't think they've made much progress.

534
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,239
They're looking into the people
that Cho Hyunsik and Yoon Seokgu met

535
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,908
right before they were killed.

536
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,829
(sighs)

537
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,588
Man...

538
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,550
-(door closes)
-KYUNGJIN: Mr. Yoon Dochang.

539
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,683
(groans)

540
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,936
What happened to your face?

541
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,605
Well, you know.

542
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,525
You seemed to have trouble walking too.

543
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,277
You were limping like this.

544
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
Yes, well...

545
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,488
I fell.

546
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,034
Hmm. I heard your father beat you a lot.

547
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,369
Who the hell said that?

548
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,620
Those bruises on your face.

549
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,998
The limping.

550
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,500
That's because
your father beat you, right?

551
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,381
Fine, he beat me. So what?

552
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,009
Why did he beat you?

553
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,261
(laughs)

554
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,929
Do I have to tell you that?

555
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,935
(sighs)

556
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,024
I couldn't properly
take care of my problem.

557
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:42,322
My housekeeper stole from me,
so I sued her, but I lost.

558
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,490
That's why he beat me.

559
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,576
He said that I was embarrassing him.

560
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,620
Hmm...

561
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,497
What about your face?

562
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:55,418
Did he beat your bum with a golf club
and your face with his fists?

563
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,128
That's right.

564
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,339
(sucks teeth)

565
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,758
If he was the kind of man
who'd hit his son because he was

566
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,301
embarrassed about losing a lawsuit,

567
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,886
he wouldn't have touched your face.

568
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,304
Because it shows.

569
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,181
Well, he apparently did that day!

570
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,224
Mr. Yoon Dochang.

571
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,604
Who hit you in the face?

572
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,024
(sighs)

573
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,202
-I'll wait here.
-(seat belt unlocks)

574
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,328
All right.

575
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,470
TEACHER: And who might you be?

576
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,723
I'm Kang Daehan's guardian.
Where's Daehan?

577
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,977
Ah. So you're saying

578
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,146
you found yourself in the director's house
when you woke up?

579
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,232
TAESIK: And you don't remember
how you got there?

580
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,193
Yes.

581
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,656
Who...

582
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,158
I'm Attorney Noh Chakhee,
Kang Daehan's guardian.

583
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,244
I see.

584
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,579
What is this?

585
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,248
Are you getting a testimony
from a minor without his guardian?

586
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:18,126
It's not a big deal.
I was just asking him a few questions.

587
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,713
You can talk to me now. I'm his lawyer.

588
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,674
Right.

589
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,389
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE
HAESONG CHILDREN'S HOME

590
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,391
The day the director was murdered,

591
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,603
Daehan was found asleep
in his house early that morning.

592
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,148
Yes. I know what you're thinking,
so we asked him about it.

593
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,775
But he says he doesn't remember
how he got there.

594
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,403
TAESIK: According to him,
he went to bed with his friends,

595
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,488
-but when he woke up, he was there.
-(sighs)

596
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,491
We also talked to the other kids,
but it doesn't look like

597
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,453
he was drugged or anything.

598
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,497
Daehan hasn't been
in this home for that long

599
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:01,210
and he says he had never woken up
in the director's house before.

600
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,298
So it's unlikely that
the director did something to him.

601
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,135
But I just wanted to ask him
if he heard anything.

602
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,094
You know?

603
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,640
But apparently, he was asleep
and didn't hear anything.

604
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,934
Well, that's all.

605
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,189
(sighs)

606
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,862
You can be honest with me, okay?

607
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,030
CHAKHEE: About anything.

608
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,115
You did nothing wrong.

609
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,827
I'm on your side no matter what, Daehan.

610
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,205
I'm your lawyer,
and my job is to protect you.

611
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,165
Okay?

612
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,751
Okay.

613
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,836
(exhales)

614
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,923
Why were you sleeping
in the director's house?

615
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,095
I don't remember.

616
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,098
I was sleeping with my friends.

617
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,560
I think someone carried me there.

618
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,397
Was it the director?

619
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,649
I don't know.

620
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,402
I thought I was dreaming.

621
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,821
DAEHAN: But when I woke up in the morning,

622
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,573
I was in his house.

623
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:18,287
When you were sleeping there,
you didn't see or hear anything, did you?

624
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,999
No.

625
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,710
(clears throat)

626
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,962
(exhales)

627
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:34,387
Did the director do anything to you...

628
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,015
I was just sleeping.

629
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,976
It's true.

630
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,602
Yes, all right.

631
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,855
All right, then.

632
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,482
(Chakhee sighs)

633
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,294
(clicks)

634
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,009
Daehan.

635
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,221
Wait here.

636
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,974
(car door closes)

637
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,147
(groans)

638
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,900
How do I face Soonyoung after this?

639
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,905
I'm sure she would know
that this wasn't your fault.

640
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,699
(exhales)

641
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,245
Are you okay?
Were you and Director Park...

642
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,458
Well, I don't know how this will sound,

643
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,086
but I didn't like him enough
to cry over his death.

644
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,507
But I do feel bad to hear how he passed.

645
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,135
All right, then.

646
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,012
(breathes deeply)

647
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,014
Anyway, what do I do with the kids?

648
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,935
CHAKHEE: They could stay with me,
but I go to work every day.

649
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,187
And I can't leave them alone at home.

650
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,233
I asked Junwoo's mother.
She's happy to take them in.

651
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,901
Junwoo's mother?

652
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:17,240
Yes. She said Junwoo had his surgery,
and she didn't go to jail, thanks to you.

653
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,494
I wouldn't worry one bit
if she took them in.

654
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,789
That's such a relief, really.

655
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,291
-SIBAEK: Shall we?
-Okay.

656
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,966
JEONGHA NANUM HOSPITAL

657
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,375
(door opens)

658
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,385
(serious music)

659
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,515
HARAN: Your dad has started his campaign.

660
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,394
And?

661
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,230
The election is just around the corner.

662
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,732
He will find you.

663
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,694
So you want me to hide somewhere
and stay out of trouble?

664
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,778
No.

665
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,741
I came to tell you that you
should do whatever you want.

666
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,451
HARAN: Don't listen to what your dad says.

667
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,869
I just...

668
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,206
want you to be happy.

669
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,124
I mean it.

670
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,420
After all this time?

671
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,465
YIYEON: When I wanted
your help to be happy,

672
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,426
you were too busy
building shopping malls and resorts

673
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,012
to care about me.

674
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,599
Now that my life is ruined,
you want me to be happy?

675
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,188
What do you want me to do?

676
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,149
HARAN: What can I do?

677
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,568
Tell me what I can do for you.

678
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,952
I want you to kill that person.

679
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,587
-(lighter ignites)
-(Yiyeon crying)

680
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,591
(chuckles)

681
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,013
DON'T WORRY
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM

682
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,433
She says not to worry.

683
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,685
Ah!

684
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,228
Thank you.

685
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:58,776
Ma'am, this is what I've been offering
as fostering expenses. Please accept it.

686
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,614
This is the least I can do.

687
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,491
Please accept it. I insist.

688
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,785
Call me if you need anything.

689
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,245
Okay, don't worry.

690
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,454
Yes. Text me.

691
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,166
I'll get going, then. Take care.

692
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,003
(phone vibrates)

693
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,804
Hello?

694
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,265
KYUNGJIN: Is this Attorney Noh Chakhee?

695
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,647
Goodness, I know you're busy.

696
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,066
Nice to meet you.

697
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,193
I'll make this quick.

698
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,991
You received a call from Mr. Cho Hyunsik
on the 23rd at dawn, right?

699
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,828
Yes. I'm not sure
if it was the 23rd, but I did.

700
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,205
KYUNGJIN: Right. What did he say
to you on the phone?

701
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,417
CHAKHEE: Nothing.
I just heard some heavy breathing.

702
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,127
Then he hung up.

703
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,255
KYUNGJIN: Did you notice anything strange?

704
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,258
Of course, it was strange. He called
me at the hour of dawn like a pervert.

705
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:10,264
At that time, Mr. Cho
was being tortured by his murderer.

706
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,601
-What?
-KYUNGJIN: Yes, and he called you

707
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,605
in the middle of that.
Why do you think he did that?

708
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,068
Well, I'm not sure.

709
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,240
Did you really have an affair with him?

710
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,117
(scoffs)

711
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,121
Do you cops investigate
based on rumors these days?

712
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,547
You got in his car
two days before his murder, right?

713
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,759
-Yes.
-Why did you?

714
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,388
Mr. Cho came to my office that night.

715
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,641
I made a mistake
with the Kangsung lawsuit,

716
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,226
so I got in his car to talk about that.

717
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,813
I have no idea why
the police and the rumors

718
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,649
are framing me as his mistress.

719
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,694
But while I was in his car, he offered me
a job as his company's in-house lawyer.

720
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,155
He said he'd provide me
with an apartment and living expenses.

721
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,993
Then he started groping my thigh,
so I headbutted him.

722
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,331
And while I was trying to fight him off
in the backseat, the car stopped.

723
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,376
Then Mr. Jwa Sibaek
dragged him out of the car.

724
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,546
And I stopped him from punching Mr. Cho,
and that was that.

725
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,006
After that, Mr. Jwa gave me a ride home.

726
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,258
That's all.

727
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,221
Right. How do you think
Mr. Jwa Sibaek knew?

728
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,975
That you were being
sexually harassed by Mr. Cho?

729
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,936
Ah! He and I left
the office together that night.

730
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,813
He saw me getting in Mr. Cho's car,

731
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,525
and he happened to be going
in the same direction as the car.

732
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,777
Hmm. So it was a coincidence?

733
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,079
KYUNGJIN: Do you recognize this car?

734
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,457
-It's Mr. Cho's car.
-KYUNGJIN: Yes.

735
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,041
What about this?

736
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,545
-It's Mr. Jwa Sibaek's.
-Yes.

737
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,590
KYUNGJIN: Do you see
that they're in a line?

738
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,511
When the light turns green,
they start moving at the same time.

739
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,139
The thing is, this security footage

740
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,601
is from one month
prior to Mr. Cho Hyunsik's murder.

741
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,229
Mr. Jwa Sibaek

742
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,775
had been following Mr. Cho for a month
before he was murdered.

743
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,948
And... What's her name again?
Ms. Yoon Youngju.

744
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,493
You know her from her lawsuit
for wrongful termination, right?

745
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,244
Yes.

746
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:42,374
It was Mr. Jwa who contacted Ms. Yoon,
and offered to take her case.

747
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,834
What do you think about that?

748
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:54,553
I'm not sure as to what opinion
you want me to have about Mr. Jwa,

749
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,182
but there's nothing suspicious about
the fact that he offered to take her case

750
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,101
because that's when the lawsuit
against Kangsung began.

751
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,771
And all the relationships
were formed after that.

752
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,690
I guess Ms. Yoon Youngju
was just the first coincidence.

753
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,983
Should it mean something else?

754
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:13,656
Right, but what if there have been
a few more coincidences afterwards?

755
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,994
Ms. Kim Heeyoung, Park Junwoo's mother.

756
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,330
Initially, Mr. Jwa was on her case,

757
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:26,252
but after he assaulted Mr. Yoon Dochang,
you took over, correct?

758
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,461
Yes.

759
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,380
KYUNGJIN: Well, as it happens,

760
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,926
Mr. Yoon Dochang's father is
Mr. Yoon Seokgu, another murder victim.

761
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,388
And the one who contacted Ms. Kim
and offered to defend her case

762
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,017
was also Mr. Jwa.
What do you think about this?

763
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,980
Maybe...

764
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,026
Just maybe, he assaulted Mr. Yoon Dochang

765
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,990
on purpose to get off Ms. Kim's case.

766
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,369
His motive is unclear, but Mr. Jwa Sibaek

767
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:06,584
may be dragging you into lawsuits
involving the murder victims.

768
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,548
Let me ask you upfront.

769
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,010
Are you in a relationship
with Mr. Jwa Sibaek?

770
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,388
Or are you just
having casual sex with him?

771
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,141
(chuckles)

772
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,435
(hums seriously)
Detective.

773
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,356
I'll be straightforward
with you too, so listen carefully.

774
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,485
I never had an affair
with Mr. Cho Hyunsik,

775
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,656
and I'm not in a relationship with Mr. Jwa
or having casual sex with him.

776
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,201
CHAKHEE: If you keep asking me
such unpleasant questions,

777
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,413
I'll have no choice
but to defend myself as a lawyer.

778
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,876
Right.

779
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,006
Mr. Yoon Seokgu was murdered on the 12th.

780
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,134
From 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.,
where were you?

781
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,013
The day before that
was Ms. Kim Heeyoung's trial.

782
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,224
We basically won,
so when the trial ended in the evening,

783
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,187
Mr. Jwa and I went out to celebrate
and drank until late at night.

784
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,563
And...

785
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,984
we went to his place to have
a few more drinks and went to sleep.

786
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,402
(hums seriously)

787
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,908
Can you testify that Mr. Jwa was at home
between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.?

788
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,744
He was at home when I woke up.

789
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,204
What time was that?

790
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,540
I'm not sure. Around 6:00 or 7:00 a.m.

791
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,501
(chuckles)

792
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,046
(exhales)
Ms. Noh.

793
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,965
KYUNGJIN: You're a lawyer, so I'm sure
I don't have to remind you.

794
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,219
You're aware of
what your statement means, don't you?

795
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:46,266
You're providing an alibi to someone
who could possibly be the prime suspect.

796
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,018
I'm aware.

797
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,812
But I can't lie, can I?

798
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,564
No.

799
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,692
You can't lie.

800
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,531
SOUTHERN DISTRICT POLICE STATION

801
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,087
(uneasy music)

802
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,508
KYUNGJIN: His motive is unclear,

803
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,801
but Mr. Jwa Sibaek

804
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:26,974
may be dragging you into lawsuits
involving the murder victims.

805
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:33,272
Can you testify that Mr. Jwa was at home
between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.?

806
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,482
(scoffs)

807
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,861
CHAKHEE: Attorney Jwa murdered someone?

808
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,405
That's ridiculous.

809
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,866
(breathes deeply)

810
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,117
I'll remember.

811
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,246
I just need to remember
what happened that night.

812
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,915
That'll solve everything.

813
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,795
(exhales in disbelief)

814
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,844
(clacking)

815
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,139
Blow on it.

816
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,975
(both blow air)

817
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,146
(sharp exhale)
Here.

818
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,859
(clacking)

819
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,152
(rattles)

820
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,489
(exclaims)

821
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,616
Isn't it amazing?

822
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,160
SIBAEK: Should I take it back out?

823
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,079
The trial will take about two months,
and you won't go to jail.

824
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,122
You'll be fine.

825
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,624
Don't worry.

826
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,918
I promise I'll do my best.

827
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,253
Thank you, Sibak. Thank you.

828
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,964
-What?
-Thank you, Sibak.

829
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,883
"Sibak"?

830
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,218
That won't do.

831
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,178
SIBAEK: No, no. "Sibaek."

832
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,639
Sorry. Thank you, Sibaek.

833
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,599
Right. Okay. Don't worry.

834
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,975
Yiseul, come on.

835
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,521
Thank you. Thank you.

836
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,897
Thank you.

837
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,777
(sighs)

838
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,993
God.

839
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,706
(can clanking)

840
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,668
Looking for a hair tie?

841
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,419
Here it is.

842
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,674
Ta-da. I've been waiting for this day.

843
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,805
Well...

844
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:35,894
You couldn't find a hair tie and your hair
was all disheveled the other day.

845
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,188
You looked like a lion.

846
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,487
Well, just forget it if you don't need it.

847
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,656
No, I do need it.

848
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,867
Thanks.

849
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,294
Mr. Do, I'm going
to Ms. Choi Yoonjung's house.

850
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,628
All right.

851
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,299
(gentle music)

852
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,642
(distant barking)

853
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,276
HANA-RO 80-23
HANA 2-DONG 346-56

854
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,112
(clicks)

855
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,202
(sighs)

856
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,416
(knocking on gate)

857
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,792
Anyone home?

858
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,422
CHAKHEE: Ms. Choi Yoonjung,
are you in there? Ms. Choi Yoonjung!

859
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,053
-(sighs)
-(door opens and closes)

860
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,808
Who are you?

861
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,979
-YOONJUNG'S MOTHER: It's hot, isn't it?
-Thank you.

862
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,023
Well...

863
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,734
Where's Ms. Choi?

864
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,904
(embarrassed sigh)
She's not home right now.

865
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,865
She's in the hospital.

866
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,117
The hospital?

867
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,079
Yes, a psychiatric hospital.

868
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,208
When was she admitted?

869
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,335
She admitted herself.

870
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,920
She'll come home in a few days.

871
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,841
She said she'd really
attend the trial this time.

872
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,345
Then when she comes home,

873
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,014
please tell her to come by
my office before the trial.

874
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,642
CHAKHEE: I'll get going.

875
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,768
My Yoonjung...

876
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,981
used to be a police officer.

877
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,653
Here. Come in.

878
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,451
(emotional music)

879
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,707
YOONJUNG'S MOTHER (voice breaks):
When she was assigned to a station,

880
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,168
she was so happy, saying that
she was a real police officer now.

881
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,379
(sniffles)

882
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,425
NAME: CHOI YOONJUNG, THIS STUDENT SHOWS
GOOD BEHAVIOR, EXCELLENCE IN ACADEMICS

883
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,052
AND SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHERS
IN TERMS OF SINCERITY AND DILIGENCE.

884
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,345
THUS WE AWARD THIS CERTIFICATE.

885
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,058
(muffled dance music)

886
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,102
(man humming)

887
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,938
DRUNKEN MAN: You're pretty.

888
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,150
Who are you? What's your name?

889
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,028
Where have you been all this time?
(laughs)

890
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,655
WOMAN: Hey, what are you doing? Let's go.

891
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,199
DRUNKEN MAN: She's pretty.
(cackles)

892
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,784
-She's pretty.
-WOMAN: Get inside.

893
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:45,250
-MAN: You'll be a good officer, Yoonjung.
-YOONJUNG: Thank you.

894
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,502
MAN: What do you think a good cop does?

895
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,547
Cops need to be submissive.

896
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,258
You're supposed to do as you're told.

897
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,552
-YOONJUNG: Yes.
-MAN: Here, pour me a glass.

898
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,430
(tense music)

899
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,100
Why are you trembling like that?

900
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,643
-Just pour the drink.
-I'm sorry.

901
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,229
(glass clacks)

902
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,398
We police are one.

903
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,817
-What are we?
-One.

904
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:15,781
MAN: Yes. So tonight, let's become one.
Don't go home, okay?

905
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,075
-I'm sorry, sir.
-(man grunts)

906
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,453
-(panicked squealing)
-MAN: Hey. You little...

907
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,206
YOONJUNG: No, wait!

908
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,332
(screams)

909
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,000
Please don't!

910
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,002
I guess...

911
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,840
the fact that she poured him a drink
has been weighing on her heart.

912
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:35,967
That's why.

913
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,679
She's disgusted by her own hands
that poured those drinks.

914
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,018
Do you think this will help
with her trial?

915
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,479
I'll look into it.

916
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,150
So, after that...

917
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,570
She filed a complaint against him
to the higher-ups

918
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,364
and also made an official police report.

919
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,283
But the inspection came to nothing,

920
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,995
and in the end,
he was cleared of the charges.

921
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,247
(exhales hopelessly)

922
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,584
If it had ended there,
Yoonjung and I would've just

923
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,878
considered ourselves unlucky
and gone on with our lives.

924
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:16,633
But that man hired a big law firm
and sued her for defamation.

925
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,594
YOONJUNG'S MOTHER:
Money is a scary thing, you know.

926
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:25,517
He won the lawsuit,
and she had to pay him 20 million won.

927
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:32,023
And that made her
completely lose her mind.

928
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,776
(emotional music)

929
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,281
Do you remember...

930
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,784
which law firm it was?

931
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,453
(voice breaking)

932
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,872
I do.

933
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,041
I will never forget it.

934
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,380
Jangsan.

935
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,049
(dramatic music)

936
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,222
(exhales in disbelief)

937
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,852
(gate clanks close)

938
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,990
(line ringing)

939
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,116
EX-SECRETARY: Ms. Noh.

940
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,827
CHAKHEE: Hi, it's been a while.
How are you?

941
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,163
Good. How about you?

942
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,206
Good. Listen.

943
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,460
Could you find me a case
that Jangsan handled eight years ago?

944
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,629
Sure, which one?

945
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,089
It was a defamation suit,
and the client was a police officer.

946
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,549
We won the case.

947
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,009
(keyboard clacks)

948
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,639
Yes, I found it.

949
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,767
Well, who was the lawyer on the case?

950
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,561
Mr. Jang handled it himself.

951
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,896
(gasps)

952
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,398
EX-SECRETARY: It was actually
the first case you worked on.

953
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,193
(tense music)

954
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,111
(breathes deeply)
Who was the client?

955
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,159
It was the police chief.

956
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,536
Jeon Jaeho.

957
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,164
(dramatic music continues)

958
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,545
YOONJUNG'S MOTHER: It's all right.
It's okay. Come on, stop crying.

959
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,013

(weeping)

961
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,442
CHAKHEE: Why should I be
their topic of conversation?

962
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,111
My only crime is working hard.

you worked too hard at Jangsan.

Who do you think you are,
riding around in that trash car?

970
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,024
Man.

971
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,152
God damn it.
