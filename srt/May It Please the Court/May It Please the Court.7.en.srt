BASED ON THE ESSAY
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT BY JUNG HYEJIN

4
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,013
What's going on?

5
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,292
That punk! What is with that bastard?

6
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,686
What the hell is wrong
with that psycho? Damn it.

7
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,578
That...

8
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,997
That psychotic bastard.

9
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,902
Ms. Noh?

10
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,080
You're back late.

11
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,542
Yes, I guess...

12
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,503
I'll get going first, then.

13
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,129
Is something going on?

14
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:19,634
Ah, I'm sorry to ask, but can you
drop me off at Seonggang Hospital?

15
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,822
Why are you going to the hospital?

16
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,034
I'm going there to meet a defendant.

17
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,370
That's where she's hospitalized.

18
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,331
You're having a meeting outside
the office for a consultation?

19
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,209
You might just become
valedictorian at this rate.

20
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,428
Ms. Noh, do you know that your heels
are getting lower and lower?

21
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,307
When we first met,
they were about seven centimeters high,

22
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,227
but they're now about three centimeters.

23
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,063
By the time you go around barefoot,

24
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,274
you'll be a great
public defender like me...

25
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,483
A great...

26
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,196
proper attorney.

27
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:24,991
A proper human.

SEONGGANG HOSPITAL
VISITING ROOM

30
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,665
I'm sorry about how I acted.

31
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:17,960
I thought...

32
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:23,257
I was getting better,
so I just stopped taking my medication.

33
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,016
When I stop taking the meds,
a voice torments me.

34
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,521
I seemed a bit
like a crazy person, didn't I?

35
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,903
Are you doing all right at this hospital?

36
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:55,289
When my wrist starts to hurt a lot,
I instantly get furious.

37
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:02,046
So at the last hospital,
I threw a trash can.

38
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,965
I got kicked out and came here.

39
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,261
But this place isn't any good.

40
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,181
People here rarely wash themselves.

41
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,059
And the nurses are scary.

42
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:27,613
I met with your mother
when I went to your place.

43
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,699
You did?

44
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,369
She told me...

45
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,706
what had happened...

46
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,169
eight years ago.

47
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,757
I see.

48
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,303
You were in a lawsuit
against Jangsan, right?

49
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,472
I was.

50
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:57,351
That lawsuit...

51
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,773
was mine.

52
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,988
I was in charge of that case
while I was an intern,

53
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,992
and because we won that case,
I became a full-time lawyer at Jangsan.

54
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,843
I won't make any excuses

55
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,155
by saying I actually believed
what the Police Chief said.

56
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,722
I'll right this wrong.

57
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:39,727
Usually, with civil suits, you can't
request a retrial after five years.

58
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,706
But I looked into your case,
and you filed for an appeal back then.

59
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,274
So you still have three months
to file a request for a retrial.

60
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,735
I'll find
the evidence before then

61
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,738
and file for the retrial
no matter what it takes.

62
00:08:57,077 --> 00:09:02,166
At this point, I'm not sure
how much of this will comfort you.

63
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,712
But I'll do what I can.

64
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,264
Do as you please.

65
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,060
You people did as you pleased
eight years ago too, anyway.

66
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,985
Mr. Jang.

67
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,672
You helped Mr. Choi receive
a retrial for a case from 30 years ago,

68
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:36,116
for which he was wrongfully imprisoned
for 22 years after being suspected

69
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,494
of the abduction and murder
of a young student in Jeongha.

70
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,577
How do you feel?

71
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,919
I just wish to apologize to the victim.

72
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:50,214
Mr. Choi Younghak was delighted to hear
that he could finally be vindicated

73
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:53,259
just over the fact
that his retrial request was accepted.

74
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:57,304
I only regret that I couldn't file
this request even sooner.

75
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,558
But some people can't help
but doubt your intentions

76
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,245
for defending him pro bono
as a senior partner of a large law firm.

77
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,063
Some are even wondering
if you're trying to set up the groundwork

78
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,023
for the upcoming
National Assembly election.

79
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,443
- What's your take on that?
- You're right.

80
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,822
I plan on returning to Jeongha,

81
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,157
my father's hometown,
and run for the National Assembly.

82
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,452
- He's going to run in his hometown?
- He'll run for the National Assembly?

83
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,538
But I did not take this retrial case

84
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,666
because of my desire to become
a member of the Assembly.

85
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:31,964
I took this case because I also share
the pain of losing someone I love

86
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,447
to the authority of the government.

87
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,843
Someone you love? What do you mean?

88
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,636
Do you mean your current wife?

89
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,930
- Are you talking about your family?
- Someone you love?

90
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,534
- Do you mean there's a victim?
- What kind of damage did you...

91
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,102
Is it true?

92
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,062
What you said about someone you love.

93
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,357
The female voters are going to hate this.

94
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,236
A man who still talks about
his first love even after 30 years.

95
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,030
Maybe they will.

96
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,906
Or maybe they won't.

97
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,951
Did you look into Yiyeon?

98
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,037
Ah, I was going to tell you.

99
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,164
I found her.

100
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,751
She's volunteering
at a free clinic in Jeongha.

101
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,338
What if she had graduated med school
then gone down that road?

102
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,797
It would have been fantastic.

103
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,925
She was fined five million won
for assaulting a cop.

104
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,181
Do you know who's in charge of her case?

105
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,516
Noh Chakhee.

106
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,769
It's a relief.

107
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,521
Noh Chakhee can stick by Yiyeon's side

108
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,732
and keep her under control
until the election is over.

109
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,156
Yes.

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
What?

111
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,037
I'll call you later.

112
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,501
Look at this.

113
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,379
WHO'S HINDERING THE MURDER INVESTIGATION
OF THE KANGSUNG CEO?

114
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,260
JANG, THE LATE CHO, AND YOON
CLOSELY BONDED, WITH KIM IN THE SHADOWS

115
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,680
This bastard is still out of his mind.

116
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,348
Do you know him?

117
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,395
Call the secretary and tell him
to shut down this blog.

118
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,355
The hackers will handle it.

119
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,731
Who is he?

120
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,069
Just a criminal convicted three times.

121
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,363
A cockroach of a bastard.

122
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,002
YC'S BLOG

123

B-LOG
THIS PAGE DOES NOT EXIST

124
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,061
Mr. Noh! The bread is done.

125
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,565
Hey, you'll get
your license in no time.

126
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,899
You have a knack for it.

127
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,403
Really? Thank you.

128
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,781
Well, Chakhee kept telling me
to learn how to bake, so...

129
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,659
Well, anyway, Mr. Noh.

130
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,036
How do you know her?

131
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,623
I mean, how can the meanest girl
in the world be acquainted

132
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,267
with the greatest teacher in the world?

133
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,918
- Blood relation.
- "Blood relation."

134
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,170
What?

135
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,797
She's my daughter.

136
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,048
What?

137
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,386
Wait, so the girl who seems like
she doesn't have a drop of blood in her

138
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,849
is the daughter of this man who would
pour out his blood for anyone?

139
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,768
Wait, how did that happen?

140
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,436
How did she turn out like that?

141
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,229
It's because of their last name.

142
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,776
He named her "Chakhee" hoping that
she would be "charitable" toward others.

143
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,362
But his last name is "Noh," right?

144
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,282
So she became "Noh Chakhee,"
with no charity.

145
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,411
If his last name had been "So" or "Hella,"
she would've been hella charitable.

146
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,829
I see.

147
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,498
What do you mean, "I see?"

148
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,752
Mr. Noh.

149
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,379
You posted an article about my dad.

150
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,967
Right, that was out of my hands.

151
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,012
It was in your hands.
You did it because you wanted to.

152
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,309
Please enjoy.
I have to go make the dough, so...

153
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,148
Your blog gets hacked every time,
and the article gets deleted anyway.

154
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,232
So why keep doing it?

155
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,568
It's like a disease, I guess.
I'm a reporter.

156
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,030
If I don't do that, I get an itch.

157
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,282
Mr. Noh.

158
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,160
Do you think my dad
will become an assemblyman?

159
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,790
Probably. Since he's charming
and competent.

160
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,544
Will he?

161
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,650
<i>Yes, Attorney Jang.</i>

162
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,360
Where are you?

163
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:05,571
I'm already at the restaurant.

164
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,573
I'm sorry about that.

165
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,908
I was going to call you, but I forgot.

166
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,079
I received urgent reports
regarding the nomination.

167
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,792
Reports related to the nomination?

168
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:24,464
Reports such as, "CEO Cho Hyunsik had paid
illegal campaign funds to Lawyer Jang."

169
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,134
<i>Then he was murdered soon after.</i>

170
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,177
<i>"Something may be going on here."</i>

171
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:34,641
<i>"Or that "Lawyer Jang's daughter
also has a history of drunk driving</i>

172
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,477
<i>or assaulting others while drunk."
Things like those.</i>

173
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,023
<i>People are sensitive about
drinking nowadays, you know?</i>

174
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,649
It'll give us a huge headache

175
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,943
if people begin to make a case
over things like this.

176
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,820
Is that so?

177
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,575
<i>Our members are investigating
the truth of the reports.</i>

178
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,702
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

179
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,224
You scared me for a second.

180
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,977
I thought you might
really become an assemblyman.

181
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,033
<i>Do as you please.</i>

182
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,746
You people did as you pleased
eight years ago too, anyway.

183
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:50,133
BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

184
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,177
One plate
of king-sized dumplings, please.

185
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,275
Oh, my gosh!

186
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,070
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were closed.

187
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:11,738
No, don't worry. It's all right.

188
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,865
Please sit. Why don't you join me?

189
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,952
No, I'm...

190
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,956
Please join me.

191
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,712
Then...

192
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,763
Is it someone's birthday today?
Is it yours?

193
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,934
No, I'm not someone important enough
to celebrate birthdays.

194
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:42,894
My wife.

195
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,730
I see.

196
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,443
Then when will your wife get here?

197
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,820
Is it okay to start without her?

198
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,991
I hope she's here right now.

199
00:17:56,908 --> 00:18:00,746
I'm not sure if she's here or not.

200
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,337
She died 30 years ago.

201
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,965
I see...

202
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,634
She'll be thrilled.

203
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,556
It was always just the two of us,
but we have a surprise guest today.

204
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:21,933
"Two"?

205
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,810
Gosh, I'm starving.

206
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,214
Chisik, are the short ribs ready?

207
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,709
BACKWOODS HOMEMADE DUMPLINGS

208
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,962
Well, have a good night, then.

209
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:54,674
- Yes, you as well.
- I'll be off.

210
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:16,154
- Are you all right?
- Sorry?

211
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,575
How can you two be brothers?

212
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,662
I'm sure it's tough to believe.

213
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,457
Yes, well, compared to my brother,
I'm overwhelmingly...

214
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,834
Yes, well...

215
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,677
There is nothing similar
about the two of us,

216
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,962
no matter how hard you look...

217
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,964
When you get older, are you also...

218
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:35,632
Take that back.

219
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,260
That was harsh, you know?

220
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,427
Do you see this?

221
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,222
My hair is very dense, isn't it?

222
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:45,350
And the quality of my hair.
My hair is very healthy.

223
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,436
Wow, Mr. Chisik sure is a true romantic.

224
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,106
How did he spend 30 years all alone?

225
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:54,317
She probably married him because
he showed her that kind of pure love.

226
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,653
My brother has looked like that...

227
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,823
since he was 20.

228
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,577
Then his wife must've been
the hopeless romantic.

229
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,412
But what happened to her?

230
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,541
She was murdered.

231
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,657
Today isn't her birthday.
It's the anniversary of her death.

232
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,763
She loved cakes when she was alive,
but they were too poor.

233
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:27,767
They had no money,
so she rarely got to eat cakes.

234
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,898
That's why he eats a cake
on the anniversary of her death.

235
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,027
This is barely anything.

236
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,579
How did he endure
the past 30 years by himself?

237
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,082
Why did he...

238
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,126
choose to be alone?

239
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,842
Because when those who remember are gone,

240
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,346
the truth goes with them.

241
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,936
Life was too tough,
so I screamed into the sky.

242
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,313
"Why the hell is my life such a damn joke?"

243
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,816
As I was screaming, I met that woman.

244
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,863
To me, that woman
was my salvation and religion.

245
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,743
But I lost her.

246
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,371
There is no divine power in this world.

247
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,625
And every moment I took another breath...

248
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,463
was like hell.

249
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,219
I had already died...

250
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,473
"30 years ago."

251
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,813
That's what Chisik said.

252
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,835
So I told him this.

253
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,814
"Stop talking like you're living
a star-crossed love story."

254
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:25,844
If you have time for that,
go and make more dumplings to sell.

255
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,764
And buy a house.

256
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,559
"Not having a house to call your own
at your age is the real hell."

257
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,771
That's what I said.

258
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,776
Have you been well?

259
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,394
It has been 30 years already.

260
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,857
It took such a long time
to keep my promise to you.

261
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,485
The world you dreamed of.

262
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,572
The world we dreamed of.

263
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,283
I'll make that happen.

264
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:55,618
Please keep an eye on me.

265
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,872
And see how big I can be
and how high I can go...

266
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,253
as Jang Gido, the politician.

267
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,800
Let's stop here.

268
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,452
Stop it.

269
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,131
Tell them to edit it, so that no one
can identify the location of this grave.

270
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:56,596
Not one bit of information
about who is buried here can get out.

271
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,521
Anyway, who is she, really?

272
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,232
I told you.

273
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,198
A woman I loved.

274
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,665
Mr. Do, what does this look like?

275
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,708
Hmm?

276
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:30,713
What should it look like?

277
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,799
Do you see
this white line right here?

278
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,425
Isn't that bone?

279
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,929
- No, doesn't it look like a chip?
- "Chip"? Like what?

280
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,973
Potato chips, squid chips,
or casino chips?

281
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,434
No, the chips that get implanted
in dogs these days. A microchip.

282
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,312
Is this about Ms. Choi Yoonjung's case?

283
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,273
I wasn't so sure at first either.

284
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,277
But this. The more I look at this,
the more it looks like a chip.

285
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:58,241
Maybe the hospital really did put
a microchip in Ms. Choi's wrist.

286
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,703
Mr. Jwa.

287
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,246
You're here.

288
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,000
- Gosh.
- What does this look like?

289
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,461
Doesn't it look like a chip?

290
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:15,425
If I say that white wrist bone
looks like a chip,

291
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,801
will that become your defense?

292
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:20,221
Yes. I want to do that,
just as Ms. Choi believes.

293
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,268
I want to believe in Ms. Choi.
Though I wasn't able to eight years ago.

294
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,270
"Eight years ago"?

295
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:33,151
Before I became Jangsan's lapdog,
so I mean, while I was still a lap-puppy.

296
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,570
I bit Ms. Choi Yoonjung.

297
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,573
Do you regret that?
Being Jangsan's lapdog?

298
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,450
No, I don't regret it.

299
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,036
If I could go back,
I'd make the same choice.

300
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,039
I'd believe what
Chief Jeon said just the same,

301
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,960
and I would've done my best
to win my first case as an intern.

302
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,129
But, however late it is,

303
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,445
I'm just trying to take responsibility
for the choices I made.

304
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,135
No.

305
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:05,224
If you really could go back in time,
I'm sure you'd make a different choice.

306
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,935
And you would accept
the consequences of that choice.

307
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,149
If you had done so,
we could've met a little sooner.

308
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,985
Right here, in this place.

309
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,114
And I would've been...

310
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,326
very exhausted.

311
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,621
I'm so tired.

312
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,748
- So very tired.
- Right.

313
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,250
I knew you were being too nice.

314
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,797
That's the guy who tried
to assault CEO Cho Hyunsik

315
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,632
two days before he was murdered.

316
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,759
And before President Yoon Seokgu
was murdered,

317
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,053
he assaulted his son, Yoon Dochang.

318
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:44,514
That's the kind of guy
who threatened you with his car.

319
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,849
What does he do?

320
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,226
He's a public defender.

321
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,229
- An attorney?
- Yes.

322
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,023
He works in the same office
as Noh Chakhee.

323
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,067
This doesn't make any sense either.

324
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,402
Something has to be up.

325
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,697
That guy and Noh Chakhee are involved
in all these murder cases.

326
00:29:03,282 --> 00:29:04,701
But why me?

327
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,830
I don't even know who this bastard is.

328
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:13,501
Maybe you do, and you just forgot.

329
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,840
It just feels like he's announcing
his next murder victim by saying,

330
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,007
"You're my next target."

331
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,729
Stop cursing me
with that nonsense, damn it.

332
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,686
- Okay, keep tailing him.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,814
Did you look into Lee Dongpil too?

334
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:35,898
Yes.

335
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:40,027
But he seems to have vanished
after he was released from prison.

336
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,321
And we can't seem
to reach his family either.

337
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,701
Lee Dongpil...

338
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:53,332
Ah, there was this temple
he often went to.

339
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,377
It was either Hwaju or Hwajo Temple.
Something like that.

340
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,296
It's an hour or two away
from Seoul by car.

341
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,257
- Search up there.
- Okay, will do.

342
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,474
What could it be?

343
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,143
What am I forgetting?

344
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,782
Who brought these flowers?

345
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,242
I'm not sure.

346
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:33,289
I do come by often since you asked me to.

347
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,376
Ah! Was it that young lady?

348
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:44,467
You see, when her granddaughter comes,
she buys lots of flowers.

349
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,928
To greet everyone around her.

350
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,139
Anybody else?

351
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,728
Well, I think a young man did come by.

352
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
Goodness.

353
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,773
I'm not completely sure.

354
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,485
I'm not sure if he came by
to see her or someone else.

355
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,032
What did he look like, that young man?

356
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,496
Man, my father
recently passed away.

357
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,666
And yet you're asking me
to pay compensation?

358
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,792
Yes.

359
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,670
Had your father been alive,
I would've asked him.

360
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,588
But he's no longer around.

361
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,756
I can't help it.

362
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,342
Then sue me. Do whatever you want.

363
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:27,426
I'm not paying squat.

364
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,887
Then before I file the lawsuit,

365
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,014
I'll report you first
for kidnapping a minor.

366
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,519
Hey, that happened ages ago.

367
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:37,895
Do you have evidence?

368
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,773
How dare you try
to blackmail me without proof?

369
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,318
Your agreeing to settle the case
after I beat you up is the first evidence.

370
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,153
The café's security footage is the second.

371
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,239
And most decisively,
Mr. Park Junwoo's testimony

372
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:49,322
would be the third.

373
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,411
And weren't you arrested once in the US
for possessing child pornography?

374
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,454
But Jangsan's stateside office
got you off.

375
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,875
Fine. You're right.

376
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,295
Jangsan got me off
while I was in the States. But hey.

377
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,381
What makes you think
they won't do it in Korea?

378
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,968
And last time,
I stayed quiet because of my father.

379
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,651
But now he's gone, so why should I care?

380
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,471
So you're well aware of the situation.

381
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,057
Yes. Your father
is no longer in this world.

382
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,435
So why would Jangsan get you off?

383
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,645
Rather, they'll draw
a line in the sand.

384
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,231
Jangsan will do their best
to avoid getting involved

385
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,108
in anything related to Mr. Yoon Seokgu.

386
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,361
Damn it.

387
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,655
This lawsuit.

388
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,993
No matter how much time
or money it costs, I'll make sure I win.

389
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:37,413
I'll chase you to the ends of the earth
and make sure you pay the full amount.

390
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:40,124
Even if you go to prison
for kidnapping a minor,

391
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:41,709
the lawsuit will continue.

392
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:46,547
And even if you're released,
the lawsuit will continue.

393
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,592
Until the day you die.

394
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,262
So let's make this easy for both of us.

395
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:55,431
The settlement agreement.

396
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,477
The compensation
for Mr. Park Junwoo, 100 million won.

397
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,316
And this compensation for the caddie,
Ms. Kim Naeun, 200 million won.

398
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,778
What? A total of 300 million?

399
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,656
The compensation is for
the permanent scar on Ms. Kim's face,

400
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,907
as well as her surgery.

401
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,993
It's also for her termination from
the golf club due to her hospitalization.

402
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,246
And above all, it's to compensate her

403
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,541
for the humiliation inflicted upon her
by Mr. Yoon Seokgu.

404
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,836
Jesus Christ. What, "humiliation"?

405
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,174
Man, so even chicks like this
have pride, do they?

406
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,176
It's so damn expensive.

407
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:53,239
Do you know why your father croaked...

408
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,200
in that manner?

409
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:00,162
Because your father didn't know

410
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:06,043
just how immensely and deeply
one can be humiliated

411
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:09,046
at the hands...

412
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,633
of another person.

413
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,847
Jwa Sibaek and Yoon Dochang
are together right now?

414
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,683
Yes. It looked like
they exchanged documents.

415
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:22,268
But you don't know what they're for?

416
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,022
Okay. Keep me updated.

417
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,402
See? I knew it. I had Jwa Sibaek tailed.

418
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,239
He's apparently negotiating
an agreement with Yoon Dochang.

419
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,368
Yoon Dochang signed the paper
Jwa Sibaek pulled out.

420
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,620
What do you think that means?

421
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,875
In my opinion,
Jwa Sibaek also killed Yoon Seokgu.

422
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,128
He probably made some kind of deal
with Yoon Dochang.

423
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,505
What kind of a deal?

424
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,175
Like hiring him as a contract killer
to murder his father?

425
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,634
It's possible.

426
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,555
Listen, Detective Jung.

427
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,893
I'm saying this out of sincere concern,
so please don't take it the wrong way.

428
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,606
You should quit working as a detective
and start writing a novel.

429
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,483
That's where your talent lies.

430
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,526
Come on, isn't it weird?

431
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,571
It's so obvious that Jwa Sibaek
is involved with everything at this point.

432
00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:17,698
Yes, it's odd.
It's as if he's making it obvious.

433
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,994
The way he intimidated Chief Jeon
with his car was obvious.

434
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,497
The way he tried to assault
Cho Hyunsik was obvious.

435
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,333
Same goes for his meeting
with Yoon Dochang right now.

436
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,627
What are we waiting for?
Let's just arrest him.

437
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,753
And then what?

438
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,716
We'll get a confession out of him.

439
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,137
How? Should we go ahead
and torture people in the 21st century?

440
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,473
I mean, just bring him in for now.

441
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:45,017
If you get him here,
he's bound to tell us something.

442
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,395
There is someone

443
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,358
who's much closer to Cho Hyunsik,
Yoon Seokgu, and Chief Jeon Jaeho

444
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,486
than Jwa Sibaek, isn't there?

445
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,613
Who?

446
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,493
Are you saying Jang Gido killed them?

447
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,956
They're all Jangsan's financial backers.
Why would Jang Gido kill them?

448
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:11,794
There must be something
he wants more than money.

449
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:41,198

Gido.

455
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,490
By any chance,

456
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,746
if you end up losing the election,
what will happen?

457
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,582
I can't lose.

458
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,459
My approval rating is 5% higher

459
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:37,046
than the other party's candidate
who's running for reelection.

460
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,839
And it'll continue to rise.

461
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,591
But still.

462
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:43,219
There is always an if.

463
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,141
Then I'll lose the law firm,
and Haran will divorce me.

464
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,519
If Haran comes at me full force,
I might even go to prison.

465
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,357
Yet you still want to do this?

466
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,068
I think...

467
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,031
- it isn't too late to quit...
- You know how I am.

468
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,408
I never start a fight I can't win.

469
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,245
Father.

470
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,164
I'll continue to go higher and farther.

471
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,042
This is just the beginning.
How can I quit now?

472
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,337
It's taken years
to prepare for this moment.

473
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,090
I'm not going to fail.

474
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,425
What do you mean by "farther"?

475
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:26,887
The highest place in our nation.

476
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:33,978
I'll go there and regain your honor
and good name. I will do that.

477
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:42,069
People say that parents always have
a soft spot for their children

478
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,153
and they were right.

479
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,781
What can I do?

480
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,284
If you want it that much,
then you must win.

481
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,872
How much do you need again?

482
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,794
A billion won.

483
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,765
How did you come across someone like that
and let him get the best of you?

484
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:14,184
My dear...

485
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,396
Attorney Jang.

486
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,484
I'm sorry.

487
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,113
Everyone has a skeleton in their closet.

488
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,534
If he brazenly demanded
a bribe from you like that,

489
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:35,372
he's someone that will show off
his own skeletons by himself.

490
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,125
Just open that closet for him
and feed him the money.

491
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,253
You can't keep beating him with a stick.

492
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,422
He'll need some carrots too.

493
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,093
Gido.

494
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:52,056
Now that you're here, win.

495
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:58,771
Win and aim high and far,
just like you dreamed of doing.

496
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,109
Yes, Father.

497
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,739
DELUSION DUE
TO EARLY SCHIZOPHRENIC SYMPTOMS

498
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:09,822
HOSPITALIZATION REQUIRED

499
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,742
- This is it?
- Yes.

500
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:16,121
I sent in five pages of questions,
and all I get are these two lines?

501
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,916
You could say this about anyone
going around in a tinfoil hat.

502
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,335
Do doctors here work as a hobby?

503
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,879
What are you looking at?

504
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,631
What?

505
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,257
Jeez.

506
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,260
KIM NAEUN
PARTY B: YOON DOCHANG

507
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,512
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

508
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:39,895
To be honest, when you
offered to help, I had some doubts.

509
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,190
I didn't know
you would really help her like this.

510
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,691
Thank you, Mr. Jwa.

511
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,112
I don't know...

512
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,988
how I should...

513
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:53,826
how I should thank you.

514
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,329
You can thank me with money.

515
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,540
My commission is 70% of your settlement.

516
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:06,713
Yes, it was a joke. A joke.

517
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,799
Your gratitude is enough.

518
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:13,846
Good luck
with the rest of your treatment.

519
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,015
The settlement money will be sent
by the specified date. For sure.

520
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,142
I'll be in touch.

521
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,811
Thank you, Mr. Jwa.

522
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,147
Ten percent?

523
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,615
Attorney Jwa Sibaek.

524
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,370
Why don't we grab some coffee?

525
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,667
SEONGGANG HOSPITAL

526
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,550
I hear you're helping
with Ms. Kim Naeun's case.

527
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:52,676
Yes.

528
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:55,554
Did you offer to help this time too?

529
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:04,104
I'd like to have you come to the station
regarding Mr. Cho Hyunsik's murder case.

530
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:09,109
I already said all I needed to say
to another detective.

531
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,236
Yes, but please do come again.

532
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,906
I have some questions
about President Yoon Seokgu too.

533
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,074
Sure, okay.

534
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,159
Okay.

535
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,495
Okay.

536
00:42:20,078 --> 00:42:21,330
If you'll excuse me.

537
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,419
Take care.

538
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:50,317
You made quite a scene at the hospital.

539
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,444
So you'll be fined about one million won

540
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,446
for property damage
and obstruction of business.

541
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,408
But if I plead insanity,
you could get a deferred sentence.

542
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,494
I'll do as you want.

543
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:07,084
Pleading insanity...

544
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,465
Does that mean
you'll claim that I'm crazy?

545
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:17,636
Yes.

546
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,018
Mr. Jwa.

547
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,759
Was that her? From eight years ago?

548
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,305
Yes. The one whose life
was ruined because I bit her.

549
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,431
No.

550
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,852
How can a puppy that doesn't
even have teeth bite someone?

551
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:09,104
The ones who bit her

552
00:44:09,187 --> 00:44:11,940
are Police Chief Jeon Jaeho
and Jang Gido of Jangsan.

553
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,238
I thought you were smart, Ms. Noh.
But you can be quite foolish at times.

554
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,702
I think I'm about to do
something foolish again.

555
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,871
What do I do?

556
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:33,128
You're a much better person
than you think you are.

557
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:37,758
Once you learn that,
you'll no longer do anything foolish.

558
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,595
We're talking about me, Jangsan's lapdog.

559
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,472
- Mm.
- The Shih Tzu.

560
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,932
- Mm.
- But I'm suddenly a good person now?

561
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,310
Yes. I'm very smart,

562
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:50,979
so I already figured it out
while working with you, Ms. Noh.

563
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,522
You're not a dog. You're a person.

564
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,067
And not just any ordinary person,
but a likable person.

565
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,445
But not someone that you like?

566
00:45:00,947 --> 00:45:02,449
It's been fun with you, yes.

567
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,825
The door is to your right.

568
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,744
No, it's okay. I get it.

569
00:45:06,244 --> 00:45:07,287
Let's go.

570
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,082
I said the door is to your right.

571
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,416
And I said let's go.

572
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,511
- I mean, come on.
- There you go again.

573
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,887
Try to do better, okay?

574
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:27,182
See? I told you so.
I told you that you two will get married.

575
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:33,313
So when's the date?
And kids. How many kids will you have?

576
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,077
There's no need
to think too much about it.

577
00:45:35,148 --> 00:45:37,943
Once you have kids,
they'll grow up all by themselves.

578
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,194
- Granny.
- Yes?

579
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:40,570
I'm hungry. I want some food.

580
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,863
Sure.

581
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,657
Okay?

582
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,075
What's for dinner?

583
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,454
Ah! I made your favorite,
kimchi stew with pork.

584
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,790
That's not my favorite.
It's your favorite.

585
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:53,333
What are you talking about?

586
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,501
Come on, you dummy.

587
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,795
Goodness, kimchi stew.

588
00:45:59,297 --> 00:46:00,674
Sounds delicious.

589
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,557
Is it that good?

590
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,230
I don't know about everything else,
but I know that you make killer kimchi.

591
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,649
Why is that all you know?

592
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,695
You make it sound like
I'm bad at making everything else.

593
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,406
I know. I know everything.

594
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,241
You're good
at everything else too, Granny.

595
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:27,784
Hmm.

596
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,122
Don't finish everything and leave some.
It's for my son when he gets home.

597
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,792
Your son?

598
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,961
Where's your son?

599
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,798
He went to school.
It's about time he came home.

600
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,676
What grade is he in?

601
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,387
He's first grade in elementary school.

602
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:57,063
Man, how come this son of yours
hasn't grown up in over 30 years?

603
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:59,858
What are you talking about?
Are you stupid?

604
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,568
I'm not stupid.

605
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,573
Granny.

606
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:09,117
I'm done. I'll head out now.

607
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,334
CIGARETTES, EGGS, POPSICLES, LIQUOR

608
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:31,640
EUNHEE SUPER

609

DAY OF BUDDHA'S COMING

610
00:47:54,996 --> 00:47:56,915
You're a detective?

611
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:59,459
Yes, and I'm looking for Lee Dongpil.

612
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,213
He used to come to this temple.
Do you know him?

613
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:04,756
I do know him.

614
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,845
Our temple keeps
his mother's memorial tablet.

615
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,012
Is that so?

616
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,764
Where is he now?

617
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,727
He passed away three years ago.

618
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:19,604
He died?

619
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,524
He took his own life.

620
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:28,071
By any chance, did he ever mention
CEO Cho Hyunsik of Kangsung Pharm,

621
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:31,199
President Yoon Seokgu,
or Attorney Jang Gido of Jangsan?

622
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:34,619
He did.

623
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,580
He did? What did he say?

624
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,041
That he wanted to kill them.

625
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:50,427
You don't have to see me off.

626
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:55,515
Take care.

627
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,377
A detective was here.

628
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,362
COURT

629
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,614
What do you see here, everyone?

630
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,407
This part right here.

631
00:49:54,866 --> 00:50:00,080
This is the part of her wrist where
defendant believes a chip was inserted.

632
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,081
DEFENDANT

633
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,584
The defendant showed
this X-ray to her doctor.

634
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,253
And surprisingly, the doctor also stated

635
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:10,757
that he wasn't sure
what that was next to the bone.

636
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,008
Your Honor.

637
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,637
After the defendant underwent surgery
for fracturing her wrist,

638
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,098
she began to hear
her wrist speaking to her.

639
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,433
Before then, her wrist may have hurt,

640
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,645
but it never started
a conversation with her.

641
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:29,526
Anyone would suspect medical malpractice
if their wrist started talking to them

642
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,570
after they had surgery
for a fractured wrist. Isn't that so?

643
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,905
Counselor.

644
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,867
Do you honestly believe
that anyone would think that?

645
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,831
The hospital failed to tell her exactly
what that spot was.

646
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:46,084
Refusing the defendant's simple request
to be treated and diagnosed

647
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:48,670
was unreasonable on the hospital's part.

648
00:50:48,753 --> 00:50:50,797
So the defendant's protest
against this injustice...

649
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:53,675
was a reasonable reaction.

650
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,760
PROSECUTOR

651
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:02,851
JUDGE

652
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,645
Defendant.

653
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,648
Is there anything you want to say?

654
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:10,984
Yes.

655
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,987
Your Honor.

656
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:16,364
When you go to a hospital,

657
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,493
something is written on their wall,
"Patient's Rights and Responsibilities."

658
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:25,874
Patient's Rights and Responsibilities.
Article 1, Clause 3-1.

659
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,126
One, a patient's rights.

660
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:30,336
A, the right to receive medical treatment.

661
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,340
All patients have the right to receive
appropriate health and medical care

662
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,177
to protect and improve their own health.

663
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:42,348
The gender, age, religion, social status,
financial circumstances, et cetera

664
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:46,269
of the patient shall not play a factor
to infringe upon this right.

665
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:49,564
And health and medical personnel
cannot refuse treatment

666
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:51,316
without justifiable cause.

667
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:01,201
But the hospital
put a talking chip into my wrist,

668
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,329
and then refused my request
to have it checked out.

669
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:08,833
They refused to diagnose me
just because I protested against the chip.

670
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,157
I believe this clearly violates

671
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,213
the Enforcement Regulations
of the Medical Service Act.

672
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,683
Okay, I understand.

673
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,270
I will take your statement
into careful consideration.

674
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,732
Is there anything you wish to add?

675
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,816
No, Your Honor.

676
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,818
That's it.

677
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,208
It looked like the judge
believed what I said, right?

678
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:53,211
Yes. He said he'll take it
into careful consideration.

679
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:59,551
I was worried that you or the judge
might not believe me again.

680
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,720
It looks like
everything will go well, right?

681
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:06,558
Yes, but even if the judge
believes what you said,

682
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,935
according to the law,
you may still be fined...

683
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:13,940
Ah! It's all right. It's true that I threw
a trash can in the hospital.

684
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,527
I'm relieved that you see it that way.

685
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:19,863
Thank you for today.

686
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,407
I'll get going, then.

687
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,825
The retrial.

688
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,286
I'll try to file a request.

689
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,013
I even appealed to a higher court
seven years ago, but still lost.

690
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:35,461
He's now the police chief.

691
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:37,714
And Jangsan is even bigger now.

692
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,509
You're just a public defender, Ms. Noh.

693
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,512
How would you ever win against him?

694
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,682
You're right, Ms. Choi.

695
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:49,885
Over the last eight years,
Jeon Jaeho became the chief

696
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:51,686
and Jangsan has become much bigger.

697
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:55,273
But I'm not the intern
I was back then, either.

698
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,026
I'll file for a retrial, even if we lose.

699
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:02,780
If we don't, Ms. Choi,
that would be unfair to you.

700
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,594
<i>Hello, Ms. Noh.</i>

701
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,346
Hey, it's me.

702
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,890
Remember the case I mentioned before?

703
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:31,267
Can you email me that file?

704
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,269
<i>Do you mean Chief Jeon Jaeho's case?</i>

705
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,729
Yes, that's the one.

706
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,482
I'm sorry, but I cannot share
a lawsuit case file

707
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,984
unless you are a part of Jangsan.

708
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,155
It's me, Noh Chakhee.
I'll be back at Jangsan in a year.

709
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,951
<i>Yes, please return to Jangsan
in a year and make your request then.</i>

710
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:50,286
<i>Would there be anything else?</i>

711
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,663
No, there isn't.

712
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,289
<i>Then I'll be hanging up now.</i>

713
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,793
Wow!

714
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,295
I didn't think Ms. Song was like that.

715
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,089
She's great at her job.

716
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:04,634
Then should I dress up and visit Jangsan?

717
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:08,012
You want the lawsuit case files

718
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,057
of CEO Cho Hyunsik
and President Yoon Seokgu?

719
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,641
Yes.

720
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,812
Not only did Jangsan defend
Kangsung and Kumshin as corporations,

721
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:19,565
but I believe you also
defended them for personal lawsuits

722
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,651
against Mr. Cho Hyunsik
and Mr. Yoon Seokgu.

723
00:55:21,734 --> 00:55:24,112
I'd like to know
what kinds of lawsuits they were.

724
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:28,574
Ah! And I'd like
Chief Jeon Jaeho's files too.

725
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,413
I'll give you the files.

726
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,499
But please bring a warrant first.

727
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,756
If I had a warrant,
I would've been less polite than I am now.

728
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:50,263
You've known Mr. Cho and Mr. Yoon
for a long time, am I right?

729
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,264
Yes.

730
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,684
For over 30 years.

731
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,644
They were both from my father's hometown.

732
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,522
Goodness, it must be
heartbreaking for you.

733
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:02,358
If they had been alive,

734
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,362
they would've helped you immensely
with your campaign for assemblyman.

735
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,661
Do you think...

736
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,164
you will win the election?

737
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,503
I plan to.

738
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,632
That is if Cho Hyunsik and Yoon Seokgu's
murder cases are wrapped up

739
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,426
as they are now, right?

740
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,475
Detective.

741
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:41,022
If you solve a problem
with an answer already in mind,

742
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:45,026
it becomes much harder
to get the actual answer.

743
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,073
I don't think you know
the answer I have in mind.

744
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,704
I do look forward
to seeing that answer sheet.

745
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,169
CEO'S OFFICE
JANG G. D.

746
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:11,302
Excuse me.

747
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,389
It's not a big deal,
but I left my cigarettes inside.

748
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,556
Did you?

749
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,101
It's a bit awkward for me
to go back in there,

750
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,019
so could you get them for me?

751
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,229
Sure.

752
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,147
Thank you.

753
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,338
You look excited.

754
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,225
I find you...

755
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,272
the most endearing

756
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,400
when your face turns red

757
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:14,949
from humiliation.

758
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:19,036
I can see that again today, right?

759
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,080
Why wouldn't I be excited?

760
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,681
Goodness, Attorney Jang.

761
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:41,350
That's not right.
You're now Candidate Jang.

762
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:47,565
Actually, you'll be an assemblyman soon,
so welcome, Assemblyman Jang.

763
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:52,487
Would you like to choose
for yourself, Mr. Park?

764
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,698
Which crime would you like
to be charged with?

765
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:04,457
You'll get three years with this,
and five years with this.

766
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,750
And this is...

767
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,377
for your youngest kid.

768
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,717
Your youngest son got into college
in a rather unconventional way.

769
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,597
Attorney Jang.

770
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,850
I must have been mistaken.

771
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,019
Those reports were complete nonsense.

772
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:32,109
If you wanted to screw me over,
you should've lived an honest life.

773
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,671
Are you sure you reported
on Cho Hyunsik's illegal campaign funds?

774
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,965
Yes, I even sent proof of deposit.

775
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,509
Why did you send a tip about Yiyeon?

776
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,219
I never asked you to do that.

777
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,304
That wasn't us.

778
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,307
Then who was it?

779
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:08,521
Is there someone else
who wants to bring Jang Gido down?

780
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,399
Thank you.

781
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,610
Goodbye.

782
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,885
Mr. Do.

783
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,053
Where are you right now?

784
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,639
The defendant is here,
waiting to meet with you.

785
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,057
Right.

786
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,852
<i>It was tough to schedule him
because he didn't want to come.</i>

787
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,313
I know, but I have
to do something this afternoon,

788
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,731
so I'm not in Jeongha right now.

789
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,109
Come on, Ms. Noh.
Why are you being like this?

790
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,696
Could you coax him
and reschedule the consultation?

791
01:00:58,779 --> 01:01:02,617
Look, this man has
four assault convictions under his name.

792
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,576
<i>Exactly.</i>

793
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:05,539
<i>It's probably better
for you to take the beating</i>

794
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,498
<i>- instead of someone as fragile as me...
</i>-Ms. Noh!

795
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,665
I'm really sorry,
but this is too important.

796
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,709
<i>- Where are you anyway?</i>
- Okay, later.

797
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:14,837
She hung up on me?

798
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:19,342
So have you had lunch?

799
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,598
What should we eat
for lunch today?

800
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,643
Come on, we always eat sausage stew. Damn.

801
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,935
It's good.

802
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,395
No, they have bad kimchi.

803
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,397
But it's good.

804
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,940
LEGAL CONSULTATIONS ARE NOT FREE

805
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,567
Man, what should we eat?

806
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,611
Pork cutlet.

807
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,613
Pork cutlet? That sounds great.

808
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,786
Okay.

809
01:01:50,122 --> 01:01:51,791
The files.

810
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,084
Did you find everything?

811
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,338
Hey, why are you so shocked?

812
01:01:57,421 --> 01:01:59,799
You're acting like I'm here to get you.

813
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:00,758
Drink this.

814
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:01,967
I'm sorry.

815
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,139
And the files?

816
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,518
I'm sorry.
Which files are you looking for?

817
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:11,602
Look it up.

818
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,646
Okay.

819
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:18,943
Eight years ago. The client is Jeon Jaeho.
It's a defamation suit.

820
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,879
DEFAMATION CASE FOR
SPREADING FALSE INFORMATION

821
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:21,779
SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGE OF CHOI YOONJUNG

822
01:02:21,862 --> 01:02:23,406
CONVERTING 2 FILES

823
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,161
Copy them.

824
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:36,751
Excuse me...

825
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,213
I admire you, Ms. Noh.

826
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,090
My goal is to join the M&amp;A team too.

827
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:44,593
You were truly amazing during
the Shinhwa Heavy Industries lawsuit.

828
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:46,137
- Really?
- Yes.

829
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,014
I want to be a great lawyer,
just like you are.

830
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,726
Don't you mean "successful"?

831
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,021
Oh, it's done.

832
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,736
Thank you.

833
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:07,241
- Right. Intern.
- Yes.

834
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:11,746
Those aren't what make you great.

835
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:24,925
Ms. Noh?

836
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,851
We meet again.

837
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,312
Yes.

838
01:03:40,524 --> 01:03:41,734
You look pretty today.

839
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,823
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

840
01:03:54,663 --> 01:03:56,624
I told you everything last time.

841
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,877
Yes, you did.

842
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:05,758
But I received information
that you might have lied to me.

843
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:11,055
I just met your ex-secretary at Jangsan.

844
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,640
And she told me that you have had

845
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:17,353
an issue with blacking out
ever since you were with Jangsan.

846
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:23,442
Whenever you'd win a case,
you'd drink with your clients, black out,

847
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,820
and the secretary
would clean up after you.

848
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,367
You always hung in there
until everyone finished drinking and left,

849
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:35,412
so the secretary said
only she knew about your blackouts.

850
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,622
Is that true?

851
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,460
Let me ask you again.

852
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,046
In the early morning
when Yoon Seokgu was murdered,

853
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:49,385
how much do you remember
of the time you spent with Mr. Jwa Sibaek?

854
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,889
Everything I'm about to say now

855
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:57,810
can and will be used against me,
so no comment.

856
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:01,105
Okay, fine.

857
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:04,316
You'll be summoned
as a witness for our investigation soon,

858
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,484
so please be ready.

859
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,613
Also, if your testimony
is proven to be false

860
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,783
and the murder charges
against Mr. Jwa are finalized,

861
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,995
you should also prepare yourself
for the consequences.

862
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,498
Yes, sure. Be my guest.

863
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:27,047
Are you really certain
that Mr. Jwa Sibaek isn't the culprit?

864
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:28,631
Yes.

865
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,468
Just recently,

866
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,638
someone threatened the police chief
with their car on the road.

867
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,601
I looked up the license plate,
and it was Mr. Jwa's car.

868
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,021
And this police chief

869
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,732
has a long history with the murdered
Yoon Seokgu and Cho Hyunsik,

870
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:48,444
as well as CEO Jang Gido of Jangsan.

871
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:53,741
He threatened someone like that
and disappeared

872
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,242
as if to say, "You're next."

873
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,411
Who did that? Mr. Jwa Sibaek.

874
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,291
Even after hearing this,
do you still not believe

875
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:08,047
that Mr. Jwa could possibly
be the culprit?

876
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,635
Was that police chief...

877
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,429
It was Chief Jeon Jaeho.

878
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,041
What happened
to finding Lee Dongpil?

879
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,251
<i>Yes, I went to Hwaju Temple.</i>

880
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,253
But he killed himself three years ago.

881
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,883
He killed himself?

882
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,927
<i>Yes, that's what the monk said.</i>

883
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:58,806
Look into it more.

884
01:06:59,556 --> 01:07:02,977
Find out why he killed himself
and if he really did kill himself.

885
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,394
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

886
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,272
What about Jwa Sibaek?

887
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,067
I put some of my staff on his tail,
but they haven't found anything.

888
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,569
He goes to work in the morning
with Noh Chakhee,

889
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,365
and he only travels between the office,
the courthouse, and the detention center.

890
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:20,869
And he sometimes leaves the office
to meet his defendants or something.

891
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:26,333
Jang Gido. Put a tail on him.

892
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,585
Jang Gido of Jangsan?

893
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,716
Jang Gido will run
for the National Assembly soon.

894
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:37,177
<i>Both Cho Hyunsik and Yoon Seokgu
would've gotten in the way of his future.</i>

895
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,138
They weren't people
who would've helped him.

896
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,682
But still, do you think
Jang Gido killed them?

897
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:43,767
You don't know what he's like.

898
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,520
You don't understand how far he'll go.

899
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,023
<i>Okay, well, I'll get on that.</i>

900
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:16,842
You're...

901
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:46,205
Spare me...

902
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,707
Why?
