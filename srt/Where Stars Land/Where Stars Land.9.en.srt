Did something happen to you?

11
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,840
Did you get hurt?

12
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,980
Because you look uncomfortable.

13
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,750
Isn't it too late?

14
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,190
You should've said that 12 years ago.

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,780

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,950
You haven't left for the day. That's good. Be on standby.

37
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,800
Section Chief Mo, have you heard anything more about the situation?

38
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
They are currently implementing the emergency plan.

39
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,960
I hope nothing goes wrong.

40
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,240
This is your first airplane accident, isn't it?

41
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,630
Yes, this is my first. I've only done it in training.

42
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,650
It's my first time too.

43
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,070
Yes, Section Chief.

44
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,070
No, it's still at the ramp. I'll go up immediately.

45
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,100
Then I will be leaving first. I have plans.

46
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,160
NA609, Incheon Tower, Roger.

Wind 300 at 9 knots. Clear to land, Runway 34.

49
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,430
Clear to land. Runway 34. NA609.

50
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,630
Everyone, please do not panic. Put your arms in front of the chairs.

51
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,270
- And put your heads down.
- I'm fully trained to handle an emergency like this.

52
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,470
Please remain calm.

53
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,210
Keep your head down.

54
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,230
Keep your heads down. Heads down.

55
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,830
Please keep your head down.

56
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,720
Keep your head down. Keep your head down.

57
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,410
Wow, you're a strong boy. It's cool that you're not afraid.

58
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,300
Cabin crew, please be seated.

59
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,930
A little more, just a little more.

60
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,820
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

61
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,370
It's finished!

62
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,140
Cabin crew, evacuate the passengers.

63
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,720
Yes, sir!

64
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,750
Is everyone okay?

65
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,550
No one is hurt, right?

66
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,880
Take it easy. Take it easy.

67
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,990
Nice landing.

68
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,340
Are you okay?

69
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,450
Are you okay?

70
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,220
NA609, aviation fire. Request fire service.

71
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,320
And expect passenger evacuation on the runway.

72
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,350
Han Yeo Reum...

73
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,030
Han Yeo Reum. Han Yeo Reum!

74
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,750
Where are you going?

75
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,660
You can't just go in there. It's the Notification Area.

76
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,250
What happened?

77
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,280
My mom is aboard that plane.

78
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,650
I said ... my mother is aboard.

79
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,730
Yes.

80
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes, so when

81
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,540
will that be resolved?

82
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,880
Ah, yes, I see.

83
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:18,460
It's the West Port Office. For now, they should stop taking off and landing at Runway 1 and 2.

84
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,360
As soon as the schedule comes out from the West Port Office, re-enter the FIDS (Flight Information Display System) again.

85
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,540
Yes, sir.

86
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,910
And Go Eun Seo.

87
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,100
Pick up your phone.

88
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,580
Yes?

89
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,160
What are you doing right now?

90
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,110
Is it a time where you can just use your phone?

91
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,390
Does this not look like an emergency to you?

92
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,520
One of the plane's engines bursted into flames,

93
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,170
so we had to emergency land it!

94
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm sorry. Actually, I know someone that was on that plane.

95
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,740
Yeah ok. Whatever it is,

96
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,850
we still have to do our duty.

97
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,870
Let's start getting the airlines' cooperation by phone. Spread the schedule of delayed flight arrivals quickly.

98
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,730
Yes.

99
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,250
The emergency landing was a success.

100
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,730
How many were injured?

101
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,400
- How many passengers were there?
- There were 252.

102
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,780
Team Leader Yang. What happened to the shelter for non-injured passengers?

103
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,110
Hold on, please.

104
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,810
It will be set up between 6 and 8 airside of Immigration. The field team is already on their way there.

105
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,450
In case there are delays in landing and taking off, as much as you can, please don't let the passengers get confused.

106
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,920
For now, prepare food and drinks for the non-injured passengers,

107
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,010
And just in case, please prepare cup noodles as well.

108
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,250
Get ready with enough blankets. You should deploy manpower divided across the buses

109
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,050
to guide the passengers. Yes.

110
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,400
Section Chief Gong. I need you to find out the flight information.

111
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,630
All right.

112
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,840
Team Leader Lee, how's the traffic side?

113
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,080
For now we have secured as much space as we can on B1.

114
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,040
We have directed that the cars of the 609 passenger's relatives and friends

115
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,270
will be parked in that lot.

116
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,070
I'm sure there are going to be a lot of press vehicles coming in shortly. Please take care of them.

117
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,330
Don't let there be an article about a traffic jam caused by an airport accident.

118
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,890
Of course.

119
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,140
You take charge of the site and report if anything happens.

120
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,670
Yes.

121
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,070
Yes, Chairman.

122
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,240
First of all, please send the press vehicles to the Transportation Department's parking lot. Don't let them obstruct the passengers' families' vehicles.

123
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,390
Well... all right.

124
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,800
(Arriving flights' statuses are changed from "Arriving" to "Delayed.")

125
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,630
(Departing flights' statuses are changed from "Boarding" to "Delayed."

126
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,390
Yes, I understand.

127
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,440
Every flight in Incheon is delayed.

128
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,340
It's going to be chaos on both sides of the terminal.

129
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,240
You need to go out to the terminal and control the situation on both sides.

130
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,640
All right.

131
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,060
Mobilize as much manpower from our team as possible to serve as guides.

132
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,610
- Assistant Nam, follow me.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,170
Where's Lee Soo Yeon? Is he back yet?

134
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,300
No, not yet.

135
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,070
We called him a while back already! Tell him to hurry!

136
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,190
Yes, Lee Soo Yeon.

137
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,630
Excuse me, may we ask about the accident?

138
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,390
They have landed safely.

139
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,210
I got a report that they made an emergency landing and they are in the midst of controlling the fire.

140
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,260
But why are you asking?

141
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,460
Han Yeo Reum's mother is on board that plane.

142
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,960
What?

143
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,270
She wants to personally go to the site, what should we do?

144
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,810
Is there something I can do out there, Team Leader?

145
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,950
Whatever it is, just let me go.

146
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,630
Team Leader.

147
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,220
You may not.

148
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,720
There are only two things which you can do in this situation.

149
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,080
Go back do your job or go to the family waiting room and wait for your mother.

150
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,940
All of the flights in Incheon have been delayed,

151
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,700
so it would be best for you to come to the site.

152
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,650
But if you say you are not in the right state because of your mother, then I understand.

153
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,990
The family waiting room is going to be on the first floor, so you can go there. That's all.

154
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,200
Who is on board?

155
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,720
The female employee, Han Yeo Reum ... It seems like her mother is on board.

156
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,780
Ahh...

157
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,280
Should I take you to the family waiting room?

158
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,420
Han Yeo Reum.

159
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,440
No. I also know where that is.

160
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,370
Should I stay with you?

161
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,770
I am asking about that... now.

162
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,950
What... do you mean?

163
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,660
It's a situation where I can't help but worry, even if you tell me not to worry.

164
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,400
You won't feel right to go back to work.

165
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,580
And I think you would be having a hard time.

166
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,220
So?

167
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,940
If I stay with you... it might be of help.

168
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,200
Ahhh... you meant it like that.

169
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,960
Well... like that.

170
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,040
It's okay.

171
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,690
I will be fine by myself.

172
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,640
The section chief is so mad. Hurry to the terminal.

173
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,770
Lee Soo Yeon

174
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,410
My mom is aboard that plane.

175
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,340
I said ... my mom is aboard that plane.

176
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,430
Passenger Service Team Lee Soo Yeon
♬  Because I know you ♬

177
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,550
Yes, Lee Soo Yeon.

178
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,420
What's your mother's name?

179
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,100
It's Yoon Hye Won. Why?

180
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,830
I received the order to escort the passengers.

181
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,810
Get on.

182
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,260
Hey, Na Hyeong Joo!

183
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,320
Focus.

184
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,220
Yes, I understand.

185
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,220
Children first, followed by senior citizens and ladies.

186
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,880
Sir, excuse me, sir!

187
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,520
Please exit in order!

188
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,070
I'm Director Ma. I need to get off first.

189
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,210
I need to go out in a hurry due to business matters.

190
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,350
Let me get off first.

191
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,480
In emergency situations, you should follow our instructions. Please move to the back.

192
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,660
Look here! I am a Business Class passenger!

193
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,760
In this situation the First Class and Business Class

194
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,280
- should have priority.
- Please go to the back.

195
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,520
Please keep the order.

196
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,870
- What!
- Ahjussi!

197
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,970
Don't you understand Korean? He said to keep order.

198
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,350
Children, elders then women. How many times do we have to repeat?

199
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,730
You always say how we differentiate between men and women,

200
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,670
why is it that during times like this women are first?

201
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,780
If they are needed, it's discrimination but in this situation it's ladies first?

202
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,600
So that's your problem. Okay.

203
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,540
Let's get off together.

204
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,080
I will get off with you at the very last. Equality between men and women.

205
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,100
What are you doing? Hurry and move back!

206
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
What the?!

207
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,040
Here, go.

208
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,660
Move back. All the way back.

209
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,280
Do it.

210
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,280
Perhaps are you Yoon Hye Won?

211
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,310
I'm sorry, are you Yoon Hye Won?

212
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,490
Go up slowly. Be careful of the steps.

213
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,990
Yes.

214
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,110
It seems there are no passengers that were hurt badly.

215
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,750
Han Yeo Reum, right? I heard your mother was on board that plane.

216
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,660
Yes.

217
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,910
I received a report about the scene.

218
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,310
As of now, it seems like there are no passengers who are badly hurt.

219
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,270
Really? There's really no one hurt?

220
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,090
As of now, there are none.

221
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,700
I am on my way to the non-injured passenger's area.

222
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,530
Pardon?

223
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,170
I received a call that the passengers who just came off the plane have arrived.

224
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,550
How about that? Do you want to go together?

225
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,930
Just move forward, everyone. Move.

226
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,100
Move forward. Keep in line. Keep in line.

227
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,660
Please move forward everyone. Do not stop. Just keep in line.

228
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,130
Slowly move forward.

229
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,390
Please do not stop.

230
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,480
Don't panic.

231
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,240
Please move slowly.

232
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,930
Are you okay?

233
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,860
Ahjussi!

234
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,230
Ahjussi!

235
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,900
Please be careful going down the stairs.

236
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,820
Look here!

237
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,740
Are you alright?

238
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,920
There's an injured passenger inside the plane. It's a Korean woman.

239
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,880
Yes, I understand.

240
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,840
- Na Yeong Joo.
- Yes, Sunbaenim.

241
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,020
The firemen just asked for support.

242
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,530
There's an injured woman inside. Go in with a medic.

243
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,500
Yes, I understand.

244
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,880
What are you doing, Na Yeong Joo?

245
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,660
Coming.

246
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,800
General Manager Gwon Hui Seung

247
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,290
Are you alright?

248
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,830
Yes.

249
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,320
I'm alright, so hurry and evacuate the other passengers.

250
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,560
Over here! Is there an attendant?

251
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,080
I called the Emergency team so they will be up shortly.

252
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,300
Then, just for a while...

253
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,070
Just close your eyes. It will be more comfortable.

254
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,730
Please keep in order until the last moment.

255
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,760
She's over there.

256
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,370
Thank you.

257
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,850
This way!

258
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,420
