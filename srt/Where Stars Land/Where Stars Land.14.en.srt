1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,320
It's so hard. I know it has to be done, but
Episode 14

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,890
this is the hardest thing we have to do.

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,680
I feel so bad when I think about those homeless people.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,930
But they interfere with our guests. And the complaints pour in.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,460
Here.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,570
Ah, thank you!

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,390
Thank you.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,330
Na Yeong Joo, are you not tired?

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,110
No, I'm fine.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,130
Ah, yes...

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,110
By the way, I don't see Lee Soo Yeon today.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,610
Yes, Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,290
Ah,

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,580
Agent Lee Soo Yeon was given a different task, so he's over at Commercial Facilities.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,530
But, why are you asking for Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,090
I always see you two stick like glue together, but today I can't see him.

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,750
What "stick like glue together"? When did we?

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,350
You're completely wrong.

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,390
You shouldn't say it like that, when we just do rounds together sometimes.

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,340
"We're always stuck together?" Someone would get the wrong idea if they heard that.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,200
I didn't have the wrong idea at all, Han Yeo Reum.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,430
What?

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,320
You need more water?

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,400
What's the matter? Come here.

25
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,900
These are the documents regarding Level 3, 3-16-02.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,640
Alright.

27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,380
What happened?

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,390
I came in person to brief you about the employee rest area.

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,630
Team Leader Yang told me to do so.

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,790
You're personally going to do it?

31
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,820
Yes. I will personally do it.

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,700
Today is a real mess since morning.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,140
Why? Are things going wrong?

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,690
If you're always so mindful of what others think, of course things will go wrong.

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,070
Who are you?

36
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't try to find out. You'll only get hurt.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,550
From the looks of it, you seem to have a subtly bright personality but

38
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,000
you were born and bred without much luck.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,650
Right?

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,930
What do you mean?

41
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,960
You have memories of being greatly hurt by your parents at a young age, don't you?

42
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,900
Good then. Try to convince me.

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,440
As you can see, because the majority of the stores are arranged here,

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,180
the location is a place relatively out of the line of traffic and sight of passengers.

45
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,820
I know, that's why the Commercial Facilities Team also wants this space.

46
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,170
There have been many complaints that the existing rest area is too small to sleep.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,840
If we move to a larger space, we expect to resolve many of the complaints from staff staying there.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,150
What will happen if I split the space between the east and west?

49
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,590
We need a larger space. It doesn't make sense to split a small space into two.

50
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,350
If they're split, we'll need double the manpower and expense.

51
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,810
It seems the Passenger Service Team is always having problems with manpower.

52
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,420
That's just because we are short of manpower.

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,100
Instead of "not enough", "there aren't any", "it can't be done", and the like,

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,590
can't you operate efficiently with the manpower you have?

55
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,880
It's easy to say from the top "work efficiently with the same personnel",

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,390
but in the end, it only means the subordinates should suffer.

57
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,820
You might say that, but I don't want to install an employee rest area there.

58
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,140
The Commercial Facilities team and the company are talking about using the space as a warehouse.

59
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,330
A warehouse is fine but are you inclined to provide an employee rest area?

60
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,350
Or I might give it to an airline.

61
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,470
We know that the rate of usage by airline staff of the rest area is very high.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Saying that you will satisfy one airline at the expense of a rest area

63
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,260
used by the other airlines' employees is rather biased.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,060
- Please eat it.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,700
Cherry and pistachio flavor.

66
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,340
I bought them both.

67
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,200
Yes.

68
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,030
By any chance...

69
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,940
Are you some type of philosopher or fortune-teller?

70
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,080
Stuff like face-reading, palm-reading, fate-reading...

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,640
A long time ago, I did study that for a while.

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,710
To be honest, I am someone who studies psychology.

73
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,720
Don't you dare tell anyone.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,390
If it gets out that I'm here, it will be a big headache and a nuisance.

75
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,600
But, why are you talking about my parents?

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,070
Your actions say so.

77
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,030
When I see people like you, who care so much about what others think of them,

78
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,090
- it means either their parents were extremely cautious in expressing approval,
- That wasn't the case.

79
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,830
or they didn't compliment you enough when you were young.

80
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,670
You're wrong again.

81
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,530
Then, were you either ignored or abandoned as a child?

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,590
That's it!

83
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm right, aren't I?

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,420
I could do it that way, too. If you keep making guesses, of course one will eventually be correct.

85
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,070
The wall around your heart is too strong.

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,330
Me? Surely not.

87
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,160
I am open-minded.

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,130
You might be smiling. But you're not smiling because you're happy, you're smiling to hide.

89
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,970
You don't want to expose how you really feel.

90
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,730
You're afraid that people will turn their backs on you.

91
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,140
No need to live always hiding everything.

92
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,700
Be clear when you like something. The world will go on either way.

93
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,490
If someone likes you, just accept that person.

94
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,570
If someone doesn't like you, don't mind them either.

95
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,730
Life isn't such a big deal.

96
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,430
Wow, this is so good! You try some, too.

97
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,000
Hello?

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,300
It's me. I came over because it's lunchtime. Do you want to eat together?

99
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,390
Okay. I'll save us seats.

100
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,360
Hey, did you hear? Apparently, Han Yeo Reum and Lee Soo Yeon are dating.

101
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,790
They even slept together.

102
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,460
I also heard about it. It's totally awesome!

103
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,570
Let's say Han Yeo Reum is like that. But why would Lee Soo Yeon do this?

104
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,000
Why Han Yeo Reum out of all people?

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,870
First of all, she's pretty. I heard guys don't care as long as a woman is pretty.

106
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,460
What era did you hear that from? It's not like that nowadays.

107
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,890
That's right. I heard guys check a woman's salary these days.

108
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,520
Of course we should. We should care about the salary.

109
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,630
Excuse me. May I interrupt you? Where is the source of what you just said?

110
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,060
What?

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,690
I need to know what kind of jerk is spreading those rumors.

112
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,980
Go Eun Seob, why are you coming out? Are the tables full?

113
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,610
Let's go somewhere else! All of a sudden, I feel like eating kal-guksu (hand-made noodle soup).

114
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,100
Let's go eat kal-guksu. Let's go! Let's go!

115
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,260
Oh, hey!

116
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,890
Wh-wh-wh-what? An office couple?

117
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,150
Please keep it down. People will hear you.

118
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,070
Really? Is that true? For real? Oh my god!

119
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,390
What is "Oh, my god!"?

120
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,420
Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Reum have become a couple.

121
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,290
Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Reum?

122
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,760
Yes!

123
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,500
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

124
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,580
Why are you all alone? Didn't you buy something to eat?

125
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,320
No, I think I don't need something.

126
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,720
Did your briefing with Seo In Woo go well?

127
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, I tried my best.

128
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,020
Good job.

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,360
Here, have this.

130
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,020
I enjoyed the latte you made for me this morning.

131
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,100
So the lunch latte is my treat.

132
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,820
Thank you.

133
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,270
Yeah... Hot, hot.

134
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,310
Look at the two of you right out in the open.

135
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,330
I must be losing my touch. I should have caught on sooner.

136
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,460
What are you talking about?

137
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,760
So he wasn't asking for money. From what I've heard.

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,360
Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Reum, you're dating. The office couple.

139
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,730
You should be better about it if you were going to date in secret.

140
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,400
Last night you were at Lee Soo Yeon's house.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,640
Ahhh...

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,200
And you got caught this morning on the way out by Na Yeong Joo.

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,830
Since you're now an official couple, you should treat us.

144
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,270
Treat us out! Treat us out! Treat us out!

145
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,000
Treat us out! Treat us out!

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,730
Treat us out! Treat us out! Treat us out!

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,490
Han Yeo Reum.

148
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,600
Where did you hear such a thing?

149
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,410
How can you find the source of a rumor?

150
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,830
Am I right, Assistant Nam?

151
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,540
I heard it, too.

152
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,060
Is that your house?

153
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm curious who it is, that "someone you just know."

154
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,290
I don't see Lee Soo Yeon today.

155
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,370
I always see you two stick like glue together, but today I can't see him.

156
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,710
I'd like to meet with Na Yeong Joo please.

157
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,940
Han Yeo Reum, she just went to the break room to rest.

158
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,880
What is it?

159
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,560
I didn't see you in that light. But how could you spread those rumors without even checking if they're true?

160
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,390
Rumors?

161
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,070
Na Yeong Joo, you're a woman, too.

162
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,960
How could a woman do that to another woman?

163
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,030
You know how detrimental that type of rumor is.

164
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,600
Why are you doing this to me?

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
Are you harboring something against me?

166
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,400
How could you spread such vicious rumors?

167
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm sorry, but I don't understand a single word you're saying.

168
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,170
Why are you pretending not to understand?

169
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,270
You saw me leaving Lee Soo Yeon's house this morning when I woke up.

170
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,000
That's why you spread that rumor all over!

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Lee Soo Yeon, you say? That was Lee Soo Yeon's house?

172
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,090
Wow, you're an expert at pretending not to know. Really!

173
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,260
Like you say, you shouldn't put blame where it doesn't belong.

174
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,150
Na Yeong Joo!

175
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,240
I had no clue until just now that it was Lee Soo Yeon's house.

176
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,560
I found out right now since you just said it.

177
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,100
I don't know what kind of rumor there is causing you to do this to me.

178
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,580
But go check what the truth is before accusing me. It wasn't me.

179
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,950
But then, who?

180
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,490
Stop asking me when I don't know either.

181
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,270
Han Yeo Reum, come talk with me.

182
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,550
You really didn't say anything?

183
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,190
No, I didn't say anything.

184
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,350
I beg your pardon.

185
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,150
Let's go!

186
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,040
Na Yeong Joo, it really wasn't you, was it?

187
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,770
I said it wasn't. Really!

188
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,560
Who do you take me for?

189
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,110
What did you say?

190
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,000
There was someone else besides us in the supply room.

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,090
No way. I checked when we went in there though.

192
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,550
You must not have seen past the shelves because it was too dark.

193
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,260
It was my fault. Because of Seo In Woo's briefing,

194
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,690
I missed my opportunity to tell you about it.

195
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,330
Han Yeo Reum..

197
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,380
Just... give me some time alone.

198
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,040
Just leave me alone.

199
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,370
So, did you make a decision regarding the employee rest area?

200
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Team Leader Yang, what do you think you're doing now?

201
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,510
You need to wait for the official results to come back. How can you barge in like this?

202
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,000
The orders for the rest area construction need to go in right away. Do you think a decision can be made by today?

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,440
The same goes for us. It would be better to get a quick decision, Team Leader Seo.

204
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,420
Firstly, both of the teams presented good reasons as to why they need the space.

205
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,720
- So what's the decision?
- Which way did you decide?

206
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,370
Level 3, 3-16-02,

207
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm handing it over to the Commercial Facilities Team.

208
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,750
Yes! I knew you would see the bigger picture!

209
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,240
You sure know what needs to be done for the sake of the airport.

210
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,290
Thank you, Team Leader Seo.

211
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,320
Yes!

212
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,260
Was our team's briefing that terrible?

213
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,560
No, Lee Soo Yeon did well. He left no room for error.

214
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,180
But...?

215
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,380
It's just because the reasons that were presented by the Commercial Facilities Team were more appealing.

216
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,520
Team Leader Heo was great at negotiating the commercial contract deposits.

217
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,190
Do you feel good after screwing Lee Soo Yeon and me over like that?

218
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,880
It's unfortunate if you misunderstand me that way.

219
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,010
I made my judgment and laid down my decision as the Operations Planning Team Leader.

220
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,060
Yeah, right!

221
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,990
What happened to the employee rest area?

222
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,690
Commercial Facilities Team got it.

223
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,350
What?

224
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,170
Yes! Yay!

225
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,120
I'll treat you all!

226
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,500
Lee Soo Yeon, how did you give the briefing that...

227
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,150
How could you get it taken away by the Commercial Facilities team who merely submitted a piece of paper?

228
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,180
You can't win against a piece of paper, and yet you can date just fine.

229
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,900
Why? What?

230
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,500
What are you looking at? What did you do right?

231
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,410
Han Yeo Reum is a problem here, too.

232
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,560
If she was tagged as a bomb and passed onto Passenger Services, she should get her act straight and work hard.

233
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,660
Instead she wastes time dating a newbie.

234
00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:01,070
Don't you know that it can hurt just by people looking at you?

235
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,630
Yes. I know it too well.

236
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,050
That's why her words hurt more.

237
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,320
Don't say those things so carelessly.

238
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,760
What?

239
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,020
I admit that I didn't complete my job fully.

240
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,230
But ... that's where it ends.

241
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,600
Look, I'm asking about your work-related responsibilities.

242
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,980
Exactly. So just ask about work-related responsibilities.

243
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,310
Don't drag in someone who has nothing to do with it.

244
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,210
Look at you.

245
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,820
Lee Soo Yeon, are you talking back to me?

246
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,870
That's enough, Section Chief Gong.

247
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,690
Did I make something up or what?

248
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,800
How dare you raise your voice with those eyes at me?!

249
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,380
I said that's enough.

250
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,910
Am I doing this for no reason?

251
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,070
I'm so mad that he lost a done deal.

252
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,660
Are you going to keep at it, Section Chief Gong Seung Cheol?

253
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,580
If you're going to keep at it, don't just talk. Grab him by the throat and fight a round.

254
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,220
What is it? Should we get out the mats? Is that what you want?

255
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,350
Seriously.

256
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,300
I'll go check the airside once.

257
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,350
Han Yeo Reum doesn't feel that way.

258
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,240
I'm the one who likes her.

259
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm the only one to have feelings.

260
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:10,510
♬ Someday in your life, running in different ways.
Can someone come and... ♬

261
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,270
Han Yeo Reum, where are you?

262
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,740
♬ take me to my way. ♬

263
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,790

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,430
♬  So lay down just for one night. ♬

265
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,640
Han Yeo Reum, please respond.

266
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,430
Han Yeo Reum,

267
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,050
♫ Or see the way of life.  ♫

268

♫ Every time it feels like an ending for all ♫

269
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:45,360
♬ Maybe it's a day to stop for a moment to smile. ♬

271
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,930
♬ The life is too short to cry.  ♬

272
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,830
Hello?

273
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,260
Yes. One moment please.

274
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,900
Assistant Nam.

275
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,090
Hello?

276
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,730
Is this Nam Woo Jin of Passenger Services?

277
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,290
Yes, this is. May I ask who is calling?

278
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,060
I won't beat around the bush. Stop talking about other people so carelessly.

279
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,730
What?

280
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:34,130
If you keep spreading malicious rumors with no proof behind them, I'm going to reveal your private information to others.

281
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,650
Look here. Who are you?

282
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,660
Do you want to know who I am?

283
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,620
Then first go to Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Reum and apologize.

284
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:49,370
If you admit your role and apologize to them for what you did, I'll tell you who I am and apologize to you.

285
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,690
What? Who are you?

286
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,620
It feels pretty bad, doesn't it?

287
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,880
That's how it feels to be talked about behind your back.

288
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,900
It's fun when it's someone else. But it feels rotten when it's about you.

289
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,330
So watch yourself in the future.

290
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,200
What the...?

291
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,100
What's wrong? Who is it?

292
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,160
It's nothing. Just a prank call.

293
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,210
Honey, what are you doing?

294
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,560
Really? Another business trip?

295
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,840
Omo! My honey must be tired. What should I do?

296
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,100
Is that so? Then shall we have a glass of wine tonight?

297
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,440
I accomplished something big today, too.

298
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,110
Then, see you at home.

299
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,110
Team leader Yang, are you not going home?

300
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:06,190
Whether you're a man or a woman, you need to have a family as you age.

301
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,050
Aren't you getting off work, Team leader Heo?

302
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,970
Why shouldn't I? I have to go home with my family.

303
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,010
Hey, son! Where are you?

304
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,710
Are you at the cram school?

305
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Let me buy you a drink, Team leader Yang.

306
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,960
No, I have some work left. Please go first.

307
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,290
Don't work so hard spinning your wheels.

308
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,070
There's plenty of time before the year-end review.

309
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,160
Shall I go now too?

310
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,580
How long were you here for?

311
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,950
I came right after work.

312
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,330
My luggage is at your house.

313
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,330
Ah... Would you like to go in with me for a little while?

314
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,750
No.

315
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,510
Even if it might be inconvenient for you, I would appreciate it if you could bring them for me.

316
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,350
Okay then. Wait a moment.

317
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,260
Thank you, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

318
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,660
Are you okay?

319
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,440
I just want to erase everything that happened during the whole day.

320
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,580
It's my fault after all.

321
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,210
I was rash and acted foolishly.

322
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,360
I have no excuse for myself,

323
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,740
and I can't find the words to say in this situation.

324
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:22,740
I wish I could crawl into a rat hole somewhere.

325
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,950
Give me your address. I'll help you find your place.

326
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,320
It's okay. I can go by myself.

327
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,200
No need to wander all around here alone searching for it.

328
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,060
Give it to me, okay?

329
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,640
What's wrong?

330
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,720
What? Is there something wrong?

331
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,870
No way.

332
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,390
I think this is the right place.

333
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,910
As if! That can't be.

334
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,670
It's right. It's unit N° 103, 1st floor. It's that house there.

335
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,220
This makes no sense.

336
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,840
She's late. I heard she will be moving in tonight.

337
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
No, I can't go in there.

338
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
Han Yeo Reum.

339
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,720
Never! Absolutely not!

340
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,910
Where are you going to go?

341
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,810
Anywhere except there.

342
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,780
I will never go inside that house.

343
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,400
Why aren't you going in? From now on, you'll live in that house.

344
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,260
I'm just going to look for another place.

345
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,470
Why are you being like this? Really!

346
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,200
What is it that you are so afraid of?

347
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,760
I'm not avoiding it out of fear. It's because it's humiliating.

348
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,190
What are you so embarrassed about?

349
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,340
Is it me? Or the fact that I like you?

350
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,160
It's me.

351
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,720
It's because I'm embarrassed and ashamed.

352
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,930
Is that good enough for you?

353
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,590
There are no coincidences in life.

354
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,650
There are no coincidences in life.

355
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:22,240
Everything that happens in life, has a reason.

356
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,260
Everything that happens in life, has a reason.

357
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,350
I'm sure you'll see after you get through today, there was a reason for everything that happened.

358
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,040
- So...
- That saying...

359
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,900
How do you know about it?

360
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,500
Now go into your house. Stop being embarrassed.

361
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,110
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

362
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,980
Do you, by any chance...

363
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,710
know my dad?

364
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,570
Do you?

365
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,490
For the brothers, one for each on the house.

366
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,280
Give me a little bit more.

367
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,590
Hey, give me some. Hey!

368
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,980
Yes. I know him.

369
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,500
