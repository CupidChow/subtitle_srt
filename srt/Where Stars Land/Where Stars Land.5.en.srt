1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,930
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,580
Yeo Reum, in dad's workplace, the stars fall every day.

3
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,730
It's a place where thousands of stars come down and leave.

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,520
In that place, I met that person.

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,210
Then we will prepare the equipment.

6
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,450
A person who has arms and legs which do not feel pain.

7
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,050
Was it because of that?

8
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,700
Eating alone is a given, he has never attended a company dinner once.

9
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,380
He hasn't anyone he is close to there is a not even anyone who pretends to be close to him.

10
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,000
I wish there would be no instance where people would pay attention to me.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,230
As for me, I, as much as possible, enjoy working behind the scenes, quietly and out of sight..

12
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,230
We'll get 10 tickets ready and we'll bring them to counter B. Good work.

13
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,050
Thank you.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,960
- More stanchions near KR Airlines should be put up and ...
- There are some extra ones in the storage room.

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,040
How many are there not counting the damaged ones?

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,780
There are probably fifteen-twenty.

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,610
Yes, Manager. This is Lee Soo Yeon from the PS Team.

18
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,140
I wonder how it became like that?

19
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,200
We have at least fifteen stanchions.

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,670
I think we can put as many as ten at departure counter B.

21
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,730
Was it from when he was born or from an accident?
Yes, we will take care of it.

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,250
Do you have something to say to me?

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,360
No. I don't.

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,850
What is it? Did you cause trouble again?

25
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,120
Or... do you have a request?

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,990
I won't tell anyone.

27
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,140
What you told me ... that time.

28
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,970
How are you okay? It was 100 degrees boiling water!

29
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,700
I can't feel pain.

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,010
See, pain...

31
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,620
Please do the morning check once more for unauthorized fixtures airside.

32
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,220
"Airside" - the area accessible only to passengers who have gone through immigration and security.

33
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,190
Do you want to eat lunch with me? I will be your lunch buddy.

34
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,790
I don't need one.

35
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,070
Aren't you bored eating alone?

36
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,420
You should complete your task properly.

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,410
Anyway, this is your final task in T1 (Terminal 1).

38
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,490
Pardon?

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,130
Final task?

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,960
- Haven't you heard anything from Section Chief Gong?
- No, what?

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,750
About the transfer? You haven't heard anything yet?

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,980
Transfer? Section Chief Gong?

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,360
What is this mix of two terms?

44
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,190
- Could it be ... ?

45
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,850
- Pack your things.
- Pack my things?

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,390
Yes. From today onward you don't have to work in T1.
(Terminal 1)

47
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,550
So, pack your things.

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,070
I'm sorry but ... I haven't heard anything about this.

49
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,930
You will get the call this afternoon. So pack your things first.

50
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,080
Perhaps, did I do something wrong again?

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,980
Let me see... I don't know about that.

52
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,650
But it's a notice that came from way up there. Just so you know.

53
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,550
From way up there?

54
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,710
- Are you all ready?
- Yes, Team Leader!

55
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,170
What are you doing not packing your things?

56
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,940
Huh?

57
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,180
I need to know the reason, Team Leader.

58
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,250
I was moved here only one week ago.

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,750
I worked so hard that I ran with all my might.

60
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,790
Hey, there Miss Han Yeo Reum.

61
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,120
Aside from being late from the first day, every day I came an hour early and went around the field.

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,140
- So?
- So...

63
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,600
Why do I have to pack my things again?

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,900
Even though you have to follow orders from the higher ups,

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,760
shouldn't you at least tell me the reason?

66
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,860
Do those words mean that you don't want to go with me?

67
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,560
- Pardon?
- If you don't like it, then I can't do anything about it.

68
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
- Let's go.
- Yes, Team Leader.

69
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,510
What do you mean go together? Where?

70
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,190
- To T2 (Terminal 2).
- Why T2?

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,310
I told you already that I don't know and that it was an order from the higher ups.

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,820
We just pack if they tell us to and go if they tell us to go.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,820
You're also going?

74
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,720
Ahhh... Didn't I say so?

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,360
That I and Lee Soo Yeon are also going?

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,760
You're also going?

77
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,130
I got the order too.

78
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,320
Then you really should have told me so.

79
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,090
I thought I was being chased out so I was scared.

80
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,760
Aren't you going to pack?

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,930
What do you mean? Of course I will. Wait a moment.

82
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,360
But still, it seems like the Team Leader isn't picking on me seeing how she's also taking me, right?

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,260
I will be going first.

84
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,020
Wait for a moment!

85
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's go together!

86
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,970
To Terminal 2

87
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,520
Wait a moment!

88
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,840
Free Ride Airport Bus

89
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,100
For plant quarantine (vegetables, fruits, etc.)

90
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,160
Animal quarantine (meat, sausage, other meats)

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,780
Guns, drugs, live ammunition and tear gas guns etc.)

92
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,240
Overseas purchase of $600 or more.

93
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,360
What is that?

94
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,100
Oh my!

95
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,830
Seriously.

96
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,580
Dust.

97
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,120
Dust.

98
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,760
Dust.

99
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,250
Dust.

100
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,390
Dust.

101
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,960
Dust.

102
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,170
Dust.

103
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,060
Dust.

104
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,010
Dust.

105
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,610
Dust.

106
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,990
Dust.

107
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,660
Dust.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
Dust.

109
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,960
Dust.

110
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,720
You should wipe your shoes better before tracking all that dust.

111
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,790
Dust.

112
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,690
Dust.

113
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,420
Wow, the main offices are awesome.

114
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,850
Welcome, Sunbae. There's your seat.

115
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,540
That person.

116
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:03,380
The company is a cold-hearted place. Your value is based solely on your abilities and evaluation. Did you get that?

117
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,600
If you cause a ruckus without being able to control your emotions once more, it will not end with just a warning.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,670
And the the two-month salary cut that followed.

119
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,990
If you are unhappy with the audit office's decision, please submit evidence to rebut it.

120
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,730
Why is that person here?

121
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,790
Say your greetings. He's Section Chief Gong Seung Cheol who came to T2 with me.

122
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,150
Hello, I was able to greet you a few times before.

123
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,550
I remember. I am the new Team Leader of the Operations Planning Department, Seo In Woo.

124
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,690
Team Leader?

125
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,800
I heard you went to consult with Arville Airport. When did you arrive?

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,660
It's been a week.

127
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,290
I will be seeing you often now. I put myself in your care.

128
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,340
And this is our team's newbie, Lee Soo Yeon.

129
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,870
What kind of greeting is that? So rude just nodding your head.

130
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,330
Where is my desk?

131
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,720
Just sit anywhere.

132
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,120
Young people these days...

133
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,800
Now they don't really look up to those who are higher.

134
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,550
They don't reply to what you say and just greet haphazardly.

135
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,500
Where's that one person?

136
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,940
What should I do?

137
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,330
If he's T2's Team Leader then I will be seeing him every day in the building.

138
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,200
What are you doing?

139
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,640
Team Leader...

140
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,530
Oh my, how are you?

141
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,090
You've grown up a lot. You're now saying your greetings while sitting.

142
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,770
Ah...

143
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,560
I. AM. GOING. CRAZY.

144
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,230
You're late.

145
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,460
Are you smoking?

146
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,610
I quit about five years ago. Now I only smoke one when I get very stressed.

147
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,300
But my lighter isn't listening.

148
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,310
What's the matter, at this hour?

149
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,770
Why did you turn your phone off?

150
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,500
I thought there would be no reason to pick up now.

151
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,370
If you quit your job, are you also going to quit on your human relationships?

152
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,370
I don't want to live under the scrutiny of those who look at me differently.

153
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,160
I'd like to be someone who has nothing to do with others ... that's how I want to live.

154
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,170
That will be difficult, since you are handsome enough to catch attention.

155
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,260
Even your personality is so prickly that you can't live having nothing to do with other people.

156
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,150
I am not joking.

157
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,980
I am also not joking. There will be a department move to T2 tomorrow.

158
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,540
I will be taking Section Chief Gong and you. Just so you know.
- Team Leader.

159
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,760
Team Leader—

160
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,280
When you go there, you would meet people whom you are curious about.

161
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,160
Seo In Woo, that person.

162
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,240
You can just come to work as usual. As if nothing happened.

163
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,040
Do you have time?

164
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,300
No. I'm busy.

165
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,000
Please come and talk with me.

166
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,000
What is it about?

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,580
It's an emergency situation.

168
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,820
It's a disaster. I'm surrounded by enemies. There's no one on my side. It's a teacup in the tempest.

169
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,350
It's a tempest in a teacup. You've got it reversed but it doesn't fit the situation.

170
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,180
Anyway, between Operations Planning Team Leader Seo In Woo, and Traffic Team Leader Lee Woo Taek,

171
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,630
I have nowhere to turn to.

172
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,500
What about Team Leader Seo In Woo?

173
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,030
He is the very person who hit me docking my pay for two months.

174
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,710
While controlling me like an emotionally disturbed person, he is coldhearted with neither blood nor tears. Teng!

175
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:17,280
And on top of that, Team Leader Lee Yoo Taek... When I was in the Traffic Team, do you know how much he hated me?

176
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,000
Just one reason. I'm a woman.

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,920
Maybe not.

178
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,010
That maybe not guy. The person he latched onto is me.

179
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,810
Every time he speaks it's "a woman is this and that."

180
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,470
It's a given that you work hard til you die and you are dumb if you make a mistake.

181
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,350
He is literally the top old man with a bad attitude among the old men with bad attitudes.

182
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,840
A blood-sucker voraciously exploiting the effort and hard work of his subordinates!

183
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,140
I can hear you.

184
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,210
Talking behind someone's back, why is your voice so loud?

185
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,860
This woman is sloppy. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

186
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:02,040
You heard him say those things about a woman?

187
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,680
Oh! Team Leader Seo came.

188
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,390
Now that it seems like we're all here should we share introductions with each other?

189
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,450
We already exchanged greetings outside.

190
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,940
I see. So next, Team Leader Lee Yoo Taek from the Traffic Service.

191
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,080
It's also been just 2 weeks since Team Leader Lee has moved here.

192
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,090
- Welcome, Team Leader Yang.
- I'll see you often, Team Leader Lee.

193
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,180
And also, the original member of T2, Team Leader Heo Young Ran.

194
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,460
- It's been a while, Ms. Yang Seo Goon.
- I know right, Ms. Heo Young Ran.

195
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,360
You must have had a hard time in T1.

196
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,230
You don't look as vital as you used to. Even your skin seems to be getting saggy.

197
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,500
Team Leader Heo, it seems nice that you are lucky.

198
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,150
You must have poured everything into your skin care instead of work.

199
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,720
You're still not married. It seemed like you were going to get married.

200
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,930
And you haven't divorced yet? It seemed like you would be getting a divorce.

201
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,080
I think greetings are over. Can I just go out now?

202
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,410
Not yet, there is still one more person. The Security Team has changed its team leader this time.

203
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,070
Oh, just in time!

204
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,030
I'm a bit late. I was transferring duties in T1.

205
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,800
Where did Han Yeo Reum go this time?

206
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,440
Well, we can do the one missing next time.

207
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,520
Well, shall we start with introducing ourselves?

208
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,640
Is the new incoming chief of security Choi Moo Ja?

209
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,530
Ah, so nice to see you again!

210
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,670
You are more beautiful, Team Leader Heo.

211
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,820
I know that too. Anyway, I could kill you for using those discerning eyes.

212
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,010
Hello, Team Leader Lee.

213
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,500
Welcome, Team Leader Choi.

214
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,990
Thank you.

215
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,950
It's been a while.

216
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,060
Yes. Please take good care of me, Team Leader Choi.

217
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,900
What do you mean? We just have to do our own duties well.

218
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,690
Don't you think so? Team Leader Yang?

219
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,470
Now, all our Team Leaders for special operations in T2 are gathered.

220
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,040
Except for Team Leader Heo, there are four team leaders who were newly appointed.

221
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,070
As you know, it was for the sake of smoother operation of T2.

222
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,100
After getting the President's approval with difficulty, because bringing this move about was extraordinary,

223
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,270
each of you should apply your capability. You're all team players so I'm sure you will do well.

224
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,630
Yes, I'll do my best.

225
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,390
But then they say that work also follows a person's fate.

226
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,960
Of all the things, you have been assigned to the most headache-inducing job, Team Leader Yang.

227
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,100
Why are you like that? Is it because of Team Leader Heo?

228
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,530
She is always conscious of feeling a huge rivalry with you

229
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,690
while she compares each and everything and creates a diversion.

230
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,930
Then, why did you have to come to T2?

231
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,800
Me? Did I follow you? I just followed orders.

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,150
When was that? Was it before they also told me to transfer? Or after?

233
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,030
How would I know that?

234
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,540
Is there something that happens in the airport that you don't know?

235
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,460
What is it again this time? What else did I do wrong?

236
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,790
Go back to T1.

237
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,620
Nothing works according to my plan.

238
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,760
What's wrong? You can do it as long as you want to.

239
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,550
Yes, tell me.

240
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,120
Has the meeting of all team leaders already finished?

241
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,980
What about Lee Soo Yeon?

242
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,170
He was sent to Customs. He is going to check both the body and the status of the damaged cart.

243
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,070
What should I do? Should I tell him to come back?

244
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,970
No.

245
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,560
It seems that Team leader Choi is interested in me so it's very stressful.

246
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,580
You'll be fine if you go to T2. By any chance, do you think Team leader Choi will follow you until there?

247
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,690
What should I do? I'm dead meat.

248
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,550
How come I meet all of them in one place?

249
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,100
What am I going to do now?

250
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,130
What do you mean?

251
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,900
Consider it as fate and live diligently.

252
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,930
Are you now saying that to comfort me?

253
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,960
Then, would you like to cry together?

254
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,150
Han Yeo Reum, is that what you want?

255
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,610
I do not feel like joking right now.

256
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:47,110
Team Leader Yang, Section Chief Gong and, on top of that, there's Team Leader Seo and Team Leader Lee. It's a layered cake over there.

257
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,780
I need sincere comfort and encouragement so that I can survive here!

258
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,100
What do you want to hear?

259
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,870
It's okay.

260
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,450
You are doing well right now.

261
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,140
I really try to listen to it once. Even if they are mean, I'll bear it and

262
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,400
even though it's difficult, I will smile. But even If I'm dying and I'm trying my best,

263
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,300
I don't even hear it once.

264
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,220
It's okay.

265
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,920
From the start you have had accidents and mistakes. Since it's happening again, what's the matter? What?

266
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,140
Why are you acting as if it's something new?

267
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,580
Do you want me to kill you?

268
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,360
If you're miserable too what will happen if you tremble for more than five minutes?

269
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,500
It will become reality.

270
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
If you finish as a miserable loser all by yourself, what will the reality become?

271
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,610
A nuisance.

272
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,890
So stop pleading misery and get back to work

273
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,920
So after work ends, I will treat you to soju and beer.

274
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,800
Forget it. You drink that homemade beer.

275
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,730
What are you doing here?

276
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,020
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

277
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,830
I'm on my way to Customs per the directions of Section Chief Gong. He asked me to check the damaged cart.

278
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,200
Okay. I understand. Let's go together.

279
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:25,480
Why don't you take care of the things you do not want to hear before the things you want to hear?

280
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,180
A woman is this and that, those are words you don't have to hear.

281
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,460
Please go to Team leader Yang and tell her.

282
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,920
Those words are not easy to digest.

283
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,710
I want to live too.

284
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,080
- Will you die if you say those things?
- Probably.

285
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,070
How?

286
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,010
That person is a very high Team Leader and I am just an ordinary worker.

287
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,760
And in reality, they are not on my side.

288
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,510
You never tried it before. How would you know?

289
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,440
Whatever you are thinking about, you never say it yourself.

290
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,800
Of course not. Who am I, to say this kind of things aloud?

291
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,780
Having barely made it through the first year, all I can do now is respond to the passenger's complaints.

292
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,190
It's all checking for unauthorized fixtures, taking care of stanchions, and checking damaged carts.

293
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,220
I work so hard that my feet bleed from roaming the airport and it doesn't show.

294
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,510
What great work do I do for me to say what I think?

295
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,290
" You don't work well and you complain all the time."

296
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,210
"Being useless is rude". It's very obvious that you'll say something like that.

297
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,890
But if you keep silent allowing the other party to think they're correct,

298
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,450
you'll never hear what you want to hear.

299
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,360
You say your words so effortlessly.

300
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,970
I didn't think that it would've been hard to understand for you.

301
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,020
You take care of the western side, and I'll take care of the eastern side.

302
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,230
What the heck?

303
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,270
Overseas purchase of $600 or more.

304
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,930
What are you doing?

305
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,120
The workers stuck these here. Though I didn't even buy a lot.

306
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,830
Would it be so hard to let travelers feel good by giving them a pass?

307
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,660
Isn't that so?

308
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,910
This is the ladies' restroom in the customs area.

309
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,960
I discovered a female customer removing the yellow customs labels.

310
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,520
I think you need to come for this.

311
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,700
Oh, my gosh. Unni, are you a Customs officer?

312
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,270
I am a Security employee and not your Unni.

313
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,330
Security Team?

314
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,470
Hey listen, are you even doing your work correctly?

315
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,220
You think that just because you are the Security Team, it means you're all that?

316
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,690
Can you just investigate like this?

317
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,360
I have never done such a thing and we don't do those.

318
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,220
And I was just on my way home.

319
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,940
If you are on your way home, just head home.

320
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,350
Why are you butting into other people's business?

321
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,350
Okay. I am getting engaged the day after tomorrow.

322
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,640
I bought my fiancé's suit and our couple ring.

323
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,800
Is it such a huge sin for me to buy this?

324
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,610
You should say those to the Customs employee.

325
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,190
I wasn't going to tell you this... but do you know who my father is?

326
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,300
What would I do if I knew who your father was?

327
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,930
If you knew who my father is...! You can not do this to me!

328
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,030
Good for you having such a father.

329
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,590
But if you have such a father, why are you doing this kind of pathetic thing?

330
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,350
Pathetic?

331
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,960
If you went and bought things abroad, then you should pay tax confidently.

332
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,620
If you don't want to pay tax, then you should have just bought moderately.

333
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,730
What on earth is this? Secretly in the women's restroom.

334
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,070
Yah! Let's not drop formalities among people who just met.

335
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,820
Excuse me, wait a moment. This is a public restroom.

336
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,440
Other passengers would be uncomfortable if you do this here.

337
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,870
You... why don't you try getting cursed at.

338
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,940
If you do that, your fine will just increase.

339
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,650
Let me go! You're not going to let go?

340
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,780
You must be crazy. You're not going to let go?

341
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,280
You could get hurt so you should come out quietly.

342
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,660
You should not do that, Passenger!

343
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,350
Get out of the way! You, really!

344
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,400
Why are you so strong?

345
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,020
Why are you being like this?

346
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
You're not going to let me go?

347
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,480
Will you please stop.

348
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,420
You're not going to let me go?

349
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,970
Aren't you going to let go?

350
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,960
It hurts.

351
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,350
Really... I said it hurts!

352
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,010
- What's wrong?
- I caught her removing the yellow tag from her bag.

353
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,060
The lady customer's bags are there. The tags are in the toilet.

354
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,350
Then, see you.

355
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,930
But still, did you have to push someone on the bathroom floor?

356
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,510
You! This is a violation of civil rights!

357
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,230
You bad woman!

358
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,900
It hurts.

359
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,430
Lee Soo Yeon? What are you doing here?

360
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,550
By any chance, did you come together with Team Leader Yang to T2?

361
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,130
Yes. As of today.

362
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,100
Nice to meet you. I also moved to T2 as of today.

363
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,170
Didn't I tell you?

364
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,990
The skilled Passenger Service employee who caught the middle school bomb threat kid the other day.

365
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,450
Hello. I'm Deputy Oh from the Security Team.

366
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,150
I'm Lee Soo Yeon.

367
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,130
Let's see each other often, Lee Soo Yeon.

368
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,930
I was coming from touching a cart so my hands are dirty.

369
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,140
We're men. So what?

370
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,590
I have to go. Bye.

371
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,150
I think he's keeping an interesting secret inside.

372
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,570
Keep an eye on him.

373
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,930
Team Leader, I have something to tell you.

374
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,760
What is it?

375
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,530
I ran into the Security Team Leader on the way here. He transferred to T2 as well.

376
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,070
I just found out that he moved to T2 not long ago, too.

377
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,580
I'm sorry, Team Leader, but in this situation, I....

378
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,830
Even normal people often face obstacles they can't avoid.

379
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:53,670
Whether they fight and push through them, or go the long way around, everyone has to confront them.

380
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,870
In my case, you know that the situation would be different.

381
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,470
How long are you going to avoid things, just because you're different?

382
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,470
Do not make a decision right now. Let's take some time.

383
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,970
I'll take care of the situation with Team Leader Choi, okay?

384
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,590
Team Leader Yang Seo Goon! Team Leader Yang Seo Goon!
