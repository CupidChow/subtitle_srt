1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,780
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,260
What did I say before?

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,570
I told you to refrain from coming to the airport.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,140
There are more people watching than you think.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,480
Don't call me out on a whim. Don't come to visit.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,270
Then how can I see you in the future?

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,060
It would be better if we didn't meet from now on.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,290
You're getting quite rude in your manner of speech.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,440
The Chairman and Director are finally meeting today.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,720
It took me ten years to get things to this point.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,850
Wouldn't it be troublesome for you if a done deal was ruined at this point?

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,140
Lee Soo Yeon is your brother, isn't he?

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,480
Isn't that why you're shielding him?

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,210
Give this to the chairman. He'll need it for the meeting with the General Manager.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,100
How did he become so normal?

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,490
Were artificial bones implanted?

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:10,190
It would be better if you stopped making unnecessary issues right before an important deal.

18
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,010
Episode 26

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,010
What happened?

20
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,730
How is it that you're with those people?

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,190
It's none of your concern.

22
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,980
You definitely ran away back then.

23
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,690
You even abandoned me and ran away before. So why are you with those scum again now?

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,350
Why?

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,940
Aren't you going to tell me?

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,950
If I don't, will you break my arm?

27
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,450
Don't tell me. Were those people the bastards who were involved in the "big picture" then?

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,280
I thought you were at least a bit sorry for what you did to me.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,090
I thought you were mean to me and I got under your skin because you felt sorry for what you did.

30
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,630
But ...

31
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,660
if it's because of them,

32
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,050
because of those jerks who broke and ruined me ...

33
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,950
Is that why you were pushing me away again?

34
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,020
Is that it?

35
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,850
I clearly warned you.

36
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,930
Quietly get out of my sight.

37
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,910
Don't regret anything that is going to happen now.

38
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,840
It's all up to you.

39
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,050
Could you leave now?

40
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,410
Sorry, it's my boss's order, so I can't leave.

41
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,530
Seriously.

42
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,860
Just go! I want to be alone!

43
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,430
Do you know what my nickname is?

44
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,130
The time-bomb of time-bombs of Incheon Airport.

45
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,960
Your father gave me that nickname. Isn't that mean?

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,380
So what do you want me to do about that?

47
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,210
I was just doing my best. But in someone else's eyes, I look like a time-bomb.

48
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:25,650
And someone simply likes an idol and follows them around. But to someone else that's being a troublemaker.

49
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,860
And someone looks like an arrogant jerk.

50
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,380
But then you find out, that person has a lot of pain in their life.

51
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,820
I'm sure that's how it was with your father.

52
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,130
Just saying to have a drink might appear to be an abuse of power to someone.

53
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,020
He probably couldn't have imagined that.

54
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,370
If he did, he never would have done it.

55
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,880
In his personnel assessments, he is sensitive and doesn't spare himself.

56
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,840
Are you badmouthing my dad? That he's an hypersensitive geezer?

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,730
Is that what it sounded like? I didn't mean it that way.

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,540
Are you going to tell your dad I said that?

59
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,890
What's with you?

60
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,570
Eat lunch before you go.

61
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,570
Aren't you coming?

62
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,470
Enjoy your lunch, sir.

63
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,650
Oh, how is your injury?

64
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,810
It's good. It's healing.

65
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,840
That's good.

66
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,360
Na Yeong Joo, Oh Dae Gi, are you going out to patrol?

67
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,620
Yes, it's still work hours.

68
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,500
Who is this?

69
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,480
This is my family. My grandparents and parents.

70
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,740
I see.

71
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,510
Hello, I'm Han Yeo Reum of Passenger Services.

72
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,680
She even introduces herself so politely.

73
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,760
Are you colleagues with our Dae Gi?

74
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,010
Yes, I am.

75
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,370
We aren't in the same department. But I impose on him quite a bit.

76
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,800
I see.

77
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,530
Our Dae Gi grew up only around boys,

78
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,950
so he appears brusque on the exterior.

79
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,950
But he's very deeply affectionate on the inside.

80
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,950
I see.

81
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,000
- Grandfather, you should go now.
- About marriage...

82
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,160
How old are you? What's your Chinese zodiac?

83
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,970
Grandfather, you shouldn't be like this here.

84
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,620
She's such a nice young lady though.

85
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,770
She seems to be about your age as well.

86
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,030
She has a boyfriend.

87
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,670
I'm just informing you that Han Yeo Reum currently has a boyfriend.

88
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,600
And of course, that isn't sunbae Oh Dae Gi.

89
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,980
Is that so? You do?

90
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,590
Yes, I am dating someone.

91
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,430
Oh dear, that won't do.

92
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,970
You should have said so sooner.

93
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,330
Grandfather, the elevator is here. You should get on.

94
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,020
Alright, alright.

95
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,300
Go safely.

96
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,790
Grandmother, take care!

97
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,080
For Dae Gi's mate...

98
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,550
Have a safe trip back!

99
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,350
Go work.

100
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,890
Go safely!

101
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,750
Go...

102
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,990
Thank you, Na Yeong Joo.

103
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,130
Don't mention it.

104
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,250
I'm sorry, Han Yeo Reum.

105
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,050
Don't mention it.

106
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,710
Then ...

107
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,330
I'm sorry. I forgot you were on your way to be off duty.

108
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,130
Your family must have liked Han Yeo Reum.

109
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,780
Han Yeo Reum gives off a good impression.

110
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,100
She's the type that elders like.

111
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,870
I see. That's the type they like.

112
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,190
But not me.

113
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,490
I like a different type.

114
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,690
Not a puppy-type like Han Yeo Reum. More like a cat-type.

115
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,120
Just saying, in case you got the wrong idea.

116
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,540
I didn't, though.

117
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,240
You didn't? Alright, then.

118
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,700
Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

119
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,930
You're here? How about Section Chief Gong's daughter?

120
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,580
They reconciled and went to lunch together.

121
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,670
That's good.

122
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,820
I almost got paired up with Oh Dae Gi on the way here.

123
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,120
Oh Dae Gi's family was here, including his grandparents and everyone.

124
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,300
And they asked if I'm married, how old I am, and what about Dae Gi.

125
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,990
- And then?
- Na Yeong Joo rescued me.

126
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,540
She said I was dating someone and nipped it in the bud.

127
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,670
I seriously want to be reborn as someone like Na Yeong Joo next time.

128
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,290
How great would it be to say what you want without caring what people think?

129
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,020
You told Na Yeong Joo about us?

130
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,620
Yes. Well, it just happened somehow.

131
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,110
You didn't want rumors to get out though.

132
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,490
Will you be alright?

133
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,060
That was when I didn't know how I felt.

134
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,610
What about now?

135
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,810
Should we go somewhere else?

136
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,900
What are you doing?

137
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,140
I've always wanted to do this when I found a guy I liked. Against a wall.

138
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,080
What do you think? Does this make you nervous?

139
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,370
So, what comes next?

140
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,900
What? Next?

141
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,480
What comes next after pushing someone against a wall?

142
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,380
To be more precise?

143
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,250
Umm,

144
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,620
something like this?

145
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,930
Oh! This is a workplace. Calm down, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

146
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,070
Who's the one who started this? Who was it?

147
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,940
I'm sorry about yesterday.

148
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,020
I shouldn't have run out like that.

149
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,920
I didn't know what to say.

150
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,060
Were you that scared of me?

151
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,220
You just felt unfamiliar.

152
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,570
Were you really the guy I knew?

153
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,620
The person who always looked perfect and did everything well,

154
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,080
You must have been shocked to see that sight of me.

155
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,010
Right?

156
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,100
Yes.

157
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,850
Are you hurt with me speaking this way?

158
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,540
It's better than you were at first.

159
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,270
Earlier, you were so awkward and strange.

160
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,660
I was trying to be natural.

161
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,990
I love you.

162
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,830
I thought about it all night.

163
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,840
But no matter how hard I thought, you said all the cool things already.

164
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,290
So, I'm saying this first.

165
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,240
I love you, Lee Soo Yeon.

166
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,490
♫  This is what my heart says. ♫

167
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,790
I said that I love you.

168
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,190
♫ I hate myself for not being confident♫

169
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,900
I love you.

170
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm disabled.

171
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,590
Although you know that already.

172
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,390
♫ I might miss you, I'm afraid.♫

173
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,190
If you knew it, I'm also disabled.

174
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,460
Although you may not remember.

175
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,190
I'm a troublemaker, lack a sense of identity,

176
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,560
full of self-victimization, low self-esteem, self-pity, animosity against the world, lame excuses and futile efforts.

177
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,060
Having no ability of substance,

178
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,840
relational anxiety syndrome and even a chronic inferiority complex.

179
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,990
I have so many disabilities inside of me.

180
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,890
With me being like that, am I still acceptable

181
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,310
to you?

182
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,920
♬  When you and I are face to face like this, ♫

183
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,610
♬ It seems everything else stops.  ♫

184
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,340
If I'm acceptable to you, too.

185
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,560
♬ No one has to make an effort.  ♫

186
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,720
♫ When you feel that, it's enough. ♫

187
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:43,530
♫ If I just see you, while I am just next to you ♫

188
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:49,930
♫ Somehow I keep yearning for you ♫

189
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,230
♫ Even though I can't count ♫

190
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:00,270
♫  the time I will endure alone♫

191
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:05,160
♫ As it is I will stay more with you ♫

192
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,290
I need to know how dangerous that "wearable" is to people.

193
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,460
Before that, may I tell you just how dangerous that wearable is to Soo Yeon?

194
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,920
Should I tell you that first?

195
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,020
- What are you saying?
- That one month that Soo Yeon asked you turn a blind eye toward ...

196
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,530
It might be difficult for him to get past that.

197
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,470
CBC Blood Test EDTA (Test for Kidney function), WBC, ESR, CPR are High

198
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,890
Blood Electrolyte Results

199
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,940
Creatinine High ~ Acute Infection

200
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,920
Yes, Master.

201
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,960
Did you go to work today?

202
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,200
Doctor Yoon had asked for a blood test when you were injured.

203
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,500
But, the blood electrolyte levels have come out too high.

204
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,400
Doctor Yoon would like a more thorough exam. Soo Yeon ...

205
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm okay. Nothing feels wrong with me.

206
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,730
This isn't a time to be stubborn!

207
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,730
Things might become more serious.

208
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm sorry, I'm working now.

209
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,400
I'll see you at the restaurant later. I have to hang up.

210
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,320
What is all this?

211
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,660
Oh, they're birthday presents we prepared.

212
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,950
Really? What is it?

213
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,390
Wow,

214
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,360
Oh, hand cream.

215
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,220
Wow, the presents are all practical, huh?

216
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,120
What is this?

217
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,730
Who did this? Do you really not know my taste?

218
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,170
Who has no sense to buy these?

219
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,930
It's for fun. In return, we're treating you to dinner.

220
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,540
Pick your favorite thing out of all of those.

221
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,070
We decided that person doesn't have to pay.

222
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,010
So, pick one.

223
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,310
Oh, what should I choose? This is difficult.

224
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,840
Sunbae, I need to stop at the restroom.

225
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,760
Okay.

226
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,270
Why? Why are you so happy?

227
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,920
That's my present. I told you he'd pick mine.

228
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,160
Yes! Let's go eat!

229
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,270
Let's go, let's go.

230
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm sorry that I didn't have the sense to know your preference.

231
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,290
If you don't like the socks, you can exchange them.

232
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,760
They said they could be returned.

233
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,730
The socks?

234
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,390
Please wrap them.

235
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,400
Oh, Na Yeong Joo? You're buying his gift, too?

236
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,260
Yes, we were told to each prepare something.

237
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,060
Those socks are cute. This is mine.

238
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,160
Please wrap it.

239
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,370
Who did this? You don't know my taste? Who has no sense to buy these?

240
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,880
...no sense to buy these?

241
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,710
How did it go?

242
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,950
Well, I went to the audit team and told them everything.

243
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,140
And I turned in the receipts for the meal I bought.

244
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,470
Good work. Everyone can leave for the day.

245
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm sure you feel crummy. Would you like a drink?

246
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,160
Are you teasing me?

247
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,470
- Are you joking?
- That's not it at all.

248
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,700
I thought we'd go out for a team dinner and it wouldn't feel right without you.

249
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,100
So, you people...

250
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,960
What are you doing? You said a team dinner.

251
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,140
Aren't you getting up?

252
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,100
We are.

253
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,480
- What about Han Yeo Reum?
- I'm coming, too.

254
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,430
Always awkward.

255
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,300
Kids these days are awkward at comforting others.

256
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:20,370
I'll teach you how it's done. It's the Passenger Service Team! So just try to fire me!

257
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,970
Follow me!

258
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,200
Follow me!

259
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,640
The chairman sent a car. You can take this.

260
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,160
What about your car?

261
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,050
Yes, it's over there.

262
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,200
Let's take that.

263
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,240
I told you to stop doing unnecessary things.

264
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,650
What's with that guy? Why is his vibe so weird?

265
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,450
Is it right for me to meet with that person?

266
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,200
I'll start going now.

267
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,720
Sunbae Choi.

268
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,290
Deputy Director Lee. What are you doing here?

269
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,470
I'm here to see you. It's been a long time.

270
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,620
Welcome.

271
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,780
Cheers!

272
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,930
Han Yeo Reum. Let's race.

273
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,720
Yes, So Hui's father.

274
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,670
So Huis' dad is on his way.

275
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,860
Bottoms up!

276
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,690
The blood electrolyte levels have come out too high.

277
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,680
Doctor Yoon would like a more thorough exam.

278
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,600
Is it just a mechanical defect, or is there a problem with the chip inside your body?

279
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,240
Until you know the cause, you shouldn't wear it.

280
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,670
If you uselessly over-exert yourself, there might be muscle necrosis.

281
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,210
That would be a real headache, you know.

282
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,540
I wish Christmas would get here quickly.

283
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,990
It will be so busy then.

284
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,980
What should we do for Christmas?

285
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,280
Can't you just give me one month?

286
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,100
I'm not sure. What should we do?

287
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,330
Should we go on a trip?

288
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,940
Actually, I've never been on a plane before.

289
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,510
What do you think about me since I work at an airport but have never been on a plane?

290
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,610
I think it is so like you.

291
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,930
That answer is so like you.

292
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,320
But ... do you not feel well?

293
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,540
No. I'm fine. Why?

294
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,430
You look a little tired.

295
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,450
I haven't partied like this before, I guess.

296
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,600
This won't do.

297
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,730
You should go in and rest.

298
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:39,980
♫ It's crumpled.  ♫

299
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,220
Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow.
♫ Pull out my heart from that deep place.  ♫

300

303
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,930

♬ If you smile, it will lift my spirits again. ♬

305
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,440
♬ I'm afraid you will see and read. ♬

306
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,790
♬ Deeper and Deeper.

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:21,060

308

309
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:38,880

312
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,420
Hello.

313
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,200
Who are you?

314
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,310
I'm Mr. Jang.

315
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,460
I've been the person who has been assisting Lee Soo Yeon.

316
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,400
Sunbae, the fog is gradually worsening..

317
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,870
What happened? Was there fog in the forecast?

318
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,320
It was for tomorrow morning.

319
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,660
This is the west port control tower.

320
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,050
Thank you.

321
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,690
But ... what brings you here?

322
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,020
Actually, I'm here because of Soo Yeon.

323
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,250
I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Han Yeo Reum.

324
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,340
We have to establish a low visibility level 2.

325
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,050
We will issue a low visibility level 2 warning.

326
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,730
In one moment, just like that,

327
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:50,980
a situation was unfolding, where we couldn't see in front of us.

328
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,830
♬ Because I know you,

329
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:10,720
♬ The yearning I feel makes my heart beat  ♬

330
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,380
♬  Because I met you,  ♬

331
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,790
♬ I don't have the tears which were increasing anymore  ♬

332
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:25,050
♬  I feel happy ♬

333
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,500
