1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,420
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,500
I think you have to vacate the place.

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,840
Pardon?

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,190
I still have three days before the moving date. If you tell me to suddenly move out—

5
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,720
The person who signed the contract is moving in tomorrow.

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,520
Should I lose a tenant? Move out.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,620
I'll be trusting that you will be moving out.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,090
Thank you.

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,890
Miss, where are you traveling to?

10
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,040
I'm not going to travel. I'm going to work. I work at the airport.

11
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,940
Where? Asian Air? Korea Air?

12
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,990
That is an airline employee. I am an airport employee.

13
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,260
Aren't these two the same?

14
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,810
Airline employees' work is related to the air travel while airport employees work for safety and airport maintenance.

15
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,560
Those are different companies and the bosses are different too.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,450
But still, you still get discounts when you fly.

17
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,500
Would it be about 20-30%?

18
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,880
None at all. Not even a 1% discount.

19
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,970
Aigoo... even if you're an airport employee

20
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,850
it's not that special. I thought...

21
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,260
Aigoo...

22
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,330
Yes.

23
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,660
So? You will be staying there?

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,600
Yes. I want to stay a little longer at T2.

25
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,610
What's the reason?

26
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,430
The reason why you want to stay there longer.

27
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,650
Honestly, I didn't want to create a reason.

28
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,460
From now on, he will undergo a few more surgeries.

29
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,700
But for now, we could see it as the right arm and leg having no hope.

30
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,790
A reason to live too...

31
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,910
A reason to persevere and hold it in. I didn't want to create any reasons.

32
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,400
Whoever it is, whatever it may be.

33
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,310
I decided not to create any reason that would hold my heart.

34
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,750
That's what I thought...

35
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,480
♫ Hey, hey, hey. I started thinking about you.  ♫

36
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,730
Is it a woman?

37
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,280
♫ You met me and passed by. ♫

38
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,160
♫ I don't think everything was a coincidence ♫

39
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,850
♫ Will I just be alone? ♫

40
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,530
♫ Will I just be alone? ♫

41
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,830
♫ Perhaps you might be listening to my story ♫

42
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,550
♫ Even though it might be rude I keep on looking at you ♫

43
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,930
♫ I don't think it's a coincidence for even a moment ♫

44
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,230
♫ You appear again and again and again ♫

45
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,690
♫ Both on a day when I felt stifling pain and when I'm overwhelmed. ♫

46
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,420
♫ Then everyday like today you were with me ♫

47
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,540
♫ You to whom I have always everyday felt for ♫

48
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes.

49
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,820
It's a woman.

50
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,130
♫ To you. ♫

51
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,200
♫ Hey, hey, hey. I started thinking of you.  ♫

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,500
♫ Hey hey, hey, you met me as though it were coincidence. ♫

53
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,450
♫ I think everything which happens is a coincidence. ♫

54
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,700
♫ Both my feeling and yours, everything. ♫

55
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,360
Foreign Passport

56
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,150
Thank you.

57
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,570
Give me your passport.

58
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,100
Please wait a second.

59
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,600
Sorry, but you cannot enter with this passport.

60
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,490
Ma'am, please let me go in.

61
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,150
I am about to have my baby. I want to be with my wife. Please.

62
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,930
Can you please come this way?

63
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,370
Ma'am, please. I need to see my wife.

64
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,050
Please.

65
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,930
What? You can't accept it?

66
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,090
No. As you can see, it's already full so we can't accept it.

67
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Can you please do something about it?

68
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,030
Actually ... I'm an employee here.

69
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,590
I can't.

70
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,000
What do I do?

71
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,700
Good morning.

72
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,490
Good morning.

73
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,000
Team Leader Yang Seo Goon.

74
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,090
What is this?

75
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,530
That's the letter we sent requesting cooperation.

76
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,820
If the content is such then it is not cooperation but a threat.

77
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,860
You're pointing out

78
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,890
all the way to the stanchion storage there.

79
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,580
Putting stanchions in the aisles is clearly a rule violation, Team Leader Heo.

80
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,410
There are so many passengers in the store, it's getting crammed. Can't you hold off there for a while?

81
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,080
No, I can't.

82
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,170
The peak season is right now! Let the stores survive!

83
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,700
- Don't you know that passenger safety comes first?
- Who said I don't know?

84
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,320
It's been a while and I didn't know things, so I am asking you to let it slide.

85
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,890
And so what if a safety accident occurs? What if someone gets hurt?

86
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,450
So will you handle it when a reprimand is issued? Will you accept total responsibility by yourself then?

87
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,190
So frustrating. Will you really be so inflexible?

88
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,990
I'm just sticking to the rules, so what is this talk about inflexibility?

89
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,700
So? Are you going to stick to the rules until the end?

90
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,160
Up until tomorrow, I'm warning you that I will start to enforce it tomorrow.

91
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,890
I ask that every store cooperates, Team Leader Heo Yeong Ran.

92
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,490
Good morning!

93
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Lee Soo Yeon. There's a problem again with the water dispenser in the waiting room.

94
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,300
Today, would you personally go with Facilities Maintenance staff to check the status?

95
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,360
- You mean me?
- Aren't you the one in charge of the water dispenser for the time being?

96
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,730
Ah ... yes.

97
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,990
By the way, what's wrong with Team Leader Heo?

98
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,200
She should manage her team properly. Why is she doing these things in another team?

99
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,660
What happened to the order yesterday?

100
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,530
Ahhh... that, Han Yeo Reum--

101
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,950
Please check once again that the order is placed properly.

102
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,090
So? What are you doing now?

103
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,960
What do you mean? I'm dragging my luggage everywhere.

104
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,370
Don't do that. Do you want to go to my house?

105
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,610
You live with your parents.

106
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,530
My parents are extremely cool.

107
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,150
If I explain that your move date was moved three days earlier, then they won't say anything.

108
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,500
No, thanks. I'll take care of it.

109
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
Oh right. It's today, right?

110
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,630
Yeah. It's arriving today.

111
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,060
Estimated to arrive in 19 hours and 30 minutes.

112
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,590
Wait until then. I will do a special live broadcast.

113
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,680
You don't have to go that far. Making me so thankful.

114
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
Make sure to eat lunch.

115
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,840
Yeah, let's talk again later.

116
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,090
Are you dating?

117
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,880
- Who?
- You.

118
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,760
No, I'm not. It's a friend.

119
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,610
The voice from that call was dripping with honey.

120
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,450
Who?

121
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,540
You, Go Eun Seob.

122
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,530
Assistant Si, should I get you something to drink or maybe a snack?

123
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,400
- You heard about the passenger who was drunk and caused a ruckus last night?
- Yes, I heard about it.

124
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,610
Instructions were issued for strict handling of disorderly passengers.

125
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,360
They are to be dealt with firmly and quickly so that other passengers are not harmed.

126
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,170
Yes, I understand.

127
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,050
It seemed like you drank a lot yesterday. Are you feeling alright?

128
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,840
Beer has no effect. It's like water to me.

129
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,050
I didn't know you were like that.

130
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,910
From now on, when we have company dinners, you could be my black rose.

131
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,450
I'm sorry, but I'm only a black rose to my boyfriend.

132
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,960
You had a boyfriend?

133
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,780
Why? Can't I have one?

134
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,500
No. I thought you only worked hard.

135
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,060
- What does that mean? Women who work hard don't have boyfriends?

136
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,420
Then what about those that do their jobs haphazardly? Do they do that because they don't have a boyfriend?

137
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,030
Where did you get such a stereotypical and outlandish thought?

138
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,530
No, I didn't mean anything like that.

139
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,090
I understood it that way, Sunbae.

140
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm sorry. I worded it wrongly.

141
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,630
Thank you for the fast acknowledgement.

142
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,360
Oh, right.

143
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,950
- But then ...
- What?

144
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,490
It looks like the pregnant woman at 10 o'clock does not look well. What should we do?

145
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,590
Han Yeo Reum isn't in yet?

146
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,420
So she's outright being late for 20 minutes now.

147
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,850
If we moved to T2, she should think of doing well with a new mind and attitude.

148
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,000
I seriously have no luck.

149
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,670
I really had no idea I would be blessed with such an ill-fated subordinate.

150
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,090
What are you doing there again?

151
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,820
Ah... that, my shoelace has come untied...

152
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,580
Seriously, you're doing all sorts of things.

153
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,340
Then.

154
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,530
I went around the field.

155
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,860
Field?

156
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,000
I came an hour ago and went for one round already.

157
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,590
One hour ago? Really?

158
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,780
Yes. I have moved to T2 so I should work with a new mind and attitude.

159
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,610
-- That ...
- By the way, before I clocked out last night, I put in an order for stanchions.

160
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,990
I received confirmation that it will arrive within the weekend at the latest. I will confirm once again this morning.

161
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,740
Oh. Okay then.

162
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,660
Yes, then.

163
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,850
You came an hour ago?

164
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,590
Didn't you ride the same bus as I did?

165
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,450
Oh my! I guess you did see me in the bus.

166
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,800
You were sleeping so loudly. I didn't want to and I could't watch it.

167
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,840
Perhaps, did I snore too?

168
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,960
What's with all the luggage earlier?

169
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,330
I'm moving.

170
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,280
Originally I was supposed to move house in three days. My lease for the house I lived in is still in effect until today.

171
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,550
You also saw my luggage? When?

172
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,530
Drink. You must have had a hard time roaming around the field that you didn't roam.

173
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,050
Seriously.

174
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,420
Don't be like that over a white lie that I said to survive.

175
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,540
Aren't you going to drink?

176
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,130
Isn't it hot?

177
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,370
Seriously, even if you can't feel pain, don't hold something so hot.

178
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,030
Let's see.

179
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,210
Look, I knew it.

180
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,540
Because it was hot, that's why your skin is now red.

181
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,610
Even if you don't feel the pain, it doesn't mean it's not painful.

182
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,200
It's only your head that doesn't feel the pain, but it's actually painful.

183
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,670
What to do?

184
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,450
♫ Hey, hey, hey. You met me and passed by. ♫

185
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,930
- Are you someone who grabs someone else's hands suddenly?
- Huh?

186
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,270
♫ Will I just be alone? ♫

187
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,010
♫ Will I just be alone? ♫

188
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:47,310
If you are offended, I'm sorry. Then...

189
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,670
- Then.
- A little bit.

190
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:59,310
- Pardon?
- You snored a bit.

191
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,980
Then I will be going to the airside. The water dispenser is not working.

192
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,550
So embarrassing.

193
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,380
♫ You to whom I have always everyday felt for ♫

194
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,370
♫ To you, to you, to you. ♫

195
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:30,720
It's the information desk from the 1st floor. Near B gate, there is a pregnant lady who is having difficulty breathing.

196
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,580
Yes, I understand. I will be going.

197
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,710
♫ Both my feeling and yours, everything ♫

198
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,030
It's been a while, Soo Yeon.

199
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,950
Hyung!

200
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,060
Hyung! Hyung!

201
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,810
What happened?

202
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,600
She's from the Philippines. It seems like her contractions started suddenly and she should be moved to the medical center.

203
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,860
I can't go! I need to meet my husband. My husband's plane has arrived.

204
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,020
But then he hasn't come out.

205
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,040
Sunbae.

206
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,770
This won't do. We need to take you to the medical center.

207
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,590
No. No. No. I can't.

208
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,860
I need to meet my husband.

209
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,970
I need to meet him. I need to meet him. No.

210
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,800
What's your husband's name?

211
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,060
I will go inside and look for him. So you should go to the hospital first.

212
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,000
If something goes wrong, the baby could be in danger.

213
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,750
Has it been twelve years?

214
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,180
You seemed so healthy, so I didn't recognize you.

215
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,980
You should have continued to not recognize me or at least pretended not to.

216
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,020
It would have been easier.

217
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,400
How could I, when you have changed so much?

218
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,040
Anyway, nice to see you.

219
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,000
Too bad. I don't feel the same way.

220
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Even then, I can't do anything about that.

221
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,690
But will you explain? How you got here?

222
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,290
You should ask properly.

223
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:34,350
"How did you become so normal?" That's what you really want to ask.

224
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,050
Kid.

225
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,130
Why did you come again?

226
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,670
Aren't you in high school?

227
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,610
A high school student should be studying. Why are you following me?

228
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,220
Hurry and go home. Or go to an academy.

229
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,620
Have you eaten?

230
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,470
You... do you get allowance from your mother?

231
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,100
Payment for the noodles.

232
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,330
Yes, thank you.

233
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,780
Honestly, you're happy that I came to find you, right?

234
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,940
Too bad. I don't feel the same.

235
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,760
Even then, it can't be helped.

236
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,520
For the brothers, one for each on the house.

237
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,920
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

238
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,940
Yes, go ahead.

239
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,250
I sent a photo to your cell phone.

240
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,870
This... who is this?

241
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,990
Ian Santos

242
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,100
His wife was waiting out here when her contractions suddenly started.

243
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,530
She was moved to the medical center and she keeps looking for her husband.

244
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,960
Can you please call me once you find him?

245
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,480
Yes. I understand.

246
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,660
Secondary Inspection Division 2

247
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,550
Sir, I am about to have a baby.

248
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,430
Please let me see my baby.

249
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,650
He has a record of illegal residency.

250
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,740
That's why he came with a counterfeit passport.

251
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,650
And his wife is still in Korea. What should we do?

252
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,480
You said it's a counterfeit passport. That's illegal.

253
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,060
Should we send him back like this?

254
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,090
Of course we should send him back. Then do we let him in?

255
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,290
Sir! I want to see my baby. Please.

256
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,220
Just let me see my baby and I'll go. Please.

257
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,490
Just to see my baby please.

258
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,480
Please.

259
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,690
What about the guardian? Still no contact?

260
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,160
The Passenger Service Team is looking for him right now.

261
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,560
The baby is about to come out.

262
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,070
Pardon?

263
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,330
Hasn't Han Yeo Reum called yet?

264
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,390
Not yet.

265
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,800
Departure waiting area.

266
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,560
I found the source of the leak. We just need to replace the part.

267
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,220
How long will it take to fix it?

268
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,480
About 10 minutes will do.

269
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,810
Mister Ian Santos?

270
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,560
It's boarding time now. Come up please.

271
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,510
Can I go to the bathroom?

272
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,340
Sure. Go outside and turn left.

273
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,590
Ian Santos

274
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,930
I saw him.

275
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,930
- You found him?
- Yes

276
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,710
But I think it will be hard for him to meet his family.

277
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,410
Why?

278
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,570
I think he wasn't granted entry.

279
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,970
Is that so?

280
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,080
Sunbae.

281
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,020
Did they find her husband?

282
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,460
They found him.

283
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,220
But then, he was not granted entry.

284
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,980
Ian?

285
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,900
Marie.

286
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,560
I'm sorry.

287
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,180
I can't see our child.

288
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,960
Is that person inside?

289
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,160
He's still inside the bathroom and has not come out.

290
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,820
Is there no way?

291
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,860
It's Immigration's decision. There's nothing that we can do.

292
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,300
This won't do. I will try to speak to them.

293
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,500
That is going beyond our duty, and it won't change anything.

294
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,560
The child is about to be born. How could I pretend not to know?

295
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,190
They're not even thousands or hundreds of kilometers away.

296
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,360
The child is being born not even a kilometer away.

297
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,330
Can't we just try? Uh?

298
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,960
Team Leader.

299
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,320
Yes, what's the matter?

300
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,500
But then?

301
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,030
I get it.

302
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,100
Lee Soo Yeon, continue with your duties.

303
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:56,300
Where Stars Land
