1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,700
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,770
Did you say priority?
Episode 4

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,540
Completing your daily assignment well and on time,

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,930
checking in advance to ensure passenger safety,

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,610
these are the priority duties of the Passenger Service agent.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,160
Wow...that's so cool!

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,050
You must be proud of yourself to be able to talk so cool.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,280
The schizophrenic patient swinging a stanchion was nothing to you,

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,170
a philanthropist at heart who pretends the opposite to show off his coolness.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,550
However, I'm not like you.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,900
I barely got hired with points for attending a provincial college and I must start with all the tasks that others consider beneath them.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,830
I have to do whatever I can to receive praise and recognition.

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,260
I have to flatter my superiors so that they can remember my name.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,350
Unless I put in extra hard work, I can't make it.

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,830
Why do you have to go that far?

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,800
If I don't do that, no one will acknowledge me.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,880
I'll be treated like a nobody and that'll be it.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,860
What's wrong with being a nobody?

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,780
Being treated as if you're insignificant

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,540
is something you're not familiar with, right?

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,690
People like you

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,660
will never understand deprived people like me.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,670
You don't have to work hard to get what you want.

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,190
Who are those people who get what they want without working hard for it?

25
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,520
You. You graduated from KAIST University with a perfect TOEIC score!

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,250
Because of that, you think you know everything about me?

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,410
Because of that, the world is an easier place for you.

28
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,650
You don't have to work hard for people to acknowledge and praise you.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,040
Life is easy for you with just enough challenges, right?

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,940
You are full of self-victimization, low self-esteem,

31
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,480
self-pity, animosity against the world,

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,830
lame excuses and futile efforts,

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,190
but excellent in misjudging people. Wow, hands up to you, Han Yeo Reum.

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,010
Are you done talking now?

35
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,020
Yes. I'm done. Anyway, our worlds are so different

36
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,980
that there is nothing more to be or should be said.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,100
It must be nice to live feeling so full of yourself and your identity.

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,580
You take care of the west side, I'll do the east.

39
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,250
Do you know that you are a complete buttinsky?

40
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,930
What? A buttinsky?

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,850
Yes! Full of yourself but without substance - a total butt-in-sky.

42
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,020
We completed airside in the morning and

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,930
at lunchtime, we cleaned up the additional unregistered fixtures up to the first-floor landing.

44
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,160
I'm on the third floor.

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,280
Whatever.

46
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,210
You think you're all that?

47
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,910
You know nothing about me. How dare you!

48
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,520
Not all that you say is worth saying.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Loud and scatterbrained.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,980
You have no passion nor humanity.

51
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,030
She's out of her element.

52
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,010
He's bad news. For sure!

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,540
Hello.

54
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,370
What should we do?

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,220
Why are you so stupid?

56
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,770
Do I look that sloppy?

57
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,240
Do you think I've hidden a bomb in that empty suitcase?

58
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,590
Yes, our staff is on the phone right now.

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,220
I'll give you a hint, so listen carefully.

60
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,690
The Air Narita plane that's departing in thirty minutes...

61
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,050
If you don't want to die, look for it carefully. This is your last chance.

62
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,100
What should we do? It appears to be a prank call.

63
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,740
Calling the EOD and delaying the flight...this is getting too big.

64
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,500
Let's go by the manual, okay?

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
Okay.

66
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,300
We are in Red 3.

67
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,070
I would like to apologize to the passengers who are boarding flight AB 012.

68
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,400
The boarding will be delayed due to unforeseen circumstance.

69
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,650
We apologize for the delay. Please wait for a moment.

70
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,480
Excuse me, I need to check your ID. Could you show me your passport?

71
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,070
Was it you? You made the bomb threat call?

72
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,570
- What are you saying?
- I'm sorry but I heard everything you said.

73
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,920
It was you, the blackmailer.

74
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,510
Just get lost quietly, Ahjussi.

75
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,210
If you touch me, I'll jump to my death.

76
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,530
If you don't want trouble, get out of my way, idiot!

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,940
But if you keep acting so obvious, the rumor will soon spread.

78
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,640
Just close your eyes and ignore it...

79
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,570
pretending you are indifferent and are ignorant.

80
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,610
Otherwise, you can't stay here long.

81
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,560
Let go. You aren't? I said let go!

82
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,140
What do you want to do, surrender or be dragged?

83
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,560
Surrender or be dragged?

84
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,470
What an ignorant bastard!

85
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,350
Do you want this idiot to drag you to the crowd and make a laughing stock out of you?

86
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,830
Do you want to have your head straightened out? Then, let's go for it.

87
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,770
Choi Jeong Woo of the airport police. Hello?

88
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,600
What, aren't you going to say anything?

89
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,390
Chief, the maker of the bomb threat just turned himself in.

90
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,630
Seung Hoon! Seung Hoon!

91
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,220
Seung Hoon! Seung Hoon!

92
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,710
You!

93
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,570
Seung Hoon! What's going on?

94
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,090
Sir, what's going on? Why is he here?

95
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,120
He made a prank call to the airport.

96
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,150
What? A prank call?

97
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,960
He called the airport twice with bomb threats.

98
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,400
What? Did you do that? Did you really do that?

99
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,280
Why you jerk! Who told you to make prank calls?

100
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,270
He confessed to everything.

101
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,350
We were able to confirm that his cell phone call out time matched the call received time at the Call Center.

102
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,600
We found the Voice Changer app on his cell phone.

103
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,890
You're driving me crazy! Why did you do that! Why!

104
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,940
I told you I didn't want to go on the trip!

105
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,670
Why not? You said you're the only one who never visited overseas!

106
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,090
That's why in spite of it all, we decided to send you to Japan. So why?

107
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,480
I know what you did to send me to Japan.

108
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,160
I don't want to go on a free trip transporting that stuff. It's annoying!

109
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,550
Oh my gosh...

110
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,900
You brat! Can't you be quiet? Where are you coming off?

111
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,160
Transport? What do you have to transport?

112
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,240
No ... what ... which ...

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,950
At approximately 10 a.m., in a trash can,

114
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,810
ten kilos of gold were found and turned over to Customs.

115
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,530
Customs? That was taken to the Cust—

116
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,140
Aren't the gold bars the items you were searching for when you were on the phone before?

117
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,130
May I see your passports?

118
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,140
I can't live, really!!!

119
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,470
Which department is it?

120
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,880
You're the guy who brought the kid, right?

121
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,660
I wondered what department you are in.

122
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,780
I am Lee Soo Yeon from the Passenger Service Team. Then ...

123
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,320
An interesting guy joined the staff.

124
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,380
Yes, sir. We are heading out right now.

125
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,790
Yes, I understand.

126
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,320
Sorry to have kept you waiting so long. Flight AB 012 will be boarding.

127
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,530
Yes ... Yes, I will.

128
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,550
What did he say?

129
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,660
You may board the plane.

130
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,870
Yes, thank you.

131
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,790
What is it? Are you just letting him go?

132
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,570
He's a Korean from Japan. His nationality is Japanese.

133
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,410
He doesn't have a criminal record for certain on our end and he's not wanted by Interpol.

134
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,530
As of now, we don't have enough evidence to prevent him from boarding.

135
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,370
But I saw it. The gold bars were definitely in the trash can.

136
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,110
It's not a crime to throw gold bars away in the trash.

137
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,070
Excuse me.

138
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,970
In the future, report something like this to Customs.

139
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,190
Even if we just spin our wheels for passenger safety,

140
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,870
we have more than enough to do.

141
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,760
Then...

142
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,890
C'mon, let's hurry. Doors close.

143
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,010
Apron, AB 012 requests pushback and engine start-up at Gate 46.

144
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,020
AB 012, Apron, pushback and engine start up. On pushback approach to face north.

145
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,180
Roger that.

146
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,470
So? The gold bars?

147
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,550
I think because it was confirmed they were a means of transport with the broker ...

148
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,870
Because they don't belong to the National Treasury ... They wanted them.

149
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,800
Oh, really!

150
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,680
Why did you interfere?

151
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,180
Why did you do something you weren't asked to do?

152
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,890
If you had just left it alone, after six months, you would have gotten a reward.

153
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,350
Why did you report that the broker threw it away?

154
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,150
A small part of ten kilos of gold. Jeez.

155
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,590
I am sorry.

156
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,890
Anyway, I'm going to make sure that you can't work here.

157
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,890
My gold, what should I do?

158
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,780
As for me, I believed I was doing the right thing.

159
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,560
That's how I lost my way again.

160
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,940
♫ Someday in your life ♫

161
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,580
- Remove this banner. I'll come again tomorrow morning to check.
- Yes, I will.

162
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,050
Please remove the unauthorized banner here. I'll check again tomorrow morning.

163
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,410
I'm coming.
♫ All people in here. ♫

164
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:33,750
♫ walking in different ways
You know everyone needs someone ♫

165
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,860
Han Yeo Reum.
♫ to lean on ♫

166
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,120
♫ So lay down just for one night ♫

167
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,350
♫ So I will never lose you in my eyes. Will I know. ♫

168
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,250
Han Yeo Reum.

169
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,170
♫ Or see the way of life? ♫

170
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,030
I'm in the middle of walking around the west wing right now.

171
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,950
You are just crossing two shops.

172
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,220
♫  I look at myself in the eyes ♫

173
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,770
♫ Sometimes when I see it, I’m lost in my own eyes ♫

174
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,410
Are you keeping me under surveillance?

175
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,260
I'm letting you know you have gone too far.

176
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,330
♬ Every time it feels like an ending for all  ♬

177
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,140
Earlier, I said a little too much.

178
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,810
♫ for a moment to smile ♫

179
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:28,160
I am sorry.
♫ Life is too short to cry ♫

180
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,670
♫ Life is too short to cry ♫

181
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,720
Are you all right?

182
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,650
- Are you okay?
- Mom!

183
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,330
Thank you. Yeon Ji, are you okay?
♫ Sunday you're lost in maze. ♫

184
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:50,080
♫ Monday you are out the way.
Will I ever gonna make it? ♫

185
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,280
♫ No one knows ♫

186
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,700
♬  Feels like I'm on the edge  ♬

187
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,380
♬ I don't know where to go  ♬

188
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,160
Hey there! Someone almost got hurt. Even if it is registered, it's dangerous.

189
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm confiscating it immediately.

190
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,790
Aigoo, Team Leader Choi!

191
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,370
Long time no see, Section Chief Gong.

192
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,600
I'll say. Why do you come so rarely?

193
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,990
I should come more often.

194
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,320
- The coffee smells good.
- Would you like a cup?

195
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,950
Let's see.

196
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,880
I will have to get it. Please wait a sec.

197
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,210
Thanks.

198
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,300
Busy?

199
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,040
It must be that your department is not.

200
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,870
- A Red 3 notice came out.
- It's cancelled.

201
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,630
It turned out an eighth grader made a prank call.

202
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,180
Thanks to that, a flight was delayed for an hour. His parents are liable for damages.

203
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,490
Anyway, adolescents are scary nowadays, aren't they?

204
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,750
What's your reason for coming?

205
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,940
Look at me while you are talking. There's a man in front of you.

206
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,230
What is it?

207
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,770
Have you seen Seo In Woo since he returned?

208
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,950
There's work to be done, would you leave? I'm busy, so head-splitting busy.

209
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,200
Did you have lunch?
(Speaking very intimately)

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,610
Farewell.

211
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,770
But the guy named Lee Soo Yeon ... He's an interesting guy.

212
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,850
Actually, he's the one who caught the middle schooler who made the prank call.

213
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,880
His ability is almost at the level of someone in the Special Forces.

214
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,050
But according to the records, he hasn't served in the military yet.

215
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,840
I got to see something unique which was interesting to see for whatever reason.

216
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,720
- That guy ...
- Just let it go.

217
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,430
Lee Soo Yeon does very good work in our department.

218
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,160
You're saying you know him.

219
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,860
It broke like this accidentally.

220
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,720
It wasn't me.

221
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,270
He was on the Passenger Service Team, a courteous, good-looking staff member.

222
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,880
A courteous good looking staff member on the Passenger Service Team? Ah, Lee Soo Yeon.

223
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,260
Yes. Lee Soo Yeon, it was him.

224
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,240
He sure is strong.

225
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,910
Excuse me ... did you say Lee Soo Yeon?

226
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:29,000
He was so strong, and agile. He bumped into it and it was smashed.

227
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,980
He lightly bumped it, and it all was smashed. Boom.

228
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,940
What is it? What's this guy's real identity?

229
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,280
Just ordinary ... a new employee who wants a salary-earner's life.

230
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,720
- Just ordinary? Does that make sense?
- Yes. It does.

231
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,480
So whatever you saw, erase it from your mind.

232
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,560
Whatever you were going to say, just shut up, don't say it. Not to anyone.

233
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,540
I beg of you.

234
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,540
Coffee is here.

235
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,480
I'll leave. We'll talk again later.

236
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,730
- Thanks. I'll enjoy it.
- Yes, bye.

237
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,160
Were you born with spectacular genes in your DNA?

238
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,900
How could you have an incident in every department? Even up to a gold smuggler now.

239
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,970
What are you looking at like that?

240
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,140
What's the matter? Did something else happen between you and him?

241
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,460
Anyhow, there's something strange.

242
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,590
- What else?
- There is ...

243
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,110
I don't know, but ...

244
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,010
just something strange keeps happening,

245
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,090
I'm curious.

246
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,090
The radish is very delicious today.

247
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,580
May I join you?

248
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,810
Was that good technique?

249
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,070
Earlier, I was in the situation room by accident and I saw it on the monitor.

250
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,550
You controlled the middle school student.

251
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,710
It's just that I've been working out a little...

252
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,360
Judo, Taekwondo, kick-boxing, Muay Thaï, etc.

253
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,030
Is that so?

254
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,410
Enjoy your meal then. I'll leave first.

255
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,130
You haven't eaten much... Already?

256
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,810
If you have leftovers like that, there are environmental problems ...

257
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,570
What would the Security Team Leader need to discuss with Lee Soo Yeon?

258
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,000
Excuse me,

259
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:32,400
Here...I bought this since you didn't get to eat in the cafeteria.

260
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm also apologizing.

261
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,190
I think I was harsh to you earlier, especially calling you "buttin-" ...

262
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,620
For that,

263
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,690
I apologize.

264
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,230
Oh, you opened up cup noodles.

265
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,730
Why don't you eat the sandwich I bought? I'll eat the cup noodles.

266
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,010
I was in the middle of eating, too.

267
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,710
Excuse me ...

268
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,480
I'll pour the water, so go ahead and eat.

269
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,410
I said it's fine. I can eat in three minutes, so go ahead and start, okay?

270
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,660
Oh, no! Oh, no, oh, no!

271
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,680
Oh, dear!

272
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,160
What can be done?

273
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,930
I'm fine.

274
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,210
It must hurt so much!

275
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,110
Oh, no! You probably have third-degree burns!

276
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,100
Should we go down to the emergency treatment center?

277
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,210
I'm fine, really.

278
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,640
How can you be fine? It was 100 degrees boiling water!

279
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
I can't feel pain.

280
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,620
See? The pain...

281
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,970
You can't feel any?

282
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,310
No.

283
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,660
I don't feel any pain.

284
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,760
You said you don't feel pain.

285
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,420
In my right arm. Just my right hand.

286
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,150
Oh, that's what you meant.

287
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

288
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,570
I feel so bad!

289
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,070
It's okay.

290
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,430
Oh, dear! What can be done?

291
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,780
It didn't matter anyway.

292
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,360
What do you mean? You have to quit?

293
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,380
I think too much was found out.

294
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,340
Aren't you leaving for the day?

295
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,460
Team Manager?

296
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,390
See you tomorrow.

297
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,820
I have a condition, Director.

298
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,330
I need to bring my team members with me.

299
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,150
I think I'm going to be home late.

300
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,370
There was another emergency situation.

301
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,690
This time, it was a bomb threat call.

302
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,170
Are the kids still in classes?

303
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,700
Okay, dear.

304
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,520
I know.

305
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,270
Okay, dear.

306
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,490
Yeah.

307
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,010
One go, yes!

308
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,270
Two go. Go, go, go!

309
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,340
I think the condition you gave me seems personal, and above your actual authority level.

310
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,010
You were the one that came to me to ask for the reorganization process, Director.

311
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,960
It wasn't a request, it was an order.

312
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,790
It can't be done? Then there's no choice.

313
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,730
I'll be taking a leave of absence for the time being.

314
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,190
Find someone else for the job.

315
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,150
See? I'm already rubbing you the wrong way.

316
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,110
That's not it.

317
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,120
Then I'll be waiting to hear from you by tomorrow.

318
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,580
That kid, seriously.

319
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,360
Aren't you coming out too strong?

320
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,850
Whether that's the case or not,

321
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,250
if he's going to use me, he should put up with that much at least.

322
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,660
Do you not have any time tonight either?

323
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,940
No, I can't.

324
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,920
Things are about to get interesting.

325
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,730
Mom, what happened?

326
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,420
You should have at least called to say you're not coming.

327
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,540
I'm sorry. There was an emergency with a manager here.

328
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,860
So, when are you coming then?

329
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,410
This time it's for sure, okay?

330
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,120
They're moving you to some place new?

331
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,780
Of course, that's good.

332
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,920
Don't worry. You know everyone loves me wherever I go.

333
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,020
But, Mom,

334
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:28,850
I met someone strange.

335
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,050
He said he can't feel any pain.

336
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:44,520
No matter how hard he is hit, or whether he has extremely hot water touch him,

337
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,920
he can't feel any pain at all.

338
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,730
♫ Always in my mind ♫

339
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,400
How did he become that way?

340
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,460
♫ the same memory which is a question mark ♫

341
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,660
♫ the day in front of me ♫

342
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,420
I'm here.

343
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,760
Come in. It's been a while.

344
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,350
I'm becoming more and more curious about him.

345
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,900
♫ Ooh my whole body feels throbbing ♫

346
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,590
What can be done?

347
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,860
♫ I couldn't emit a sound ♫

348
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,140
♫ I was muzzled and I looked only at you as though I would bore a hole ♫

349
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,540
Where Stars Land

350
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,060
Where Stars Land

351
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,620
♫ I talk and make endless gestures ♫

352
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,850
♫ The feeling of just you which is as familiar  ♫

353
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,980
♫ as the smell of the rain on a windy day ♫

354
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,020
♫ It must be you ♫

355
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,390
♫ It really must be you ♫

356
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,520
♫ Ooh, ooh ♫

357
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,550
♫ Somewhere in your heart ♫

358
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,380
Where Stars Land
