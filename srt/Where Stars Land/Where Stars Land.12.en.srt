00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,930
Episode 12
Lee Soo Yeon?

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,820
A while ago, I was coincidentally watching the monitor and saw him catch a bomb threat culprit in the transit area.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,460
I'm asking if you've seen anything similar to what I saw.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,680
Ah, it's a bit difficult. If Team leader Yang finds out about this, she'll be furious.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,890
It's the director's orders. If you think this is problematic,

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,370
then you are going to be put in a worse position.

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,180
Someone raised an issue about you during our meeting.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,060
That's why the director gave that order.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,140
Was it Seo In Woo that had an issue with me?

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,850
I think he seems to know something about your arm.

11
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,430
- Na Yeong Joo.
- Yes?

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,020
Na Yeong Joo.

13
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,450
Sunbaenim.

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,860
- What are you doing here?
- I was leaving for my shift.

15
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,600
Let's go.

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,610
Turn around, this way is blocked.

17
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,850
Ah yes.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,580
Huh? Manager Park?

19
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,250
Oh! Hi!

20
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,950
Manager Seo and Manager Kim are here, too.

21
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,650
Oh! How have you been? Glad to see you!

22
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,280
Hi!

23
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,670
Ms. Han! Nice to see you.

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,930
- Hurry take a look at her. You look great!
-You're really pretty, Ms. Han.

25
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,750
But why are you all here?

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,120
We're trying to make a living.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,820
Don't mind us. Go about your work.

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,240
- You understand?
- Yes.

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,920
Han Yeo Reum, do you know these people?

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,860
Ah, that is ... The chokehold three times, profanity seven times, the roundhouse kick twice,

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,040
were all with these gentlemen, Section Chief.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,750
- I see.
- Well then,

33
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,360
Han Yeo Reum must have been a bit strong when she was in the Traffic Department.

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,950
She is no joke!

35
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,010
She was quite popular amongst us.

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,270
Right?

37
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,710
The best.

38
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,920
- She's a legend.
- She's the best!

39
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,690
Team Leader.

40
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,720
Hello.

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,960
Did you meet your mother?

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,510
Yes! Thanks to you.

43
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,430
I appreciated the many things you did yesterday

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,310
Wasn't the two-month pay cut a bit heartless of me?

45
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,660
Do you still remember that?

46
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,030
Han Yeo Reum isn't a name that is easily forgotten.

47
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,410
Yes.

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,750
I'm sorry, but could you do me a favor?

49
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,090
On my desk, there's a file with an orange post-it note on it.

50
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,590
I would appreciate it if you could bring it to the section chief of Facilities, Kim Seong Ho.

51
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,230
Personnel Record Card

52
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,350
Disability Level 1
Wearing walking assist device

53
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,540
Level 1 of physical disability.

54
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,060
This guy...

55
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,190
What is this?

56
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,800
Wait, let's talk.

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,520
Just go straight that way.

58
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,630
About Lee Soo Yeon on the Passenger Service Team, Sunbaenim.

59
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,950
What?

60
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,430
What is he like? Do you know anything about him?

61
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,920
Not that I know.

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,520
- Why?
- I was just wondering.

63
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,780
Why are you curious? You have a boyfriend.

64
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,590
Why? Am I not allowed to be curious about other men if I have a boyfriend?

65
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,160
Of course not. That's two-timing.

66
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,080
What?

67
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,690
I'm not saying that's what you're doing.

68
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,000
If you're dating someone, shouldn't you not be curious about other men?

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,310
- You don't have a girlfriend, do you?
- What?

70
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,040
- When was the last time you dated?
- Univer ...

71
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,060
- You were dumped, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.

72
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,590
Are you not over her?

73
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,230
No, I've forgotten about her.

74
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,440
You're more sensitive than you look, Sunbaenim.

75
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,050
- I'm not, I'm not sensitive.
- It's okay. You'll meet someone nice.

76
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,690
What do you have to say to bring me all the way here?

77
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,320
What are you curious about?

78
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,940
What's the reason to have Security dig into my background?

79
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,040
You bother me.

80
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,100
So,

81
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,490
- I'm going to get rid of you.
- Get rid of?

82
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,230
I don't think you'll get out of my way if I don't get rid of you.

83
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,500
You've always been that way. You've always followed me around bugging me.

84
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,940
I warned you not to follow me, and yet you didn't listen and kept on chasing, chasing, chasing ...

85
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,140
and even got into an accident.

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,250
After having made me this way, have you no remorse or apology?

87
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,690
You followed after me,

88
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,230
and you got yourself in that accident.

89
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,630
And now,

90
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,360
you look more normal than anyone.

91
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,800
What remorse? Do you expect me to be sorry?

92
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,130
You!

93
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,470
You used to be my hyung.

94
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,400
It was only briefly, when father got remarried.

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,630
It meant nothing more than that.

96
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,660
Hyung! Hyung In Woo!

97
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,030
- Just go.
- What are you doing next week?

98
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,420
You don't need to know.

99
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,040
It's your birthday. Let's at least share a meal.

100
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,900
I don't need birthdays. Let's skip the unnecessary stuff.

101
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,230
Hyung!

102
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,450
I'm not your brother anymore. Although I've never been one before either.

103
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,190
- Are you really going to be like this?
- Yeah, I'm really going to be like this.

104
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,630
So don't ever come looking for me again. Understand?

105
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,620
I'm going.

106
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,070
Student.

107
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,130
Hey, Seo In Woo. Where have you been all this time?

108
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,230
If you run away like that, we will get upset.

109
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,370
I think you left this behind.

110
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,420
Thank you.

111
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,830
Hyung!

112
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,160
What are you men doing there?

113
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,970
Go!

114
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,320
Hyung! Hyung!

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,430
Hyung!

116
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,060
Hyung!

117
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,100
Hyung!

118
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,940
That kid is still following us.

119
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,750
Hyung! Hyung!

120
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,020
Hyung! Hyung!

121
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,890
That kid sure is tenacious.

122
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,390
Hyung!

123
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,780
Hyung! Hyung!

124
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,810
Soo Yeon!

125
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,410
What should we do about this?

126
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,270
Should I dump him somewhere?

127
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,660
Hyung.

128
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,770
Save me.

129
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,700
Hyung.

130
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,620
Hey, Seo In Woo! Get him!

131
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,650
Hey, jerk!

132
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,260
You bad jerk.

133
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,230
Hey, come on.

134
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,380
Look here, Team Leader Lee Yoo Taek.

135
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,670
I got word that the president will be here in an hour.

136
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,020
Are you going to leave these guys here like this?

137
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,800
They're fighting for their right to survive. What am I supposed to do?

138
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,840
Get up. Get up and leave!

139
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,850
This isn't your bedroom! Do you know that this is called "obstruction of business", huh?

140
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,370
Ahjussi, Jeez, if you say lying down is "obstruction of business"

141
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,720
then what do you say if we are uncomfortable here?

142
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,840
Why else would we be doing this?

143
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,670
It's hard and uncomfortable for us, too.

144
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,740
What? Are you really thugs?

145
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,100
What? Some kind of bastard?

146
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,900
You people! Doing this in someone's workplace,

147
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,740
this is thug behavior, that's all!

148
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,530
- Aish... Really.
- I can't believe he said that.

149
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,730
He's gone overboard. He's gone completely overboard.

150
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,420
Have you ever been beaten by someone younger than you?

151
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,780
What's wrong with you? Don't come closer. I used to serve at a forefront troop near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

152
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,150
It's called the front line.

153
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,450
Call the Security Team. Call them all! Hurry!

154
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,650
That's the seventh time.

155
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,420
You called me to eat and this is the seventh time you sighed.

156
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,300
Is that so? Sorry.

157
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,940
So? Did you talk to Lee Soo Yeon? Firmly?

158
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,310
I was going to. But...

159
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,130
you can't read a person just from their exterior.

160
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,780
What are you saying out of the blue?

161
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,060
That person, Lee Soo Yeon—

162
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,320
What about Lee Soo Yeon?

163
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,260
Nothing, let's eat.

164
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,140
There you go again. You wet towel.

165
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,570
I don't think I should say it. Please understand.

166
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,870
How about you? Are you still seeing that blind date girl from last week?

167
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,630
- We met twice and quit.
- You are too.

168
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,930
That's why you can't date. How can you know someone after just two dates?

169
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,020
You have to at least see someone through four seasons to know them.

170
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,540
In spite of experiencing the four seasons, I don't know,

171
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,950
Is there a woman that fits that?

172
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,270
There is. You, Han Yeo Reum.

173
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,700
I said it isn't funny.

174
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,010
That's always the problem. You never find me fun.

175
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,190
Just eat. It will get cold.

176
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,350
Yes, Section Chief.

177
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,340
Han Yeo Reum. Earlier you said you knew

178
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,310
those guys in black lying down, right?

179
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:12,760
You have to come to the office right away. The atmosphere is very bad here.

180
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,320
Hurry and come back. Hurry.

181
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,060
Please leave. This is an important place in managing airport work.

182
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,670
Our livelihood is also important.

183
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,450
I understand. But this method isn't proper.

184
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,190
Improper methods will bring about improper results. Please leave.

185
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,960
Are you threatening us?

186
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,600
- I'm earnestly requesting of you.
- You don't seem very earnest.

187
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,570
Don't you agree, guys?

188
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,270
- Yes!
- Thank you.

189
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,740
What are you doing? I told you to kick these guys out of the office. Right now.

190
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,780
Please leave now. Please leave.

191
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,570
Go! Go!

192
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,130
Agh, but these people are knocking over people who are peacefully protesting?

193
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,830
Hey, let's attack.

194
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,710
Hey!

195
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,040
What are you doing? Shouldn't we call the police?

196
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,760
Wouldn't it be wrong if we applied the full force of governmental authority here?

197
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,470
I think it's going to be a big fight.

198
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,970
Stop! Let's stop!

199
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,160
That's it! Good job!

200
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,800
Mister! Come here!

201
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Don't come closer!

202
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,140
- Come here.
- Don't! Don't!

203
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,940
Come here.

204
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,930
- What are you doing?
-Don't come! Don't come!

205
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,710
I warned you. You, jerk!

206
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,200
Everyone, let's stop it now!

207
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,520
Stop? Stop what?

208
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,400
Don't leave these thugs alone!

209
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,280
- Please, Director.
- Shut up!

210
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,970
I'm going to knock them all over!

211
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,000
All of them!

212
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,750
The president is here.

213
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,590
I should come back later.

214
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,510
Let's go now.

215
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,380
Mr. President...

216
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,190
Section Chief, I'm here. What should I do?

217
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,770
The situation is over, girl.

218
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,090
Just clean up.

219
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,820
Enough already. It's time to leave.

220
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,960
Dismiss!

221
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,390
We're back.

222
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,180
Did you send all our boys to the demonstration?

223
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,680
Yes, the situation is under control.

224
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,090
Good work.

225
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,620
Goodbye.

226
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,460
Na Yeong Joo, you were amazing. The scariest one, in one blow.

227
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,310
An unattended piece of luggage was discovered in the stanchion storage.

228
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,020
Please send a nearby patrol team.

229
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,720
Team 3 is en route. Over.

230
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,800
Na Yeong Joo, let's go.

231
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,060
Faster ... Clean faster.

232
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,560
There's no such thing as "your team, my team".

233
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,580
I think what you said was right.

234
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,130
About the Director and the Team Leader.

235
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,610
It looks like he took a counterpunch, right?

236
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,240
General Manager Gwon Hui Seung

237
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,860
Lee Yoo Taek, you punk.

238
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,560
This feels so good.

239
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,440
This is the Passenger Services Team.

240
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,040
Just a moment please.

241
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,010
Section Chief, Service Support Team has contacted us.

242
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,970
Why?

243
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,110
Two pieces of unattended luggage were discovered in the stanchion storage.

244
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,750
What? Luggage?

245
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,080
The EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal team) is mobilizing right now?

246
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,430
Seriously!

247
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,750
Step aside.

248
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,370
Who the heck put that luggage there?

249
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,710
If you look in the stanchion storage, it's definitely our employees'.

250
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,650
Do people think the stanchion storage is some kind of personal storage place?

251
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,560
Shoving personal luggage in there. Do you really not know whose it is?

252
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,180
You really don't know?

253
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,000
If I find out whose it is, I'll just ... !

254
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,560
Excuse me, Section Chief.

255
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,630
What is it?

256
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,690
What is it? Why are you raising your hand?

257
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,980
I'm sorry.

258
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,570
Those suitcases are mine.

You have a lot of stuff.

Yes, it turned out like that.

Do you have somewhere to go?

It's okay, I'll go to a jimjilbang
(public bathhouse in Korea, open 24/7)

287
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:37,830
I can move in tomorrow. I just have to make it through today.

288
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,290
Do you want to go to my house?

289
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,330
What?

290
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,940
It would be okay if you inconvenienced me for just one day.

291

That's what she asked.
