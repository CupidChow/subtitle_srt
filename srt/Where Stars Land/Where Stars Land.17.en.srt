1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,600
When are you planning to tell her?

2
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,770
I'm not going to tell her.

3
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,220
As long as I can hide it, I want to hide it forever.

4
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,210
If you want to continue working here, at the least,

5
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,680
you need to let me properly check it out, Lee Soo Yeon.

6
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,120
- What if I refuse?
- It could pose a problem.

7
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,990
Either let me check,

8
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,820
Are you alright? You can get up...

9
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,770
Or else just quit.

10
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,380
Lee Soo Yeon, come back to your senses.

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,450
Lee Soo Yeon.

12
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,730
Lee Soo Yeon, look here. Come back to your senses!

13
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,270
Lee Soo Yeon!

14
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,080
What happened?

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,770
I think there's a fight going on over there.

16
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,570
Horse number 1 attacks horse number 7.

17
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,770
Horse number 7 attacks horse number 1.

18
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,530
You lost. Horse number 4 attacked horse number 1.

19
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,610
- Yes, I understand.
- Drink up, drink up.

20
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,000
Drink up, drink up. Its going down, d-down, down, d-down.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,590
It's from the chief. Something came up so he can't make it today.

22
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,610
Ah, really?

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,620
He was going to bring us pig's trotters.

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,090
Han Yeo Reum

25
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,470
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,460
Lee Soo Yeon!

27
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,890
Lee Soo Yeon? Where is he now?

28
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,730
The master here named Jang took him.

29
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,630
What happened? How did he get hurt?

30
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,210
Let me ask first.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
You...

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,320
How much do you know about Lee Soo Yeon?

33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,160
How much do you know since you're asking me?

34
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,110
That arm and that right leg... What on earth are those?

35
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,350
Fox Bride Star

36
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,170
Closed for today.

37
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,420
Can you keep a secret?

38
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm asking you to keep a secret.

39
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,960
- First, let me hear about it.
- Make a promise to me.

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,670
If you can't promise me, I won't tell you about it.

41
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,130
I'm sorry. I can not make that promise.

42
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,300
I already received the general manager's orders.

43
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,030
I have a responsibility and duty to investigate and report everything about Lee Soo Yeon.

44
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,680
Whom do you have a duty and responsibility to?

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,130
A duty to the company and a responsibility as Security Team Leader.

46
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,820
Did Lee Soo Yeon commit any wrong against the company's interest?

47
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,610
If he didn't, did he disturb public order?

48
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,900
It's the video recording that IOC saw and what I saw with my own eyes.

49
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,690
None of that was normal behavior.

50
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,790
Don't you see him trying his best to live a normal life?

51
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,170
I can't simply gloss over it like that.

52
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,350
Why not? Who said so? For what reason?

53
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,170
He's wearing devices in his body that haven't been tested or approved. And he's wielding unbelievable powers.

54
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,300
- That's not dangerous? Who can guarantee that it won't be dangerous?
- I will.

55
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,320
- Team Leader Yang!
- I guarantee it!

56
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,130
I'll stake my name and everything and take responsibility.

57
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,130
So, how can you take responsibility for that?

58
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,970
Because I've seen him from the start!

59
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,450
From the time Lee Soo Yeon was fitted with it and started walking.

60
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,380
His hand moved, his arm moved, and his leg moved.

61
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,510
As you use the term, up to the moment he started working, it was all in the "normal" category.

62
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,890
I've seen him throughout that entire process!

63
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,360
He doesn't want to be special. He wants to become normal.

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,180
Because I know that he chose to do it because he wants to live an ordinary life like everyone else.

65
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,040
That's why.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,700
Can't you just leave him alone?

67
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,850
- Seo Goon.
- Please, I'm begging you.

68
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,050
Please keep Lee Soo Yeon's secret.

69
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,220
Agent Lee Soo Yeon, what happened?

70
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:57,990
Things change for that reason
Episode 17

71
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,380
E-Ticket Passenger Itinerary
Passenger name: Mr. Hwang In Bae.
From: Jeju | To: LA / Los Angeles

72
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,630
This way please.

73
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,820
I'm here this early because of you.

74
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,040
I wasn't even able to see my husband off on his business trip.

75
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,370
Thank you, Team Leader Heo.

76
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,470
You can't be sloppy with it, just because it's a storage area.

77
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,320
Our employees were going to use it as a lounge, but I took it away. Did you know that?

78
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,590
Don't worry. We'll be very tidy in our use of it.

79
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,640
Then please take good care of it.

80
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey, Honey. It's me. Where are you right now?

81
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,380
Next time be sure to schedule your departure from Incheon instead of Kimpo Airport.

82
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,070
That way I can see you off myself.

83
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,390
I understand. Then, come back safely.

84
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm hanging up.

85
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,220
- Hello.
- Good work.

86
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,320
What's Team Leader Heo doing here at this time?

87
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,330
Huh? It isn't out yet?

88
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,760
It's not out.

89
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,020
You're so excited.

90
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,660
Let's see.

91
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,020
Yes, yes.

92
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,920
Let's go, darling.

93
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,990
I think we should eat something.

94
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,060
Let's find something tasty.

95
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,390
Is your investigation of Lee Soo Yeon going well?

96
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,200
There you go again.

97
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,620
Why do you keep checking on Security Team matters?

98
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,860
Because it seems that you're favoring Lee Soo Yeon.

99
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,340
What do you mean?

100
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,330
I'm asking just in case. You might be doing a haphazard review.

101
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,420
I was concerned.

102
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,630
You keep crossing the line.

103
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,290
Do I look like someone stupid who can't separate work from personal life?

104
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,540
I guess so. We'll know from the results of your review.

105
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,310
Good morning, Team Leader.

106
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,270
I'm begging you, please.

107
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,560
Please keep Lee Soo Yeon's secret.

108
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,420
I'm asking just in case. You might be doing a haphazard review.

109
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,880
I was concerned.

110
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,700
I'm going crazy.

111
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,010
What? Is he sick?

112
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,490
Lee Soo Yeon again?

113
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,780
Yes. He's a little sick.

114
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,110
By any chance, what kind of chronic disease does he have?

115
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,910
What are you talking about?

116
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,180
You know, he just took a sick day recently, too.

117
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,900
It hasn't been long and he's sick again. I was just wondering.

118
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,150
Let's refrain from idle speculation and conjecture, Section Chief Gong.

119
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,890
I think he'll be out until the weekend, so make sure to cover for his absence.

120
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,400
Yes.

121
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,770
Han Yeo Reum

122
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,910
Han Yeo Reum

123
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,790
Agent Lee Soo Yeon, are you seriously ill?

124
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,520
By any chance, did you get hurt last night?

125
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,370
Where are you now? At home or at the hospital?

126
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,960
What should I do? Did he get hurt badly?

127
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,810
Did someone get hurt?

128
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,260
Nobody, Team Leader Seo.

129
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,720
Who got hurt?

130
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,210
Nobody.

131
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,760
Is it Lee Soo Yeon, by chance?

132
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,490
I just noticed that he seems to be out today.

133
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,880
Where did he get injured?

134
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,810
I don't know anything either.

135
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,730
Whether he's injured or sick. I just heard he took sick days.

136
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,680
But ... Why do you keep asking me?

137
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,190
Do you have some business with him?

138
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,900
No, it's not because of any business. I was just interested.

139
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,520
Interested?

140
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,760
Didn't you hear from Soo Yeon?

141
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,940
We used to be like brothers once upon a time.

142
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,150
Lie down.

143
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,300
Professor Eun came by. I treated the burns for now.

144
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,130
Even if it's just a burn, I think it affected some of the muscles.

145
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,910
You have to get rest.

146
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,160
For how long?

147
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,790
Until you're all healed.

148
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,700
Taking this opportunity to resign and get some rest might be good.

149
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,030
Won't it be hard to work at the airport anymore anyway?

150
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,550
The person who carried you here on his back was the Security Team Leader, I hear.

151
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,080
The wounds are deep, so it's for the best.

152
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,230
If you foolishly overexert yourself, and there is muscle necrosis, that would be a real headache.

153
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,960
You understand, right?

154
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,750
You aren't allowed to go outside for now.

155
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,290
Even if it's uncomfortable, just stay here until you've recovered.

156
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,510
Rest up. I'll be in the living room, so call if you need anything.

157
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,460
What about the restaurant?

158
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,900
I'm going to take a few days off, too.

159
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,180
Then, my cellphone at least.

160
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,810
That's off-limits, too.

161
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,580
Although it was a long time ago, my father and his mother were married.

162
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,030
We lived as a brothers for about three years.

163
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,220
As an effect of the divorce, we became unrelated to each other again.

164
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,060
I didn't know.

165
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,180
Due to various misunderstandings, we don't talk to each other now,

166
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,420
but I still worry quite a bit about him.

167
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,260
After all, Soo Yeon is in a special circumstance.

168
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,510
Do you understand what I'm saying?

169
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,530
Personnel Record Card

170
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,260
Level 1 of physical disability
Wearing a walking assist device

171
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes, well ... roughly.

172
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,900
No. To be honest, I don't know anything about it.

173
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,110
So that's why...

174
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,960
Will you tell me? How badly is he hurt?

175
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,970
I'd be thankful if you told me in detail what condition he's in, Han Yeo Reum.

176
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,160
I'm sorry. I don't know much either.

177
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:09,690
Now that I realize it, there's too much I don't know about him.

178
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,770
Sorry, my meeting with the president went long.

179
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,310
Did you hear? I heard it was crazy in T1 this morning.

180
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,640
You know, former Congressman Bang Seok Hwan?

181
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,490
He was caught red-handed by his wife while going on a golf trip with a young lady.

182
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,140
I hear he was completely humiliated.

183
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,310
Everyone was watching but he just covered his ears while she grabbed his collar.

184
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:57,050
Even still, should she embarrass him like that in a public area with so many people?

185
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,250
And he was once her husband, depending on public recognition, don't you agree?

186
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,990
It wasn't just covering his ears, but even more. If he deserved to be hit, he should be hit.

187
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,100
I'm sorry, General Manager.

188
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,760
I'm not feeling well today.

189
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,150
I don't think I'll make it through today's meeting.

190
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm sorry.

191
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,300
Our Passenger Service team still is not ready for the Christmas performance.

192
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,330
If you do not have any special instructions, I'll report it to you on paper by tomorrow.

193
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,830
Then...

194
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,180
Why is everyone like that?

195
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,290
Did those two get in another fight?

196
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,710
The Security Team also has a midmorning target practice tomorrow.

197
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,750
If you do not have any special instructions, I'll get up first.

198
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,790
What? What are you doing today? What’s today's occasion?

199
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,270
You're not interesting, and you have no emotion. Making busy people come sit,

200
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,370
and all you do is gossip about someone cheating.

201
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,080
What?

202
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,840
So? Would you like my report from the Traffic Department?

203
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,860
Never mind. Just put it down on paper.

204
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Making a fuss because of that temper.

205
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,120
What? What did you say to me?!

206
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
If you couldn't hear it, then don't mind it.

207
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,810
Hey, Team Leader Lee!

208
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm sorry. I'm late.

209
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,480
You don't have to be sorry. Today's meeting is over!

210
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,780
Hey, Team Leader Lee! Do you not hear when I'm calling you?!

211
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,090
Oh, again you are rebuking me somehow. Really.

212
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,380
I've been letting him off easy and this is what I get. Seriously.

213
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,690
Do you often get irritated?

214
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,470
Are you easily tired and have no energy?

215
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,390
Then red ginseng products are perfect for you.

216
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,340
Would you like to try one?

217
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,610
- Honey, why don't you try eating one?
- Thank you.

218
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,210
Since it's a jelly stick, it's clean and simple to eat.

219
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,090
Does it taste good?

220
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

221
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,860
Sure, enjoy it.

222
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,880
Welcome, grandfather. Who would you like to give it to as a present?

223
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,800
It's for my daughter-in-law.

224
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,980
It's perfect. This is very good for young women.

225
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,310
May I show you one?

226
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,220
Just give me one.

227
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,700
Do you have something to say to me?

228
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,290
What? No, not at all.

229
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,690
What about you? Do you have anything to say to me?

230
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,710
Nothing.

231
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,660
Really nothing?

232
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,970
Yes, nothing.

233
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,300
That's good. Now we don't have to discuss it.

234
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,280
But, Na Yeong Joo, isn't this a bit wrong?

235
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,260
Would a superior play the role of someone who is so reticent and incapable

236
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,840
that he somehow doesn't say a word out of fear of his subordinate?

237
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,420
That senior citizen.

238
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,690
What about a senior citizen when your senior is talking to you?

239
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,630
Where?

240
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,320
He's been there for two hours now.

241
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,520
He just stands there without moving. What should we do?

242
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,100
You have a visitor.

243
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,560
Team Leader.

244
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,070
What happened?

245
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,070
He came here from Jeju Island.

246
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,790
He's supposed to meet his son here and travel to the US.

247
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,520
But something seems strange about his ticket.

248
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,310
How?

249
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,330
The flight to Incheon is fine, but the leg to the US is cancelled.

250
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,010
What about the son he is supposed to meet?

251
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,570
He isn't here yet.

252
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,520
Elder, could you give me your son's phone number?

253
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,150
I need it to find out what the problem is.

254
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,140
Being stubborn won't fix this problem.

255
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,420
You need to give me your son's phone number so I can help you.

256
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,510
No matter what, there seems to be something wrong, right?

257
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,760
Hello. I'm Han Yeo Reum, an agent from Passenger Service Team.

258
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,510
I think there's something wrong with your plane ticket now.

259
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:44,920
If you do not mind, can we call your son and check it out?

260
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,920
Have you got your passport and ID?

261
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
- Wait.
- Sunbaenim.

262
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,710
Can't you see Han Yeo Reum is in the middle of a conversation right now?

263
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,500
The ticket is strange and there is isn't even a relative... Isn't it the proper order to get his ID first?

264
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,940
You have to wait, Na Yeong Joo.

265
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,650
He didn't accept my phone call.

266
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,310
Pardon?

267
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:14,080
Actually, I've tried to make a phone call to him since very early in the morning...

268
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,290
He did not accept my phone call.

269
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,520
How do you feel?

270
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,780
I'm fine.

271
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,070
It doesn't hurt since I can't feel any pain.

272
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,820
I shouldn't have stopped you back then.

273
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,190
When you wanted to quit at T1.

274
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,480
I shouldn't have held onto you.

275
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,140
Why do you say that all of a sudden?

276
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,110
I mean Choi Moo Ja.

277
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,920
You asked me once what kind of person he is?

278
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,780
Yes.

279
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,290
He's an upright and honest person.

280
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:10,830
He sticks to his principles and he has a strong sense of responsibility to his job.

281
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,760
Your problem ... if you try to avoid it, it's not going to go away.

282
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,200
Are you telling me to quit right now?

283
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,400
If your condition gets out in the open, you'll get hurt again.

284
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,930
You know that well, right?

285
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,840
Once again, I will be confined when others look at me differently.

286
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,730
Just like when I rode in a wheelchair for the first time.

287
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,420
Will you be able to handle it again?

288
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,170
Are you done talking?

289
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,700
I'm not sure if having him quit is the best thing for him.

290
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,300
He started that job planning to only work for six months.

291
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,030
He had resolved to leave at any time.

292
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,540
That was then, but things might be different now.

293
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,250
He might now have a reason he doesn't want to leave.

294
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,600
But how could you bring him here?

295
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,320
You should have brought him to the police.

296
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,470
He wouldn't go to the police.

297
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,710
Can't we just allow him to stay until he finds his travel partner?

298
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,500
So frustrating. There's enough work as it is.

299
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,190
And now you're creating even more work?

300
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,990
Just let me look for a relative, Section Chief. Let me do that, huh?

301
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,840
Did he at least eat?

302
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,510
I'm going to buy him food now.

303
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,150
Look at this. Look at this.

304
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,080
You should have started by feeding him, since he's elderly!

305
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,990
I'll buy something right away!

306
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,240
That Han Yeo Reum is a handful, always a handful.

307
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,550
Yes, I understand.

308
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,680
- Is it the police?
- Yes.

309
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,250
What do they say?

310
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,130
Han Yeo Reum. Just now, we got a phone call from the police.

311
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,690
That grandfather has a daughter.

312
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,640
His daughter lives in Jeju Island. Fortunately, she's been in touch with the police.

313
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,430
No, we don't know what's going on with the son yet.

314
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,180
Yes.

315
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,960
Yes, I understand. Please let me know as soon as you get any new update.

316
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,750
Yes.

317
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,320
