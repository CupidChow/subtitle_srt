1
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,160
A long time ago, my father said this to me.

2
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,020
There are no coincidences in life.

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,080
Everything that happens in life, has a reason.

4
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,160
Hello ...

5
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,350
Wake up. It's morning.

6
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,940
I know .... it must be morning ...

7
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,100
Today is the day.

8
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,880
I know ... it must be Monday ...

9
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,300
Do you want to be scolded by Team Leader Yang from the first day?

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,000
What time is it?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,670
Get ready and leave in five minutes or else you'll be in big trouble.

12
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,520
It's supposed to rain today so make sure to bring your umbrella.

13
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,380
Coffee is here!

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,730
Integrated Airport Operations Center

15
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,580
I'll go.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,720
A coincidence occurred on that day.

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,450
Oh, my umbrella ...

18
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,170
Oh my ...

19
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,450
It started to rain ...

20
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,120
He happened to be standing there.

21
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,520
Did he not hear me?

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,790
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,090
And inconceivable things started to happen.

25
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,610
There are no coincidences in life.

26
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,720
Everything that happens in life has a reason.

27
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,120
Seoul approach, KR 097 approaching KABBU Flight number 180.

28
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,950
KR 097, Radar contact.

29
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,540
Arriving 270 descend to one two thousand.

30
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,650
For vector two ILS runway three three right.

31
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,730
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,170
I am really sorry.

33
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,830
It's okay.

34
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,020
He looks very familiar.

35
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,520
Where did I see him?

36
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,280
Incheon Airport Terminal 1,2.

37
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,310
Wait a minute!
 I'm Han Yeo Reum. This is my first year at Incheon International Airport.

38
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,810
1 year ago.

39
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,210
There was an accident on the way here so I arrived late.

41
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,130
You seem injured quite a bit.

42
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm alright ... The interview ...

43
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,760
I can do the interview. Please allow me to do the interview.

44
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,700
- But, I think you should treat your wound first.
- No!

45
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,320
For me, the interview is more important than treating my wounds.

46
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,650
After three tries this is the first time I reached this point.

47
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,940
This time, no matter what, I really would like to pass the interview!

48
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,160
This is my dream!

49
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,780
So ... the interview ...

50
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,930
Please ... allow me ... to have

51
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,820
the interview ...

52
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,450
- Ms. Han Yeo Reum ...
- Excuse me...

53
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,900
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me!

54
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,750
Call 911.

55
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,880
- Is anybody out there?
- Come in and help.
- Wake up!

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,060
Please call for 911.

57
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,310
- Hello?
- Are you okay?

58
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,420
In the end, I passed the interview, as they acknowledged my passion for the job.

59
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,460
I got my dream job at the Incheon Airport. However ...

60
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,970
To describe her in just one phrase, she's a walking time bomb.

61
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,850
Look at this! It's already 17 minutes past and she's not here for work yet.

62
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,930
She has a psychological problem. She's late for work on her first day.

63
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,860
Who was it who complained we're short staffed and overworked?

64
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,060
That doesn't mean we should accept just anybody, Team Leader!

65
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,250
Even in the Traffic Department, she was on the waiting list to be released.

66
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,390
Two months after she started working, she gave her boss a roundhouse kick and received a warning for it. She is ...

67
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,280
- Team Leader ...
- That's not all.

68
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,870
Look at this.

69
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,260
During the year she was on the Traffic Department, she caused multiple customer scuffles.

70
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,570
Three of them were pushing and shoving matches and eight of them involved swearing.

71
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,070
She got her pay docked

72
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,360
and after receiving the most customer complaints in the shortest time in airport history

73
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,470
she was transferred to the Passenger Service department.

74
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,010
After one year of employment, she's won the Grand Slam of Time Bombs.

75
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,740
Why on earth would we want to retain this time bomb, huh?

76
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,210
- There were only seven.
- Oh god.

77
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,140
Hello. My name is Han Yeo Reum. I worked at the Traffic department for a year

78
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,340
and just received the transfer to the Passenger Service Department.

79
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,430
I hope you'll look kindly on me.

80
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:49,010
And I only swore seven times, not eight.

81
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,260
What are you talking about? Has the flight scheduled for 10:30 already arrived?

82
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,370
Because of the westerly wind, it came an hour and 20 minutes early.

83
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,290
Oh my life!

84
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,120
Really ...

85
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,660
Assistant Si, what gate is flight 097 supposed to go to?

86
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,130
Gate 14. The plane currently at the ramp has 50 minutes more before it starts to pushback.

87
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,790
Fifty minutes? There is still time for passengers who haven't gotten in line to board.

88
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,450
What should we do?

89
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,690
What are you doing right now?

90
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,250
You startled me. You should announce yourself if you're approaching.

91
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,280
I was going to tell you ...

92
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,220
You have interesting hobbies: roundhouse kick, chokehold, and swearing. And on top of that being late.

93
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,550
I'm sorry. From now on I'll make sure to be on time.

94
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,990
I promise to never use kicks, chokeholds nor swear words.

95
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,460
I'll do my best to work with sincerity and responsibility.

96
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,490
- That's what she promises.
- Anybody can say anything.

97
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,510
I got a call from Information Center 3.

98
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,750
They said at counter C's self-service check-in machine, there's a conflict

99
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,080
between the airline staff and a passenger. What should be done?

100
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,720
Go take care of it.

101
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,990
- Me?
- Team Leader!

102
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,460
Why? You can't do it?

103
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,830
I can handle it. I'll go.

104
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,970
- Leave your bag behind.
- Oh, yes.

105
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,730
- Your desk is over there.
- Yes.

106
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,540
- Not over there. Over here.
- Yes.

107
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,200
Oh my ...

108
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,630
She doesn't look like a ticking bomb but an idiot.

109
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,630
That's why she's more problematic. She's an idiotic ticking bomb.

110
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,720
- If you're so worried, why don't you go to check her out?
- Me?

111
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,990
Then should I?

112
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,290
Mr. Lee Soo Yeon.

113
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,900
- Could you please answer when I call you?
- Yes.

114
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,370
Go follow Han Yeo Reum.

115
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,040
- You mean me?
- Then should I?

116
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:27,530
Answer me, please ...

117
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,380
The youngsters these days!!

118
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,610
I'll do well ... I'm going to do well.

119
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,280
This will be it if I fail here too, Han Yeo Reum.

120
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,940
You did well.

121
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,230
But where even is Information Center 3? Where's the C Counter?

122
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,860
There are times when I lose my way.

123
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,820
Wow, it's a compass.

124
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,700
Yes, it's a compass.

125
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,140
Since you have this now, it's okay if you get lost.

126
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,960
I'll be in big trouble if I get lost.

127
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,210
It's okay as long as you know the direction.

128
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,580
You can always return. So, Yeo Reum,

129
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,420
you can get lost as much as you like, okay?

130
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,920
No, it's never okay, Daddy.

131
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,690
In this world if you lose your way, you'll become a straggler.

132
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,360
That's why I run even today with all my might

133
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,060
not to lose my way; or rather, to hide the fact that I'm lost.

134
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,670
Excuse me, where is the C counter self-service check-in?

135
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,190
Yes, it's this way.

136
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,020
Thank you.

137
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,140
Hey, go and get your boss!

138
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,730
Why are you jerks looking down at me!

139
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,990
What's with this stupid machine giving me a hell of a time?

140
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,500
Please restrain yourself, sir.

141
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,530
What happened?

142
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,700
I guided him to use the self-service check-in because it's a faster service but..

143
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,100
Hey you, why are you discriminating against me?

144
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,510
Why did you ask only me to check-in on the machine?

145
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,520
You're helping all the other jerks but me!

146
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
What is he even doing in a place like this?

147
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,480
- Please call the security now.
- Yes.

148
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,960
Please wait a moment, Customer.

149
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,730
- Who are you?
- I am Han Yeo Reum from the Passenger Service Team.

150
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,240
I think there is a misunderstanding.

151
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,810
What the heck! You jerks ...

152
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,530
You made me so angry and you call that a misunderstanding?

153
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,520
I don't want to deal with someone like you. Go and call your boss.

154
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,720
I said to hurry up and call the boss!

155
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,870
Excuse me. What in the world are you doing right now?

156
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,000
Can't you see what I'm doing? Should I show it again?

157
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,690
Go away.

158
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,500
Stop that now! Why are you doing this?

159
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,520
- Stop it!
- Let go.

160
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,450
Why, you crazy ...

161
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,800
What? Crazy? For me you are the crazy one right now.

162
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,670
Crazy what? What's after that? Crazy jerk, crazy asshole?

163
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,050
Answer him properly, Ms. Han Yeo Reum.

164
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,500
10 months ago

165
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,460
Did you call a customer 'crazy asshole?'

166
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,330
- Yes.
- You also roundhouse kicked a customer, right?

167
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,570
Yes. I did.

168
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,210
Han Yeo Reum. How long did you prepare to be employed here?

169
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,320
Three years.

170
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,450
But within 2 months of employment

171
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,620
you went as far as to call him a 'crazy bastard' and turned around to kick him?

172
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,600
Do you want to throw in the towel on your last three years of hard work?

173
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,590
Did you dream that your life is on a 'bed of roses' as soon as you got hired?

174
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,650
If so, wake up and smell the coffee. The company is a cold-hearted place.

175
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,810
Your value is based solely on your abilities and evaluation. Did you get that?

176
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,690
What are you staring at?

177
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,400
What comes after crazy? Jerk or asshole?

178
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,820
Don't stare at me and answer my question. You were going to swear at me just now!

179
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,370
You mean me? Really? How could I?

180
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,460
- Smiling? You're smiling?
- Oh my ...

181
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,140
You make a low living by selling service, how dare you look down on me, bitch!

182
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,650
The customer is king! I am your king! Got it?

183
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,570
If you're the king, act like the king instead of a dog, asshole!

184
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,000
How I dare to say this out loud?

185
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,960
- Let's use words, please.
- What?

186
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,090
- Stop staring!
- I said let go of this and use words!

187
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,290
Do you want to die?

188
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,880
Please stop.

189
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
Who are you, jerk?

190
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,740
Let go! Let go! How dare you!

191
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,160
Want to use muscles, jerk? Ha!

192
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,630
Let go! Ahhh!

193
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,970
Hey, jerk!

194
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,890
Regardless of place and person,

195
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,980
using violent language and behavior are without a doubt illegal.

196
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,740
In addition, you've also damaged our equipment.

197
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,270
These machines cost about 20 million won (≈ $20,000) each. Did you know that?

198
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,030
20 million?

199
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,130
- 20 million?
- You've damaged all three so the total cost will be 60 million won (≈ $60,000).

200
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,910
60 million? What 60 million ...

201
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,870
So what? What do you want me to do?

202
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,660
You will have to pay for everything.

203
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,480
For damage to public property you are legally liable for reimbursement.

204
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,650
In the case of this deliberate damage,

205
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,050
you will be held responsible for criminal activity.

206
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,750
Criminal responsibility?

207
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,820
What does that mean?

208
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,370
Basically, it means you're screwed.

209
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,310
Ah ...

210
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,210
Assistant Si, what happened at the ramp?

211
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,960
Gate 6 is the most available.

212
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,260
The AB Airline flight is scheduled to depart at 10:40.

213
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,870
It did not arrive at the ramp yet.

214
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,750
Why does it have to be AB? Is there anything else other than 6?

215
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,340
Departure area 112 is okay.

216
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,490
Gate K? They wouldn't want to go all the way there.

217
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,440
- Go Eun Seob.
- Yes.

218
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,660
- You take care of AB and I'll take care of KR.
- Yes.

219
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,170
Yes.

220
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:35,150
Incheon Tower KR 097- 8 Miles on Final Runway 33 right

221
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,020
KR 097 Tower. Continue approach

222
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,340
Wind 330 degrees, 7 knots, Runway 33 Right- Clear to land

223
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,960
Runway 33 Right, clear to land KR 097

224
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,810
Wait ... why? Why? But ...

225
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,220
Wait a minute! Where are we going?

226
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,280
Excuse me.

227
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,980
We meet again. We met earlier at the bus station, right?

228
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,740
Yes, well ...

229
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,870
Do you work in the legal field? You seem to know the civil and criminal law well.

230
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,720
How did you do this? 20 million won ...

231
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,550
You were a big help.

232
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,990
If you can tell me which flight you are traveling on,

233
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,610
I'd like to give you a pass to the lounge to express my thanks.

234
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,050
Lee Soo Yeon

235
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,370
I'm sorry for not introducing myself earlier. I am Lee Soo Yeon from the Service Team.

236
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,590
Anyway, what should we do? Three machines are down.

237
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,440
Excuse me?

238
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,010
What are you going to do?!

239
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,450
There are three self-service check-in machines down.

240
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,280
More than 60 million! 60 million won!

241
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,580
I've heard that the burden of compensation for damaged property is borne by all the passengers.

242
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,950
So, are you saying it's not your money?

243
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,300
No, that's not what I meant.

244
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,450
Stop. I need a report on this account by today.

245
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,220
When, where, why!

246
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,900
Despite being the Service Team member at the scene,

247
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,030
you let 3 self-service check-in machines get damaged—

248
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,270
I didn't let it happen,

249
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,220
the customer was very obstinate and I couldn't stop him.

250
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,700
You're skilled in roundhouse kick and chokehold. Why didn't you use your talents?

251
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,650
You should have stopped him, whether by roundhouse kicking or flipping.

252
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,940
Customer Comments are also available when it comes to auditing

253
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm still restraining myself.

254
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,660
You restrained yourself because you were scared of that?

255
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,160
You already have a red flag. You're worried about getting another one?

256
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,190
The youngsters these days ... they never want to submit.

257
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,730
No matter what your Section Chief tells you, you know best.

258
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,770
You're the only one who has a lot to say.

259
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,790
You're here. About the self-service check-in machines ...

260
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,630
As I think of it, there was a stanchion barrier in the duty free area.

261
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,020
What? Oh yes, I understand.

262
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,530
Miss Han Yeo Reum.

263
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,910
Yes, sir. I will take care of that right now.

264
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,720
Do you even know where the stanchion storage is?

265
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,210
No, I do not.

266
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,640
What can you do if you don't even know where it is?

267
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,710
If you don't ask for help, no one will tell you where to go.

268
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,380
- About what?
- Excuse me?

270
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,180
You said you were sorry. What are you sorry about?

271
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,580
Well ... that ...

272
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,140
You say "sorry" out of habit, without even knowing what you are sorry about.

273
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,030
Is that how you are going to behave even in the future?

274
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,780
I'm sor—

275
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,490
Mr. Lee Soo Yeon.

276
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,970
- Respond, will you?
- Yes.

277
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,260
You will be Han Yeo Reum's supervisor from now on.

278
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,960
Please be responsible for and report to me everything

279
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
starting with the management of the stanchions, anything related to the overall business of the Passenger Service Team,

280
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,760
the method of dealing with and responding to passengers up to the method and approval of payment.

281
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,330
You're not responding again!

282
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,680
Do I have to do that?

283
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,900
- What?
- Yes.

284
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,520
You have to, Mr. Lee Soo Yeon.

285
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,300
Let's have a meeting about the autumn performance.

286
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,560
You're really something!

287
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,560
I never acted that way, even after I became Section Chief.

288
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,780
"Do I have to do that"? Wow!

289
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,170
Is that something you can even say? Kids these days ...

290
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,760
I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me.

291
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,890
Nothing is going right!

292
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,240
That's fine. I'll take care of it.

293
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,420
I said I will take care of it.

294
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,520
Before all this, I did the hard work alone too.

295
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,240
I've never given work to someone else because I was a woman.

296
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,010
And I've never inconvenienced my co-workers saying I was a frail woman.

297
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,500
It's just a little sprain.

298
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,340
I don't fall down easily. I'm pretty athletic.

299
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,110
If you need it, ask for help.

300
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:15,490
Instead of that, could I get some information on Section Chief Gong?

301
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,550
I think his personality is way too much.

302
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,840
I'd like to know how I can get along with Section Chief Gong.

303
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,160
Some pointers to get along better with him.

304
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,320
I'd really appreciate your help in getting this information.

305
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,650
Please?

306
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,780
- I'll tell you where the stanchion storage is.
- You won't help me with this?

307
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,210
Won't you help me, Mr. Lee Soo Yeon?

308
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,040
Do you have something to write with? The directions to the stanchion storage is complicated.

309
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,910
Just tell me. I have a naturally good memory.

310
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,510
I have a very good sense of direction.

311
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,490
If you turn around, you will see the employee break room.

312
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,080
Yes, I know where that is.

313
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,830
You pass that and go to the employee gate.

314
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,400
Yes, the employee gate ... I know.

315
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,970
Pass that, then, after about 5 meters, you'll see a freight elevator on the left.

316
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,810
Take that to the 2nd floor.

317
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,780
Immediately after you get off the elevator, go to the right until you see the immigration office.

318
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,560
After that there is the quarantine station and after that ...

319
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,550
Yes.

320
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,970
- Make a left turn in the direction of the sign for the animal and plant quarantine station.
- Yes.

321
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,120
When you get to the end of the corridor, you'll find a security office.

322
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,920
If you turn left again after that, the office for environmental management and landscaping will appear.

323
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,380
- If you go 10 meters more ...
- Ah ...

324
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,660
you will see another elevator. Don't take that one.

325
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,620
If you go straight right, there will be door.

326
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,420
That's precisely where the stanchion storage is.

327
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,090
Should I ask the Service Team to help you?

328
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,050
No, I've completely absorbed it.

329
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,570
I can do this.

330
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,540
Fine then.

331
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,350
I wanted to do well.

332
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,250
But again...

333
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,510
I got lost.

334
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,850
This is not a route. It's a maze.

335
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,470
I'm going to go crazy!

336
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,700
Look, Ms. Han Yeo Reum. Are you going to slack off on your first day?

337
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,350
How can something that should have taken 30 minutes, take over 2 hours?

338
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,270
Lee Soo Yeon even went to you

339
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,830
and gave you directions.

340
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,520
What the heck is wrong with you?

341
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,160
That guy pulled a fast one on me, right?

342
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,290
Lee Soo Yeon? The slightly arrogant guy?

343
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,990
Yeah. That Lee Soo Yeon. The arrogant, rude and repulsive ...

344
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,450
He pulled a fast one on me on my first day knowing that Section Chief Gong doesn't like me.

345
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,330
He purposely gave me complex directions to the warehouse to make me confused.

346
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,660
You usually get lost.

347
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,640
Anyway, what a first day I had ... Wow ...

348
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,050
Even if making a living in this world has endless competition, isn't that really too much?

349
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,390
Even if I appear to be his rival ...

350
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,250
That's Soo Jae, who graduated from KAIST with a perfect TOEIC score and

351
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,690
he had the highest interview score when he was hired.

352
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,470
What are you trying to say?

353
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,420
I went to a provincial college. I got in after being on the waiting list.

354
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,700
The problem is I'm a dummy. Why is he trying to hold me back?

355
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,720
Is that what you mean?

356
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,170
The well-known rumor about him is that he is mean.

357
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,820
Eating alone is a given, and he has never attended a company dinner once.

358
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,900
He hasn't anyone he is close to and there isn't even anyone who pretends to be close to him.

359
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,850
It's rumored that his handicap is his social skills.

360
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,300
No doubt, he must be the scholarly bookworm type.

361
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,720
But recently, because of some reason, the truth was revealed.

362
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,860
Lately? What happened?

363
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,720
Joon!

364
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,130
Joon!

365
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,630
You're lying. That's a load of bull.

366
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,930
That's why it's a rumor. Rumors are like that,

367
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,530
exaggerated, blown up... and then it becomes a legend.

368
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,070
Anyway, after that incident, he enjoys

369
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,320
tremendous popularity from the duty-free shop staff.

370
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,240
Damn, so annoying.

371
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,590
Even so, it's your duty as a sunbae (superior in being employed earlier) to cater to him. He's a newcomer much like you.

372
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,080
- Newcomer?
- Yeah.

373
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,150
He was an intern for three months and has been on the job for only one month.

374
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,590
Please organize the stuff, thank you.

375
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,410
You can't be like this.

376
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,530
Let go of me!

377
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,950
Calm down. You can't go in.

378
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,720
- Let me go.
- Please calm down.

379
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,020
Calm down.

380
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,200
What's going on?

381
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,400
She said that she needed to find her son so she's trying to come in.

382
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,630
Her son?

383
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,260
Please find my child.

384
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,490
Please, my child. Yes?

385
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,340
Please.
