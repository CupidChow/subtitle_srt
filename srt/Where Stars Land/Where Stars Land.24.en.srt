00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 24

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,450
It's you, isn't it? The ice pack guy from the airplane?

3
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,480
Yes.

4
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,070
It looks like you injured your hand seriously.

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,940
Hold on a second.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,210
Why don't you come here?

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,340
Hurry.

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,380
May I ask what your relationship is with Yeo Reum?

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,770
I like her a lot.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,280
Oh, are you the one who can't feel pain?

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
Did Yeo Reum tell you about me?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,870
No wonder. It should hurt a lot, but you don't even flinch.

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,630
I heard it was from an accident.

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,790
Yes. In high school.

15
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,690
It must have been difficult, at such a young age.

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,520
Actually, it was thanks to your husband, who helped me.

17
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,710
I ...

18
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,750
Hurry up and eat.

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,410
Yes, your situation is tough.

20
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,930
Something more ...I know that it hurts so much you feel like you'll never get over it.

21
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,540
But still, this isn't right.

22
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,700
Anyway, survive. Just live for now, okay?

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,060
Hurry up and eat.

24
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,200
To thirty. No, you have to at least live to forty.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,310
Survive first. And you have to eat in order to live.

26
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,140
Here. Hurry now.

27
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,810
That punk left me and ran away.

28
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,840
He wanted to survive alone, that so-called brother.

29
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,970
He left me alone and ran away!

30
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:05,260
The first time I cried aloud was in front of him.

31
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,990
Fate is quite an amazing thing.

32
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,700
It brings unrelated people

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,890
together to a certain place at a certain time.

34
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,530
To have them meet and get to know each other.

35
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,940
Don't you agree?

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,180
Would you like to join us for breakfast tomorrow?

37
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,330
I'd like to give you a warm meal.

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,800
All done.

39
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,630
Incheon Airport

40
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,650
What do you plan to do about this? The internet keeps spreading news, yesterday and today.

41
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,560
And the news keeps trending higher and higher by the minute.

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,630
First of all, after we caught Nam Dong Gaek yesterday, the police are now investigating.

43
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,910
It's not a problem that the reporters didn't even write an article about his arrest.

44
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,700
Even members of the National Assembly are coming tomorrow to hold a party policy consultive meeting.

45
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,650
- Team Leader Choi.
- Yes, sir. I'll prepare for it.

46
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,800
Team Leader Seo In Woo and Team Leader Yang assist him too.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,450
Yes, sir. We will do so.

48
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,540
I finally get out to hit some balls and this happens.

49
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,120
My tee shot was feeling pretty good, too. Seriously.

50
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,460
Actually, this has nothing to do with our commercial facilities.

51
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,860
Don't worry about it and head home. It is Sunday.

52
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,500
My son has to get ready for a science contest.

53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,930
I'm sorry and thank you, Moo Ja. Bye then.

54
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,990
Someone was injured and there was no sign of concern.

55
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,690
Since I'm here, I guess I'll circle around once.

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,230
Team Leader Seo, if you ever get to be in that position, don't ever be that way.

57
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,560
I don't have any ambition for that position.

58
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,810
Did you talk to Lee Soo Yeon?

59
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,820
About what? What, when there isn't any evidence?

60
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,880
- Hey, Team Leader Yang.
- You should be getting ready for the meeting.

61
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,030
Would you give me one of those?

62
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,110
Is it too similar?

63
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,840
- Mom!
- Oh, you're up?

64
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,250
I was just about to wake you.

65
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,600
Smells good.

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,060
It's your favorite red pepper paste stew.

67
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,050
You smell good.

68
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,170
It's my favorite scent in the whole world.

69
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,010
Your arm doesn't hurt at all?

70
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,680
The pain killer must be effective. It doesn't hurt much.

71
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,780
Then, wash your hands and set the table.

72
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,320
The guests must be hungry.

73
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,780
Hmm? Guests? Who?

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,440
- Lee Soo Yeon!
- Did you sleep well?

75
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Why are you at our house?

76
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,520
I invited him to have breakfast with us.

77
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,090
Go Eun Seob, why are you here?

78
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,370
I just came.

79
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,130
I was curious how you were doing. And your mother is leaving today.

80
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,780
Here, come and eat.

81
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,370
Daughter, you should go brush your hair.

82
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,380
And the eye boogers.

83
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,500
Just a moment!

84
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,420
Come sit down.

85
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,020
Did you tell Yeo Reum?

86
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,620
I told you I would give you until the weekend. Don't you remember?

87
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,450
What are you doing? Come and eat.

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,070
It looks delicious. Thank you for the food, Mother.

89
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm not sure if it will be good.

90
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,180
Please erase all memory of how I looked like a moment ago.

91
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,490
I'd be grateful if you only remember how I look now, Lee Soo Yeon.

92
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,890
Why just Lee Soo Yeon? What about what I saw?

93
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,590
What about my eyes? My memory?

94
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,560
Please try some red pepper paste stew, Lee Soo Yeon.

95
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,120
It will be delicious, I'm sure.

96
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,490
- It's very good.
- Isn't it?

97
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,880
My mom's stew is the best in the universe.

98
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,160
Wow, what's going on here?

99
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,640
Like you say, what's going on here?

100
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,370
And what are those flowers for? I told you not to buy it if it isn't edible. Are you ignoring my words again?

101
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,030
I didn't buy them for you.

102
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,570
On the way, I saw flowers that looked exactly like you, so I bought them.

103
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,420
Oh my gosh, did you really buy them for me? Thank you, Go Eun Seob.

104
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,380
- You don't like flowers, Mom.
- I love getting presents.

105
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,810
Yeo Reum is unexpectedly impersonal, Mother.

106
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,810
Impersonal— I have so much emotion, I'm full of it.

107
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,870
What do you think of a woman who wants chicken and beer more than flowers?

108
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,080
Man does not live on rice alone. Isn't that too dreary?

109
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,590
It's not dreary, that's reality.

110
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,980
I'm having a conversation with your mother right now.

111
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,640
She's my mom.

112
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,320
Now, why don't we all eat? It will get cold, so eat.

113
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,290
Just eat your food.

114
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,510
You eat.

115
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,980
Oh?

116
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,600
What's wrong?

117
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
I have to go as a reference witness.

118
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,800
On the culprit's side, they are denying everything about the crime yesterday

119
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,770
Maybe there's a remote corner somewhere who would believe it.

120
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,570
For now, we are securing the CCTV. We called you because we need witnesses and their statements.

121
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,680
I understand. I will testify honestly.

122
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,530
Lee Soo Yeon

123
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,160
Where would he have gotten so beat up?

124
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,670
- You're Han Yeo Reum, correct?
- Yes.

125
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,500
- Please come this way.
- Yes.

126
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,860
Do you know that person?

127
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,140
Isn't he the one who wielded a weapon at Han Yeo Reum yesterday?

128
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,820
How did you know? I understand you weren't there.

129
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,280
I knew after seeing Han Yeo Reum get nervous.

130
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,170
What happened to your hand?

131
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,480
I just fell.

132
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,970
Isn't it the palm of your hand that gets scraped when you fall?

133
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,690
Is that so?

134
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,700
- You're Oh Dae Gi, correct?
- Yes.

135
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,070
I'm with Incheon Airport's security.

136
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,320
What is it on a Sunday morning?

137
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,070
One of my guys caused a bit of trouble at the airport yesterday.

138
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,330
And he's in police custody over there.

139
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,640
The guy who created that scene at the airport is one of your guys?

140
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,270
That's why I told him to be careful about whom he dated.

141
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,400
If you're asking me to help settle that matter, it won't happen.

142
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,340
We can't get involved with police matters.

143
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,900
There's an employee there by the name of Lee Soo Yeon, isn't there?

144
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,150
This guy beat the pulp out of him and left him in an airport restroom.

145
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,660
His name happens to be Lee Soo Yeon.

146
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,750
I can't say. I don't remember the names of the people in other departments.

147
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,890
Ah, wasn't your younger brother's name Lee Soo Yeon?

148
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,310
What are you getting at?

149
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,060
I'm just wondering. I'm sure it isn't the case, but I was just curious.

150
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,860
If you have time to be that curious, why don't you manage your subordinates better, President Jo?

151
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,990
Anyway, I'm trying to adjust the schedule for your meeting with General Manager Gwon.

152
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,730
Of all times, at such an important time at the airport

153
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,480
if you create a problem, what will you do?

154
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,770
Don't make me come and go over such matters again.

155
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,960
I have important things to take care of.

156
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,840
That airport employee, Lee Soo Yeon,

157
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,960
look into him.

158
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,500
Yeah.

159
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,490
Are you finished?

160
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,700
Yes, it's all done.

161
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,750
Is your injury okay?

162
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,320
Oh, I guess so. It doesn't hurt as much as I expected.

163
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,980
I take after my mom, so I have super, ultra, amazing healing powers.

164
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,250
Since it's lunchtime, should we all eat together?

165
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,990
I searched up a really good restaurant.

166
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,260
What do you say?

167
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,830
Sounds good to me.

168
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,600
Na Yeong Joo, what about you? Why don't you join us - if you don't have plans with your boyfriend?

169
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,610
You have a boyfriend? I had no idea.

170
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,170
I'm hungry. Where is that restaurant?

171
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,130
It's only level 3 spiciness, but it's a little spicy.

172
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,630
You could say.

173
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,690
You can't call this spicy. It has to be at least level 4 to be called spicy.

174
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,720
Wow, our taste is exactly the same. Let's get level 4 next time, Na Yeong Joo.

175
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,470
Sounds good.

176
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,910
Should we get dessert after this?

177
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,640
To wash it down with something sweet. How about it?

178
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,950
Sure.

179
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Baskin Robbins - Brown

180
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,460
You haven't decided yet?

181
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,680
There's over a hundred choices.

182
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,700
World Class Chocolate and Cookie and Caramel are good.

183
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,010
For me, American Peanut Butter and Old Fashioned Butter Pecan.

184
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,700
Oh, you know how to eat.

185
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,650
Then, World Class Chocolate, Old Fashioned Butter Pecan.

186
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,000
Sounds good.

187
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,520
Let's go.

188
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,950
Do you know what they just ordered?

189
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,790
No. I don't.

190
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,900
Should we go ride a bike after this?

191
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,500
Rail-bike

192
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,820
Yes, Team Leader.

193
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,670
Han Yeo Reum, how are you feeling?

194
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,970
I'm good. Perfectly fine.

195
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,660
That's good. Actually, I'm calling because of Lee Soo Yeon.

196
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,230
My mom makes the best red pepper paste stew.

197
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,140
Try my mom's eggs.

198
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,460
It's really good.

199
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,400
The person who attacked you yesterday was injured.

200
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,930
I think Lee Soo Yeon may have done it.

201
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,160
I'll get going then.

202
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,040
All right. Take care.

203
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
See you tomorrow.

204
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,630
Yes. Bye.

205
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,550
Hello?

206
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,310
I completely forgot to ask. About the ointment.

207
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,450
Yes?

208
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,170
How often do I have to apply it?

209
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,120
What?

210
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,990
So, do I have to do it at specific times?

211
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,850
Or can I just apply it whenever.

212
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,060
Just apply it whenever.

213
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,410
I see. So I apply it whenever.

214
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,960
Yes.

215
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,460
Did you get in okay?

216
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,740
Yes, I did.

217
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,200
Okay, then.

218
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,860
Get some rest.

219
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,800
What kind of adult do you want to be?

220
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,870
I'm not sure. I haven't really thought about it.

221
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,910
How about you?

222
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,750
I want to be like Team Leader Yang Seo Geun.

223
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,420
As much people think I make mistakes, fail and am inferior,

224
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,910
she's dignified, perfect and cool.

225
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,900
Then how about today?

226
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,880
What?

227
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,480
Not how you want to live in the future; how do you want to live today?

228
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,680
Making every effort to become my perfect future self.

229
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,030
It must be sad.

230
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,690
What do you mean?

231
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,610
Instead of thinking about what you want to do in the distant future, can't you live just thinking

232
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:31,620
about what you want to do today, Han Yeo Reum?

233
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,430
Then what would you like to do during the rest of today?

234
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,760
Are you curious?

235
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,620
Extremely.

236
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,870
First of all...

237
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,950
You're quite direct.

238
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,550
When you get to know me, I have a very straightforward style.

239
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,910
And what else do you want to do?

240
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,730
And what else?

241
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,620
Are you going to do this all night?

242
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,520
Can I?

243
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,960
You like Yeo Reum a lot, don't you?

244
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,280
Before you like each other, those differences draw you to each other.

245
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,020
But once you live together, those differences can make things difficult.

246
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,770
Yes.

247
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,180
But don't hide those differences because of that.

248
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,960
You need to know what makes you different, to be able to understand each other.

249
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,520
Do you understand what I mean?

250
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,170
- Yeo Reum ...
- Yes?

251
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,730
Yeo Reum, would you like to go to my home with me for a while?

252
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,110
I have something to show you.

253
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,290
Would you wait here for a moment?

254
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,250
Uh, okay.

255
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,040
Don't move or turn around.

256
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,660
Okay.

257
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,960
I'm ready. You can turn around.

258
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,670
Han Yeo Reum ...

259
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:45,990
See, Lee Soo Yeon, I'm not ready for that yet.

260
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,330
- What?
- So, I....

261
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,540
I'm not ready for that.

262
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,230
It's okay.

263
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,960
You just have to turn around and look.

264
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,300
I said it's okay.

265
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,950
Okay.

266
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,040
Oh, if you undress like that...

267
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,560
Lee Soo Yeon.

268
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,920
This is the real me.

269
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,060
I'm a different person this way.

270
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:12,450
With me as I am, will it be all right for you?

271
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,850
♬ Because I know you, ♬

272
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,320
♬ The yearning I feel  ♬

273
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,410
♬ Makes my heart beat ♬

274
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,290
♬  Because I met you,  ♬

275
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,300
♬  I don't have the tears which were increasing  ♬

276
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,050
♬  I feel happy ♬
