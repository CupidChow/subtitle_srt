1
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,370
Do you know my dad?

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,120
Do you, huh?

3
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,050
Yes I do.

4
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,670
How?

5
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,610
- Because I went there often.
- Really?

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,420
How many times?

7
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,990
Often. For a very long time…

8
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,770
At first, I thought he was just an ordinary restaurant owner.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,010
I later learned he was a children’s fairy tale writer who wasn’t selling well.

10
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,830
And I learned he was writing the fairy tales for his daughter from whom he was separated when she was young.

11
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,720
That he is my dad,

12
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,610
since when did you know?

13
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,810
From the beginning.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,460
Why didn’t you tell me before?

15
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,140
How could I explain it?

16
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,980
Saying that everything wasn’t a coincidence …

17
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,030
Your father

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,790
caught me just as I...

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,070
was drawn by your compass.

20
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,870
It’s my daughter. Isn’t she pretty?

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,040
Between everything coincidental and chance,

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,110
somehow like a gravitational pull, it happened.

23
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,120
♫ Because what kept me going was always you ♫

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,330
And that gravitational pull

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,050
allowed us to meet now.

26
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,170
How many of those words

27
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,970
would you believe?

28
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,220
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various place ♫

29
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,650
I’m asking you why you didn’t tell me.

30
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,830
If you insist ... I didn’t want to pretend to not know.

31
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,130
I didn't plan to work for a long time at the airport anyway. And also …

32
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,290
Also what?

33
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,740
♫ Is there any reason for people laughing? ♫

34
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,920
Because I didn’t know whether you would enjoy talking about your dad.

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,660
I didn't know.

36
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,950
Is there any daughter who doesn’t like talking about her dad?

37
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,440
I heard the divorce was when you were young, and you haven’t seen him since.

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,650
♫ I will tell you that ♫

39
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,290
If I were in his daughter’s shoes, I definitely wouldn’t like talking about him.

40
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,250
♫ and, like everyone else, I too smilingly ♫

41
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,600
Do you see this?

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,450
My father gave this to me when I was nine as a birthday gift.

43
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,160
It’s because I kept getting lost.

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,320
He said "it is okay to get lost, don’t worry".

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,570
♫ Every walking, resting, and talking moment  ♫

46
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,510
What daughter would hate this dad?

47
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,060
If your father were to hear those words right now,

48
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,690
he would be very happy.

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:17,270
♫ If I talk to and listen to you the day swiftly passes like that ♫

50
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,440
Could you tell me

51
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,020
♫ A moment of happiness which is waning ♫

52
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,710
more stories about my dad?

53
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,050
Later. I'll tell you in time.

54
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,300
Go home for today.

55
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,090
Must I?

56
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,530
Yes. I think you should.

57
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,130
What is it?

58
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,960
- Hello. I'm Han Yeo Reum who will be moving in today.
- Come again?

59
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,130
I'll be living here starting today. I hope we'll get along well, Na Yeong Joo.

60
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,690
That's my room.

61
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,920
Ah, yes.

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,010
That's the bathroom.

63
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,630
- Hello?
- Did you get in safely?

64
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,720
Yes. At first I had to use some strategy to get into a room. It was successful.

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,570
That's good. Then get some rest. Today must have been exhausting for you.

66
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,860
Lee Soo Yeon.

67
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes?

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,260
It's that...

69
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,800
Thank you.

70
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,060
For telling me about my dad.

71
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,960
Sleep well.

72
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,930
Prejudice which is blamed for everything
Episode 15

73
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,480
Yes.

74
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,460
Hello.

75
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,920
Let's see...

76
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,570
Don't touch other people's food.

77
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,820
Don't touch other people's drinks.

78
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,540
I'll be using the top two shelves in the fridge. You can use the bottom two shelves.

79
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,170
Since I moved in first, is it okay that I made that decision?

80
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,790
Yes, of course.

81
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,370
Since we're splitting the kitchen like that, you can use the empty areas.

82
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,660
Please be careful not to get things mixed up together.

83
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,460
The exact thing I hate in communal living is mixing your things with mine.

84
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,630
Sure. But could I just have one bottle of water?

85
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,820
The convenience store is on the right as soon as you exit the residential complex.

86
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,280
If you start borrowing things, it will become a habit and be bothersome later.

87
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,730
Please buy your own, even if it's a hassle.

88
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,790
Okay.

89
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,030
I also hope that you don't expect to be close simply because we live together. Or to act close and ask about personal things.

90
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,190
We're merely sharing a house, we aren't trying to be friends.

91
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,090
Do you have anything else to say?

92
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,100
No. Not at the moment.

93
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,450
If I think of anything, I'll ask at that time. Is that okay?

94
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,470
I see.

95
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,560
I understand.

96
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,590
Ugh, the world is uncomfortable.

97
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,990
But, even so, what kind of human generosity is that?

98
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,540
Can't you just share one bottle of water?

99
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,260
I could have taken one and then replaced it later. Right?

100
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,100
She clearly knew that I moved in late last night and didn't have time to prepare food or water.

101
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,840
If it were me, I would have offered her a bottle right from the start.

102
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,820
How can a person be so cold? Don't you agree?

103
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,300
Oh, really!

104
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,950
Who's so cold?

105
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,070
Ah, Go Eun Seob.

106
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,480
Who is it? Who was so cold to my Han Yeo Reum.

107
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,350
And you? What are you doing here instead of going to work?

108
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,670
I was waiting for you. I wondered how your move went, too.

109
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,960
I was going to go to work with you to catch up on this and that.

110
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,310
Hello. You're Lee Soo Yeon, right?

111
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,430
Who are you?

112
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,190
- He is...
- I'm Go Eun Seob.

113
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,930
I'm in the Ramp Team. I joined the company at the same time as Yeo Reum.

114
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,200
He became my friend when I met him while preparing for the entry examination.

115
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,890
We're not just ordinary friends. We're the bestest of best friends who share even our inner thoughts.

116
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,580
Nice to meet you.

117
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,970
Oh, the bus is here. Let's go Yeo Reum.

118
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,080
Agh, who did this to the door?

119
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,660
What did they use to pull it with that the handle is crushed like this?

120
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,780
Team Leader.

121
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,920
I just got called by the Security Check Team.

122
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,100
A white male is refusing to comply with the security check. And something seems suspicious.

123
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,890
You cannot board without passing the security check.

124
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,300
Put your bag here and take off your cap here.

125
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,250
I'm sorry but I... I'm not feeling very well.

126
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,590
My body is in a lot of pain and I ... I don't think I can go through the security check.

127
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,250
I'm... I'm also claustrophobic.

128
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,890
And I...

129
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,660
I... I can't. I'm sorry, I can't do it.

130
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,710
Airport Limousine

131
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,160
Why are you getting off here and not T1?

132
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,800
It's the afternoon shift so we have a lot of time anyway.

133
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,910
You're acting strangely.

134
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,200
- How so?
- You're doing things out of the ordinary.

135
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,670
This wouldn't be the "days of our youth" if I only did the same things everyday.

136
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,470
Sometimes you have to do things you don't usually do, and try new things.

137
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,990
Isn't this nice?

138
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,560
- It's really nothing, right?
- Of course.

139
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,040
- Okay. Just go now.
- Work well.

140
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,790
Fighting for today!

141
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
See you again soon.

142
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,750
Ah, see you again at the house-warming party.

143
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,150
Then ...

144
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,620
At the housewarming party?

145
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,770
What? Housewarming party?

146
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,930
Of course.

147
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,620
If you've moved, of course you should have a housewarming party.

148
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,540
Have you never seen the residential complexes before?

149
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,600
Sunbae Kim and Sunbae Park all live in the complex.

150
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,770
Of course, I've seen the complex before.

151
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,170
But not your house. You'll have one, right? A housewarming party?

152
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,330
A housewarming party. A housewarming party. A housewarming party....

153
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,070
I'm not having one.

154
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,140
You're not?

155
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,480
No. I will not be hosting a housewarming party.

156
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,930
Na Yeong Joo. Sunbae Oh Dae Gi called. Go to departure search checkpoint 3.

157
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,520
Yes, I understand.

158
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,980
That's strange. Why isn't he coming?

159
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,480
This is so uncomfortable.

160
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,530
Excuse me.

161
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,440
Yes.

162
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,380
By any chance, are you planning to have a housewarming party?

163
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,430
House-warming party?

164
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,580
Why are you asking?

165
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,180
Because I hate loud and bothersome things, that's why.

166
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,130
If possible, please refrain from hosting housewarmings and such.

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,830
There are too many things you hate.

168
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,460
Good morning.

169
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,190
It must be good to be Han Yeo Reum. Because you're having a good morning.

170
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,770
Pardon?

171
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,950
My mood this morning is the absolute pits.

172
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm saying I'm not in the mood to hear "good mornings."

173
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,980
Ah, yes.

174
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,870
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.

175
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,550
Are you not giving morning greetings now?

176
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,930
I understand you weren't in the mood to receive such greetings.

177
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,790
I think I just heard that a moment ago.

178
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,640
I'm afraid you need to go to the Departure gate.

179
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,910
The passengers are getting backed up.

180
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,060
Starting from a foreign passenger who refused to go through security to a grandmother who was caught carrying kimchi in.

181
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,780
I'm bringing this to give my daughter! Why won't you let me bring it in?

182
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,740
You aren't allowed to bring in liquids and food in a carry-on, ma'am.

183
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,320
But, my daughter is pregnant, and she wants to eat the kimchi that I make!

184
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,020
Then you should have put it in the checked-in luggage. You cannot carry it on board.

185
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,830
Don't you have a mother? Do you not eat kimchi?

186
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,610
Take this! You heartless guy. Eat this! You eat it!

187
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,390
You can't bring in food or drinks.

188
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,970
We can drink it before going in, right?

189
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,220
Yes, but...

190
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,310
- Honey, let's drink this before going in.
- Okay.

191
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,180
Hey! What's wrong with them?!

192
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,760
But, it's just water. Why can't I go in?

193
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,270
It's a rule. Water is not allowed onto the plane.

194
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,770
They sell water inside there! What's the difference between that water and this water?

195
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,700
The water inside has already been checked.

196
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,710
Then just check it now. You can just do it now.

197
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,310
It isn't allowed. You may not bring it in.

198
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,370
I really can't bring this in? Really?

199
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,290
No, you can't.

200
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,340
Okay, I understand.

201
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,870
- What the ...?
- We're going to miss our flight!

202
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,050
Satisfied? Do you feel refreshed now?

203
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,720
- Stop that.
- Hold on.

204
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,970
Days like this always happen.

205
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,530
It's a fact. When passengers are jammed into close quarters -- Whoosh! -- then they act together like a flock.

206
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,550
Who will go?

207
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,820
Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Reum, you two go and take care of it.

208
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,210
Yes, I understand.

209
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,080
Section Chief Gong, ask Security to open more checkpoints.

210
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,950
- Hey, Assistant Nam. You heard, right?
- Yes, I understand.

211
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,690
- Section Chief Gong, won't you do it yourself?
- Assistant Nam, did you hear? I'll do it.

212
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,660
Yes. This is the Security Check Team, right?

213
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,870
I'm Section Chief Gong of Passenger Service Team.

214
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,570
Yes, could you open a few more security checkpoints? Yes, yes ...

215
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,100
- Team Leader Seo, come in.
- Yes.

216
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,350
I heard Chief Heo and Chief Yang had another round yesterday.

217
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,590
It was over a vacant space on Level 3. It's been resolved.

218
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,860
The two of them have the same personality. It must have been difficult for you.

219
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,700
Did you receive the report from Team Leader Choi?

220
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,200
Not yet. Chief Choi brought it up yesterday briefly.

221
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,000
He said if it is not done right, it could lead to a civil rights violation.

222
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,390
Another week wouldn't make a difference, so I said yes.

223
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,670
But why are you so concerned about this?

224
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,260
By any chance, do you have any other reason?

225
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,020
No, not at all.

226
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,630
It's really a security issue.

227
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,310
Okay then.

228
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,050
This is the agenda I mentioned the other day.

229
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,740
This... Is this even possible?

230
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,300
Initially, it will face resistance, but eventually everyone will be convinced.

231
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,480
When that happens, you will leave your name in the airport's history.

232
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,300
It's possible you will be viewed as more than a vice president.

233
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,480
... Written Opinion

234
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,070
Ah, what happened?

235
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,450
Ah, Team Leader. You are here.

236
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,270
This guy here won't pass through the security. He stubbornly refuses.

237
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,900
But his chest looks strange. He's wearing a bandage and it looks strangely inflated.

238
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,800
Oh Dae Gi, first let's close the line here.

239
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,360
Yes. I understand.

240
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,710
Excuse me, please move to another line. I'm sorry.

241
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,330
Sorry everyone. Move to another line, please!

242
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,720
We ask you to move to another line please!

243
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,700
It's an Australian passport? Last time, it was a Japanese passport.

244
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,640
Excuse me, I need to check your ID.

245
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,980
Could you show me your passport?

246
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,130
You may board the plane.

247
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,320
Thank you very much.
(In Japanese)

248
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,240
Where are you hurt?

249
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,220
My... My ribs. While I was traveling I... I...

250
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,350
I got into a car accident and injured my ribs.

251
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,310
Please contact customs officers and police officers.

252
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,280
I understand.

253
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,300
CCT ...

254
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,020
Can you come with us for a moment?

255
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,000
Hello. The security caught the bearer. What should we do?
(In Japanese)

256
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,500
Yes.

257
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,630
Can you come with us for a moment?

258
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,920
When will the housewarming party be?

259
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,740
What housewarming party?

260
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,220
I heard about it just a while ago from Go Eun Seob.

261
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,310
Is that so? That's strange. I never said anything about it.

262
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,050
Perhaps... if I come, do you think it'd be uncomfortable?

263
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,130
Who do you take me for?

264
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,700
I don't have that kind of personality.

265
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,040
If I said I would do one, I would. And if I said I wasn't going to, then I'm not.

266
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,910
I'm not someone who tells someone one thing and something different to another, okay?

267
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,120
But ... I think it would be fun.

268
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,330
- What?
- A housewarming party.

269
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,070
Is that right?

270
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,590
I hate loud and troublesome things, that's why.

271
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,500
Please refrain from hosting housewarmings and such.

272
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,700
Never mind. Let's not go there.

273
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,860
Police officers and customs officers will arrive in 5 minutes.

274
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,900
Okay, I understand.

275
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,240
Priority Lane

276
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,030
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

277
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,050
Why don't you bump into another person?!

278
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,180
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,610
You're sorry?!

280
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,660
Hey. catch him.

281
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,990
Sorry, my leg accidentally got caught.

282
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,420
Was it really a mistake?

283
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,140
Yes, it was not intentional.

284
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,200
Agent Lee Soo Yeon, we have no time to be here for this.

285
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,520
We have to hurry and go to the Departure gate, right?

286
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,870
Well, we are too busy now.

287
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,730
When will you let me check it?

288
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,390
You said you would give me a week. I'll tell you once I've come to a decision.

289
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,070
Check it? What is he going to check?

290
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,320
- Team Leader, what should we do with this person?
- Get off me.

291
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,340
Take him to security detail. Call an emergency team as well.

292
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,150
Yes, I understand.

293
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,170
Team Leader, this is Oh Dae Gi.

294
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,990
This is the second floor of the parking lot.

295
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,610
Section Chief Mo, can you please take a look at the second floor of the parking lot?

296
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,880
A broker just fled in that direction, but we can't find him now.

297
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,450
Okay.

298
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

299
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,390
Is he that person?

300
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,240
- Oh Dae Gi, Na Yeong Joo...
- Yes, Team Leader.

301
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,220
Run quickly to the east stairway. He's running right now to the underground parking lot.

302
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,200
Continue to follow that man.

303
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,720
Okay.

304
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,570
Oh, yes.

305
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,540
Is that so? I got it. I'm going in now.

306
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,710
It looks like something happened to the Security Team.

307
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,380
What? What do you mean?

308
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,140
A fight? Against whom?

309
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,040
It's between a secruity agent and a passenger. What do you want to do?

310
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,940
- Let it go. I said to let it go!
- Please apologize!

311
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,930
Apologize, you jerk!

312
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,270
You can't be like this, customer.

313
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,370
Get lost!

314
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,110
Please apologize!

315
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,390
Let go! Let go of me!

316
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,370
Please stop. There are too many watchful eyes.

317
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,790
Wow, what a good world we live in.

318
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,710
You can use violence at airports now.

319
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,850
- Did you record it all?
- Yes, I got it all.

320
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,360
Good job. I'm going to post this on the internet and humiliate Incheon Airport now.

321
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,450
Excuse me, passenger. Please calm down.

322
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,460
Shut up!

323
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,660
I was going on a trip and I feel like not going because I'm upset.

324
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,590
You refund it all. The plane fare and everything!

325
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,760
You jerks pay for it all!

326
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,720
Assistant Si.

327
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,050
I''m alright.

328
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,760
You go that way!

329
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,500
No.

330
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,650
Hey, Na Yeong Joo!

331
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm okay. Hurry up and go catch him.

332
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,060
What are you doing? Hurry, we have to catch them.

333
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,870
Are you hurt a lot? Where? Your shoulder? Your leg?

334
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,860
What are you doing?

335
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm asking you if you're hurt.

336
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,160
I'll take care of my own injury.

337
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,100
You should have gone and caught him no matter what! How could you lose him?

338
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,370
Hey dummy, I'm worried about you that's why.

339
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,750
What do you take me for? I was even on the national judo team.

340
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,510
When I fall, I can take it easier than you.

341
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,170
What do you mean?

342
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,850
I'm saying you don't have to take special care of me because I'm a woman.

343
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,350
Are you saying now I shouldn't worry about my junior?

344
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,720
Would you be here like this if I were a man?

345
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,170
