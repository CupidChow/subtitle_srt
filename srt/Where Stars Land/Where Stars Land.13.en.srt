1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,020
Soo Yeon’s arm … what is it?

2
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,000
As Sunbae said, it was a fluke and a miracle. The real identity of that arm is unbelievable.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,250
What exactly is it?

4
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,540
I'm not specifically handling disabled employees who use an assisted walking device.

5
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,010
Because there is a personal privacy issue, there is a self-report system.

6
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,530
An airport is at the first level of security!

7
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,460
Did you make sure the matter of safety was properly checked?

8
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,480
He is … What’s this?

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,840
Disability Level 1
Wearing walking assist device

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,900
Disability level 1?

11
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,870
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,690
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,650
Would you like to go to my house?

14
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,700
It would be okay if you inconvenienced me for just one day.

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,700
Come in.

16
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,230
Well, I’m sorry for the inconvenience.

17
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,610
Would you like to wash first?

18
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,760
Huh?

19
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,090
Your hands.

20
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,820
Oh... Yes.

21
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,830
The bathroom is over there. You can sleep on the bed in the bedroom.

22
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,320
I can sleep here on the sofa. That’s more than enough.

23
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,750
Okay. Then...

24
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Okay. Then...

25
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you doing?

26
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,090
I think I better go to the jimjibang (sauna).

27
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,680
Actually, while coming here, the thought struck me that this isn’t right.

28
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,160
I’m sorry to have bothered you. Then…

29
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,060
Look here, I hope there’s no misunderstanding.

30
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,630
I... therefore I...

31
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm not the type who can like someone within three seconds. Or fall for someone in an instant.

32
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,760
- So...
- Am I being rejected right now?

33
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,210
I'm saying that I require more time than you would think.

34
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm not the type of person to fall in love immediately.

35
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,610
Then, I guess it isn't an outright rejection.

36
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,590
That is not the case.

37
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,950
But it isn't Day 1 either, is it?

38
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,440
Right. For now, at least.

39
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,770
Okay. For now, it's up to here.

40
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,930
Just stay for today.

41
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,800
- Look here, Lee Soo Yeon,
- I won't get the wrong idea.

42
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,150
Han Yeo Reum, who isn't rejecting me or isn't starting a Day 1.

43
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,950
This will still be better than a public bathhouse.

44
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,370
You haven't eaten yet, right? Is kimchi jjigae (stew) okay for you?
- Huh?

45
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,620
It will be done soon, wait a little.

46
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,400
What's the relationship between Lee Soo Yeon and you?

47
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,370
Anyway, you two were brothers.

48
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,130
Is that what Soo Yeon said?

49
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,650
Yeah, he did.

50
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,520
He said you were someone he liked more than anyone else.

51
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,400
I brought Lee Soo Yeon over.

52
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,320
He was going to quit, but I forced him to come to T2 with me.

53
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,030
Not because of you, because of me.

54
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,730
You know how each person has a jinx?

55
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,410
That's what Soo Yeon is to me. Whenever he is near me,

56
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,960
even successes go awry. And everything becomes messed up.

57
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,410
Even that accident,

58
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,790
it wouldn't have turned out that way if he weren't there.

59
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,540
Twelve years ago,

60
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,990
he wasn't the only one who got hurt.

61
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,810
Security Team: Choi Moo Ja

62
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,340
I will eat well.

63
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,550
Do you happen to go to cooking school as a hobby?

64
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,370
Is it edible?

65
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,230
This is totally cheating!

66
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,420
It's not fair that a smart person can also cook well!

67
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,260
You were born to take the wind out of the sails of people like me, weren't you?

68
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,960
♫ Because what kept me going was always you ♫

69
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,470
♫ Because what made me laugh everyday was always you ♫

70
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,800
When are you planning to tell her?

71
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,690
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various places ♫

72
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,390
I'm not going to tell her.

73
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,550
♫ are making me run and taking me to you. ♫

74
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,630
As long as I can hide it, I want to hide it forever.

75
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,930
♫ Every walking, resting, and talking moment  ♫

76
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,230
There was so much I wanted to ask him,

77
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,030
but I didn't ask him anything.

78
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,990
♫ Every moment I am waiting feels that way ♫

79
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,910
If possible, for a little bit longer...

80
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,970
as if nothing was out of the ordinary, like now,

81
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,350
I wanted to spend time with her.

82
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,390
♫ A moment of happiness which is waning ♫

83
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,590
Excuse me.

84
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,240
Hello?

85
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm Choi Moo Ja from the Security Team.

86
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,360
I need to speak with you about something. Should we meet?

87
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,000
Secrets to Keep, Secrets to Tell
Episode 13

88
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,200
It's that way.

89
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,590
Ah, please.

90
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,930
- Go inside.
- It's too difficult. This is heavy.

91
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,070
Really! Please let me sleep! Let me sleep please!

92
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,390
First, try pulling it inside.

93
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,750
Excuse me, Lee Soo Yeon?

94
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,020
Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

95
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,920
Agent Lee Soo Yeon, are you still sleeping?

96
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,760
I went to work first.

97
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,910
I left a light breakfast on the table for you.

98
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,160
You can come back for your luggage tonight.

99
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,490
No need to lug it around everywhere.

100
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,470
Then... Let's see each other at work.

101
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,920
Is there any problem? Why did he go to work so early?

102
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,080
Have a seat.

103
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,700
What about breakfast? Did you eat?

104
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,480
What is it?

105
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,030
I'm not sure if you heard from Team Leader Yang or not. But actually, you came up in our meeting.

106
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,850
To be more precise,

107
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm talking about the walking assist device that you are currently wearing.

108
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,070
What about it? Is there a problem with it?

109
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,770
As you know, security is top priority at the airport.

110
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,420
The question has been raised whether the device

111
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,550
that you are wearing is safe to use in an airport and

112
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,450
I have the duty of verifying its safety.

113
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,800
So?

114
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,960
Would you let me confirm it?

115
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,330
What if I refuse?

116
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,160
It's the director's orders.

117
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,820
If you refuse, it could pose a problem.

118
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,420
Don't you think that's a violation of my personal privacy?

119
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,250
Of course . You could file a protest, but if you do,

120
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,030
you will draw a lot of attention. Do you want that to happen?

121
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,260
It's weird. Why does that sound like a threat?

122
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,830
Just know that I consider this a very serious matter.

123
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,390
I'll give you a week to think about it.

124
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,660
Let me know what you decide before then.

125
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,420
Either let me check, or—

126
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,390
Just quit, is that it?

127
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,290
If you want to continue working here, at the least,

128
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,100
you need to let me properly check it out, Lee Soo Yeon.

129
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,270
Then, I'll leave first.

130
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,200
Na Yeong Joo.

131
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,150
Do you live here?

132
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,770
Huh? No, this isn't my house,

133
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,060
it's just someone I know.

134
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,560
Who is that "just someone you know?"

135
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,190
Just someone like that.

136
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,920
But ... I see you're moving here today?

137
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,130
Yes, as of today.

138
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,910
I too will be moving into a house today. I'll become a neighbor.

139
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,700
I'm curious who it is that "someone you just know."

140
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,020
We're going to be upstairs and downstairs neighbors now.

141
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,350
I know right, right?

142
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,100
Where should I put this?

143
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,540
Yes, wait a second.

144
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,350
See you.

145
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,690
What should I do? I'm dead.

146
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,080
Good morning.

147
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,820
Assistant Nam. By any chance, have you seen Lee Soo Yeon?

148
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,940
Lee Soo Yeon hasn't come in to work yet.

149
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,030
That's strange. When I woke up, he said he was heading to work first...

150
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,890
in a text to me.

151
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,080
That's strange, what happened?

152
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,000
Either let me check,

153
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,800
or else just quit.

154
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,180
Lee Soo Yeon. It's an emergency, please call me!

155
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,540
This is Team Leader Seo In Woo. Contact Passenger Services

156
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,560
and have them clear out the homeless people in the terminals.

157
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,330
There is an important inspection in the afternoon. Yes.

158
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,210
Yes, hello?

159
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,550
Lee Soo Yeon, where are you now?

160
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,920
I just got off the elevator.

161
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,640
Wait, stay right where you are.

162
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
What's wrong?

163
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,020
Let's go somewhere where there is no one around.

164
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,860
This way!

165
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,140
Do you know who just moved into your complex today?

166
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,820
It's Na Yeong Joo. Na Yeong Joo from the Security Team.

167
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,730
Is that so? So then?

168
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,430
I ran right into her as I was leaving your house this morning.

169
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,420
What should I do?

170
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,030
She definitely saw me leave the house after spending the night there.

171
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,260
What's going to happen when she later finds out that you live there?

172
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,560
What happens if she does?

173
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,420
Once Na Yeong Joo is suspicious of us,

174
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,050
the moment she opens her mouth with even one word to the people around her

175
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,360
rumors will spread around the airport in an instant.

176
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,260
Is it so bad to have rumors about us?

177
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,720
Of course, that would be bad!

178
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,390
First of all, we don't have that type of relationship yet,

179
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,940
and even if we were dating, rumors should never go around.

180
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,070
Why so?

181
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,900
Let's say we were dating. What would everybody be saying?

182
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,060
"Things aren't going well for Han Yeo Reum, so she grabbed onto a successful newbie.

183
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,920
"Lee Soo Yeon doesn't know how to select women. Poor guy. Dragged by his nose."

184
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,150
Dozens of your enraged fans will rain all sorts of arrows on me.

185
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,630
Is it important what people say, just like that?

186
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,510
Yes, it's important.

187
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,320
Especially if a rumor like that goes around at work just once,

188
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,650
the one who always ends up suffering because of the social stigma

189
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,520
is the woman.

190
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,100
Even people just looking at you can cause pain.

191
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,360
You don't know that, right?

192
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,410
Han Yeo Reum, how you do you know that?

193
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,970
Well, because of certain family issues, I've had to live under scrutiny for a long time.

194
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,510
I don't want my work life to be like that.

195
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,570
I ask for your cooperation.

196
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
I understand what you mean.

197
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,060
I'll try to figure out what to do with Na Yeong Joo.

198
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,170
Thank you, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

199
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,780
Did you eat well?

200
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,370
Ah, yes.

201
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,070
What about your sleep? Did you sleep well?

202
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,630
Yes, well...

203
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,020
Either let me verify or—

204
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,240
Just quit.

205
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,070
What? Homeless people?

206
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,820
For next year too, there seems to be an on-site inspection in T2 for the newer airlines.

207
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,750
They called from the Transport Team asking for our cooperation. Let's work hard.

208
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,530
Assistant Nam, I need you to contact the Security Team and ask them to organize a team for us.

209
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,440
- And Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Rum...
- Yes.

210
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,940
You two make your field rounds with Assistant Nam, ok?

211
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,250
I'll check on the situation and join you if I can.

212
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,860
Yes, I understand.

213
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,980
What happened to the request we made to the Operations Planning Team about the employee lounge?

214
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,650
Ah, right. That's going to be a little difficult.

215
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,090
Why difficult?

216
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,180
A Commercial Facilities Team is going to take the spot that we wanted.

217
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,770
Commercial Facilities Team?

218
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,460
Ah, that's right.

219
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,710
For some time the company has been discussing installing such a place.

220
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,820
Last week, when we said we wanted to use it as an employee resting area, you didn't say anything.

221
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,270
Even then, there was no definite decision made.

222
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,890
So as soon as we said we wanted to use it as a resting lounge, the decision was made?

223
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,430
Well, suddenly since yesterday, the commercial side has been busy as bees.

224
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,050
Just look for a different space for the staff lounge.

225
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,190
Isn't the section that brings in the money more important?

226
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,680
That's right, it's important to get paid...

227
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,560
However, the employee's rest is just as important.

228
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,720
Hey, Team Leader Yang Seo Goon...

229
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,890
That wench is causing me so much stress.

230
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,080
What's wrong?

231
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,100
Last week, the area that I wanted to use as an employee lounge,

232
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,130
did you say you would give it to the Commercial Facilities Team?

233
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,890
- Oh, a decision is yet to be...
-What do you mean, not decided yet?

234
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,440
Yesterday, you definitely said that you would look into it.

235
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,150
Truthfully, we are in negotiations over that spot with Seta Airlines.

236
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,720
Airlines? Then what about us?

237
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,300
What about the employee lounge?

238
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,210
You can just make that lounge anywhere!

239
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,790
What do you mean by saying that?

240
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,700
If it's an employee lounge,

241
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,830
it should be a place that the employees feel most comfortable resting in.

242
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,810
What do you mean, "anywhere"?

243
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,000
Wow, you seem like the airport Virgin Mary instead of the airport witch.

244
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,330
Look here! Team Leader Yang, true welfare does not come from an employee resting area, it comes from money.

245
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,650
The airport needs to operate well in order for money to be made. Why don't you know what's important?!

246
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,590
Why wouldn't I know what's most important?

247
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,170
The person who knows better than anyone that first priority

248
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,700
is racking up your performance points is me.

249
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,620
Why? Does your stomach hurt when my work performance record goes up?

250
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,240
Yes, I'm hurt.

251
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,180
You make the decision: is it the Commercial Facilities Team or me?

252
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,820
Yes. You make the decision. Is it me or her?

253
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,680
First, the priority is Seta Airlines.

254
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,890
Team leader Seo In Woo!

255
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,810
I understand.

256
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,890
Bring me some documents to review by lunchtime.

257
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,190
I will think about it until the inspection in the afternoon.

258
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,520
- Hey, Assistant Song.
- Yes, Team Leader Heo.

259
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,780
A report on Level 3, 3-16-02. Fill it with why that space needs to be given to us,

260
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,380
and the supporting reason that for a nominal cost it will result in added value to the airport,

261
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,520
and give it to the Operations Planning Team Leader, okay?

262
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,760
Yes, I understand.

263
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,440
We won't be using paper, but we will go in person and perform a briefing.

264
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
In person?

265
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,240
Me?

266
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,000
Lee Soo Yeon.

267
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,030
I want you to go in person to the Operations Planning Department.

268
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,150
Me, in person?

269
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,560
You are the one who discovered that spot after coming to T2 during your field rounds.

270
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:16,580
You go and convince them of why that area should be an employee lounge.

271
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,750
Do you think they would be persuaded by me? They might actually see it as a hostile move.

272
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,010
No matter how they see it, this is something that you have to do.

273
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,280
Go in person and explain. Convince them that, no matter what,

274
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,700
that room should be an employee lounge.

275
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,260
Lee Soo Yeon, the responsibility is heavy.

276
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,730
You must take it. Understand?

277
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,010
Everyone, except Lee Soo Yeon, let us go to the field.

278
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,250
- Okay?
- Yes, I understand.

279
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,260
Oh, really?

280
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,500
It could've been good.

281
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,300
It probably was good.

282
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,580
There really must be such thing as fate.

283
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,130
Fate goes round and round.

284
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,760
Right?

285
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,480
Hey, Han Yeo Reum! What are you doing? Hurry up and come!

286
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,760
Yes, I'm coming!

287
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,710
What is so interesting that you're talking about?

288
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,710
Ah, Na Joo Yeong moved into private housing today.

289
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,220
We were hearing about her move.

290
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,260
Oh, Really? Did you move in?

291
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,400
I just moved my luggage for now.

292
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,690
I got it.

293
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,750
The Operations Department just made a request for assistance with the homeless.

294
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,660
Teams 1, 2 and 4 will perform their usual patrol.

295
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,420
I need Teams 3 and 5 to work with a Passenger Services team to take care of the matter.

296
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,970
There are a lot of elderly people, so don't use force and try to persuade them.

297
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,020
- Do you understand?
- Yes, we understand!

298
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,400
Customer, just a moment please.

299
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,790
Ah, why are you doing this?

300
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,510
Let's move over to this side.

301
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,420
There's more space over there.

302
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,220
Why? Why?

303
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,240
- When I worked for a big corporation...
- Ah, yes.

304
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,740
- My yearly salary was...
- Ah, yes.

305
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,310
Asked me how much my salary was.

306
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,100
You're being unfair to me.

307
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,510
- How much did you make?
- I was paid $65,000.

308
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,580
I'm sorry but you can't do this here.

309
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,480
Leave me alone.

310
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,750
Go in person to the Operations Planning Team Leader and present to him

311
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,240
Go in person and explain. Convince him, no matter what.

312
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,110
Get that space as an employee lounge.

313
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,850
Where Stars Land
