1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,530
So, did you lose him?
 Episode 16

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,170
I'm sorry. But I gave the license plate number to the police.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,520
Ah, okay. What about Na Yeong Joo?

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,120
I think she got hurt but, no matter how much I ask her, she won't tell me how serious it is.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,540
How are you taking care of your juniors?

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,560
You should have checked how badly she was hurt. Are you not going to find out just because she won't say?

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm sorry. I'll check it right away.

8
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,750
Team Leader Lee, who are those people in the waiting room lounge?

9
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,030
They are security personnel who grabbed a passenger by the throat.

10
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,040
Grabbed by the throat? Why?

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,850
It's because of water.

12
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,510
What? Because of water?

13
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,600
All this ruckus over a bottle of water?

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,330
What are you going to do? He is insisting on reimbursement of plane fare and emotional distress damages.

15
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,390
The passenger started it by splashing the water and started the fight too.

16
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,220
The passenger's statement differs.

17
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,870
Their assertion is that our security personnel attacked them first.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,010
No, it's not. Absolutely not.

19
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,800
If you don't believe me, you can take a look at the CCTV cameras.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,280
Even if the passenger's story was incorrect and the Security Team's story was right,

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,490
how can you get into a fight with a passenger by grabbing his throat?

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,410
This young guy, in the face of an unexpected situation, can't restrain himself and lost his temper.

23
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,260
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,990
You should be apologizing to the passenger, not to me.

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,670
But the passenger is not willing to accept his apology.

26
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,470
So, go apologize until his anger subsides and resolve the matter.

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,690
And if that doesn't work, pay for the airfare with your own money.

28
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,760
I don't think he should be held personally responsible for this, Team Leader Seo.

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,080
At the same time, I don't think the company should take a loss for this, Team Leader Yang.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,940
That's enough. Where's Team Leader Choi?

31
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,330
Tell him to come and take care of this himself.

32
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,980
But, there's a problem over there right now as well.

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,560
What other problem happened?

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,430
Mr. Jayden.

35
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,850
Hi. I'm Sang Yoon Shin from customs in Korea.

36
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,410
Did you refuse to pass security check?

37
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,710
I want a lawyer.

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:54,170
According to the identity search item in the article 301 of customs law,

39
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,440
we are implementing identity search with article.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,590
So please cooperate.

41
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,480
Would you untie the bandage?

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,020
Didn't you hear me?

43
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,000
I said I want a lawyer.

44
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,360
Why? Have you done something requiring you to call a lawyer?

45
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,130
No! Ah, it hurts!

46
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,780
Stop! Get off me!

47
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,430
Aigoo. What to do.

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,170
I really have to call you a lawyer.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,120
What happened?

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,650
Are things settling down over there?

51
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,010
Almost. Why? What's wrong?

52
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,110
I think you need to get over here now.

53
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,260
Now?

54
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,570
Yes, right now.

55
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm Team Leader Seo In Woo of the Operations Planning Department.

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,710
I heard you were inconvenienced at the security checkpoint.

57
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,810
I am very sorry.

58
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,250
I don't need anything like that.

59
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,220
Just talk about the airplane ticket costs and the compensation for psychological damage.

60
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,800
Seriously! We haven't been on a trip in such a long time!

61
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,900
This is the first time since our honeymoon. How could you ruin this?

62
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,880
What are you going to do? You two?

63
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,630
I'm sorry. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused to your travel.

64
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,530
I just did what I was told to do.

65
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,030
Food is not allowed. Water is not allowed.

66
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,150
Dangerous items are not allowed.

67
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,620
Our duty is to identify and prohibit those items from entering.

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,690
And I was only doing my duty.

69
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,640
There's no reason to apologize.

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,740
This jerk still isn't sorry! Really!

71
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,420
The moment you put on those clothes and decided to work in the airport,

72
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,250
you aren't allowed to argue about those reasons.

73
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,230
That's what you're getting paid for.

74
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,420
The company is a cold-hearted place.

75
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,440
Your value is based solely on your abilities and evaluation.

76
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,680
He isn't getting paid to do nothing.

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,750
We work hard and get paid for doing that work.

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,210
Stop acting as if you're giving out hand-outs.

79
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,160
This isn't a situation where you should be butting in.

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,650
I couldn't sit still and just listen to what you're saying.

81
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,560
Don't you see that I'm trying to resolve this situation with whatever it takes?

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,960
Not at all. It doesn't appear that way at all.

83
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,520
Really? Then are you saying it doesn't matter if he loses his job?

84
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,880
That could possibly happen. Is that okay?

85
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm sorry, passenger.

86
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,540
I'm sorry that our young coworker isn't fully knowledgable.

87
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:14,180
Please don't be angry as I will try to compensate you somehow.

88
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,090
- Please forgive us this once.
- Ah, jeez,

89
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,530
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,710
I'm really sorry.

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,630
Do you understand? This is how you handle things.

92
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,000
Watch and learn carefully.

93
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,860
Aigoo. You are all here.

94
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,310
How is it? Can you hear anything?

95
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,360
No. It's all quiet.

96
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,780
Oh, scary. I think it's scarier when it's this quiet.

97
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,050
Team Leader Lee, don't you think you should go in?

98
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,940
Leave them alone. It's a Security Team matter. They'll take care of it.

99
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,510
Gosh, Chief Choi has a temper too.

100
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,130
- Is that so?
- Yes.

101
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,040
Why are you down there?

102
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,690
Just get up. Get up.

103
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,150
Did you commit some grave sin?

104
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,340
Who are you?

105
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,580
Ah, me? I'm Team Leader Choi Moo Ja of the Security Team.

106
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,280
By any chance, are you the one who did not follow the instructions of the security check agent?

107
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,920
What?!

108
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,300
In that case, you might be charged for breaking Airport Security laws. How did this happen?

109
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,270
What do you mean?

110
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,280
It was just water. Water!

111
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,490
How does water break Airport Security laws?

112
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,200
You didn't know that you can make a bomb with any liquid?

113
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,800
A b-b-bomb?

114
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,500
Wait a moment. I'm a good citizen of the Republic of Korea!

115
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,320
How can you make a bomb with water, man?

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,020
Of course you'd say that.

117
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,280
But we do not know who you are. We've never seen your face before.

118
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,280
How would we know whether you are upstanding or not?

119
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:02,230
Close to 200,000 people like you go through our security gates. Don't you know?

120
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,250
We have no choice but to work according to the laws. Because security is our priority at the airport.

121
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,800
But is it okay to curse and hit those people

122
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,770
who are working to guard your safety? Huh?

123
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,470
This guy grabbed me by the throat first!

124
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,360
- Do you have any evidence?
- Yes, I have!

125
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,520
My wife has it all on her cellphone.

126
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,410
- You have it, right?
- Yes.

127
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,800
Excuse me.

128
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,500
I have a video of what happened too.

129
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,960
I really can't bring this in? Really?

130
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,750
No, you can't.

131
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,330
Fine.

132
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,840
Satisfied? Are you refreshed now? Hold on. What are you looking at?

133
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,920
What do you think you're doing?

134
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,000
You said I can't bring this in. So I was dumping it out. What are you going to do about it?

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Seriously, this person.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,180
"This person? This person?" Did you just call me "this person", bastard?

137
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,590
Did you just hit me?

138
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,120
You look like you're going to hit someone. A kid like you!

139
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,180
You're going to hit an adult? Then let me see you try!

140
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,580
What will you do about this?

141
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,020
Will you get on the plane and go on your trip as planned, or according to the Aviation Security Law...

142
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,380
By the looks of it, you may even have a criminal suit filed against you.

143
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,420
Would you like me to walk you through the whole process? Huh?

144
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,900
Didn't the Facilities Team call her a Walking Time Bomb?

145
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,330
She's still a time bomb.

146
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,840
Lately, she sometimes comes in with the save.

147
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,570
Is that so?

148
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,470
You worked hard. You can return to your posts.

149
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,740
Thank you, Team Leader .

150
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,070
Next time... don't interfere with my Security Team.

151
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,020
What is this? Even making them kneel?

152
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,370
Did this require doing that?

153
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,270
I was simply trying to resolve the issue.

154
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,840
This is resolving the issue? It's more like putting a target on their backs.

155
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,720
If you make my team members do that again,

156
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,100
I won't sit still.

157
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,250
I don't know why a sentimental leader may be popular to the public,

158
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,550
but from an organizational perspective, it's very annoying and dangerous.

159
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,360
Are you calling me an annoying and dangerous person?

160
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Because of your useless sentimentalism,

161
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,950
isn't this why you keep delaying Lee Soo Yeon's investigation?

162
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,790
Look here, Team Leader Seo.

163
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,600
I've already stated that this is an airport security issue!

164
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,230
Then you, as the Team Leader of the Security Team, should do your best with this investigation.

165
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,610
Because that's your job and duty!

166
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,990
You asked for a week?

167
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:51,230
You better have an answer for me by then. Or else, I can go to your superiors.

168
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,480
I told you to control your temper! We almost couldn't go on our trip!

169
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,050
Take it easy!

170
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,980
Oh! Honey?

171
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,640
You worked hard.

172
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,050
Did you come running after watching the monitors again? I told you not to do that.

173
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,520
I came to have lunch with you since it's lunchtime.

174
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,690
I'll buy today. Tell me everything you want to eat.

175
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,200
Thank you, Honey.

176
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,690
Let's go.

177
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,090
What do you want to eat?

178
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,000
You said you'd buy me something expensive, right?

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,980
I did?

180
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,590
What did they decide to do?

181
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:15,040
Either I let them check or I quit. I said I'd give them an answer within a week.

182
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,190
It looks like Team Leader Choi went to Team Leader Mo of Integrated Operations to get video footage about you.

183
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,060
He may already have an idea of what is going on with you.

184
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,640
Because of your useless sentimentalism,

185
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,270
isn't this why you keep delaying Lee Soo Yeon's investigation?

186
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,530
What kind of person is Team Leader Choi?

187
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,040
What do you mean?

188
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,780
How much can he be trusted? I'm just wondering.

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,990
- Where are you going?
- They said I'm fine. I'll be going then.

190
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,120
Na Yeong Joo, stop right there.

191
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,190
Tell me. Where did you get hurt? I'll go to the hospital with you if it's serious.

192
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,210
I'm sure I already told you. I'll take care of my own injuries.

193
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,340
Why do you keep saying that?

194
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,400
A senior is checking on his junior's condition. Are you going to keep responding that way?

195
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,590
I'm telling you that I'm not that weak. Don't misunderstand.

196
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,250
I think you're the one with the misunderstanding.

197
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,600
In that situation, I would have done the same thing if it were any other junior, not just you.

198
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,410
Even if it were Jeong Hwan or Yeong Seob, I would have done the same thing.

199
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,340
Even if the criminal runs away right in front of your eyes?

200
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,190
- Yeah, I would.
- How could you?

201
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,350
Because I'm not the police.

202
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,930
I'm here taking care of passengers' safety. I'm not a policeman who catches criminals.

203
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,500
That's why a junior's safety is more important to me than catching a criminal. Satisfied?

204
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,550
I'm sorry, but I don't think the same as you. Satisfied?

205
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,740
It's okay to think differently.

206
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,450
But just because you do so, doesn't mean you're right and others are wrong.

207
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,010
That kind of thinking is not allowed.

208
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,660
Man or woman, senior or junior,

209
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,830
stop separating people and drawing lines, and discriminating. We're one security team.

210
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,800
There's no such thing as a man or woman. We're all on the same team.

211
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,290
At least, that's how I've thought up through now.

212
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,240
Don't ever again say that a man is this way or a woman is that way.

213
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,540
If you do, we won't be on the same team any longer. Understand?

214
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,300
Excuse me, Oh Dae Gi,

215
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,830
She should be here by now.

216
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,730
Na Yeong Joo, Na Yeong Joo!

217
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,310
What is it? Coming in without even knocking.

218
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,880
I did knock, but I don't think you heard me.

219
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,240
You have guests outside.

220
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,570
What?

221
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,200
What brings you here?

222
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,710
You didn't even call us so we just came instead. For what?

223
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,290
Housewarming! Housewarming! Housewarming!

224
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,420
Oh my gosh. You told me not to have a housewarming.

225
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,260
I'm sorry. I didn't plan this.

226
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,160
It's okay. Life doesn't always go as planned.

227
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,390
Have a good time.

228
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,840
Thank you.

229
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,180
Hey! Don't worry about food.

230
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,710
We brought chicken and beer. We also bought rice cakes, sausages and fries. Just sit down.

231
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,250
Open the dishes, open the dishes.

232
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,890
What are you doing, Na Yeong Joo!

233
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,870
What are you doing here?

234
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,360
Na Yeong Joo is having a housewarming. The Security Team is all over, so I came out to give them space.

235
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,800
How about you?

236
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,340
I just... heard some noise.

237
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,680
Why? Did you think I was having a housewarming without you?

238
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,030
Since we're out, do you want to walk around the neighborhood?

239
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,940
Shall we?

240
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,180
Eat, eat.

241
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,480
But, it seems that Team Leader is late.

242
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,300
Team Leader?

243
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
- Team Leader is also coming?
- Of course!

244
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,540
I told him about it.

245
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,790
Let's eat!

246
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,180
Let's eat.

247
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,100
Do you want a chicken drumstick?

248
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,510
I'm going to eat the chicken drumstick.

249
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,600
- You eat it.
- Please eat it.

250
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
Chicken drumsticks are the best, right?

251
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,640
Please give me one.

252
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,730
Excuse me, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

253
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,380
Yes?

254
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,650
How were my father's cooking skills? Did it taste good?

255
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,880
Yes, it was pretty good.

256
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,620
I heard from my mom that his business wasn't doing well.

257
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,670
Seeing that, it seems the food was just okay, right?

258
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,100
But still, I thought it tasted good.

259
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,070
They were the most delicious noodles in the world.

260
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,450
To me, at that time.

261
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,550
Here you go, free extra noodles for the brothers.

262
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,360
As for me, I remember seeing my dad 's face only until I was nine.

263
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,030
After that, I only got to talk to him once in a while on the phone or through letters, but I didn't get to meet him.

264
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,830
When I heard about my dad from you,

265
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,970
it felt a little strange.

266
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:06,830
It was nice and somehow unfamiliar.

267
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,740
Is this how it feels?

268
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:30,630
It feels good and somehow it feels familiar.

269
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,000
♫ Because what kept me going was always you ♫

270
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:49,530
♫ Because what made me laugh everyday was always you ♫

271
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:59,580
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various places ♫

272
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:07,970
♫ are making me run and taking me to you ♫

273
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:17,910
♫ Every walking, resting, and talking moment  ♫

274
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,860
♫ is all time looking forward to you ♫

275
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,100
♫ Every moment I am waiting feels that way ♫

276
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:36,600
♫ If I talk to and listen to you the day swiftly passes like that ♫

277
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,700
♫ A moment of happiness which is waning ♫

278
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,140
What should we do?

279
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,490
First, report it to the police.

280
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,380
And then stay as far from here as possible.

281
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,590
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

282
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,110
Oh! The police.

283
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,700
What's the number? I suddenly can't remember it!

284
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,890
Hello. This is the police, right?

285
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,330
You there!

286
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,860
Why are three of you ganging up on one person?

287
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,360
Who are you? Just pass by quietly.

288
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,720
I want to just pass by, but you're being too noisy.

289
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,350
You bastard.

290
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Are you alright? You can get up...

291
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,970
Lee Soo Yeon.

292
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,820
Lee Soo Yeon. Lee Soo Yeon, come back to your senses.

293
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,340
Lee Soo Yeon!

294
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,140
Lee...

295
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,890
What's that?

296
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,290
Lee Soo Yeon.

297
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,680
Lee Soo Yeon. Lee Soo Yeon, come to your senses.

298
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,600
Lee Soo Yeon!

299
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,260
Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon!

300
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:44,800
♫ Because I know you, ♫

301
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,300
♫ the yearning for you makes my heart beat  ♫

302
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,830
♫ Because I met you, I am happy ♫

303
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,900
♫ without the tears which were accumulating ♫

304

Where Stars Land
