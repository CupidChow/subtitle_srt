1
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,870
The Security Team... will now withdraw from there.

2
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,680
But, Team Leader...

3
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,880
Don't say anything. First withdraw from there, Oh Dae Gi.

4
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,590
Come back.

5
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,300
Hurry.

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,600
Please do as Team Leader Choi says.

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,250
Do as he says. Whatever the situation is, you shouldn't let anything happen, especially related to safety.

8
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,620
All the more reason, you shouldn't let this spread to the airport.

9
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,310
Aren't you going already?

10
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,610
Deputy Director Lee. You're following them well, right?

11
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,350
Yes, Sunbae. It is going well.

12
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,310
If it gets any worse, call the police.

13
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,760
People should not get hurt by all means, understand?

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,830
I understand. Don't worry about it.

15
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,390
- Safety has priority over a criminal.
- I know.

16
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,290
You said we are not police officers.

17
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,790
I know. I know everything.

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,010
But I was pi**ed off! Spitting mad!

19
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,120
Did Director Jo take Lee Soo Yeon?

20
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,150
Where are you now? I will go there.

21
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,540
Sunbaenim, what are you doing?

22
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,050
- Hyeon Joon, did you bring your car today?
- Yes, I brought it.

23
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,040
Let me just borrow it for a while, okay?

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,230
Hurry!

25
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,450
Wait a moment.

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,650
Sunbaenim, what's the matter?

27
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm not sure. I don't know.

28
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,060
This will stop Soo Yeon.

29
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,540
It will stop him?

30
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,080
Can I... do this?

31
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,510
We are all... just passing by.
 Episode 31

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,050
You may go there.

33
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,690
Oh! Section Chief went into the booth?

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,660
Jeong Hyeon Joo was contacted and told that her kid suddenly got sick so she left.

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,060
He has remained working in her place continuously like that.

36
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,600
- What about tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow too.

37
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,790
Yes, that's it.

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,170
Where is Lee Soo Yeon?

39
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,000
How did it go with General Manager Gwon? Do you think it will work out?

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,920
Please answer me, where is Lee Soo Yeon?

41
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,090
Seo In Woo.

42
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,150
What?

43
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,640
Didn't Team Leader Seo In Woo ask you to call me?

44
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,430
Put a stop to it and send him back, Director Jo.

45
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,640
If you don't want to mess with an airport staff member and screw up the deal ...

46
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,660
You do not have to worry too much.

47
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,130
Because I'm going to kill that bastard without anyone knowing.

48
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,250
Without leaving any trace.

49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,900
If there is no trace. there is no problem.

50
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,300
That hard disk, twelve years ago ...

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,930
Do you want it revealed to the world?

52
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,810
You... You said you lost it.

53
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,420
Didn't you ever think it was insurance for Soo Yeon and me?

54
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,260
You don't want to see the last ten years of work go down the drain, do you?

55
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,570
The plans for Incheon Airport, for both you and me.

56
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,230
Hyung!

57
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,860
Let me go! I said to let me go!

58
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,320
You! Here ...

59
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,820
Let me go!

60
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,360
Stop!

61
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,400
Stop!

62
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,350
Let me go!

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,030
Hyung!

64
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,070
Where do you think ...

65
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,020
Take him.

66
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,880
- Throw him into the sea.
- Yes.

67
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,100
What should I do, Deputy Director?

68
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,250
I will call the police and we will chase Jo Won Ho.

69
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,650
Step aside!

70
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,130
If you don't step aside, everyone will get hurt! Step aside!

71
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,830
Let me go...

72
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,530
Where are they going with Team Leader Seo In Woo?

73
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,130
I'll find out!

74
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,060
I will definitely find out.

75
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,710
Yang Seo Goon

76
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,690
- Why is she like that?
- I don't know.

77
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,680
Yes, what happened?

78
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,620
We arrested twenty-one people who appear to be gang members at the scene.

79
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,680
But there's no one who looks like an airport employee.

80
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,160
- There isn't?
- No, there isn't.

81
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,630
Alright, I understand.

82
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,770
- You just stay still.
- Yes.

83
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,850
Hyung! Hyung! Hyung!

84
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,950
Let go, Soo Yeon. Just let go!

85
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,720
- Hello?
- I just got a call from Oh Dae Gi.

86
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,990
He says Lee Soo Yeon is heading home right now. Come quick.

87
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,780
Team Leader, Lee Soo Yeon is going home right now.

88
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,190
Team Leader Yang, I was actually on my way to meet you.

89
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,990
I heard from Han Yeo Reum. Are you sure he's safe?

90
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,400
He's with our Security Team's Oh Dae Gi and Team Leader Seo. They seem to be safe.

91
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
That punk Team Leader Seo ...

92
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,300
I worried that he was all talk but he really did pull through.

93
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,690
- Seo Goon!
- If you leave the kids in that kind of danger ever again,

94
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,490
I'm really going to end things with you forever.

95
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,090
Team Leader Seo said he'd handle this situation himself, that's why.

96
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,270
Even so, I couldn't let the Security Team and gangsters fight at the airport.

97
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,990
Either way, I want you to know that I'm really unhappy about what happened today.

98
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,220
Deputy Director Lee, how did it go?

99
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,240
I don't think you need to worry about Lee Soo Yeon.

100
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,190
Both of those guys are giving statements that they were fighting with each other.

101
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,150
Neither does Director Jo want it to look as if something happened

102
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,010
and his minions are keeping their mouths shut and haven't seen a thing.

103
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,840
That's good.

104
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,940
This time, you need to report it properly to headquarters, Sunbaenim.

105
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,300
About both Lee Soo Yeon and Seo In Woo.

106
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,670
I know. Anyway, thanks.

107
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,310
By the way, when are you coming back to the headquarters?

108
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,710
That too. Later.

109
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,610
Lee Soo Yeon, will you be alright?

110
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,140
Yes, I'm alright.

111
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,660
Thank you for bringing me home.

112
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,540
Yeo Reum, you're coming now?

113
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,810
Yeah, where's agent Lee Soo Yeon?

114
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,590
I got here ten minutes ago but he's not here yet.

115
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,110
Lee Soo Yeon!

116
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,050
Lee Soo Yeon.

117
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,330
Lee Soo Yeon...

118
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,870
Lee Soo Yeon.

119
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,650
Lee Soo Yeon!

120
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,220
Lee Soo Yeon!

121
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,900
Lee Soo Yeon, what do I do?

122
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,230
Why did you follow me here?

123
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,690
If I hadn't, then I wouldn't have found out your true feelings.

124
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,180
Why are my true feelings so important?

125
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,580
Do you know that?

126
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,730
The three years that you fed me as an older brother,

127
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,280
it was much more than what my mother ever did.

128
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,500
You were always like that.

129
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,470
You'd act annoyed, but you'd always worry about me and take care of me,

130
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,870
saying I was pitiful.

131
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,880
You were worried that I'd turn out like you.

132
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,760
It's a relief you didn't turn out like me.

133
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,600
This time, it was you who went after me.

134
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,880
Do you know that?

135
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,140
This is Soo Yeon's college entrance present.

136
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,380
Because he won't accept it from me, please deliver it as though it were from you.

137
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,160
Thank you, In Woo.

138
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,960
I heard you have re-married.

139
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,720
Yes. I'm going to America next month.

140
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,990
Then, what about Soo Yeon?

141
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,050
He should go with us,

142
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,490
but he said he will live in a college dormitory. He's so stubborn.

143
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,470
But now, he's pretty good living on his own.

144
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,060
It was two ears after the accident. Leaving her son who had become disabled,

145
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,530
his mother ran away saying she was finding her own life.

146
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,590
A father who always had priority over your life.

147
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,530
Children who were always pushed to the back in their parents' lives like that,

148
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,200
don't know how to even love themselves.

149
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,680
Because they never learned.

150
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,320
Are you all right, Sunbaenim?

151
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,020
Yes. I'm fine.

152
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,790
You weren't injured anywhere?

153
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,230
No. I wasn't.

154
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,520
Is he really going to be all right?

155
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,620
Soo Yeon should be stopped.

156
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,060
It should be done so that Soo Yeon will survive.

157
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,520
Have you decided yet?

158
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,260
I have absolutely no shame in facing heaven.

159
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,400
Does that mean you will proceed?

160
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,700
If there's no shame in my heart, I can't do otherwise. Isn't that right?

161
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,230
- Look here, General Manager Gwon.
- Is there anyone here

162
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,060
who loves Incheon Airport more than I do? Let him step forward.

163
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,280
From the time we rode a boat to come and go to Yeongjong Island (site of Incheon Airport),

164
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,390
until our current Incheon Airport was built, twenty years ago.

165
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:14,220
I am the person who has dedicated everything, my youth, my middle age, my life. It's me!

166
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,590
Gwon Hui Seung's real name is here ... I'm ready to be buried here.

167
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,110
I have poured my life into this place. I have!

168
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,300
Both you Yang Seo Goon and you Lee Woo Taek.

169
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,100
Don't recklessly judge my life and my efforts!

170
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,680
This position will never be taken away. Do you understand?

171
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,290
Well, if that's your decision, I will inform the union tomorrow morning.

172
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,420
We have no choice but take collective action.

173
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,710
Do as you please.

174
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,760
Shall I talk to him, Team Leader?

175
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,020
Are you very upset?

176
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,060
I'll be fine. It's not only me.

177
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,430
I'm sure at some time or another, someone will make it happen.

178
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,760
Because the person who loves this place wants the right person to do it.

179
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,570
It's not the time yet.

180
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,820
When you try to do something by force when the time is not right, someone will get hurt.

181
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,440
I just... hope that it's not you.

182
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,480
We are all just nothing but passers-by.

183
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,470
I don't know what decisions will be made by whoever follows us.

184
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,790
We will take care of this now as it is for a little longer.

185
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,270
That's our job.

186
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,680
Are you awake?

187
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,840
Yes.

188
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,100
When did you wake up?

189
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,050
Just now.

190
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,000
Your fever went down.

191
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,970
The medicine Mister Jang gave must be effective.

192
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,690
Did you stay up all night?

193
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,030
Mister Jang stayed until dawn.

194
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,810
How about your body?

195
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,250
It's so-so.

196
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,690
Stay here. I'll get something to eat.

197
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,920
Let's stay like this a little longer.

198
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,370
Aren't you hungry?

199
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,990
I am not hungry.

200
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,180
I like now more.

201
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,210
I'm delivering breakfast.

202
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,770
Yeah. I ordered and sent it. I thought it would be hard to prepare brreakfast.

203
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,920
It'll taste better if you eat it when it's hot from the microwave.

204
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,070
Did my Yeong Joo somehow think of all of this?

205
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,440
Bon appetit.

206
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,010
It looks like he must have been pushing himself too hard.

207
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,120
One unit which acts as the hamstring is out.

208
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,530
Because there is a spare, there isn't a problem with replacement for now.

209
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,200
The infection is more of a problem than that.

210
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,960
Did you use what I gave you?

211
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,120
But .. is it really all right to use it?

212
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,110
Let's think about right and wrong next time.

213
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,830
In any case, we have to try to save him.

214
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,000
Left the way it is, I'm afraid

215
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,250
Soo Yeon won't be able to last even the next week and will collapse.

216
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,860
If it's too difficult for you to do, I will do it.

217
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,350
No matter what it takes, I must save that guy Soo Yeon's life.

218
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,400
I know ...

219
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,280
however ...

220
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
It looks delicious.

221
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,300
The life he chose ... it is all right for someone else

222
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,660
to put a halt to it without his permission?

223
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,950
