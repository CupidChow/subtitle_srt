1
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,100
It's right across from that counter.

2
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,170
It wasn't for the sake of looking different from others.

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,240
I wanted to look like them.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:55,170
♬ Just the heavy burden you carry  ♬

5
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,790
♬  I am happy I can share it with you ♬

6
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,810
It wasn't because I wanted to be special.

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,040
Actually,

8
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,130
I wanted to look normal ...

9
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,340
so I made a choice.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,090
But don't hide those differences from each other.

11
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,100
You need to know what makes you different to be able to understand each other.

12
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,900
The time is now for me to be truthful to you.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,410
Yeo Reum, would you like to go to my home with me for a while?

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,690
I have to show you something.

15
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,860
♫ Sitting next to you and speaking in a soft voice  ♫

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:46,600
♬ I am saying that's enough.
I am saying that's enough..  ♬

17
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,100
♬ Because I know you,  ♬

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,250
♬ the yearning I feel  ♬

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:04,300
♬  makes my heart beat. ♬

20
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,080
♬  Because I met you,  ♬

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
♬ I don't have the tears which were increasing anymore  ♬

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,180
This is the real me.

23
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,670
Soo Yeon.

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,570
I am a different person this way.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,800
With me as I am, will it be all right for you?

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,880
For her to be truthful to me, now ...

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,790
is the time.

28
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,440
Hello.

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,030
Hello.

30
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,570
Do you remember?

31
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,390
First, can I have a bowl of noodles?

32
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,030
Yeo Reum, all you all right?

33
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,580
Were you very shocked?

34
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,610
Wow, you're so good at boiling the noodles!

35
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,390
It doesn't seem you majored in cooking.

36
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,630
Isn't that so? Doctor Park Won Shik.

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,150
The device that Lee Soo Yeon is wearing, that's your invention, right?

38
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,160
Call me Mr. Jang. I'm merely a noodle shop owner now.

39
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,250
Can you explain to me about that wearable device?

40
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,120
What's the exact reason that I have to?

41
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,830
You know already ... that Lee Soo Yeon hit someone.

42
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,160
Whatever the reason, situation or relationship to victim,

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,670
in either case, someone got hurt.

44
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,850
This is an issue of Soo Yeon's stepping out of line for personal reasons. So tell me.

45
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,310
That's why I need to know how dangerous that wearable device can be to people.

46
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,100
By any chance, when you said you were malfunctioning...

47
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,260
Correct.

48
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,210
It's this arm.

49
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,630
But at that time, you told me that it was because of me, why?

50
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,860
Because of you, I keep malfunctioning.

51
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,600
When the error first started occurring,

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,220
it was that day.

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,150
The first day you started working at the Passenger Services Team.

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,170
Is it that if I'm by your side, you will keep malfunctioning?

55
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,850
That's not exactly it.

56
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,210
When my heart became agitated because of you,

57
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,970
that was when the errors occurred... I only suspect up to there.

58
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,270
By any chance, does that arm also read your feelings?

59
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,060
That's not it.

60
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,130
It's just that there are sixty-six conductors embedded in my arm and leg.

61
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,920
Within each conductor there is something like a battery to give impetus.

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,900
It's similar to a pacemaker. So ...

63
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,110
maybe it reacts sensitively to my heart fluctuations.

64
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,140
Ah...

65
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,050
Either way, you're okay now, right?

66
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,010
Yes. I'm okay, now.

67
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,700
How about you?

68
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,790
Han Yeo Reum, are you okay, too?

69
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,990
Of course I'm fine.

70
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,090
Thank you for telling me. It must not have been easy.

71
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,380
Just get some rest today. You need to go to work tomorrow.

72
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,340
I'll get going.

73
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,240
Yeo Reum.

74
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes?

75
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,610
Oh, right.

76
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,170
I'll see you tomorrow then.

77
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,500
See you tomorrow.

78
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,180
Is she... really going to be okay?

79
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,530
Is he... really going to be okay?

80
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,560
Belonging to Each Other
Episode 25

81
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,020
Excuse me! It's dangerous being on the driveway, back up please!

82
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,460
Please stop taking photos. You're obstructing the path of the passengers!

83
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,920
Excuse me, please move back, you'll get hurt.

84
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,990
Ah, so annoying, seriously!

85
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,550
You!

86
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,590
What about Section Chief Gong? Is there an issue?

87
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,060
The manager overseeing the lounge reconstruction is complaining.

88
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,650
He says it's bothersome how he comes right at the end of the workday

89
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,720
asking to go for drinks.

90
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,400
Chief, you're almost finished, right? Would you care for a drink?

91
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,690
- I'm still not finished with my work.
- Ah, come on. Just one drink?

92
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,940
Manager ... today, what about a drink?

93
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,420
Section Chief Gong was reprimanded once before for abuse of authority because of alcohol.

94
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,330
He almost got axed then, but you covered for him and saved him.

95
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,660
That time, there was a misunderstanding.

96
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,360
Either way, those rumors are coming out and I was worried.

97
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,810
You don't need to worry. It's true he carelessly looked haggard and drawn from lack of sleep,

98
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,250
but he's not the kind of person to drink heavily.

99
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,900
I'm telling you, it's serious this time.

100
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,750
Aigoo, two team leaders! You're here early.

101
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,240
Good morning, Section Chief Gong.

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,250
Be careful before you get stabbed in the back. Watch what you do.

103
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,040
Work hard.

104
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,890
What were you talking about?

105
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,400
Chief Gong, are you still going around asking people to drink?

106
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,140
It's just a greeting, a greeting!

107
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,960
Like saying "Let's go have lunch together" - just like that.

108
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,690
Why? Did Team Leader Heo say something?

109
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,760
There's word that the construction site manager is burdened by it.

110
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,700
Hey! Don't you worry! It's not the first time we've worked together.

111
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,490
There will be no problem at all.

112
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,720
Still, be careful that word doesn't get out.

113
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,920
Always so meddlesome.

114
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,180
You're not going to work today?

115
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,500
I have the afternoon shift, how about you?

116
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,610
I'm off in the morning, I have a doctor's appointment.

117
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,400
Has it been treated?

118
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,430
Yes, the company's insurance will pay for the treatment costs.

119
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,390
That's good.

120
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,620
You... said you had a boyfriend, right?

121
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,940
Can I ask your advice on one thing?

122
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,990
Let's say you just found out an extremely important secret about your boyfriend.

123
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,140
Is it right to just let it pass as if it's not a big deal?

124
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,270
Or, is it right to have a more serious talk about that secret?

125
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,760
I can't say.

126
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,660
You've never experienced that?

127
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,560
No.

128
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,840
What do you usually talk about with your boyfriend?

129
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,220
Hasn't it already been three minutes?

130
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,380
Amongst the employees, there's someone named Lee Soo Yeon, right?

131
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,900
Wasn't your younger brother's name Lee Soo Yeon?

132
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,730
About Ahjussi... Are you going to pretend you don't know him to the end?

133
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,190
It seems like he's homeless and staying at the airport. His health doesn't look so good, either.

134
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,500
What are you trying to say?

135
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,610
About your father.

136
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,790
My father? Who says I have anything like that?

137
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,380
- Hyung—
- Call me by the proper title, Lee Soo Yeon.

138
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm not your "hyung". I am the team leader.

139
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,060
Team Leader, your father's health doesn't seem to be so good.
(formal speech)

140
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,660
Especially older people ... Once the weather gets cold, their immune systems can be weakened.

141
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,210
You should go over to him to confirm his condit—

142
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,970
Stop butting into others' business.

143
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,560
Just take care of yourself, Lee Soo Yeon.

144
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,900
Don't go around swinging at and assaulting Nam Dong Gaek.

145
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,860
Who says that? Is it the Security Team Leader?

146
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,210
Chief Jo

147
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,580
Yes, it's me.

148
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,340
This is the Passenger Services Department.

149
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,870
Just a moment, please.

150
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,530
Section Chief Gong, it's a call for you.

151
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,250
Where?

152
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,760
Yes, this is Gong Seung Cheol, of the Passenger Service Team.

153
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,340
Yes, yes.

154
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,000
And?

155
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,990
What do you mean?

156
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,990
Wh-what did I do?

157
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,790
All right, I understand.

158
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,340
I'll head over right now.

159
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,050
What's the matter, Chief?

160
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,520
Huh?

161
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,740
Nothing. There seems to be a misunderstanding.

162
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,790
Did Section Chief Gong go somewhere?

163
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,810
He just received a call and left.

164
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,820
I see.

165
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,080
What, abuse of authority? What kind of abuse of authority have I done?

166
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,960
In this day and age?

167
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,160
On the contrary, when I go out from the inside, it's with a deferential attitude.

168
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,250
Anyway, since it was reported, we have no choice but to investigate the claim.

169
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,490
If, in fact you did it, not just you,

170
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,230
your whole team could be given a penalty.

171
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,120
Ah, this is unbelievable.

172
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,380
I knew it! I even warned her and she ignored me!

173
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,170
It seems it's already gone from the audit team to internal affairs.

174
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,480
What now?

175
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,970
What if Section Chief Gong Seung Cheol ends up getting fired?

176
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,060
Do you want a drink?

177
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,450
Lee Soo Yeon,

178
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,560
who is that?

179
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,840
Section Chief Gong Seung Cheol's daughter.

180
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,450
Daughter? Oh my, what do I do?

181
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,550
Oh no!

182
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,680
Be alert, be strong, and in a tight formation.

183
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,660
- In position.
- In position!

184
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,600
There, there! Don't run.

185
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,640
Please move.

186
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,010
You can't enter here!

187
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,150
Please move!

188
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,810
Don't run. You could get hurt!

189
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,550
Hey, stop there! Don't run.

190
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,210
Everyone, seriously, please calm down! Calm down!

191
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,830
Did you finish the treatment?

192
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,840
How did you know I was here? Did you talk to my mom again?

193
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,950
I came on an errand for T2 and I saw you going in, why?

194
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,150
How's the wound?

195
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,980
They said it's healing very well.

196
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,320
Are things going well with Lee Soo Yeon?

197
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,190
Mhmm. Well...

198
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,440
- Can I ask for your advice?
- What is it?

199
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,650
The thing is ... Let's say you found out an extremely important secret about someone.

200
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,110
Is it right to pass by it as if it's no big deal?

201
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,960
Or is it right to have a more serious talk about that secret?

202
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,140
Lee Soo Yeon told you a secret?

203
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,710
I never said it was Lee Soo Yeon.

204
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,600
Even if you never said it, it's obvious it's him.

205
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,870
So, what do you want to do?

206
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm not sure.

207
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,680
Honestly, there's a lot that I'm curious about and that I want to ask him.

208
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,950
But asking the wrong things might make him uncomfortable.

209
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,170
You think he told you not expecting that?

210
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,590
That... he must've thought of that, of course.

211
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,910
Then why do you think he told you?

212
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,630
Just do whatever you want.

213
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,790
It's worse if you pretend nothing happened after something already happened.

214
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,010
Is that so?

215
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, it is.

216
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,980
Of course, I'm the person who's been praying endlessly for you and Lee Soo Yeon to break up.

217
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,850
That's the consultation for now.

218
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,970
Lee Soo Yeon

219
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,460
Ah yes, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

220
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,870
Me? I just finished the treatment and I'm going out now.

221
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,180
Yes.

222
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,890
Ah, yes. Right now?

223
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,740
Yes, yes. I can head over right away.

224
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,460
Yes, yes, yes. I got it.

225
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,960
Yes.

226
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,600
How was it? Very natural, right?

227
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,770
Extremely burdensome...

228
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,090
What the heck is "yes, yes, yes"?

229
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,770
That's for your advice. Get back safely, Go Eun Seob.

230
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,100
Does she like him that much?

231
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,100
Lee Soo Yeon...

232
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,040
You're here?

233
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,010
I'm sorry. You're busy and I called you to rush here.

234
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,450
Oh, not at all. Don't be sorry.

235
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,070
I was finished with my treatment so I planned on heading over anyway.

236
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:29,260
The hospital says I'm healing very well and the wound has almost fully healed in just two days.

237
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,510
But ... What's the matter?

238
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,340
Right now, there's a 3rd-year female middle schooler in the break room.

239
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,540
She's had some mental distress.

240
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,800
I'm not sure how to deal with it.

241
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,310
Female middle-schooler? Who is it?

242
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,760
Section Chief Gong's daughter.

243
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,930
Section Chief Gong's daughter?

244
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,090
What about my daughter? What did she do?

245
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,480
That's right, they say your daughter is here.

246
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,150
Team Leader Lee brought her here. She's in the break room right now.

247
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,130
What?!

248
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,580
Why are you doing this?

249
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,050
I said I'm going!

250
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,140
You can't go until your father gets here.

251
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,170
What's wrong with you? I'm not here to see my father.

252
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,320
So Hui, does your father know that you're not going to school and chasing idols?

253
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,920
What's it to you?

254
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,450
Whether I go to school, or whether my father knows?

255
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,010
Why are you being so nosy?

256
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,900
So annoying, seriously!

257
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,710
Gong So Hui!

258
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,430
What's wrong with you, speaking so rudely?

259
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,630
A student should be at school at this time, but what? Idol??

260
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,860
Are you skipping school and comin here because of that?

261
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,290
I'll do what I want.

262
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,720
Since when were you interested in me? It makes me so angry!

263
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,260
What?! You little punk...

264
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,170
Angry? What did you do well to get angry?!

265
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,530
Just wear what we clothe you with, eat what we feed you,

266
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,020
and study. That's all we asked of you and you can't even do that properly.

267
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,630
Who are you to get angry in this situation?!

268
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,420
You think that just by clothing me, you've done everything?

269
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,960
Just feeding me, that's all?!

270
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,640
What more do you want from me? Hakgwon (cram school) tuition, everything else. All the money that your mom and I make,

271
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,940
we're throwing all of it to you kids!

272
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,750
What more can I do for you, exactly?!

273
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,220
I said I don't want to go to cram school! You forced me to go and now what are you saying?!

274
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,790
This brat ... What right do you have to be like this?

275
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,150
Gong So Hui, are you really going to disappoint me like this?

276
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,150
Father, just do your work properly.

277
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,060
I heard you're being fired because there was a complaint against you for abusing authority.

278
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,610
What?

279
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,460
Who told you that nonsense?

280
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,430
All the employees here say so.

281
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,690
"Section Chief Gong was reported for abuse of authority? I knew it!"

282
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,510
"Isn't he going to get fired?"

283
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,970
Because you've become like that, everyone says it serves you right! Do you know that?

284
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,610
So annoying, seriously...

285
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,020
Hey, Gong So Hui! Gong So Hui!

286
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,120
Gong So Hui!

287
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,880
Han Yeo Reum, can you go follow her?

288
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,200
Yes, I will.

289
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,060
Section Chief Gong, come see me for a second.

290
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,890
Who are you?

291
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,140
I'm Han Yeo Reum of the Passenger Service Team and—

292
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,230
Forget it.

293
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,400
Han Yeo Reum, where are you right now?

294
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,950
I'm in the third floor women's bathroom by the café.

295
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,490
What about Section Chief Gong's daughter?

296
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,580
She's inside.

297
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,350
Are you all right alone?

298
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,600
Yes, well. For now...

299
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,160
If you need help, call me. I'll be nearby.

300
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,680
Han Yeo Reum...

301
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,790
Yes? I got it.

302
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,690
Thanks, Lee Soo Yeon.

303
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,270
Hyung!

304
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,110
Who is it?

305
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,060
Should we get rid of him?

306
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,750
What happened?

307
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,650
I heard you were summoned by the Audit Team.

308
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,720
I really am not on a power trip.

309
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,270
I only had the purest of intentions.

310
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,130
It's at a friendship level, Team Leader.

311
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,450
The only time I drank was the day construction began with the construction supervisor.

312
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,770
We only had a drink with our dinner.

313
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,000
As for the food bill, I personally paid for it.

314
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,750
Do you want to see the bill?

315
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,420
You may have had a drink with no ill intention,

316
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,330
but the other party could have felt pressured.

317
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,640
But ... Having a drink with people you work with ...

318
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,720
Has the world now become a place where that is an abuse of power?

319
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,070
Responsibility follows to the extent of the authority you have been given.

320
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,550
If they felt that way, then you are in the wrong.

321
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,750
Seriously...

322
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,990
I'll go explain to the internal Auditing Team.

323
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,190
Also, leave the construction site to Assistant Nam.

324
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,430
You have a cellphone, why don't you use it?

325
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,580
Oh, this is frustrating.

326
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,620
Where are you looking for?

327
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,380
I'm here for Oh Dae Gi of the Security Team.

328
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,060
Was the airport made for the exclusive use of idols?

329
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,130
Why do we have a mess every time?

330
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,010
It's because those young guys are the country's flag-bearers.

331
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,270
That's true.

332
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,860
Even when we are having a hard time, starting with BTS, they are our idols.

333
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,260
We need to take care of and protect them. They are national treasures.

334
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,270
Are you a fan of BTS?

335
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,860
Call me an "Army"*.
(the name of the BTS "fandom")

336
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,430
Are the "Armies" like those girls before?

337
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,790
What's your problem?

338
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,800
We Armies are busy campaigning and never cause trouble at airports like this.

339
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,600
BTS Armies protect each other!

340
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,860
Alright, protect each other well.

341
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,750
Go ahead.

342
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,550
♫ We will love ourselves.

343
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,940
Sunbaenim, you have visitors.

344
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,680
Visitors?

345
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,530
Dae Gi!

346
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,420
- Mom?
- My cute little boy!

347
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,780
- Grandma!
- Grandpa's here, too!

348
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,430
I'm here too, Dae Gi!

349
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,890
What brings you here without calling ahead?

350
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,480
So, this is where my grandson works.

351
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,660
Grandfather, this is the security office. Why did you suddenly....

352
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,490
These must be our Dae Gi's co-workers.

353
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,000
Hello!

354
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,320
Hello!

355
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,170
What's all the commoti— Oh! What's going on?

356
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,840
Team Leader, this is my grandpa, grandma, father and mother.

357
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,760
This is the Security Team Leader.

358
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,820
Nice to meet you! I'm Oh Dae Gi's grandpa.

359
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,670
I'm Oh Dae Gi's father.

360
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,760
I'm his grandma.

361
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,230
And I'm his mother.

362
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,160
Yes, yes. I'm Team Leader Choi Moo Ja.

363
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,630
Sorry, Team Leader. They just came suddenly without letting me know.

364
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,890
Actually, today is his birthday.

365
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,550
But he just left in a hurry without eating breakfast, saying he's busy.

366
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,270
It isn't much. But we packed some rice cakes and a few things.

367
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,700
Oh, you did?

368
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,500
Grandpa, still... coming to my workplace like this is a bit...

369
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,930
It's alright. Since they already brought the food, let's enjoy it.

370
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,490
And happy birthday!

371
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,410
Happy birthday!

372
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,340
Everyone come here and have some.

373
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,480
Yes, yes, come here.

374
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,590
Thank you!

375
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,300
I'll untie it.

376
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,420
Try this.

377
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,390
Please eat a lot.

378
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,630
