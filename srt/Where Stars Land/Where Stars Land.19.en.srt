1
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,370
Have you ever encountered any malfunction?

2
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,270
No.

3
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,910
Did you ever lose control so that it didn't move according to your will?

4
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,330
Lee Soo Yeon.

5
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,430
Lee Soo Yeon?

6
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,130
Lee Soo Yeon.

7
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,340
Lee Soo Yeon.

8
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,390
- Coffee?
- No, I'm fine.

9
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,150
But, could you tell ...

10
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,390
Actually, I have a favor to ask you.

11
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,500
What kind of favor?

12
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,550
It's about Soo Yeon.

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,290
Soo Yeon!

14
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,490
What happened?

15
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,800
He had fallen over in the parking lot and it seemed he was badly hurt.

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,180
I don't know who you are, but I'll introduce myself later.

17
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,200
- What are you talking about, Na Yeong Joo?
- Sunbae, I am asking for a change.

18
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,060
- Why?
- Because you're too difficult.

19
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,260
Carrying out my duties constantly concerns me.

20
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,940
Your and my way of thinking are too different.

21
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,280
If we think differently, you can't work together?

22
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,650
That's the way I am.

23
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,460
So, are you saying I have to form a team to suit your taste?

24
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,790
Sunbae, when you listen, does everything I say get distorted like that?

25
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,130
It's so hard I'm dying. I need to take a breath!

26
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,830
Can't you listen and hear that?

27
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,940
If you were expecting me to be understanding of you,

28
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,550
then, Na Yeong Joo, you should have discussed it with me, instead of making demands.

29
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,560
Having disagreements with seniors can happen.

30
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,290
I'll give you that that could fully happen when people think differently or disagree.

31
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,210
However, you attack without any thought of listening to another view.

32
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,470
You insist on listening only to what you say and your own opinion while you don't want to communicate.

33
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,520
And, while you are saying whatever, you want the other person just to instantly understand you.

34
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm sorry but I don't want to be so constrained.

35
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,950
Are you saying it's a matter of force?

36
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,110
Then should I call it a tantrum?

37
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,230
So? You aren't going to put me on another team?

38
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,490
No. I'm not changing anything.

39
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,010
While we wait for you to come up with a more convincing reason,

40
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,000
you and I will continue the way we are. That's all.

41
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm sorry, Yeo Reum. I won't be able to make it for our dinner plans tonight.

42
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,830
I'll call you later.

43
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,630
I would like to put right the things which went wrong with Soo Yeon.

44
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,730
I'd like to make up with him somehow. But I just don't know how to.

45
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,650
Han Yeo Reum, would you be able to help me?

46
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,700
- No!
- Master,

47
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,150
I am not your master. Even if I were your revered ancestor, this won't do.

48
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,310
I need to check if it's just a simple mechanical defect,

49
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,150
or if it's a problem with the microchip in your body.

50
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,560
Until we determine the cause, you shouldn't wear it.

51
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,970
I don't have enough time.

52
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,230
I don't have time either. I don't know if it will take a month or a year either.

53
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,620
I made a promise with the Security Team Leader.

54
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,590
He's turning a blind eye for just one month.

55
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,920
If he overlooks it for a month, will that solve anything?

56
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,410
What do you plan to do after a month?

57
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,680
I'll quit working at the airport.

58
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,900
That's what I agreed to do.

59
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:48,410
♫ Because what kept me going was always you ♫

60
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,440
♫ Because what made me laugh everyday was always you ♫

61
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,710
Should we just love?

62
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,850
Today. Now.

63
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,950
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various places ♫

64
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:14,610
♫ are making me run and taking me to you ♫

65
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,450
That today

66
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,930
♫ Is there any reason for people laughing? ♫

67
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,890
I only have a month of them left.

68
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,180
♫ They say there is without anything being funny ♫

69
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,540
Just for that one month's sake, you could lose everything.

70
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,460
That one month could be all I have.

71
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,760
♫ and, like everyone else, I too smilingly ♫

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:52,950
♫ am happy. You make me feel happy.  ♫

73
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,510
♫ Every walking, resting, and talking moment  ♫

74
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,130
During that one month,

75
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,810
I determined to leave a perfect

76
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,770
image of myself in her memory.

77
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,700
♫ If I talk to and listen to you the day swiftly passes like that ♫

78
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,970
Episode 19

79
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:30,270
< That Which I Have Now,
But Won't Later >

80
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,060
- Did all of you come from Singapore?
- Yes. Yes.

81
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,760
- Everyone, please pass your passports over to me.
- Yes.

82
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,390
Yes, thank you.

83
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,230
- Lee Sang Joon?
- Yes?

84
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,720
♫ The national physical exercise, start! ♫

85
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,700
♫ One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ♫

86
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,930
♫ Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven. ♫

87
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,800
- What are you doing so early in the morning?
- I'm doing my morning exercises.

88
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,160
Can't you do that in your own room?

89
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,560
My room is too small. Did I bother you? If so, I'll turn it off.

90
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
No, I'm already awake. Carry on.

91
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,600
Ah, your boyfriend left those for you yesterday.

92
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,500
- What? Lee Soo Yeon came by?
- Lee Soo Yeon?

93
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,800
What?

94
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,650
You said it wasn't Lee Soo Yeon.

95
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,880
About what?

96
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,140
Did you forget that you yelled at me about spreading false rumors?

97
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,450
How could you spread those rumors without even checking if they're true?

98
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,700
Even though I clearly said it was not me.

99
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,530
Wow, you're an expert at pretending not to know. Really!

100
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,940
After you attacked me like that, and still no apology...

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,450
Ah... that time, I went a bit overboard.

102
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,220
I'm sorry, but it really wasn't true then.

103
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,730
What about now?

104
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,470
Now?

105
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,270
But Na Yeong Joo, you said we shouldn't ask each other about our personal lives.

106
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,560
I also hope that you don't expect to be close simply because we live together. Or to act close and ask about personal things.

107
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,140
We're merely sharing a house,

108
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,110
We aren't trying to be friends.

109
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,160
Oh yeah, I did say that. I'm sorry for asking.

110
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,400
Yes, then...

111
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,050
Yes, then...

112
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,250
By the way, who brought the flowers and that cake?

113
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,050
That man who likes homemade beer.

114
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,550
Ah, I stopped by last night.

115
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,280
I can eat the cake, but what are the flowers for?

116
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,340
It's to set the mood. Don't you like roses?

117
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,670
No, I prefer beer over flowers.

118
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,840
More so, chicken that goes so well with beer.

119
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,430
So from now on don't spend money on me,

120
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,340
later when you find a girl you like, buy flowers for her instead.

121
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,740
Do you understand?

122
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,110
- Shall we have lunch together later?
 - No.

123
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,370
Today, Agent Lee Soo Yeon is absent from work so I think I'll be busy.

124
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,250
I see.

125
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,750
Okay then. Have a good day.

126
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,750
Have a good day too.

127
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,010
Han Yeo Reum?

128
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,500
You're Han Yeo Reum, right?!

129
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,200
Oh Min Jeong?

130
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,980
Yeo Reum, it's really nice to see you!

131
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,250
We haven't seen each other since our high school graduation, right?

132
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,900
Are you an employee of the airport? Which department?

133
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,450
I work in the Passenger Service Team.

134
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,050
Oh, girl! You have made it. Wait a minute.

135
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,950
I work at a travel agency so I'm at the airport a few days per week.

136
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,350
This is so great! Do I finally have some friends with connections?

137
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,750
No, actually should we go get some tea?

138
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,030
No. I am working now.

139
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,220
Oh yeah, you are. Let's go grab lunch then.

140
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,530
Give me your cellphone.

141
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,280
This is my phone number.

142
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,230
Go wait for me in the underground restaurant at noon.

143
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,620
I'll see you there. It's my treat, girl.

144
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,560
- Excuse me...
- See you later then.

145
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,600
I'll go now.

146
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,700
I made it in a rush but it's a portable discharger.

147
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,360
If an error like that occurs again, just place this on the battery pack on your shoulder.

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,530
So, what happens if I do that?

149
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,530
In plain terms, it's going to power off.

150
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,610
Also, the magnetic force will disappear.

151
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,290
But the movement of your devices will also be turned off.

152
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,670
My leg, too?

153
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,920
Why ask if you already know?

154
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,410
Not only your arm and leg, but there will also be considerable damage to your muscular strength.

155
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,630
So, only use it if you are in dire need.

156
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,240
Thank you, Master.

157
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,040
Wouldn't it be better if you told that girl the whole truth?

158
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,840
I'll be back.

159
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,970
That kid insisted on going over there.

160
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,040
But... I'm not sure if this is really for his own good.

161
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,980
Who knows?

162
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,760
Even up to now, I live not knowing the correct answers.

163
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,660
Don't you think so?

164
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,780
From today, I will open the doors of "Fox Bride Star" again.

165
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,460
Please come to have a drink.

166
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,390
Okay, I will.

167
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,090
Airport Limousine

168
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,980
Na Yeong Joo, look in the one o'clock direction.

169
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,080
I'm sorry but could you show me the magazine you have in your hand?

170
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,720
A thief!

171
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,610
Contact the police.

172
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,360
We're here at Gate 1 on the 3rd floor.

173
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,080
We caught a pickpocket red-handed. Please come immediately.

174
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,400
Excuse me, that is my wallet. It's mine.

175
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,280
No. You don't have to worry about it.

176
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,430
There's this girl whom I had pegged as a fool back in high school. Her name is Han Yeo Reum.

177
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,740
Well... She's part of the Passenger Service Team here.

178
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,270
I'm going to try my best to get some Fast Track passes.

179
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,110
In return, I'm in charge of those VIPs next week.

180
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,200
Okay.

181
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,480
Who would have thought I would see Han Yeo Reum here?

182
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,750
Sunbaenim.

183
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,810
Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi, where are you?

184
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,920
Oh Dae Gi is not here.

185
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,500
I said he's not here.

186
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,540
Who is it?

187
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,310
I won't tell you.

188
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,790
Team Leader Lee, are you really going to work like this?

189
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,400
Must I get calls from the PR department on these issues first thing in the morning?

190
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,180
Airport taxi fare: At Incheon Airport, illegal call vans charge double the standard rate.

191
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,870
There are illegal call vans and unfair taxi fares.

192
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,210
There are already over six complaints from foreign travelers this month!

193
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,960
What do you plan to do about this?

194
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,900
We'll do a crackdown.

195
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,460
A crackdown won't do! Nip it in the bud!

196
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,660
In a short time, Airport Service Quality evaluation will start. Do you want to get the lowest score again?

197
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,610
That happened because of complaints that parking fees are expensive.

198
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,590
So, are you saying you're satisfied with such low scores?

199
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,690
You aren't thinking of how to raise scores wherever you can.

200
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,920
I don't work at the airport to receive a score.

201
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,940
"I don't work at the airport to receive a score."

202
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,400
Team Leader Lee. You've been here too long, haven't you?

203
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,030
Lacking in discipline, mentally lax,

204
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,680
habitual dereliction of duty , that fits you to a T.

205
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,650
You just sit at your desk all the time drinking your tea!

206
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,520
What? What if you stare at me like that?

207
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,040
What are you even going to do to me? I'm the General Manager!

208
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,450
If you don't want to hear this, then just do your job properly! Understand?!

209
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,810
The General Manager seems to be a bit extreme with Team Leader Lee these days.

210
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,180
Section Chief Gong, let's do a crackdown on illegal call vans on landside.

211
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,150
Yes, I understand.

212
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,270
Assistant Nam, did you hear, right? You should go down there.

213
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,350
In the afternoon I must go to a meeting with the manager of the Sangju rest area.

214
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,420
Illegal call vans ... Shouldn't the Transportation Department be doing the crackdown?

215
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,180
The Team Leader is asking to do it.

216
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,680
Moeover, didn't the General Manager give that order just now?

217
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,500
Are not you going down?

218
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,390
I'll go down instead.

219
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,440
What? Lee Soo Yeon?

220
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
What happened? I heard you were sick.

221
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm fine now.

222
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,340
Assistant Nam, I'll go down.

223
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,810
Aigoo, you!

224
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
Are you alright?

225
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,330
That's the way General Manager Gwon is. Well, in a day or two ...

226
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,290
As far as I know, I think it's a male menopause problem.

227
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,620
As they get older, their hormones drop. And they make a big deal, getting steamed up over nothing.

228
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,630
Having affairs with young women they don't belong with.

229
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,560
I mean, I'm not saying that the General Manager had an affair.

230
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,390
I'm just saying that a lot of men in that stage do.

231
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,720
The weather is so nice today.

232
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,840
I wish I had the money to brush everything off and just go anywhere.

233
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,660
What are you talking about? You lost your radio?

234
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,170
It appears I dropped it when I was in the scuffle with the pickpocket.

235
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,160
I haven't been able to find it. I'm sorry.

236
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,960
Saying sorry isn't going to solve it.

237
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,920
What if it gets into the hands of someone who could threaten security?

238
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,960
Then when security at Incheon Airport is breached, will you accept responsibility?

239
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,960
- Hey, Seun Woo.
- Yes.

240
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,200
- Tell the security team to change the channel on their radios immediately.
- Yes.

241
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,370
Find your lost radio by today no matter what.

242
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,110
Do you understand?

243
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,950
Sunbaenim.

244
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,330
Ah, what is it? What's the matter?

245
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,730
It's about your radio. I think it's still inside the airport.

246
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,620
Look down!

247
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,800
You aren't allowed to tape those up like that, Miss.

248
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,480
Yeo Reum!

249
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,380
If you keep sticking and removing tape, it will ruin the wood. Refrain from using tape.

250
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,320
Why all of a sudden you're using polite speech?

251
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,520
Don't do that. Can you just let it go this once?

252
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,680
Our staff members are coming here in no time.

253
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,010
I can't hold all those signs by myself.

254
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,820
What are friends for?

255
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,250
I said you can't do that.

256
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,780
Okay, okay. I won't if you tell me not to.

257
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,770
Even so, girl, you don't have to make me feel bad about it.

258
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,350
And about lunch, I guess I can not eat it together with you. I have a previous appointment.

259
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,420
Is that so? Then, lets eat another day.

260
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,370
No. I'll probably have plans on other days, too.

261
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,630
Please do not contact me.

262
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,580
It's okay. You did well.

263
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,440
You really did well, Han Yeo Reum.

264
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,720
That's how it's done.

265
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,640
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

266
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,830
What are you doing? Is she someone you know?

267
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,690
She's a travel agent. But she keeps using tape, so I corrected her.

268
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,010
You're doing your job well even without me.

269
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,280
Yes, well. Because my boss is a little strict.

270
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,770
It's not that your boss is good at his job?

271
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,980
He totally does whatever he wants.

272
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,020
He makes plans for dinner and then cancels them whenever he wants.

273
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,090
And he says he'll call, but doesn't. That's how he is.

274
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,070
Hmmm. That's a bad boss.

275
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:21,180
Were you sick again?

276
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,230
Are you okay now?

277
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,320
You always manage to show up when there is work to be done.

278
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,960
Jut a while ago, Section Chief Gong ordered a crackdown on the illegal call vans.

279
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,800
As a matter of fact, I was on my way to notify the Service Support Team about it.

280
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,750
Would you like to go with me?

281
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,410
Wait a moment.

282
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,630
Wait a moment too.

283
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,530
Hello?

284
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,860
This is Lee Soo Yeon.

285
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,480
Who is the person next to you?

286
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,190
It's Go Eun Seob.

287
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,160
Yes.

288
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,160
I'd like to talk to you about yesterday. Can I see you at lunchtime?

289
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,330
I'm sorry but I have nothing to talk to you about.

290
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,090
It's okay. Let me do all the talking.

291
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,290
Then, I'll hang up.

292
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,360
By any chance, does the man next to you know?

293
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,550
About what?

294
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,390
About your secret.
