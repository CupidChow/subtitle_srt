1
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,610
♬ It is crumpled. ♬

2
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,160
♬ It is thrown and pushed ♬

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,170
♬ into a corner of a deep place in my heart.♬

4
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,770
♬ Even if I take it out♬

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,310
♬ As much as I can't even open it again♬

6
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,550
♬ It's wrinkled.♬

7
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:06,940
♬ If you smile I open up my heart more again♬

8
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,390
♬ I will show it and read it to you ♬

9
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,760
What do you want us to do on Christmas day?

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,830
Shall we go on a trip?

11
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,320
♬Well, if that doesn't work ♬

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,250
Actually, I've never been on a plane yet.

13
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,330
She is talking about our tomorrow.

14
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,810
Then, what about today?

15
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,260
Huh?

16
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,600
Rather than the future, how would you like to live today?

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,670
Shall we

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,850
just love?

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,230
Today ...

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,890
right now.

21
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:53,040
He always talks about our today.

22
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,270
I need to know how dangerous that wearable device can be to others.

23
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,050
Before that, can I start by telling you how dangerous the device

24
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,390
- is to Lee Soo Yeon right now?
- What do you mean?

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,000
Even that one month which Soo Yeon asked you to close your eyes

26
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,790
might be difficult to achieve.

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,630
Hello. I am Mister Jang, the person who assists Lee Soo Yeon.

28
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,670
But, why have you come looking for me?

29
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,300
I want to discuss him with you and also to ask you a favor.

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,400
A favor?

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,360
Soo Yeon spent nearly eleven years sitting in a wheelchair after an accident.

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,020
It's not even been a year since he is ambulating and moving as he does.

33
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,060
There is even more of his story which I don't know.

34
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,230
He has been adjusting well without any problems,

35
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,400
and has been doing his job as normally as he wanted,

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,280
but recently he started to have problems.

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,020
It keeps malfunctioning.

38
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,420
Although you might know it,

39
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,480
Soo Yeon likes you a lot.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,830
He is pure in heart and hungry for affection,

41
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,720
so I think he is being somewhat reckless without considering the consequences.

42
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,030
It may impact his body.

43
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,720
What do you mean by that?

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,460
Why would it affect his body?

45
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,550
His body is in a poor condition.

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,130
How bad is it?

47
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,420
His inflammation levels have come out higher than I thought.

48
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,150
That's the CK level.

49
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,760
The infection we are seeing is a bad sign for Soo Yeon.

50
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,070
Do you like Soo Yeon?

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,950
Yes.

52
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,930
Can you please tell him to stop?

53
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,200
How could I? How could I do that?

54
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,610
It's all right. Tell me. I can do anything. I will do anything.

55
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,730
Are you hurt somewhere?

56
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,090
Han Yeo Reum?

57
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,060
That night

58
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,110
like the fog coming in

59
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,050
we were anxious about our tomorrow.

60
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,050
We were just as uncertain

61
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,550
about our today.

62
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,190
Women, Men and Adults
- Episode 27

63
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,030
The fog is worse than we expected. How is the RVR (runway visual range— the distance a pilot on the runway can see)

64
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,660
It's not even 300 meters.

65
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,530
For now, issue a Low Visibility Category 2 notice.

66
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,210
I will issue the notice of Low Visibility Category 2.

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,370
There Is low visibility category 2.

68
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,600
Once more: there is low visibility category 2.

69
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,840
Due to thick fog on the west coast and interior parts of the country,

70
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,340
a special advisory has been issued for Incheon and Gimpo Airports.

71
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,800
Since many arriving and departing flights for Incheon Airport are currently delayed or cancelled,

72
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,030
departing passengers should confirm their flights in advance.

73
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,890
I'm sorry for being late. While driving here,

74
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,950
I couldn't even see five meters ahead.

75
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,000
My hands are still shaking.

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,220
Did you get the message from the West Port that a Low Visibility Category II was issued?

77
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,790
Yes. For now, I am assigning additional check-in counters for passengers arriving for delayed flights

78
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,290
in consultation with the airlines.

79
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,920
How is the preparation going for laying over areas for domestic passengers?

80
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,690
They will be opened in succession starting with the CS Academy for the passengers who are laying over?

81
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,350
- How much relief supplies have you secured?
- We have 2000 blankets and 5000 bottles of water.

82
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,560
We are also gathering emergency food.

83
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,570
- Team Leader Heo.
- Yes?

84
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,130
- Begin consultation over extension of the commercial facilities just in case.
- I will.

85
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,420
Team Leader Lee, it would be good to extend the schedule of the airport railway and get late buses ready.

86
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,970
Yes.

87
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,770
Right here, I remember the nightmare last Christmas.

88
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,260
Yeo Reum.

89
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,980
Han Yeo Reum.

90
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
Who is it?

91
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,290
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

92
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,970
Oh, no, Lee Soo Yeon.

93
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,290
- Is Han Yeo Reum here?
- Just a second.

94
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,310
Would you like to come in? It's a little chilly out.

95
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,430
Oy, Han Yeo Reum, wake up.

96
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,400
A little more.

97
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,550
I said wake up. Lee Soo Yeon is here.

98
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,530
Hmmm?

99
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,200
Han Yeo Reum, I'm here.

100
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,000
What happened?

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,300
- I think you two over-indulged yesterday.
- What?

102
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,240
Yes, well, I think the two of us solidified our friendship with so-maek (soju and beer).

103
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,780
Did she say friendship? Us two?

104
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,320
The night before

105
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,800
Is life supposed to be like this?

106
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,940
How can there be nothing easy?

107
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,700
Did you not know? Life is like that.

108
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,650
Why are you like that again?

109
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,330
Miss Na Yeong Joo.

110
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,260
Hey, what's with the Miss Na Yeong Joo?

111
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,070
Hey, just call me Yeong Joo. Cut the formalities. Cut it!

112
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,930
Yeong Joo!

113
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,530
MIss Na Yeong Joo, did we yesterday ...

114
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,570
What? As I said, yesterday, we agreed to speak informally. Is the memory garbled?

115
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,440
- Ah, more than being garbled ...
- It's garbled and you have forgotten.

116
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,870
It's not coming out of my short term memory.

117
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,150
Was it cut out in parts?

118
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,790
I think it's all because of Lee Soo Yeon.

119
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,930
What?

120
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,120
- She talked the most about you while drinking yesterday.
- I did?

121
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,340
Agent Lee Soo Yeon. Lee Soo Yeon.

122
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,800
My Lee Soo Yeon. I love you, Lee Soo Yeon.

123
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,210
Even if you said Gi Seung Jeon, it was Lee Soo Yeon.

124
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,940
Even if you were talking about something else, you made a U turn to Lee Soo Yeon.

125
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,560
Talking about one thing and talking more and more.

126
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,500
Is that so? If you have something to say, why didn't you say it to me?

127
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,980
Oh, that's not so. It's because I was just really drunk.

128
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,560
Oh, I'm nauseous. Shall we have some hangover soup before work?

129
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,840
Been sprout type or other greens?

130
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,070
There isn't time for that.

131
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,060
Didn't you receive the emergency notice?

132
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,680
Emergency notice?

133
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,540
It's yours.

134
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,590
Low visibility special condition?

135
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,250
Lee Soo Yeon, wait a while. It will be just five minutes.

136
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,470
Jeez.

137
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,090
Dad. As if I had never gotten lost once ...

138
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,710
please help.

139
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,680
I've finished getting ready. Shall we go now?

140
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,560
How is the current situation?

141
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,700
- It's foggy and we can't start.
- What time do you think we will leave?

142
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,230
We're doing our best. We ask for your understanding.

143
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,900
- Did you all just get here?
- Yes, Deputy Oh.

144
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,240
I came as soon as I heard the forecast. I think the fog is going to continue to roll in all morning.

145
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,170
What shall we do? Don't tell me it's going to be like last Christmas' nightmare?

146
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,660
Did that happen last year?

147
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,080
Yes. The fog trapped us during Christmas for several days.

148
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,300
Because of the delays, one after the other, we weren't able to go home for nearly a week.

149
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,380
Yes, yes. For now, please match the quantity of 200 boxes.

150
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,010
Yes, I will.

151
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,920
Section Chief Gong, Assistants Nam, Kim and Choi, go airside.

152
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,140
We have passengers waiting who were scheduled to depart over four hours ago.

153
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,850
In consultation with the airlines, escort them to the layover area.

154
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,380
Yes, I understand. Everybody, let's go.

155
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,840
What? The gas isn't flowing to the shops?

156
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,710
Imagine this! Gas is not flowing both airside and landside for food and beverage services!

157
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,300
Is is Incheon City? This is Incheon Airport.

158
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,830
Lee Soo Yeon. Take Han Yeo Reum with you to a neighboring supermarket.

159
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,150
Buy as much substitute emergency food as possible, including cup noodles.

160
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,020
- Yes, we will.
- Yes.

161
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,210
What the heck is all this panic?

162
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,760
Let's go, Assistant Song.

163
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,170
What kind of person is Team Leader Seo In Woo?

164
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,090
Team Leader Seo?

165
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,800
Yes.

166
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,230
You've been here watching him from the sidelines. What kind of person is he?

167
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,720
He has a good mind but lacks humanity.

168
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,080
His work is meticulous and flawless, but he doesn't look like he likes doing it.

169
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,850
In one word, he sucks. But why are you asking?

170
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,270
It turns out that he was a scholarship student.

171
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,890
One of Chairman Sin's kids. I wondered if you knew that he was.

172
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,620
Are you sure?

173
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,340
He was escorting General Manager Gwon Hee Seung to Seoul for a meeting with the new president.

174
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,980
- Good morning.
- What are you doing here?
- What?

175
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,300
Gosh, that's some kind of fog that you can't see an inch in front of you.

176
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,620
It's really busy here, right? Did you eat breakfast?

177
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,480
Why? What's the problem again?

178
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,070
What's happening is because of the fog alert.

179
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,330
Gosh, the next few days are going to be busy, right?

180
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,530
Make sure you eat.

181
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,090
I'm going.

182
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,620
I'm going to ride in a car again driven by Lee Soo Yeon.

183
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,940
But ... are you feeling sick somewhere?

184
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,910
You seem to have a fever.

185
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,440
I do?

186
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,480
Look, this is a real fever.

187
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,280
Your forehead is a lot warmer than mine. Have you got a cold?

188
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,040
- It's not a cold.
- If it's not a cold, why do you have a fever?

189
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,670
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

190
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,250
It's not because of my arm. I think it's because of you.

191
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,270
Why me?

192
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,510
As you said, only the two of us are in the car.

193
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,810
Can't you tell I'm worried about you?

194
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,220
It means that it's not an issue to the degree that I have to go to the hospital.

195
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,720
Soo Yeon right now is in very bad shape.

196
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,430
I am alright, really. Let's go now.

197
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,110
All right.

198
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,290
No. Because of Chief Jo, It's now an emergency Operation Contingency Procedure situation

199
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,150
in which all departing flights are on hold

200
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,090
and the gates are all occupied by aircraft which arrived.

201
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,440
It's a serious problem. It's time now to take off or to land now.

202
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,050
How many are in the air right now?

203
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:12,110
There are nine now. In the next two hours, twenty more are scheduled to arrive.

204
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,630
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

205
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,810
Our landing has been delayed now due to heavy fog.

206
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,650
We are preparing for a safe landing,

207
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,790
so please be patient and wait a moment. 
- Our landing has been delayed.

208
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,780
We ask for your kind understanding.

209
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,910
When are we going to arrive home?

210
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,820
- Aren't we there yet? I want to go home.
- We'll be getting off in a little while.

211
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,520
Song Ye Jin.

212
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,050
Can you please check the condition of the passenger sitting in 34C?

213
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,560
Passenger, are you not feeling well?

214
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,340
Passenger, passenger!

215
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,950
- Passenger.
- Passenger
- Passenger.

216
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,060
- Wake up, Passenger!

217
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,310
- Passenger!

218
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,530
See if there is a doctor among the passengers.

219
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,230
Get the AED ready. (AED: automated external defibrillator. Checks heart rhythm and can shock the heart)

220
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,620
One two three four, one two three four.

221
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,070
One two three four.

222
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,670
One two three four. One

223
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,280
two three four.

224
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,830
One two ...

225
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,850
Seoul approach KR098.

226
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,550
Mayday, Mayday.Mayday.

227
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,640
We have a medical emergency on board.

228
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,310
Request landing to Incheon Airport and request medical assistance at the gate.

229
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,700
KR 098 Roger. Do you need priority for landing?

230
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,110
Affirm. KR 098.

231
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,740
Team Leader. It's the control tower. It's an emergency situation.

232
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,750
Yes, it's Park Tae Hui.

233
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,480
KR098 has an emergency patient. Please assign an emergency gate.

234
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,370
He'll be landing in five minutes.

235
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,360
Five minutes? That's a headache.

236
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,780
For now we don't have an emergency gate. I'm going to forward this to IOC.

237
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,200
I'll check the apron.

238
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,830
Look here, Go Eun Seob. Give it a try.

239
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,630
- What?
- In how many minutes do you think you can empty

240
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,000
in the fastest way the most accessible gate airside for an ambulance crew now?

241
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,810
3 seconds, 2 seconds, 1 second ...

242
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,140
Gate 234.

243
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,780
Seta Airlines Flight 1092 just completed unloading.

244
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,880
It can be moved quickly to ramp 351 on the remote apron.

245
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,920
Two, three, four ...

246
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,290
What are you waiting for? Hurry and dial and don't leave anything out.

247
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,840
Yes.

248
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,420
It's the ramp station.

249
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,790
There's an emergency patient on KR 098 and we need to clear a gate immediately.

250
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,790
Can you remove 1092 and take it to 351 on the remote apron?

251
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,980
Right now? We can't.

252
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,860
We just finished. We need to get passengers quickly aboard.

253
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,820
Isn't there some way around that? This is an emergency.

254
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,720
We have a situation too.

255
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,110
We should also be departing. We don't even have a lot of passengers.

256
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,320
In any case, you know you can't leave now, because of the order of taking on passengers.

257
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,480
Isn't if first come, first served?

258
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,460
I know that too. This is an official emergency request from the tower.

259
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,980
The plane has just arrived and cannot land at the gate on the remote apron.

260
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,410
One two three four. One two three four.

261
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,760
Passenger, are you awake?

262
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,680
The is a OCP. (Operation Contingency Procedure) Are you personally in control?

263
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,480
Please cooperate with emergency procedures.

264
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,800
Even if planes are delayed, the life of a person cannot be re-scheduled. You know that.

265
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,590
All right.

266
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,920
We will remove it right now.

267
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,390
Thank you for your cooperation.

268
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,110
KR 098 has been assigned to Gate 234

269
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,770
Yes. A standby order will be issued.

270
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,750
Good.

271
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,010
Good job.

272
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,940
I'm sorry. There has been an unexpected situation at the airport, so you'll have to wait a bit more.

273
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm sorry for the delay.

274
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,960
- There is going to be a change in the boarding gate.
- Yes.

275
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,740
Please make sure to notify all the passengers about it.

276
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,160
KR098 has been assigned to Gate 234

277
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,780
Okay, let's go.

278
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:22,080
KR098, taxi to gate 234 via 311 then Romeo Charlie. Number 1.

279
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:29,800
KR098, taxi to gate 234 via 311 then Romeo Charlie. Number 1. KR 098.

280
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,490
You did a great job of first aid.

281
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,030
What's the matter? Are you sick?

282
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,910
I'm sorry. I think it's because I drank too much last night.

283
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,630
Alcohol? Who did you drink with?

284
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,750
Why are you asking?

285
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,330
Huh?

286
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,860
Oh, just because you were drinking so much with someone.

287
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,150
If you're tired, go upstairs and take a break. I'll ask Sun Woo to change.

288
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,780
No. I'm fine.

289
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,020
You don't look fine. Your face is very pale.

290
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,730
If I'm really tired, I'll tell you.

291
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,700
Please don't be concerned.

292
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,270
Am I concerned?

293
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,780
I am always concerned about you.

294
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,610
A male has fallen near Exit 1 on the west wing. Security Teams nearby please come.

295
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,760
Aren't you going?

296
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,950
Security Team 3 is responding now.

297
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,280
Besides whatever there is in the store,

298
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,560
I would appreciate your sending whatever is in the warehouse too.

299
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,230
I'll check the quantity first,

300
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,830
and I will arrange to send you the maximum soon.

301
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,790
Thank you.

302
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,540
I'll do it.

303
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,280
It's alright. Cup noodles are not heavy.

304
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,230
I'll do it. You can take a break.

305
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,790
You have a fever now.

306
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,320
Because you're sick, you're angry, but I'm not letting a sick person work.

307
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,960
I'm fine. I can at least ...

308
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,690
Did I say this was fine? This is light.

309
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,770
There you go!

310
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,030
I said I will do it.

311
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,460
If you keep pushing me like this, I'm really going to get angry.

312
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,620
Han Yeo Reum, give it to me. Let me push it.

313
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,240
Never mind. I can do it.

314
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,670
There.

315
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,530
See? It was easy.

316
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,160
Let's go.

317
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,700
Excuse me, please step aside.

318
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,390
- Doctor, what's the situation?
- It seems to be one of the homeless people who stay at the airport.

319
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,720
His condition is very poor.

320
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,690
How long since he fainted?

321
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,890
He was already unconscious when I found him. As soon as I found him, I called for help.

322
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,980
Thank you, Doctor.

323
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,040
- Call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

324
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,220
Sir?

325
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,780
We have an emergency patient in front of Gate 1 on the 3rd floor. Please send an ambulance.

326
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,760
Sir, are you all right, sir?

327
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,960
Sir? Sir.

328
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,920
