1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,380
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,170
Final Episode

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,460
What is it?

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,480
A resignation letter.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,830
Mister Jang was thinking of taking you to the US.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,330
Perhaps, did you decide to go?

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,590
Even if I go there,

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,230
the chance of my getting better is very slim.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,920
So, what is this resignation?

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,520
I'm just...

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,010
giving it to you in advance.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,600
One day, all of a sudden...

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,100
I think I might become unable to emerge from it.

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,210
If that happens, please accept it.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,830
Oh, Lee Soo Yeon! You've been here.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,490
I need you to go to the immigration area because all of sudden the passengers are piling up. Hurry!

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,040
What is it, Team Leader?

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,080
Lee Soo Yeon gave it to me a while ago.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,970
The moment in which the vague uneasiness becomes reality ...

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,450
Did you not know about Lee Soo Yeon's decision?

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,220
No.

22
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,940
I just assumed.

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,340
But to the extent of resigning ...

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,070
What should I do?

25
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,470
What do I do now, Team Leader?

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,790
That person...

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,030
I may not see him anymore.

28
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,880
Customer, please go to the booth 17.

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,010
Huh? The Chief is going to a booth today too.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,690
It seems Jeong Hyeon Joo is absent again today because of her baby.

31
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,840
Even so, I think today, the day is a little ...

32
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,260
What is it? What day is today for the Section Chief?

33
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,350
Actually, today is Section Chief Lee Gi Baek's last day before retirement.

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Could you please take off your glasses?

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,850
What's the matter?

36
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,730
I heard that you're retiring today.

37
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,720
I wanted to wish you farewell.

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,840
What's the big deal about retirement?

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,300
It passes just like all the other days ...

40
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,530
We are not much different from those passengers.

41
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,230
Just like those people who go past this airport and go somewhere else,

42
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,090
We also are going to stay just for a while.

43
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,440
There isn't anything special in a day which has the same meaning.

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,060
♫ Someday in your life ♫

45
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,260
Thank you for your effort all this time.

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,140
Thank you. I'll accept your farewell.

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,230
♫ take me to my way  ♫

48
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,040
♫ So lay down just for one night ♫

49
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,290
♫ So I will never lose you in my eyes ♫

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,420
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

51
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,470
Where are you now?

52
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,050
♫ Or see the way of life ♫

53
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:19,510
♫ Every time I look at myself in the eyes ♫

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:28,020
♫ Sometimes when I see it I’m lost in my own eyes ♫

55
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,600
What's the matter?

56
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,450
Did you turn in your resignation letter?

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,550
Yes.

58
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,270
Why?

59
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,390
I think it will be better.

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
Can't you just...

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,620
stay by my side?

62
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,670
I'll...

63
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll become your arm and leg.

64
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,890
The reality is much harder and heavier than you think.

65
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,300
I can do it.

66
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,760
Let me do it.

67
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Then, when you face such a reality, you will become exhausted.

68
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,640
Now take off the wearable device

69
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,490
and accept treatment, please.

70
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,790
Okay?

71
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,580
I don't want to take you all the way there.

72
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,690
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various places ♫

73
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,320
Please, do not leave me alone!

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,090
♫ are making me run and taking me to you ♫

75
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,520
Without you,

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,740
I can't go on.

77
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,530
♫ Is there any reason for people laughing? ♫

78
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,840
Just...

79
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,250
Let me pass by, Yeo Reum.

80
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,600
♫ They say there is without anything being funny ♫

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,370
To you, I'm...

82
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,630
just someone who passes by.

83
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,590
No, you can't. I don't want to.

84
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,340
Do not say that.

85
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,990
♫ I am happy.  ♫

86
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,200
Let's do that. Shall we?

87
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,590
♫ You make me feel happy.  ♫

88
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,830
♫ Running while watching the clock, ♫

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,100
I can not do that.

90
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,970
I don't think I can do it.

91
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:01,620
♫ The moment is so happy that I shed tears ♫

92
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,310
♫ I whom you made look forward ♫

93
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,960
♫ will give everything ♫

94
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,600
To you, I must be someone just passing by.

95
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
♫ After I follow you ♫

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,110
Your time which was made beautiful and glorious.

97
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,960
That summer ... whom I loved so much

98
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,900
Just remember that I was there.

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,570
♫ I think every moment I walk rest and speak ♫

100
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,930
If I can live in your memory...

101
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,470
that's enough for me.

102
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,600
♫ is a moment which is more than just your coming to me. ♫

103
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,230
Resignation letter

104
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,760
Whose is that?

105
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,500
Soo Yeon's.

106
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,650
I thought I'd become a better adult.

107
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,940
But that's how I am letting a junior go and sending him away.

108
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,330
Ultimately, I couldn't protect Lee Soo Yeon.

109
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,920
When it is an affliction which is thrown at us, we struggle and are defeated.

110
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,770
Why, when kids learn this, do they give up, clear everything away,

111
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,830
and cut off relations with the world?

112
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,830
Damn.

113
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,080
It really sucks.

114
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,820
Today, Lee Soo Yeon will be treating us! He will do the pouring!

115
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,490
Here, here. Let's celebrate lightly at first with beer down our throats.

116
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,300
Here.

117
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,430
Cheers!

118
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,030
Cheers!

119
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,100
By the way... Oh Dae Gi and Na Yeong Joo, when did you become a couple?

120
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,740
What do you mean? A couple?

121
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,840
You aren't? Heol. I was completely sure you were dating.

122
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,040
I'm telling you we aren't! Watch what you say!

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,270
But ... do we really look like a couple?

124
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,780
No. To the contrary, it was a shock.

125
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,570
- Sunbaenim.
- I'm just curious.

126
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,110
I was curious. I didn't mean anything else. Let's drink.

127
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,520
Here, here, here, one glass for each person.

128
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,560
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

129
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,650
What, toast to me too. Let's do it together. Cheers!

130
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

131
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,660
- Horse number one.
- Horse number two.

132
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,100
- Horse number three.
- Horse number four.
- Horse number five.

133
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,500
- One attacks five.
- Five attacks.1.

134
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,130
- Horse number 1 attacks 4
- Number 4 attacks 3.

135
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,560
You got caught.

136
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,470
Go Eun Seob.

137
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,410
Drink! Drink! Drink!

138
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,900
- One shot! One Shot!
- Wow!

139
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,580
- One
- Two
- Three
- Four.

140
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,750
Na Yeong Joo! Black Knight! (i.e., someone who will drink the penalty shot for her)

141
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,270
- Black Knight! Black Knight!
- No, no, no, I'll drink it.

142
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,960
- No, I think it will make you drunk.
- No, I said I'll do it.

143
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,520
Oh, Na Yeong Joo!

144
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,900
That's enough.

145
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,240
- I'm fine. One!
- Two!

146
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,940
- Three!
- Four!

147
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,630
Hey, hey. Na Yeong Joo, are you really okay?

148
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,420
Oh, seriously. What do you take me for?

149
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,930
It's because the drink was a little strong.

150
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,030
I am perfectly fine.

151
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,270
Hey, hey. Sit here for a while. There, there.

152
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,630
Anyway. Well. I thought you were a heavy drinker but it was all a sham, huh?

153
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,390
There ... did you catch on again?

154
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,210
Yes kid, I've caught onto everything.

155
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,510
Your boyfriend and your being able to handle strong drinks, too, you pretending to be strong ... I've caught on to everything.

156
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,290
Is that right?

157
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,500
Why have I been caught for everything by you?

158
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,610
Up to now, there is no one who caught onto me.

159
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,730
Is that so? So what?

160
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,450
Well, I mean ... Anyway, I've been caught.

161
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,780
Could you catch on to a little more and then go?

162
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,870
Huh? What?

163
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,560
Do you want to stay together tonight?

164
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,220
I'm saying I want to be together with you. Lee Soo Yeon.

165
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,090
Can't I?

166
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,290
Can't you?

167
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,420
Yeo Reum. As for me ...

168
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,970
Do you want to? Huh?

169
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,020
Huh?

170
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,750
Yeo Reum, let me tell you about a dream I had.

171
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,890
♫  Someone's appearance can make my today a day ♫

172
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,130
- This one.
- This one?

173
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,600
♬  which is entirely painful ♬

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,130
Oh, it's going to be so pretty.

175
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,800
♬  Someone's laughter ♬

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,700
- Here!.
- Right.

177
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Look at this.

178
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,840
- Oh, here.
- I really want to go there.

179
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,750
♫ can make my whole heart happy ♫

180
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:30,170
♬ Just the heavy burden you carry  ♬

181
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:36,180
♬  I am happy I can share it with you ♬

182
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,400
Do it, do it!

183
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,700
♬  Speaking and listening with our whole hearts ♬
 Shoot! Shoot!

184
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:51,110
♬  All those times are precious ♬

185
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:58,400
♬ I want you to say it's okay, it's okay  ♬

186
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,330
♫ Your very existence as you are now is precious  ♫

187
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,390
I dreamt of waking up next to you every morning.

188
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:13,650
♫ Sitting next to you and speaking in a soft voice  ♫

189
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:21,460
♬ I am saying that's enough. I am saying that's enough..  ♬

190
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:44,560
♬  Because you hold and hug me, ♬

191
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,910
♬  I can think about tomorrow again ♬

192
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,220
♬ Because of you  ♬

193
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,880
♫ It's crumpled ♫

194
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,470
♫ It's been thrown and pushed ♫

195
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,410
♫ Into a corner of a deep place in my heart. ♫

196
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,520
♫ Even if I take it out ♫

197
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,050
Please live.

198
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,840
♫ As much as I can't open it again ♫

199
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,600
Although it's hard, for my sake, once more again ...

200
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,800
♫ It's wrinkled. ♫
please live for me.

201
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,290
♫  If you smile, my heart will be uplifted again  ♫

202
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,730
I... I will wait for you.

203
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,060
♫ I will show it and read it to you ♫

204
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,220
Okay?

205
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,770
♫ More deeper than ever ♫

206
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,800
♫ Well, if that doesn't work ♫

207
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:54,350
♫ I want to go down and read ♫

208
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,780
♫ the feelings which I wrote to you ♫

209
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,140
♫ whom I like so much I could die ♫

210
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,270
♫ If I do that, won't  ♫

211
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,580
♫ everything change? ♫

212
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,740
♫ I dreamed that for a while. ♫

213
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,330
She's my daughter. She's pretty, right?

214
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,590
She doesn't look like you.

215
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,060
Doesn't look like me? Look! Here are two eyes.

216
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,610
What about her nose, eh? And her lips?

217
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,450
Because she doesn't resemble me, she's pretty.

218
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,010
Ah, you've come.

219
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,990
Soo Yeon, he's here.

220
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,370
Say hello. He's Professor Jang Won Sik.

221
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,700
I've heard a lot from the restaurant owner. You are Lee Soo Yeon, I see.

222
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,960
There are no coincidences in life.

223
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Everything that happens in life has a reason.

224
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,290
One year later

225
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,900
Elders, may I help you?

226
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,800
They sell lunch boxes here, but what kind of lunchbox is this?

227
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,940
Ah, this is the place which rents mobile wi-fi hotspots.

228
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,840
Nowadays it is almost a necessity on a trip.

229
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,830
It is easy to carry.

230
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,260
Then shall we rent one?

231
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,100
Would you like to do that? Manager?

232
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,860
Elders, are you taking a trip?

233
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,980
You haven't made a reservation yet, have you?

234
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,210
What's with a reservation?

235
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,360
Manager.

236
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,020
Just a moment. Three or four people can use one of these. I'll look for an extra one.

237
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,760
Oh Dae Gi!

238
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,110
You're Oh Dae Gi, right?

239
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,010
Who are you?

240
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,360
It's me, me! Hye Min!

241
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,470
Song Hye Min?

242
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,080
Your face changed a lot.

243
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,820
Yes. I've had some touch-ups done.

244
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,470
But ... you work here?

245
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,400
Yeah, well...

246
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,790
- You're married?
- Not yet.

247
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,600
Hey. You've become so handsome. Do you have a girlfriend?

248
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,280
It's not official yet.

249
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm still single, too.

250
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,820
If you have some spare time, should we meet up?

251
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,450
He has a girlfriend.

252
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,300
What?

253
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,140
I'm telling you Sunbae Oh Dae Gi already has a girl that he likes.

254
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,680
Missing child alert. Missing child alert.

255
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,210
Seven-year-old boy wearing a blue parka.

256
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,390
Sunbaenim, we have a missing child. Shouldn't we get going?

257
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
What's with her?

258
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,530
Enjoy your trip.

259
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,030
- Na Yeong Joo! Let's go together!
- Hey!

260
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,690
Are you alright?

261
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,360
Mommy!

262
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,440
- You lost your mom?
- Yes.

263
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,380
I found a crying child on the east side by a bathroom.

264
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,870
Well, shall we start?

265
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,860
General Manager Yang Seo Goon

266
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,110
Omo, General Manager Yang Seo Goon is here.

267
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,960
Actually, I was cleaning your seat until you got here.

268
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,190
Does the seat look that good?

269
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,730
Is looking good all there is? I envy you.

270
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,080
Should we start the meeting?

271
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,940
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

272
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,160
There hasn't been a single time you came early to a meeting, Team Leader.

273
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,850
It was because of a missing child. A missing child.

274
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,130
So, has the missing child been found?

275
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,980
Yes, fortunately thanks to an airline stewardess.

276
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,070
I've been running since this morning, so I'm starving to death.

277
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,570
I can eat this, right? Let's all eat!

278
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,510
Oh, Jae Won.

279
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,400
Where did you go?

280
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,330
Thank you.

281
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,090
No problem.

282
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,380
Then, have a nice trip.

283
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,490
Thank you. Thank you.

284
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,730
Thank you.

285
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,040
It's already been almost a year since that person left.

286
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,740
Closed

287
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Fox Bride Star

288
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,610
Still no contact?

289
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,690
No, there are no calls.

290
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,970
Did you hear any news from anyone?

291
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,580
None.

292
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,130
How can people do that? SNS and internet work like that around the world.

293
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,010
Why on earth wouldn't he tell you some news? In a world where you can't not communicate?

294
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,990
There hasn't been news for a year. Isn't that a bit much?

295
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,030
Although I'm sure Lee Soo Yeon has his own reasons, too.

296
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,330
Have a safe trip.

297
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,610
I hear the Middle East is a little dangerous. Be careful of flying bullets.

298
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,390
Are you sending me off with a hook in one fell swoop by saying that?

299
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,140
Don't work for ten days. Just do your consulting and come back.

300
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,660
I mean it, Yeo Reum.

301
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,130
As for me

302
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,230
I think I'm probably going to be next to you.

303
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,350
Whether it is as a friend or whatever else role I take.

304
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,950
Whatever way you want it, I'll continue.

305
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,950
Probably that's what I'll do.

306
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,580
Is that so?

307
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
It is.

308
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,090
Come back safely.

309
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,350
You stay safe too.

310
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,550
It's the first time I've seen this.

311
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,610
I've never seen anything like this my entire life.

312
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,570
He was so strong.

313
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,700
How could this have happened?

314
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,710
Why are you like this? Did something happen?

315
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,280
Gosh. Someone broke a stanchion.

316
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,800
What? A stanchion?

317
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,580
Who did this?

318
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,100
A short time ago, a drunk Russian Mafia guy with wild eyes

319
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,930
tossed his bottle away and was screaming

320
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,100
while swinging a stanchion.

321
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,900
Suddenly a young man appeared and ripped it out of his arms. Bam!

322
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,500
Could it have been Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

323
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,300

Where did that person go? Huh?

He had just gotten off the plane so he was going through immigration.

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,630
♫ Always in my mind ♫

336
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:23,190
♫ the same memory which is a question mark ♫

337
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,610
♫ the day in front of me ♫

338
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:32,350
♫  the day which was like an unfolding movie ♫

339
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:38,530
♫ Oooh my whole body feels throbbing ♫

340
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:45,350
♫ I couldn't emit a sound ♫

341
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:51,000
Today too, in this place where so many stars pass and pass again ...

342
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,790
♫ It must be you; my heart must know it's only you ♫

343
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,400
He's been brought back by the Fox Star Bride.

344
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,560
♫ The feeling of just you which is as familiar  ♫

345
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,930
♫ as the smell of the rain on a windy day ♫

346
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,780
Fox Bride Star

347
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,660
♫ It must be you ♫

348
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,340
♫ It really must be you ♫

349
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,830
Close

350
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,160
♫ Somewhere in your heart ♫

351
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,410
Open

352
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:27,720
♫ If you say it's something you can't feel ♫

353
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:36,700
♫ I will bottle up all of my feelings ♫

354
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,890
♫ Oooh can you feel it here and now? ♫

355
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,580
♫ This... ♫

356
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,900
♫ The many surprising things which were said to me ♫

357
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,900
♫ Now I will give them to you too ♫

358
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,160
♫ It must be you, my heart must know it's you ♫

359
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,830
♫ I talk and make endless gestures ♫

360
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:07,020
♫ The feeling of just you which is as familiar  ♫

361
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,290
♫ as the smell of the rain on a windy day ♫

362
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,060
♫ It must be you ♫

363
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,510
♫ Even If I both can cover ♫
