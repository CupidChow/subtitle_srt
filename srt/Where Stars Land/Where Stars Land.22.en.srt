00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,900
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,950
Episode 22

3
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,040
Don't you think so?

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,970
Does this make any sense? It's not just someone, it's Team Leader Lee.

5
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,480
What's going on with Team Leader Lee?

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,630
Nothing that I would know, Han Yeo Reum.

7
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,890
Look, Team Leader Yang, shouldn't you go yourself and tell him about it?

8
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,570
- What?
- You need to confirm what is going on.

9
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,690
Do you have to confirm if it's true?

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,640
Even if everyone else is like that, Team Leader Lee is not that kind of person.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,690
They say that the money envelope he got from those guys is still in his pocket.

12
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,800
The money envelope?

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,730
- Who is it that received the money envelope?
- No, it's nothing.

14
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,890
Team Leader Heo, you tell me who it is.

15
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,540
Oh, my gosh! What to do now...

16
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,370
Team Leader Heo.

17
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,850
Yes.

18
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,950
- Actually, the thing is, General Manager—
- Team Leader Heo.

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,290
I didn't mean to talk about it.

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,620
Team Leader Heo!

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,720
Yes, yes, yes. General Manager Gwon.

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,740
You called me?

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,540
What are you doing in front of me now? Are you joking?

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,170
Joking, you say? It's definitely not like that.

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,430
I don't think you need to concern yourself with ridiculous rumors, Director.

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,180
Who is it that Yang Seo Goon is protecting them?

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,250
- Is it someone from the Passenger Service Team?
- No.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,550
- Is it someone from the Commercial Facilities Team?
- Oh, no!

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,490
Our team is upright and squeeky clean at the highest level, totally.

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,000
If it's not this side or that side, then who is it? Is it Team Leader Lee Woo Taek?

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,100
It was Lee Woo Taek?

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,860
Director Gwon!

33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,610
What should we do? What should we do?

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,700
Ah, yes.

35
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,340
Yes, I'll take care of it quickly.

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,180
What's wrong?

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,700
Let's meet at my office for a while. Now, immediately!

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,270
Team Leader, do you want to quit?

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,180
During my career, there were many moments when I wanted to quit.

40
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,320
If you're going to be on the take, you should do it discreetly.

41
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,130
Did you accept a money envelope in the middle of the taxi stand with many people watching?

42
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,240
Ah, you mean that? They gave it to me in the envelope, so I took it in the envelope.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Is anything wrong with that?

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,180
Do you have two lives?

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,890
Ah! Or was it sufficient enough for you not to care if you got caught?

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,540
Not that many times, but I did receive it about twice.

47
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,590
You... you're doing this to screw me over, aren't you?

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,940
If there is a report of you accepting a bribe, it's not only you who will be devoured!

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,920
Because the devouring will extend to me, the general manager.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,070
You are doing this on purpose, right?

51
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,880
Before things get more complicated, you take care of it, Team Leader Lee.

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,090
What is it that you want me to take care of?

53
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,040
Are you really going to play dumb until the end?

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,220
Do you need to be disgraced in front of all the employees?

55
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,440
How are you going to disgrace me?

56
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,170
Why are they doing that?

57
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,310
Team Leader Lee was seen receiving an envelope from those illegal call vans guys at the taxi stand.

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,850
An envelope?

59
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,550
That's right. An envelope.

60
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,460
Ah, that...

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,420
Twenty years of friendship...

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,030
just ended right here, Lee Woo Taek.

63
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,360
Han Yeo Reum, do you know about that envelope?

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,510
Yes, I do.

65
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,700
What is it?
- Goguma. (Sweet Potato)

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,560
Gogu-, Goguma?!

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,320
Manager Park's mother sends corn in the summer and sweet potatoes in the winter.

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,330
She keeps sending them, so I've gotten some as well.

69
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,690
Roasted sweet potatoes aren't considered as money or valuables in our country, are they?

70
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,810
It's just the sentiment.

71
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,620
Do you want one?

72
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,930
Looks delicious. Goguma.

73
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,970
Do you like Han Yeo Reum a lot?

74
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,390
Yes, a lot.

75
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,820
Then don't leave any regrets.

76
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,990
Time is something which does not always return.

77
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,200
If it's not that exact moment or that time,

78
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,090
there is the kind of fate where you are never meant to meet.

79
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,930
See you tomorrow. I'll leave!

80
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,330
See you tomorrow.

81
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,420
Then, I'm leaving.

82
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,600
Na Yeong Joo, there's going to be a work dinner. You're not going to go with us?

83
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,660
Yes, I don't think I'll go.

84
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,020
Why? Do you have a date?

85
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes, well...

86
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,070
I'll take my leave.

87
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,040
Na Yeong Joo has a date.

88
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay then, let's quickly get changed and leave. What should we eat?

89
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,190
Oh my goodness. My body is stiff.

90
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,260
When did you come?

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,840
Just now.

92
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,190
You're late. Quitting time was a while ago.

93
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,390
Han Yeo Reum, why have not you left yet?

94
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,090
I've been waiting for you, Lee Soo Yeon.

95
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,790
By chance, if you don't have any plans, would you like to eat dinner with me?

96
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,460
I've been researching good restaurants while I was waiting for you.

97
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,840
Do you happen to like spicy foods? I totally like strong flavors.

98
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,510
What to do? I have to go home early today.

99
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,760
Yes.

100
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,140
- Excuse me.
- How long do you think it will take?

101
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,120
What?

102
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,840
Earlier, you asked me for some time.

103
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,630
For how long should I wait?

104
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,430
Do you like that woman a lot?

105
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,150
Yes, a lot.

106
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,120
Then don't leave any regrets.

107
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,060
Understand?

108
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,080
Excuse me...

109
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,830
What are you waiting for?

110
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,400
He said he has to go home early.

111
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,860
If the woman asks him out first and even researches restaurants ...

112
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,330
You shouldn't wait for a person who turns you down, Yeo Reum.

113
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,230
Don't you agree, Lee Soo Yeon?

114
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,620
Well, I guess it depends on the situation.

115
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,010
In any case, my friend Han Yeo Reum is such a foolish person.

116
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,860
She doesn't know men, and she doesn't know how to play hard to get.

117
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,450
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,300
What do you mean? I want to go with you to the spicy food restaurant that you picked out.

119
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,790
I totally like strong flavors also.

120
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,530
Then us friends will be leaving to go eat spicy food.

121
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,040
Let's go, Yeo Reum.

122
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,330
Lee Soo Yeon, I will see you tomorrow.

123
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,590
Hey, what are you doing?

124
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,420
What do you mean? I was helping you.

125
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,340
Helping with what?

126
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,960
Weren't you going to have dinner with Lee Soo Yeon?

127
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,270
Yes.

128
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,220
He'll be out in three seconds. Want to see?

129
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,190
One.

130
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,690
Two.

131
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,260
Three.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,520
Why hasn't he come? Wait.

133
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,040
One.

134
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,260
Two.

135
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,830
Three.

136
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,590
Three!

137
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,670
That's strange. Why isn't he coming? He is usually right behind me.

138
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,670
Okay.

139
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,470
Let's go then.

140
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,320
Would that be all right?

141
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,620
Why aren't you listening to me?

142
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,370
Oh Dae Gi!

143
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,160
What are you doing standing there?

144
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,210
Let's go. Let's go!

145
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,240
Hurry up!

146
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,410
I enjoyed my meal. I'll be back again.

147
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,440
- What's with you?
- Why did you come after humiliating me?

148
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,790
Who is it who suffers being misunderstood and humiliated alone?

149
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,000
You can't stand me, right?

150
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,390
Truthfully, you were envious when I became director.

151
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,660
We started working at the same time. But your promotions were delayed and I alone moved up.

152
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,800
You don't remember stepping over your co-workers just to advance yourself?

153
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,530
But still, I didn't step on you.

154
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,340
Hui Seung,

155
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,400
What is it?

156
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Right now, how many friends do you have left who will call you by name?

157
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,350
You're the only one. So what?

158
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,750
Why do you think that is?

159
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,950
That is ... at a glance I am suffering only for work.

160
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,650
It is dying, because I have lived only to work.

161
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,420
That's not it. You like being called by a title better than your own name.

162
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,310
You like the sound of Team Leader, Director, Vice-President, better than your own name.

163
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,360
Is that a bad thing?

164
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,320
It's not okay if my everything is the title I earned from working hard?

165
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,120
That's my reason for living.

166
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,890
And my reason for existence.

167
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,090
That's right.

168
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,810
Aren't you happy now?

169
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,970
Just drink this much more and go home.

170
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,710
Boss, how much is that?

171
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,120
One more drink.

172
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,550
No, you can drink after you wait five minutes.

173
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,230
Sheesh, why are you ruining the mood?

174
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,690
Let's just have one more drink, okay?

175
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,260
You already had four drinks in a row. No.

176
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,090
Okay.

177
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,190
- Has it been five minutes?
- Five seconds have passed.

178
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,960
Ah, I really don't know.

179
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,800
He said he likes me, so why is he suddenly asking for time?

180
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,600
Can you explain it to me? What do men mean by this?

181
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,090
Don't ask me. I'm a man who doesn't think that way.

182
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,900
Asking a woman I like for some time to think about it.

183
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,650
I don't do such things. If I like her, I like her, and if not, I don't.

184
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,440
Is that why you're never able to go on more than two dates with a woman?

185
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,340
That's not because there's a problem with me.

186
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,610
That's right. It's because you haven't found your soulmate, right?

187
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,320
It could be that I met her, but she doesn't realize it.

188
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,310
Or it could be you.

189
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,920
I told you that's not funny, Go Eun Seob.

190
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,780
Just why do you like Lee Soo Yeon?

191
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,360
Since we're on the subject, let's hear it. What about him is better than me?

192
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,630
It's just... I like being with him.

193
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,400
That's enough, let's stop now. I take back my question.

194
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,150
When I hear his voice, I feel happier without being aware of it.

195
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,110
I said that's enough.

196
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,250
When he's looking at me,

197
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,630
somehow I ... feel like it makes me special.

198
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,850
If you like him so much, go tell that bastard yourself. Stop telling me about it.

199
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,450
Right.

200
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,890
I need to say these kinds of things in person, right?

201
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,490
What?

202
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,650
Thank you, Go Eun Seob.

203
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,870
How come you always say the right things? Thank you so much.

204
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,800
Where are you going?

205
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,520
To Lee Soo Yeon. I'm going to tell him personally, face to face.

206
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,190
I'll pay for the drinks today.

207
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,070
Have as much as you want.

208
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,690
Did I ask you to pay for the drinks? I wanted to be with you.

209
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,750
Perhaps, do you like me?

210
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,030
Yes

211
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,440
♫ It was always you ♫

212
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:07,520
♫ Because what made me laugh everyday was always you ♫

213
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:18,010
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various places ♫

214
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:25,460
♫ Are making me run and taking me to you ♫

215
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:34,520
♫ Is there any reason for people laughing? ♫

216
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:45,070
♫ They say there is without anything being funny ♫

217
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:53,710
♫ I will tell you that and, like everyone else, I too smilingly ♫

218
00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:04,240
♫ I'm happy. You make me feel happy ♫

219
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:13,900
♫ I think every moment I walk rest and speak ♫

220
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:22,630
♫ is a moment which is more than just your coming to me. ♫

221
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,920
Oh, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

222
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,700
Did you drink alcohol?

223
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,030
Yes. I drank.

224
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,860
I left in the middle of drinking.

225
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,620
Why?

226
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,500
Because I thought of something I want to say to you.

227
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,010
What are you saying?

228
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,420
I like you too.

229
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,200
I like you too.

230
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,460
So,

231
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,080
don't malfunction.

232
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,670
I'm not sure what it is exactly. But I hope

233
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,640
that you won't keep malfunctioning because of me.

234
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,540
♫ This is what my heart does. ♫

235
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,200
Well, I have to go now.

236
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,670
♫ I am unconsciously looking for you ♫

237
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,770
♫ As if I lost something precious. ♫

238
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:04,460
So that you know, I'm very good at waiting.

239
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,070
You don't know why my name is Han Yeo Reum yet, right?

240
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,650
It's because I was born in the middle of summer.

241
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,690
But the season I like the best is actually autumn.

242
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,970
I,

243
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:29,480
♫ Don't hesitate to tell me gradually those deeply stored feelings. ♫

244
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,330
Because I first met my parents in autumn.

245
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,650
From the time I was born, I even had to wait in order to meet my parents.

246
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,510
And even when my mom and dad were divorced,

247
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,100
I continued to wait and wait for my dad.

248
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,400
And I waited three years to get this job at the airport.

249
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,260
So, Lee Soo Yeon...

250
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,250
You can have as much time as you want.

251
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
No matter how long,

252
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,490
I don't mind waiting. I can wait.
♫  This is what my heart says. ♫

253
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,690
♫ I hate myself for not being confident ♫

254
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,390
That's all I wanted to say.

255
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,050
♫ Because for as much as a day

256
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:35,220
♬ I might miss you, I'm afraid. ♫

257
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:44,050
♬ If I just see you, if I am just next to you  ♫

258
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:50,590
♬ Everything is all right for me  ♫

259
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,950
♬ Even if I were lost  ♫

260
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,510
♬ Even if sometimes I want to cry  ♫

261
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,920
♬ As it is I will stay with you more  ♫

262
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,470
♬  When you and I are face to face like this, ♫

263
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,900
♬ It seems everything else stops.  ♫
I love you.

264
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:23,080
♬ No one has to make an effort.  ♫

265
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,620
♫ When you feel that, it's enough. ♫

266
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:39,950
♫ If I just see you, if I am just next to you ♫

267
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:46,450
♫ Somehow I keep yearning for you ♫

268
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:56,150
♫ Even though I can't count the time I will endure alone ♫

269
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,660
♫ As it is I will stay with you more ♫

270
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,300
- Do you have some time today? 
- Hello.

271
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,050
I'm on duty in the morning.

272
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,430
So what about in the afternoon?

273
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,540
Hello.

274
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,780
By any chance, are you asking me out for a date?

275
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,300
Yes, I'm asking you out for a date.

276
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,420
Hello.

277
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,800
Hello.

278
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,480
Did something good happen to Han Yeo Reum today?

279
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm not sure. Maybe she has a date.

280
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,260
So, did your date go well yesterday?

281
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,970
Of course.

282
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,100
Hello.

283
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,520
Hello.

284
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,310
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Yes, go ahead.

285
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,370
I'm interested in receiving text message (SMS) Service.

286
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,460
The text message (SMS) service? If you take a look at this page here,

287
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,110
You can follow all these steps written here from your phone.

288
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,160
- In this order?
- Yes, that's right.

289
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,010
It'll be easier for you to understand if you read this user guide carefully.

290
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,090
Yes, I understand.

291
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you. Have a good day.

292
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,060
Han Yeo Reum

293
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,820
Oh, Han Yeo Reum. Haven't you left yet?

294
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,930
I'm leaving now.

295
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,190
Have a good weekend.

296
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,190
Let's die together!

297
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,410
Let me go. Quickly, let me go.

298
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,150
Shut up!

299
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,050
This is the east side information front desk.

300
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,830
Please contact the Security Team, quickly!

301
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,140
Let me go. Let's talk about this!

302
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,000
How am I supposed to let you go?

303
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,530
This is how much I love you.

304
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,370
You love me too!

305
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,320
How could love change this much?

306
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,280
- Okay, I got it. I understand.
- What should we do?

307
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,930
Let me go please.

308
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,720
Please wait a moment.

309
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,500
Shut up! Go away!

310
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,950
Talk to me and let her go. You're suffocating her!

311
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,050
I asked you to shut up!

312
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,690
What should we do?

313
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,650
- I think she's injured.
- Yes, you're right.

314
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,110
Han Yeo Reum!

315
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
Han Yeo Reum. Han Yeo Reum, are you alright?

316
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,820
Han Yeo Reum! Han Yeo Reum!

317
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,950
Cheongna Lake Park

318
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,790
Han Yeo Reum

319
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,940
