1
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,610
Titanium spring mounted inside the arm
with shoulder reel equipped with 4 pistons.

2
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,340
Interactive design

3
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,520
calf holder rear cap, works with 4 vacuum pistons
with hydraulic oil

4
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,770
I thought it was an impossible dream.

5
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,650
Can you get up once?

6
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,960
That dream ...

7
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,650
became reality.

8
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,930
No.

9
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It was more than reality.

10
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,590
Shall we see what you can do?

11
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,870
Taxi. Taxi here!

12
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,770
Seo In Woo.

13
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,300
Hey.

14
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,400
Wait!

15
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,330
Wait a moment.

16
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,960
What should I do? Shall I continue?

17
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,970
Don't go today.

18
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,490
I need you today too.

19
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,260
Don't go.

20
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,230
Choose only one. Are you a friend to me or a man?

21
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,580
If I choose a man, then what will you do?

22
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,010
If so, then I would...

23
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,050
lose my good friend.

24
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,100
Can't I be that?

25
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,950
To you?

26
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,720
Just...

27
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,060
because that person is the only man to me.

28
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,720
Lee Soo Yeon, what are you doing here? Have you been waiting for me?

29
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,680
What's wrong? Are you sick?

30
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,650
Ah, why is your face like this?

31
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,340
Are you hurt? Did you fall?

32
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,810
Did you fight with someone again?

33
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,320
You're late?

34
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,840
Oh dear. Look at your face all cut up.

35
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,120
But when you're hurt, you should go to the hospital! Why did you come here? I'm cold too.

36
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,840
I waited for you.

37
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,320
I can't let this slide. First, let's go to a hospital. Okay?

38
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,740
I'm alright, Han Yeo Reum.

39
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,300
That face now would never be alright.

40
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,950
Get up immediately, okay?

41
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,960
Han Yeo Reum.

42
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,580
You can't get up? Should I call a taxi?

43
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,300
First, stay right here. I'll go...

44
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,650
Yeo Reum.

45
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm alright.

46
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,860
I said I'm alright. Come over here.

47
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,250
My heart aches.

48
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,470
This person...

49
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,700
to me, he was in a lot of pain.

50
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,700
The true nature of the feeling we call love
Episode 29

51
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,950
At that level ...

52
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,860
It's late.

53
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,150
You are not a child. Why did you fight?

54
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,570
Were you just hanging out with strong guys?

55
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,120
Are you laughing now?

56
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,710
Yes, it came out.

57
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,050
Amazing.

58
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,740
It hurts.

59
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,050
What my mom said was just right.

60
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,400
A man is only a man until he begins to love.

61
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,330
The moment a woman confirms their love, the man becomes a child.

62
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,960
It's not like that. I can not agree with that.

63
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,910
My dad did exactly that.

64
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,690
After he approached her as a man, he said he was a child because he was in love.

65
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,750
It is because he was like a child by nature.

66
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,290
Genuine and pure.

67
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,520
That's why he wrote children's stories.

68
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,240
Who did you fight with?

69
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,320
- Bad people.
- Bullies?

70
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
- Perhaps.
- Oh, you don't care.

71
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,490
You should call the police.

72
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,380
How many people?

73
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,040
I can't say. There was a bunch of them. I'm not exactly sure.

74
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,120
About ten? Maybe twenty?

75
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,190
Ah, no way. That's all a lie.

76
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,700
A lie?

77
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,970
I'm sorry. I'm talking like crazy again, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

78
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,530
I'm sorry for earlier, Han Yeo Reum.

79
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,770
- For what?
- For getting angry and going off.

80
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,870
There was nothing to be angry with you about.

81
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,660
Why? You shouldn't be upset about that.

82
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,560
We are dating.

83
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,400
If you are dating, you get angry, get tangled up, and then clear the air, right?

84
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,640
Do you want to do that with me?

85
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,750
Get angry, tangled up and then clear the air?

86
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,620
If we do, can you accept it?

87
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,950
I'll try it.

88
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,850
Why? I'm totally disappointed. Really!

89
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,540
You should generously accept if that's the case.

90
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,900
If you are clearing the air as you said, what am I doing now during the clearing?

91
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,900
Heol. Without any warning, are we starting the real game now?

92
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,720
Would you like to sleep?

93
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,380
Go to sleep.

94
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,300
If you just let it sit, it's going to get swollen. You should put a little more in.

95
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,780
I will go now.

96
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,890
Are you just going?

97
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,620
Have a good night.

98
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,010
Director Jo

99
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,870
Yes, it's Seo In Woo.

100
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,150
That bastard... What is he?

101
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,940
What do you mean?

102
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,710
I mean that bastard, Lee Soo Yeon.

103
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,770
I do not know what you're talking about.

104
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,980
From the beginning, I must have made it clear that I don't know who he is.

105
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,130
- Hey, Seo In Woo.
- I'll hang up.

106
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,630
Then, you could die.

107
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,210
Why are you coming out from there?

108
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,890
I needed his approval. I'm on my way from coming to leave it on his desk.

109
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,930
At this time?

110
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,100
It's a matter that I need approval for early tomorrow.

111
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,450
Then, what happened?

112
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,850
Are you really not going to tell me?

113
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,150
Yes, not yet.

114
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm going home.

115
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,180
Documents for approval

116
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,100
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Chief.

117
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,120
Why are you in such a mood? Are you suffering from disappointment?

118
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,970
Are you suffering from a broken heart?

119
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,680
No, I'm not. Absolutely, it's not that.

120
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,190
Who is it? Which department?

121
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,580
Perhaps... A teammate?

122
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,840
I will not tell you.

123
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,870
Anyway I got dumped before I even got started.

124
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,720
Aigoo. Full moon is overflowing again.

125
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,220
Tomorrow it's going to be a perfect hell again.

126
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,660
What?

127
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,570
The full moon... Why?

128
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,490
You didn't know? When the full moon rises,

129
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,120
more and more of those individuals suddenly show up.

130
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,820
Those individuals?

131
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,980
Go!

132
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,220
Everybody, hurry up!

133
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,580
Hey. Attention, everyone.

134
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,820
A pre-assessment team for the ASQ evaluation was formed by the CS management team.

135
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,210
Today I was notified that, starting tomorrow, for two days there will be a preliminary assessment.

136
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,870
The pre-assessment team was formed by people from outside companies.

137
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,210
Their identity and number are confidential.

138
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,960
I hope that the entire gamut of airport operations will do their best

139
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,510
to get through this without any exception and without any incident.

140
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,150
That's it.

141
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,810
Assistant Yoon, let's go on a round.

142
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,380
Yes, I understand.

143
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,010
We should also do rounds.

144
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,690
Assistant Song, you take the landside. I'll take the airside.

145
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,120
- Okay, let's get going.
- Yes, Team Leader.

146
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,100
Don't you have something special to ask of us?

147
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,200
Let's just do what we normally do.

148
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,300
Because it's near the end of the year, there's an increase of unauthorized banners again,

149
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,430
- so focus on that.
- Yes, we will.

150
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,800
Han Yeo Reum, why is Lee Soo Yeon like that?

151
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,540
Where did he get hurt like that? Who hit him?

152
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,050
I'm not sure. I don't know either.

153
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,930
What's the matter, Lee Soo Yeon?

154
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,900
I don't think you don't know.

155
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,740
- You're a little hurt.
- So that's why you're disappointed?

156
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,230
That I wasn't injured otherwise?

157
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,990
You should have just run away, Soo Yeon.

158
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,920
Even now, you don't know what you messed around with, do you?

159
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,580
From now on, you only have two choices.

160
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,680
Run away to somewhere where those people can't find you

161
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,440
or you kneel down.

162
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,010
I don't want to do either.

163
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,490
They are stubborn and persistent.

164
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,710
It will be painful while they follow you to the end.

165
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,580
That night... Did you really run away properly?

166
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,080
I asked you if you managed to run away properly.

167
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,060
Stop.

168
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,880
Did you dare run away?

169
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,740
Where is that hard disk that you took away?

170
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,820
I lost it.

171
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,630
Where?

172
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,060
I don't know. I really don't know.

173
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,100
You really don't know? Should I remind you about it?

174
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,140
In Woo, I admit you're smart, but you're worthless.

175
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,210
The president raised me, made me study, and made me into a human being.

176
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,560
In what haystack did you roll it, bastard?

177
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,740
You left that disk somewhere, huh?

178
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,580
I didn't hand it over to anyone.

179
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,450
It's the truth.

180
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,150
I really lost it.

181
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,540
No matter who finds it, they will never unlock it. I did that. It's the truth.

182
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,880
Please believe me.

183
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,700
The guy earlier with the broken arm and leg. Find out which hospital he was taken to.

184
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,260
If he is still alive, go and end his last breath.

185
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,910
Yes.

186
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,300
Please don't do that. Please don't do that.

187
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,180
Soo Yeon has nothing to do with that.

188
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,320
He-he doesn't know anything about it. Please!

189
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,510
Please, leave my younger brother alone.

190
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,540
Please. Please...

191
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,620
Please! I beg of you, please!

192
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,800
Let's stop talking outside of business.

193
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,270
But, that hard disk...

194
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,970
Do you remember it?

195
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,650
Did you forget you left it at that restaurant?

196
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,700
Hey, student. It seems that you left this behind.

197
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,910
Thank you.

198
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,730
Yes, Yeo Reum.

199
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,660
What's the matter?

200
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,640
The password is pretty complicated....

201
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,630
By any chance, you...

202
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:31,790
You don't think that I ... that I haven't opened it yet, do you?

203
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,560
I've heard you talking about the pre-assessment unit.

204
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,990
Yes!

205
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,550
Let's just do as usual.

206
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,760
Because as usual, you guys do great.

207
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,650
Yes!

208
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,460
Yes, this is the Security Team.

209
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,250
Yes, I understand.

210
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,020
What is it?

211
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,850
I got a report that someone is doing floral decorations in the airport.

212
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,540
Flowers? What kind of flowers?

213
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,590
Oh, the full moon rose last night.

214
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,190
What?

215
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,270
What are you doing here? Go ahead and take care of the situation!

216
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,960
Yes sir.

217
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,640
- Let's go, Na Yeong Joo.
- Yes.

218
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,980
That disk then. The password was pretty complicated.

219
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,490
You don't think that I ... that I haven't opened it yet, do you?

220
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,000
This is Seo In Woo, Team Leader of Operations Planning Department.

221
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,100
Team Leader, we're in trouble.

222
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Someone sent me something like a note

223
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,200
and he knows everything about our meeting with the new president.

224
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,130
I think this person is definitely in here.

225
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,900
What should we do?

226
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,860
I ... will try to talk to this person.

227
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,880
Lee Soo Yeon, where are you now?

228
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,070
Lee Soo Yeon? Lee Soo Yeon?!

229
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,670
Yes, Section Chief.

230
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,190
I need you to go to the landside east on the 3rd floor. Hurry up!

231
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,530
Yes, I understand. I will go now.

232
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,320
What is it? What are you talking about?

233
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,560
I just got a call from the General Manager.

234
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,410
He received a strange letter. Were you the one to send it?

235
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:02,220
No. But I do know its content.

236
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,490
Since when did you plan on doing that?

237
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,580
That's enough. Anyway, we need a change here.

238
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,550
If you miss the time to accept the change, you will fail.

239
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,850
There's nothing as scary as losing your competitive edge in the era of unlimited competitiveness.

240
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,430
So did you take out the privatization card?

241
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,410
They are providing administration of the management of airport operations.

242
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,820
and they will introduce private management techniques.

243
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,120
How long will you just be satisfied with being number one in Customer Service?

244
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,690
You know we are falling behind in transfer rate and new airlines.

245
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,600
And on top of that, the dependence on non-aircraft revenues is too high.

246
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,390
I just said the same thing nine years ago.

247
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,370
How long can we rely on non-aircraft revenues?

248
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,590
But look! Just like that, we opened T2.

249
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,390
There's nothing wrong with building level 4 without the infusion of outside capital, is there?

250
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,580
There are already several airports which have been publicly listed

251
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,270
or are planning to do so.

252
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,800
Heathrow, Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle, Sydney. Shall I name more?

253
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,730
Do I blindly do what others do? Whether it might be poison or medicine?

254
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,690
That's what I am saying about a global trend.

255
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,930
Global Flow? Advanced System?

256
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,530
Everything's great.

257
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:11,620
However ... A system which excludes people is bound to cause damage.

258
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,510
What damage?

259
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,700
As you say, the sale of public stock has been successful.

260
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,690
Can you ignore that's the opinion of the private companies which own stock?

261
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,680
You have to deal with that. Who do you think is doing that?

262
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,300
Transportation fees are only going to change in keeping with inflation.

263
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,240
Heathrow Airport charges 6.9 times more than Incheon airport!

264
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,300
After Athens Airport sold shares, it raised facility fees by 500 percent.

265
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,760
If private capital comes in, will it allow the freezing of fees?

266
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,890
Don't keep thinking you are the only one supporting the airport.

267
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not doing this for the airport.

268
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,010
It's for the people working here!

269
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,100
And... For passengers who use our airport.

270
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,480
Team Leader Yang.

271
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,590
Are you thinking of going ahead with that plan no matter what?

272
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,210
What? What? About what?

273
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,500
If you are, let's get the team leaders together in an emergency meeting and make a public announcement.

274
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,800
Look here. Team Leader Yang, it's not what it seems.

275
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,100
Please let me know before the end of working hours.

276
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,750
I will wait on standby.

277
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,120
Did anything happen?

278
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,370
Team Leader Lee.

279
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,820
Why? Something happened, and you are doing that?

280
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,970
Where Stars Land
