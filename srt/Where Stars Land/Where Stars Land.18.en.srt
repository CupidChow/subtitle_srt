00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,660
Episode 18

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,890
- Here's your takeout order.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,450
Hello?

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,070
Hey, Han Yeo Reum. How are you today?

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,560
It's busy as usual today.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,390
Don't work so hard. You'll make yourself sick.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,840
I think Lee Soo Yeon is the one who made himself sick.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,950
He's sick and taking sick days. He'll be out until the weekend.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,680
So you're worried about him?

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,020
I can't reach him at all.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,130
I don't know if he's sick or injured.

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,540
Do you need a drinking buddy? I'm suddenly craving a drink.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,380
I'll call you at the end of the day.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,720
Right. When you're done at the end of the day, call me.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,730
Work hard.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,260
- Do you know what?
- Yes?

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,330
Women can't feel romantic vibes towards men who are too casual about their feelings.

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,850
They'll think they're too casual to be their man.

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,460
Han Yeo Reum

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,850
Oh Dae Gi, did you hear something?

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,790
We've found his son.

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,480
You found him? Where? Where is he now?

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,290
He's in the U.S. He's in L.A. (Los Angeles).

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,100
What?!

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,120
Last night, he already left the country on a flight. Together with his family.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,750
Then...

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,320
What about that grandfather?

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,800
In a word, he's been abandoned.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,960
Hearing what Team Leader Lee said, that so-called son,

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,790
talked his father into living in the US with him.

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,520
So he sold his house and farm,

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,030
the son took all that money

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,210
and flew off to the US by himself. Abandoning an elderly father in the airport.

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,090
How despicable.

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,430
Rotten jerk.

37
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,430
So now ... what should we do with the grandfather?

38
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,740
His daughter is coming on the earliest flight available.

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,040
Please eat slowly. Just slowly.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,900
Thank you.

41
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,010
You're not allowed to go outside.

42
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,630
If you over exert yourself and muscle necrosis occurs, things are going to get really complicated.

43
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,340
- You know that, right?
- I know.

44
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,540
But... I miss her.

45
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,720
Will you be able to handle it?

46
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,020
Will I be able to handle it?

47
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,550
Just because you don't feel pain doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

48
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,720
Your head doesn't register the pain, but in reality, it does hurt.

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,650
What can be done?

50
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:05,080
♬  Someone's appearance can make my today a day which is entirely painful ♬

51
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:19,790
♫ Someone's laughter can make my whole heart happy ♫

52
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,050
♬ I want to say It's okay, it's okay  ♬

53
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:36,230
♫ Your very existence as you are now is precious  ♫

54
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:43,460
♫ Sitting next to you and speaking in a soft voice  ♫

55
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:51,440
♫ That's enough for me. That's enough for me. ♫

56
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:07,690
♬ Because I know you, the yearning for you makes my heart beat  ♬

57
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:25,130
♬  Because I met you, I am happy without the tears which were accumulating  ♬

58
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:50,680
♫ If you see me today, my heart beats. ♫

59
00:06:50,680 --> 00:07:00,050
♫ You comfort all my days. ♫

60
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:30,470
♬  Because you hold and hug me, I can think about tomorrow  ♬

61
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,440
♬ Because of you  ♬

62
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,700
This kid even took the car keys?

63
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,560
Mr. Jang

64
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,330
Yes, this is Yang Seo Goon.

65
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,120
I think Soo Yeon is headed to the airport.

66
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,290
He shouldn't be out in his condition. But he isn't picking up my call.

67
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,600
Could you call me as soon as you find him?

68
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes, I'm headed that way, too.

69
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,390
Assistant Nam, where is Han Yeo Reum right now?

70
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,840
She's probably in Departures. She was with that grandfather earlier.

71
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,660
Father!

72
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,880
Father! What are you doing here?

73
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,760
You're killing me! Really! The US? What were you thinking, the US?!

74
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,700
Where did all that doting on your son get you?!

75
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,490
You sold your house and farm! You don't have anything left!

76
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,680
Ah, seriously!

77
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm so upset I don't know what to do!

78
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,900
What did you do right to be crying?

79
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,750
Look at me.

80
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,000
Team Leader!

81
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,860
Did you happen to make plans to meet with Lee Soo Yeon?

82
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,000
With Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

83
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,930
No. I can't get in touch with him.

84
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,520
I think Lee Soo Yeon is at the airport right now.

85
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,110
Did he really not try to contact you?

86
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,880
No, he didn't.

87
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,500
Wait a moment.

88
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Agent Lee Soo Yeon (2) Missed calls.

89
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Han Yeo Reum

90
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,940
Can we go to a place where only the two of us can talk?

91
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,800
It would be good if it were somewhere with no CCTV cameras.

92
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,970
Follow me.

93
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,700
Are you feeling okay?

94
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,230
No. I'm not okay yet.

95
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,180
What's the reason you just had to see me right now?

96
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,030
You said you needed to check it yourself, right?

97
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,400
So I'm going to let you check it.

98
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,380
This is connected to my right arm all the way up to my shoulder.

99
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,060
And a similar one is attached to my right leg from my ankle to my thigh.

100
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:59,670
Without these, I can't walk or move my arm,

101
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,690
or use my hand.

102
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,500
What abilities do you have?

103
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,130
I don't know the limits yet.

104
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,160
However, the heaviest thing I've stopped before was a car.

105
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
And I'm able to lift a person.

106
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,600
I saw you blocking a stanchion too.

107
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,480
My nerve was damaged, so I don't feel any pain.

108
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,520
Have you ever used that strength on a person?

109
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,670
Once I caught a bully in middle school.

110
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,170
But I didn't use my strength back then.

111
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,360
And last night's fight. That's the extent of it.

112
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,530
Have you ever encountered any malfunction?

113
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,000
No.

114
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,830
Did you ever lose control so that it didn't move according to your will?

115
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,270
No, never.

116
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,370
For the past year, it never went out of my control, not even once...

117
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It didn't (go out of my control).

118
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,890
Why all of a sudden are you opening up everything to me like this?

119
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,430
To be honest...

120
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,500
I've come here to ask a favor of you.

121
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,480
His phone isn't turned off but he's not answering it.

122
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,260
Soo Yeon shouldn't be going around in this condition.

123
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,750
We have to hurry and find him.

124
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:54,280
Team Leader, Lee Soo Yeon keeps not answering his phone. What should I do?

125
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,120
Can you keep looking for him around?

126
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,600
Did you find him?

127
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,810
Where is he right now?

128
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,470
Okay, I understand.

129
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,850
We need to talk.

130
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,530
I'm busy.

131
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,790
Just now, I'm back from meeting Lee Soo Yeon.

132
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,770
- Let me ask you something.
- What is it?

133
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,600
Why do you want to hide Lee Soo Yeon's secret this badly?

134
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,300
What is Lee Soo Yeon to you?

135
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,960
Ji Woon.

136
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,790
To me, Lee Soo Yeon is Ji Woon.

137
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,110
A life without discrimination and pity,

138
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,950
living however one pleases. My younger brother wasn't able to do that.

139
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,320
But I wanted to help Lee Soo Yeon survive.

140
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,640
However, it doesn't seem to have worked out that way.

141
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,920
To be honest, I've come here to ask a favor of you.

142
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,690
What is it?

143
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,500
Can you give me a month?

144
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,200
If I give you a month,

145
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,580
what are you going to do after that?

146
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,240
I will stop and quit.

147
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:09,910
Just for a month, please let me live as I am living today.

148
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,580
I beg you.

149
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,910
What are you doing here?

150
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,810
I just came to meet someone.

151
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,180
I heard you were sick.

152
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,650
You should be resting at home if you took sick days.

153
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,590
What happened to you?

154
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,940
By any chance, did you get injured during the fight last night?

155
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,480
Where did you get injured? Did you get hurt a lot?

156
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

157
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,180
Did you see how many times you missed my calls?

158
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,700
What about my text messages?

159
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,760
Are you worried about me?

160
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
Of course, I'm worried.

161
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,910
The person I was with disappeared into thin air.

162
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,540
You didn't call me, you didn't pick up my calls and ignored my texts.

163
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,650
What? You're smiling?

164
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,160
You smiled just now? How can you be smiling now?

165
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,100
Shall we just love?

166
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,550
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

167
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,370
Let's just love.

168
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,360
♫ Because what kept me going was always you ♫

169
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,030
Today, right now...

170
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:24,100
♫ Because what made me laugh everyday was always you ♫

171
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:32,600
♫ Too many reasons hiding in various places ♫

172
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,100
There's so much I don't know about you.

173
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:52,000
♫ Every walking, resting, and talking moment  ♫

174
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,620
If there is something I do know...

175
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,040
Today, right now...

176
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,360
I know this moment is real.

177
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:09,900
♫ Running while watching the clock, right now I'm going to see you ♫

178
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:18,770
♫ The moment is so happy that I shed tears ♫

179
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,510
♫ I whom you made look forward ♫

180
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,910
♫ will give everything ♫

181
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,280
♫ I am going to you ♫

182
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,790
♫ After I follow you ♫

183
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:37,030
♫ Everyday I resemble you ♫

184
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,930
I reviewed the documents you gave me.

185
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,820
What did you think?

186
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,860
I still haven't reached a conclusion, to be frank.

187
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,450
You know there is a thing called public sentiment for our Incheon Airport.

188
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,570
Any innovation is always followed by an equal amount of opposition.

189
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,830
I could be shackled by that opposition.

190
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,900
What will happen then?

191
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,700
In fact, there's someone who wants to meet with you regarding that.

192
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,720
It's President Shin from Geosan Group. You must have heard of him.

193
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,660
Would you like to meet with him?

194
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,430
I have something to tell you.

195
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,510
Go ahead.

196
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,060
- Let's talk later.
- Then, I should go out and leave you two alone.

197
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,250
Please let me know when you've made up your mind.

198
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,970
Why don't you stay? You can hear this, too.

199
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,510
What is it?

200
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,710
It's about the employee whom Team Leader Seo brought up during the last Team Leaders' meeting.

201
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,360
The one the Security Team needed to check.

202
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,390
That's right. How did it go?

203
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,280
I just met with him and completed my assessment.

204
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,190
In my assessment, it shouldn't pose a big problem.

205
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,330
That's good.

206
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,720
Did you really check it yourself?

207
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,530
That's correct. I performed a full assessment.

208
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,740
Could I see documents showing the complete review was done?

209
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,050
Team Leader Seo. You keep crossing the line.

210
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,140
Let's switch job positions. If I asked you to let me see important documents from the Operations Planning Department Team,

211
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,950
would you be willing to show them to me?

212
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,870
Let me take a look at the documents you just gave the Director.

213
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,030
Could you show them to me?

214
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,100
That's right. If he says he's certain about it, then it must be fine.

215
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,720
That's good. You worked hard.

216
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
It's already time to call it a day.

217
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,540
So, you may go. You've worked hard.

218
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,400
Yes, sir.

219
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,950
I'm a bit disappointed.

220
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,450
The outcome was exactly the one I was afraid it would be.

221
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,470
Sometimes in life,

222
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,820
it's not a bad idea once in a while to just turn your back.

223
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,690
And it's Yang Seo Goon on top of it. Not just another woman.

224
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,460
From today onwards, everything about Lee Soo Yeon will be managed and supervised by the Security Team and the NIS.

225
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,480
Just know that and don't try to intervene again.

226
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
Lee Soo Yeon, you!

227
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,610
I'm sorry, I took your car without permission.

228
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,900
You think this is about a car? You know it's not.

229
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,550
Why don't you listen? Something bad could really happen.

230
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,110
There was something I had to do. I'm sorry.

231
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,730
You look better than what I was worried about.

232
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,070
But since you took sick days until the weekend, just get some rest.

233
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,290
Thank you.

234
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,460
See you next week.

235
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,670
Give me the car keys.

236
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,330
Sure.

237
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,860
Do something about those lips.

238
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,890
Something you had to do...

239
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,030
You're here just in time.

240
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,440
We're going to get some drinks. Would you like to join us?

241
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,690
I have plans, I'm sorry.

242
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,890
That's okay. We didn't expect it anyway.

243
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,850
Everyone, follow me!

244
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,000
La la la la la....

245
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,230
Take care!

246
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,010
See you tomorrow. Work hard!

247
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,060
Take care.

248
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,900
Sunbae ...

249
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,880
I have something to tell you.

250
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,250
Yeah, what is it?

251
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,190
Please put me on a different team.

252
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,090
What do you mean? Change teams?

253
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,800
You're too difficult for me.

254
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,940
While we are working together, for various reasons, I'm very anxious.

255
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,250
I apologize, but ... please move me to another area.

256
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,510
A glass of beer please.

257
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,770
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,710
My husband

259
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,860
My husband

260
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,780
My husband - (16) missed calls.

261
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,910
Jerk.

262
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,830
I'm leaving the office now.

263
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,290
Why are you smiling?

264
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,610
Take that off. You can't keep wearing that.

265
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,760
Could you just let it go for tonight?

266
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
- Actually...
- Actually what?

267
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,300
I have a date tonight. With Han Yeo Reum.

268
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,660
You! What's more important right now?

269
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,400
Your arm or your date?

270
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,350
My date.

271
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,060
You crazy fool. No, take it off right now.

272
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,860
I won't be out too late.

273
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,210
I'm borrowing your car.

274
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,710
Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon!

275
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,250
That...

276
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,280
Team Leader ...

277
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,200
Are you busy right now? I have something to discuss.

278
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,850
It won't take long. It's about Soo Yeon.

279
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,680
Have you ever encountered any malfunction?

280
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,220
No.

281
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,670
Did you ever lose control so that it didn't move according to your will?

282
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,670
No, never.

283
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:34,890
♬ Because I know you, the yearning for you makes my heart beat  ♬

284
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:51,500
♬  Because I met you, I am happy without the tears which were accumulating  ♬

285
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,100
Where Stars Land
