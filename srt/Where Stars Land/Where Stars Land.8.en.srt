1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,200
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,100
Episode 8

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,060
Did someone cause an accident again?

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,930
Yes. I think it's going to be major.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,520
This time it's someone who was not allowed entry.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,720
Who is it this time?

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,100
It's the very person you know well.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,860
Secondary Inspection Division 2

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,030
Incheon Airport Immigration Office

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,000
That is going beyond our duty and it won't change anything.

11
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,530
Men's room.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,500
Mister Santos! Mister Santos!

13
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,700
Seriously!

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,700
Team Leader.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,900
Security Team.

16
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,040
I am asking for help. A passenger not allowed entry has escaped.

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,160
He's going to the west side of the transit area now.

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,500
We are headed in that direction.

19
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,850
This is Seo In Woo.

20
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,750
He was in charge of Arville Airport operation and planning consulting for the past 2 years.

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,950
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

22
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,320
Do you know we are now submitting a bid to manage the Kuwaiti fourth airport from our overseas division?

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,860
Before they make the final decision, they want to see T2, so do well.

24
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,830
I understand.

25
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,080
Okay. Come this way.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,600
Catch him! Catch him!

27
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,750
What's that? What's the ruckus?

28
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,840
For now escort our VIPs and wait in the lounge.

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,830
There's a problem with safety. I think they should look around when the situation is over.

30
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,290
Is there something wrong?

31
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,030
No, no, it's alright. It's not a problem.

32
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,300
- Come this way.
Yes.

33
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I will not get inside the plane. I need to see my wife. Please.

34
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,410
Unfortunately I don't have any authority about that.

35
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,260
So, let's go back and not cause problems. Okay?

36
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,890
Let me see my wife. Please.

37
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

38
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,310
Please.

39
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,450
Please.

40
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,780
I won't go anywhere. I need to see my wife.

41
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,760
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

42
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,200
Calm down. Put it down, right now.

43
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,380
It's okay.

44
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,710
It's not a big deal. Calm down.

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Don't keep making problems. Okay?

46
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,000
Are you alright? Is everything okay?

47
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes. Nothing happened.

48
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,200
So? What are you planning after you go in there?

49
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,980
I want to at least talk to them.

50
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,270
The child is being born.

51
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,200
I want to ask if they could at least let him see the baby's face.

52
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,560
Does Immigration seem so lenient to you?

53
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Just because someone asks, they would revoke the decision that's already made?

54
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm sorry.

55
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,990
What to do?

56
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,590
Why? What's wrong?

57
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,300
The baby is born. It's a girl.

58
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,280
She's pretty.

59
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
I know.

60
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,100
You've worked hard, Sunbaenim.

61
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,870
Are you crying?

62
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900
I keep on coughing.

63
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,400
Excuse me... can I take a photo?

64
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,770
What to do?

65
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,120
Why? What is it again?

66
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,100
The baby is so pretty.

67
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,170
You'll let him leave the country without seeing this pretty face.

68
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Isn't that too much?

69
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,010
I'm really curious.

70
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Why did you entrust Han Yeo Reum to me?

71
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,010
When I look at Han Yeo Reum, it brings back to my mind

72
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,080
a certain newbie that came in eighteen years ago.

73
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,500
That newbie is now a great Team Leader or something.

74
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,500
- Team Leader Lee...
- You two are alike.

75
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,500
Very alike.

76
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,100
Let's go in.

77
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,970
I'm Passenger Service Team Leader Yang Seo Goon.

78
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,460
- You're Section Chief Lee Gi Baek, right?
- Yes, that's right.

79
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,840
A man named Ian Santos was re-questioned here.

80
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,110
To my knowledge, that person has been forbidden entry.

81
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,350
That person's wife just gave birth.

82
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,860
Yes.

83
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,550
She's in the airport's medical center now and waiting for the father.

84
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,240
Look here, Team Leader Yang Seo Goon. Immigration is a place where rules and policies are followed, not emotions.

85
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,130
I am not saying that we should go against the rule, but show some leniency.

86
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,560
I am not saying to lift the entry ban, but to let him see the child's face.

87
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,860
Humanely. Can't we do that?

88
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,090
Relaxing the rules just once may remain as the wrong precedent.

89
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,140
A person's good intentions can be abused so much.

90
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,900
So? Can't we do it?

91
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,160
We can't.

92
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,820
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

93
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,360
Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

94
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,270
In the end, what you said was right.

95
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,610
I... there's nothing that I can change.

96
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,640
It's a girl. Security Team's Na Yeong Joo sent a photo.

97
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,520
The baby is so pretty.

98
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,570
You said ... you told me it was outside our duty.

99
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,360
But then, not being able to see her dad's face

100
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,830
What could that be?

101
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,130
Yes, this is Security Team Oh Dae Gi.

102
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,400
This is Passenger Service Team Lee Soo Yeon. How is the mother's condition right now?

103
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,270
She's fine. But what about it?

104
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,230
Ah, yes.

105
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,490
This is to an extent my own thoughts and something I ask as a personal favor.

106
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,640
It may be something that requires taking responsibility.

107
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,770
So... if you don't agree...

108
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,090
You can opt out of it.

109
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,620
Where do I need to go?

110
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,700
Let's go together.

111
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,610
Air or land?

112
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,620
To Gate 246.

113
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,010
Pardon?

114
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,210
Aigoo, so scary.

115
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,550
What's the matter?

116
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,830
Can you answer the phone?

117
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,930
Yes, this is Security Team Park Jung Won.

118
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah, it's Oh Dae Gi.

119
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,180
Yes, Sunbaenim. What's the matter?

120
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,260
Yes.

121
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,310
But, Sunbaenim, that's against the rules.

122
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,470
I will take responsibility.

123
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,020
If there is a problem, you can just say that you were following my orders.

124
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,890
Understand?

125
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,500
What? I can't do that.

126
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,290
Please. Please. Please.

127
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,870
Please.

128
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,620
Please.

129
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,620
All ready.

130
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,540
Sunbaenim, will you really be okay?

131
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,510
Let's go.

132
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:54,650
♫ Some day in your life, running in different ways ♫

133

Our baby...

150
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,070
Isn't she so cute? She looks like me.

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:28,870
♬ Sometimes when I see it, I'm lost in my own eyes  ♬

164
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,230
I'm Lee Gi Baek from Immigration Office.

165
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,910
Team Leader Yang.

166
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,630
We have to go to the Immigration Office.

167
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,620
What's wrong?

168
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,710
I think the kids caused trouble.

169
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,170
Kids?

170
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,640
Which kids?

171
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,140
What happened? What's this situation?

172
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,810
They took without authorization the person denied entry from the designated boarding gate.

173
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,240
You guys, did you do it?

174
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,020
I ordered them to do it. It's my responsibility.

175
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,470
Hey! Oh Dae Gi! You punk!

176
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,910
It was a favor I asked.

177
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,850
I know it was going beyond rules, but it was not illegal.

178
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,990
The passenger forbidden entry was on the airside with the security team watching him.

179
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,500
And looked at his wife and daughter who was outside.

180
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,590
Ian Santos and his family were under our jurisdiction.

181
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,160
It means that you can't cross that line carelessly.

182
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,100
I didn't cross the line. But can you consider it as you and I having

183
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,280
a different concept of what is the right thing?

184
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,640
Entry and departure is our jurisdiction. We are at the border.

185
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,790
The individual's situation, whether it is a matter of an individual's personal perspective

186
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,820
or concept of right or wrong is not considered.

187
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,800
We can't even re-consider.

188
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,800
The sanctity of the border takes priority over anything personal.

189
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,580
Do you understand?

190
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,310
We will set up a joint investigation team for this. Will you accept responsibility? You know you must.

191
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,610
Know that I am holding you accountable.

192
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,350
You should ask me to take that responsibility.

193
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,400
The truth is I ordered them to do that.

194
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,390
They just followed my orders.

195
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,390
So I will be the one to be investigated and to take responsibility.

196
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,220
And ... for the Security Team as well. They did it under my orders.

197
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,380
I will take responsibility together with Team Leader Yang.

198
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,820
These people, seriously!

199
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,260
Excuse me for interrupting, but it's time for the flight.

200
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,910
He needs to board within ten minutes.

201
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,100
No. He can't board until the investigation is over.

202
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,500
- Pardon?
- In this situation, the couple must be investigated together.

203
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,540
So, for the time being, they will be together in the investigation room.

204
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,170
Chief.

205
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,400
For returning to his country, let's have him take the next flight.

206
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,950
Then.

207
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:29,630
Lee Soo Yeon, did Chief just say that the couple will be together?

208
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,940
Yes. I think so.

209
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,590
Chief!

210
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,000
She's so beautiful.

211
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,880
That's right. She takes after you.

212
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,220
Thank God, he gave us you.

213
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,050
The boundary between people.

214
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,430
The boundary between rules and tolerance.

215
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,100
The warning is up to tomorrow. Because after tomorrow, it will be a mandatory enforcement.

216
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,700
Please take care of the additional fixtures.

217
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,800
Well, a very very picky person has come as team leader of Passenger Service.

218
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm so stressed lately.

219
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,770
The boundary between understanding and perspective.

220
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,170
Before leaving work, each of you submit ten written letters of apology.

221
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,080
Did you say ten of them?

222
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,390
Why, is that too few?

223
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,560
No.

224
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,650
We'll write ten letters.

225
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,450
And for next week, Lee Soo Yeon will monitor the progress of construction of the operations rest area.

226
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,110
Han Yeo Reum, for one week starting tomorrow, you'll come in an hour early to make rounds in the field.

227
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,490
It's the punishment for the commotion that the two of you caused.

228
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,290
Okay, let's all go home.

229
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,020
Yes.

230
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,970
Should I leave now as well?

231
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:19,610
Lee Soo Yeon and Han Yeo Reum, you two. Please do things in moderation. I beg you.

232
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,220
Let's look around the operations rest area together at the end of the day when it's at full use.

233
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,330
We don't need to do that.

234
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,390
Let's just each take care of his own punishment.

235
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,180
The aircraft is scheduled to enter domestic airspace in 10 minutes.

236
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:52,030
And also, the boundary between hearts.

237
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,110
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

238
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,990
Then I'll be leaving first since I have plans.

239
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,930
Yes, go ahead.

240
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,340
The countless boundaries that are created like that.

241
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,150
Just passed the boundary and entered South Korean airspace.

242
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,210
Personnel Record

243

Level 1 of physical disability
Wearing a walking assist device

245
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:04,080
Where am I standing on that boundary right now?

246
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,920
Go Eun Seob, aren't you going home?

247
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,960
Go ahead first. I have some work to do.

248
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,370
Admit it already. At this point, you're dating.

249
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,360
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be landing shortly.

250
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,780
Please fasten your seatbelt

251
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,180
and return your seat back, foot rest and tray table to the upright position.

252
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,220
Seoul approach NA609. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

253
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,020
Number one engine failure due to fire in engine.

254
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,180
We are 15 miles on final.

255
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,200
We think birds strike in engine.

256
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,530
Attention, Incheon Control Tower. We inform you there is a Full Emergency passing!

257
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,880
Flight number NA609, plane type Boeing 767,

258
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,730
there's a fire in the number one engine.

259
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,820
19:25 Full Emergency occurred

Right engine failure

261
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,460
Mom.

262
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,320
♫ Always in my mind ♫

263
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,240
♫ The same memory which is a question mark ♫

264
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,250
