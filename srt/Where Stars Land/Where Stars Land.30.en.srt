1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,350
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,570
Thank you.

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,440
It seems like you have a fever. Are you really alright?

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,790
I know it's the illness. I'm alright.

5
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,670
That illness you know ... can it be cured?

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,650
What is it? What can we do about this silence?

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,100
You must like Han Yeo Reum a lot.

8
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,690
So I do not like you much, but ...

9
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,420
on the other hand, I think she is fortunate.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,750
Anyway, it looks like you're a good person.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,150
What you are saying now, can I ask what you mean by that?

12
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,310
Agent Lee Soo Yeon. Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

13
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,360
Agent Lee Soo Yeon, where are you now?

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,810
Section Chief Gong is complaining that Agent Lee Soo Yeon is constantly not coming in to work.

15
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,730
Look here, Han Yeo Reum. Is Lee Soo Yeon not here yet?

16
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,460
What is he doing that he's not able to come?

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,280
Yes, I'm contacting him right now.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,770
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

19
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,310
It's me. This is not Lee Soo Yeon, it's Go Eun Seob.

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,360
Go Eun Seob? Why are you replying? What about Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

21
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,600
Oh. I met Lee Soo Yeon here in the Network Operations department when I came to meet you.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,810
He seems to be really busy.

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,190
- So instead, I replied on his behalf.
- Is that so?

24
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,270
He's not sick, right?

25
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,990
Feeling sick? Where?

26
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,450
Agent Lee Soo Yeon is sick?

27
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,860
If not, that's fine. I got it.

28
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,210
I'll take care of things here.

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,290
Tell Agent Lee Soo Yeon to take it easy. All right?

30
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,020
Okay, okay. Don't push yourself too hard. Work in moderation.

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,780
Don't do ten jobs. In moderation, understand?

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,120
Go Eun Seob, did you come back as my friend again?

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,070
Of course, we're friends. Well... When was it different?

34
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,550
Anyway... It's nice to have you back, friend!

35
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,410
Hey, Han Yeo Reum. What are you doing there?

36
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,540
Ah, yes. I'm coming.

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,320
Hey, he's annoyed again.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,560
Let's talk later!

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,580
It got disconnected.

40
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,380
Thank you.

41
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,380
Excuse me, could you please get rid of these flowers from here?

42
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,080
Miss, do you know about flowers?

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,750
I don't know. However, I know that you shouldn't do this here.

44
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,380
With Ranunculus as the main,

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,100
- can you see we've used a variety of roses?
- What?

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,830
And Is the harmony of the white, pink and deep purple lisianthus too much?

47
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,700
Beautiful!

48
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,500
I know it's an honor to be able to see this type of work.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,190
You can't install unauthorized work here.

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,370
We'll clean up everything.

51
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,980
Look here, is not the airport a public facility?

52
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,250
Public facilities are available for everybody to use. You know, right?

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,010
Exhibitions and performances are possible only with permission from the airport administration.

54
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,140
If an unauthorized person places unauthorized items here like this—

55
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,680
This is work.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,210
Oh my god. My art...

57
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,830
In my heart...

58
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,090
In any case its inconvenient for passengers who are passing by

59
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,350
or they could get hurt, so I'll clean it up. Let's go.

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,890
All of you take your hands off right now!

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,350
Scary... Wasn't I scary enough?

62
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,070
Hey, how dare you!

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,760
No. That's not what I meant.

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,970
Aigoo. They're really expensive. These and these over here are the most expensive ones.

65
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,050
What should I do? Do you know how expensive that is?

66
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,350
Excuse me, Unni. Can't you let it slide just once?

67
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,690
Please let it slide once.

68
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,460
Unni...

69
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,570
Aren't I scary?

70
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,520
But, Oppa... Oppa, those flowers are expensive!

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,380
We see all sorts ...

72
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,200
Do you know who I am?

73
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,500
Thank you.

74
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,320
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

75
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,780
Did you get angry with me?

76
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,790
No. Why do you think I'm angry?

77
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,330
No. It's just... A bit awkward.

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,070
Let's just say we are in the middle of looking for the right street.

79
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,910
In any case, I let you know that I didn't want to be your superior.

80
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,420
I needed to straighten that out ...

81
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,100
In the process, you shouldn't feel any pressure, even in the slightest way.

82
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,400
You're okay. I'm okay, too. I'm just looking for the happy medium.

83
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,930
Until we find the appropriate distance, I would just like to look at you. Would that be difficult?

84
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,340
No. It's alright.

85
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,230
Okay. Thank you for understanding.

86
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,660
But, I mean ...

87
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,830
What do you like about me?

88
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,540
Just... I like everything about you.

89
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,370
I like your brusqueness

90
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,970
and your tough exterior is adorable

91
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,340
and what else about you?

92
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,000
In my eyes, all the actions you take ... I like them all.

93
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,850
I'm sorry. I crossed the line again, right?

94
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,990
No. I asked you to do something you didn't want to do.

95
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,220
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,180
Still, thank you.

97
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,950
You gave me a chance to say this.

98
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,110
Let's go.

99
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,520
Get back to your senses!

100
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,350
Section Chief Gong, what are you doing there?

101
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,210
What is it? What is it? What is it?

102
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,310
The guy with the notebook. He keeps writing everything down.

103
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,110
From my perspective, I think he is sort of like the pre-assessment team.

104
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,290
Ah, really?

105
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,700
But, why are you peeking at him?

106
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,280
What was it... "If you know the enemy and know yourself"?
(Quote from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War")

107
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,390
- You are always victorious!
- Exactly!

108
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,270
We must know in advance what issues the pre-assessment team will raise.

109
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,580
Because we will then provide the appropriate countermeasures.

110
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Don't you think so?

111
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,280
Then I'm off in a rush!

112
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,830
Let's go together!

113
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,310
Oh, Go Eun Seob. Are you still here?

114
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,410
Oh?

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
Ah...

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,120
What about Lee Soo Yeon? Were you not together?

117
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,200
Ah, who?

118
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,670
Ah... Lee Soo Yeon!

119
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,780
Oh, right. We were together.

120
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,640
Hey, why are you being like this? It's strange.

121
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,110
What? Me? Why me? What's strange about me?

122
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,210
Oh, this clothing.

123
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,710
This is something my mother bought which isn't to my taste. I hadn't tried it on.

124
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,640
But once I tried it on, I went out wearing it. Is it strange?

125
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,050
No. Your clothes are not strange, you are strange.

126
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,620
What is it? Did anything happen?

127
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,650
No, nothing happened. The thing is that...

128
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,340
Oh, Han Yeo Reum.

129
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,850
Oh, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

130
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,390
What did you do there?

131
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,520
Assistant Nam told me to put the items in order inside.

132
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,870
There were so many items, I was very busy so I didn't get your text.

133
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,760
Ah, I see.

134
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,830
Is that right? That supply room is no joke.

135
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,770
Assistant Nam told you to do that, right?

136
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,610
Hey, Han Yeo Reum. I'm going.

137
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,530
Oh, good bye. See you again, Go Eun Seob!

138
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,740
Is he so good?

139
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,760
Thank you.

140
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,960
What? That's annoying.

141
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,700
It's not like you are sick or something, right?

142
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,130
Me? It's not like that.

143
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,450
Then, I'm glad.

144
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,400
Do you know it's been two months since we came here?

145
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,310
Is it that long already?

146
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,040
The two of us have walked so many times like this.

147
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,000
I know, right?

148
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,210
I want to walk hand in hand with you.

149
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,720
We must go hand in hand here when we go on vacation. Okay?

150
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,180
Lee Soo Yeon.

151
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,970
Lee Soo Yeon.

152
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm alright. I'm alright.

153
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,960
Ah. First, let's go down to the medical center.

154
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,730
I'm alright. Just wait a moment.

155
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,650
- Lee Soo Yeon.
- Wait a moment.

156
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,260
Toilet

157
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,970
Ah, what should I do?

158
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,970
What do I do?

159
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,350
Mister Jang

160
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,920
Han Yeo Reum

161
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,830
I understand. I'm coming there.

162
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,180
Thank you for calling me, Han Yeo Reum.

163
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,570
I asked you to shut up!

164
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,770
Who did you fight with?

165
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,980
Bad people.

166
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,080
- Bullies?
- Maybe.

167
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,330
What happened? Weren't you extradited?

168
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,430
Ah, why are you being like this? I took a psychotropic drug.

169
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,870
I raised a knife but I never intended to hurt someone.

170
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,450
It happened because I was taken aback. I reflected on myself.

171
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,590
Besides that, my boss is very skillful.

172
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,890
He introduced me to a guarantor and he gave me the bail money.

173
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,540
Huh? He came out in a flash like that!

174
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,340
What do you want? Do you want to keep talking about it here?

175
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,780
Or shall we go somewhere else?

176
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,410
Seo In Woo

177
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,760
Han Yeo Reum.

178
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,010
This is serious. I'm in trouble. I need you to go to the men's bathroom now!

179
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,420
What's wrong? What's going on?

180
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,320
Anyway, It seems Lee Soo Yeon is in danger.

181
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,100
Pardon? Lee Soo Yeon is not there?

182
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,300
Only this was left behind.

183
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,300
What are you talking about? Lee Soo Yeon disappeared?

184
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,450
I'm here in the bus terminal's men's bathroom

185
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,440
Lee Soo Yeon disappeared without a trace and without his radio.

186
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,790
He doesn't even have his cell phone.

187
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,090
Could you scan the CCTV for this area?

188
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,580
Okay. Wait a moment and let me see it.

189
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,450
Ah, he's coming out.

190
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,350
It seems like he's heading to the parking lot.

191
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,120
At ground parking 1, moving east to 230.

192
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,540
They have been down for only three minutes.

193
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,680
Lee Soo Yeon?

194
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,770
Move right now to Ground parking Level 1, east to 230.

195
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,590
I'm sending backup now, so don't act rashly.

196
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,470
Understood, Oh Dae Gi?

197
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,660
Yes, I understand.

198
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,960
- Hyeon Jun.
- Yes.

199
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,730
Security Team on standby now, go to Ground 1 east to 230.

200
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,570
I will get more detailed directions from Deputy Oh.

201
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,910
Yes, I understand.

202
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,790
Na Yeong Joo, stay in your present position with Han Yeo Reum.

203
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,750
What about you, Sunbaenim?

204
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,610
Lee Soo Yeon is on the move in the ground level parking lot. I'm going to try to catch up.

205
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,620
I will go too.

206
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,680
Na Yeong Joo, you...

207
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,500
You are so stubborn.

208
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,920
Mister Jang, where are you now?

209
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm now passing by the parking lot on the second floor.

210
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,340
What about Lee Soo Yeon?

211
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,240
Han Yeo Reum, let's meet first. Where are you now?

212
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,360
Where should I go?

213
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:17,540
Seo In Woo

214
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,390
General Manager Gwon: Look, Team Leader Seo. I don't this is going to work.

215
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,390
Director Jo

216
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,370
Let's talk for a second.

217
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,930
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

218
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,040
This happened because of you!

219
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,370
Because of me? What do you mean?

220
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,300
Do you know Jo Won Ho, right? President Shin's right-hand man.

221
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,060
He is attached to some sort of CEO, a plausible title.

222
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,040
He is the person who does all sorts of dirty work behind the scenes.

223
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,030
What do you want me to find out from me now?

224
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,870
Do you remember when I told you before one of my best friends was a scholarship student?

225
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,980
He was in the press. One day he planned an article opposing Geosan.

226
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,590
A week after that, he died in a car accident.

227
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,310
He was stuck in the car in a river due to not knowing how to drive and being drunk while driving.

228
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,960
But my friend could never drink a single glass of alcohol.

229
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,480
After the incident, the National Intelligence Service stuck an agent on Jo Won Ho.

230
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,160
And that's why Team Leader Seo In Woo is under surveillance.

231
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm really curious why it's Lee Soo Yeon?

232
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,480
I know that he was your younger brother at one point.

233
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,400
But why does Jo Won Ho keep messing with Lee Soo Yeon?

234
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,790
What else does that mean?

235
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,250
You're asking because you really don't know?

236
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,490
I don't, that's why I'm asking. What does that mean?

237
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,960
Now swarms of Jo Won Ho's men have come to the airport. They have taken Lee Soo Yeon,

238
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,400
Is it really something you do not know?

239
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,990
Who has taken Lee Soo Yeon?

240
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,400
What? What's the current situation, Team Leader Choi?

241
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,860
Hey, stop there!

242
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,960
What's the deal suddenly with you uniformed dudes?

243
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,790
Where are you taking our airport's employee?

244
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,250
I'm not taking him, I'm just going together with him.

245
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,530
We need to have a serious conversation with each other.

246
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,390
A conversation? Nowadays, do you have a conversation like this?

247
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,690
That doesn't concern you.

248
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,710
Please just let me go with them.

249
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,910
Lee Soo Yeon.

250
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,330
It's my business. I can handle it myself.

251
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,500
If you have a confrontation here, many people could be uselessly hurt.

252
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,400
Please step aside.

253
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,070
Do you see?

254
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,540
We aren't taking him by force.

255
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,690
Okay, can you please get out of our way now?

256
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,630
I'm sorry but we won't step aside.

257
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,430
Oh Dae Gi.

258
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,830
We received instructions to stop Lee Soo Yeon from leaving the airport.

259
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,790
So, where is Lee Soo Yeon?

260
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,730
Right now, the Security Team followed him.

261
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,480
What should we do? I think those are the same bad guys whom he fought last night.

262
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
Yesterday... Did he fight again?

263
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,690
Yes, I think so.

264
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,260
But that's not what I made it for.

265
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,120
What should I do? What can I do?

266
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,820
We must stop Soo Yeon.

267
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,490
Pardon?

268
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,720
Director Jo

269
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,580
I will bring Soo Yeon back.

270
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,220
So don't make a big fuss at the airport and just let Soo Yeon go with them.

271
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,520
How can you say that?

272
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,000
Just send him? Are you telling him to go die?

273
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,160
If we go up against those people, they have nothing to lose. But we're different.

274
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,420
The fact that violence takes place within the airport will be a problem.

275
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,630
No. I can not approve it.

276
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,080
Soo Yeon will not die.

277
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,090
This time, there's no way I'll run away.

278
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,760
So trust me and just let him go.

279
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,420
For now, that is the best we can do.

280
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,030
No, Team Leader Choi. That's not right.

281
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,760
What I'm saying now is more useful than your needless sentimentalism.

282
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,540
Team Leader Choi, you know I'm right.

283
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,880
Director Jo

284
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,040
Oh Dae Gi.

285
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,700
If the Security Team gets hurt by mistake, then the situation will be out of control.

286
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,050
Please back off.

287
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,710
Oh Dae Gi, are you listening to me?

288
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,700
Yes, Team Leader. Tell me.

289
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,990
The Security Team... will now withdraw from there.

290
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,760
But, Team Leader...

291
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,290
Don't say anything. First withdraw from there, Oh Dae Gi.

292
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,260
This... will stop Soo Yeon.

293
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,800
Back off, Oh Dae Gi. Hurry!

294
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,320
♫ I want to go down and read ♫

295
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,720
♫ the feelings which I wrote to you ♫

296
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,020
♫ whom I like so much I could die ♫

297
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:53,160
♫ If I do that, won't  ♫

298
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,570
♫ everything change? ♫

299
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:01,750
♫ I dreamed that for a while. ♫

300
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,840
