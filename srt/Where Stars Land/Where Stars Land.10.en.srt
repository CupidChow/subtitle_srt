1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,860
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,350
It's this way!

3
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,410
You did well in the emergency treatment.

4
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,950
Pardon?

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,680
First, let's escort her outside.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,420
Yes, I understand.

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,150
Be careful.

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,180
Let's go out.

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,180
Na Yeong Joo!

10
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,180
Ah, yes.

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,260
It's been confirmed that the right engine and wing fire have been extinguished 100%.

12
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,210
The 252 passengers were all safely evacuated from the plane.

13
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,750
What about the injured?

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,470
That's a relief that there's no big accident.

15
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,720
Yes. We went to the West Port authority.

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,970
We told them that we will have the runways back to normal as soon as possible.

17
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,170
You've worked hard.

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,380
I need to report to the Chairman, so keep on working.

19
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,920
Try to minimize the number of complaints which come in. Do you understand?

20
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,930
What about the press. Is it all settled?

21
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,770
Yeah. Somewhat.

22
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,440
It seems like everyone was expecting a really big accident.

23
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,410
They had unexpectedly disappointed expressions.

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,610
Are all the passengers out?

25
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,600
Yes. I got the report that the last bus with the passengers just arrived.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,730
Ah, right! It seems like Han Yeo Reum's mother is on the last bus.

27
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,200
Thank you. It must have been hectic but you still found that out for me.

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,880
No problem. It was a request from you after all.

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,260
- Do you need anything else?
- No. Thank you.

30
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,180
I thought you would be in the family waiting room.

31
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,420
This is the place I could meet the passengers the fastest.

32
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,600
I am using that as an advantage.

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,960
Give that to me and go. The last bus has just arrived.

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,550
Pardon?

35
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,310
She was hurt but it's nothing serious.

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,790
- Miss, please give me water.
- Oh, yes!

37
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,660
That's enough. Hurry and go.

38
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,300
I'll be right back!

39
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,570
Do you need anything else?

40
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,450
She acts so tough but the more you know her, you see she's gentle.

41
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,910
I'm talking about Sunbae Seo Goon.

42
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,690
I'm sorry but I don't want to talk about her with you.

43
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,780
Two years have passed and you're still mad.

44
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,470
I'm sorry but I always hold grudges.

45
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,790
Ahhh... so you want to continue to be uncomfortable.

46
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,930
You're uncomfortable?

47
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,320
Well, a little?

48
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,240
Then... keep being uncomfortable.

49
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,000
About Lee Soo Yeon.

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,960
Has his use of a walking assist device been reported to Security?

51
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,670
Mom!

52
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,690
Yeo Reum!

53
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,530
Mom!

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:12,110
♬  Some day in your life
running in different ways ♬

55
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,280
Did you wait long?

56
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,320
Of course! I was dying worrying about you!

57
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,410
Why would you be worried?

58
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,310
Did you forget my life is super ultra elastic?

59
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,090
Seriously!

60
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,690
♫ Will I know
Or see the way of life  ♫

61
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm okay.
♫ So lay down just for one night ♫

62
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,810
♬ So I will never lose you in my eyes.  ♬

63
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:49,250
♫ Will I know
Or see the way of life  ♫

64
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,060
♬ Will I ever know what is going on even if I close my eyes  ♬

65
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,710
♬ Will I ever see you,  ♬

66
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,110
♬ mystic world? ♬

67
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,220
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,530
You know that Lee Soo Yeon has Disability Level 1, right?

69
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,110
For someone who has disability level 1, to live a normal lifestyle,

70
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,310
how is it possible? Don't you find it strange?

71
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,430
That's because he has a walking assist device.

72
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,340
By any chance, do you know what kind of walking assist device he has? Have you seen it?

73
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,450
What is it? What's this guy's real identity?

74
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,120
Just ordinary ... a new employee who wants a salary-earner's life.

75
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,160
So whatever you saw, forget it. It's a request.

76
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,700
Have you seen it?

77
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,060
I won't comment.

78
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,870
It's the Security Team's business.

79
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,750
Literally, Security Team means safety. We will do what needs to be done. Then.

80
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,880
I am Team Leader Yang Seo Goon who is Han Yeo Reum's superior.

81
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,450
You don't have to get up.

82
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,050
My daughter is troubling you a lot, right?

83
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes, a little.

84
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,450
You're here.

85
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,590
What is it?

86
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,370
We received a report that during the evacuation you injured another passenger.

87
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,530
Excuse me?

88
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,960
You've got the wrong person. I'm not that kind of person.

89
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,160
You're right. It is him.

90
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,270
First, since a report was made, you need to be investigated. Come with us.

91
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,190
I told you I'm not that kind of person! What do you think I am?

92
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,720
Should we take you forcefully?

93
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,560
Seriously.

94
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,020
Where do I need to go?

95
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,750
This way.

96
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,050
Status: Ready For Boarding

97
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,610
We're sorry. Have a wonderful flight.

98
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,210
Have a wonderful flight.

99
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,480
Aigoo. It's a relief that it ended without a big accident.

100
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,750
Well... you have worked hard. For the rest, the next shift will take over, so you can go—

101
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,180
I'm going.

102
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,970
I haven't even finished talking. Leaving with the speed of light ...

103
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,370
All the young ones are like that.

104
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

105
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,730
- No.
- Give her to me.

106
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,720
You're already late, what should we do?

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,050
No. I sent a message explaining the situation.

108
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm going.

109
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,430
Go on.

110
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,990
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

111
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,380
- Yes. Go on.
- Yes.

112
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,100
Thank you.

113
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,600
You've worked hard.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,570
Yes.

115
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,890
But still, you need to finish writing.

116
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,360
Yes.

117
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,370
- But then, Sunbaenim...
- What?

118
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,140
- About Lee Soo Yeon from Passenger Service Team ... Why was he there?
- There? Where?

119
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,110
Didn't you see that Lee Soo Yeon was there, on the site?

120
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,870
I didn't. What would a member of the Passenger Service team be doing on the runway?

121
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,400
Maybe you saw wrong.

122
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,920
Go home safely.

123
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,030
Mom. Where are you?

124
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,790
I'm on my way home.

125
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,710
You're going home? Alone? Right now?

126
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,420
I'm tired. I need to wash up and rest quickly.

127
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,340
No, Mom! How could you just leave? We should have had dinner.

128
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,900
It's not right for you to go just like this, after making your daughter worry.

129
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,930
It's enough that I have seen your face. Do you have time on the weekend? Can you come?

130
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,670
I'm moving. It's my moving day.

131
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,300
Is that so? I should come if I have time.

132
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,560
Will you really be okay to go alone? What about your forehead?

133
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm okay. Oh, by the way. About your friend...

134
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,010
Friend? Who?

135
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,850
That... the one who placed a cold compress on my head on the plane.

136
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,160
Perhaps, are you Yoon Hye Won?

137
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,170
Yes. What about it?

138
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,400
Who are you?

139
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,760
I'm Han Yeo Reum's friend.

140
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,310
Thank him for me. Tell him that I have troubled him.

141
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,490
Who is that?

142
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,840
The subway is here. I'm hanging up.

143
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,700
Friend? Who?

144
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,540
No. It's not us. When we came, someone had already given her first aid.

145
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,890
Really?

146
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,740
That's strange. She said it was my friend.

147
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,980
Ask Lee Soo Yeon.

148
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,550
Lee Soo Yeon? Why?

149
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,950
You will know when you ask him directly.

150
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,850
Han Yeo Reum

151
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,460
Are you okay?

152
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,080
No.

153
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,010
Can you walk?

154
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,240
My legs are fine.

155
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,550
First, get in the car.

156
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,690
Han Yeo Reum.

157
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,170
The subscriber can't answer the phone right now...

158
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,820
Woah! Lee Soo Yeon did not appear until the end.

159
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,350
We sent so many messages.

160
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,710
I sent a total of four.

161
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,570
See! We sent four and he completely ignored us.

162
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,580
He's not feeling well. I got a message saying he was going to head home first.

163
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,470
All of a sudden? Why is he not feeling well all of a sudden?

164
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,860
You have all worked hard. Don't be late tomorrow.

165
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,130
Don't forget to come in an hour early tomorrow.

166
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,100
Yes, Team Leader.

167
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,930
What is it? How did it go? I heard the plane was on fire and it had a crash landing.

168
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,540
It was not a crash landing, it was an emergency landing.

169
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,100
Why is it so quiet? It's an emergency. Emergency!

170
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,070
See you tomorrow.

171
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,860
What is it? What happened, Section Chief Gong?

172
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,700
The situation is over, Team Leader Heo.

173
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,570
It is over?

174
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,610
Team Leader Yang!

175
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,490
Then you should have said so! I came all the way back from Seoul! Stress!

176
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,620
How about a drink on the way?

177
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,050
Because of my wife, I will be going first. I'm sorry.

178
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,660
Me too, I have a prior engagement.

179
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,770
Team Leader Lee, a drink on the way home?

180
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,190
Han Yeo Reum. How did it go? Is your mom okay?

181
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,390
Yeah. She hurt her forehead but it's not serious.

182
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,300
That's a relief. Where are you now? I'm on my way to you.

183
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,150
Right now? What should I do? I'm already out of the airport.

184
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,270
Already? Where are you going to sleep? You said you have nowhere to go.

185
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,300
I'll call you later. Bye.

186
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,950
Where is she going?

187
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,070
Fox Bride & Fox Bride Star

188
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,560
Did something happen?

189
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,010
- Team Leader Seo.
- What brings you here?

190
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,470
I've come to this store I frequent, but they're closed.

191
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,000
What about you?

192
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,500
I also suddenly thought of an old place I used to frequent.

193
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,940
I went around and it seems like the owner changed.

194
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,670
It's been a while since ownership has changed. It's really been a long time for you.

195
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,220
About twelve years.

196
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,760
Since the last time was eating with a punk who was like my brother.

197
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,060
And coincidentally an accident happened that day.

198
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,590
Because of that accident, that brother's arm and leg was severely damaged.

199
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,530
So after that incident, I was not able to see him again.

200
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,400
- And then?
- Then?

201
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,360
I met that punk again not too long ago.

202
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,270
You must have been glad.

203
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,510
To say it exactly...

204
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,610
that punk appeared before me.

205
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,590
And what is the reason for you to be saying this to me?

206
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,820
Perhaps you know the reason.

207
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,310
Why that punk appeared before me?

208
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,310
How could he be back looking so normal?

209
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,340
- What do you mean?
- You brought him.

210
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,710
That punk Soo Yeon.

211
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,920
Why did you bring him to T2?

212
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,830
Did it just happen or did he ask you to take him?

213
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,780
I wonder which is it.

214
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,910
It looks like the conductor is the problem.

215
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,670
But it's a relief that you can't feel the pain.

216
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,570
It must have hurt a lot.

217
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,590
Come to my studio tomorrow morning. Until then, don't out on the assist device.

218
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,390
If something else happens, it will be a pain.

219
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,510
I... I really don't have to worry, right?

220
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,220
You need to rest for a day.

221
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,170
To fix it would need half a day.

222
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,640
What?

223
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,050
The truth is ... I'm scared.

224
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,660
That you won't be able to use your arm?

225
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,220
That people might see.

226
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:57,230
I can't forget the look the people gave me.

227
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,430
It was the first time I knew that it even a look could hurt.

228
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,800
I don't want to feel that again.

229
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,260
You won't.

230
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,090
I told you I will make it that way.

231
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,900
Don't be late in coming tomorrow.

232
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,140
There is only one thing I wished for.

233
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,550
To live an ordinary life.

234
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,360
You know, just an ordinary life like everyone else.

235
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,250
Just like an ordinary life.

236
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,940
I just wanted to live like that.

237
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,230
Han Yeo Reum.

238
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,200
I brought your bag.

239
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,940
I am in front of the cafe where we met when it rained.

240
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:02,160
♫ I wonder about the person quietly worrying about me ♫

241
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,230
♫ Tell me more about yourself. ♫

242
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:17,300
♫ My heart which was not heavy gradually saw you ♫

243
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:23,040
♫ When I kept looking, it grew more intense ♫

244
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,320
♫ It was an accident like fate ♫

245
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,120
♫ I got close to you and reached out ♫

246
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:43,890
♫ In the moment which seemed to be an instant coming like fate  ♫

247
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,270
♫ I felt it when I saw you ♫

248
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,720
♫ The small bit of warmth left in my hand ♫

249
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,180
♫ I want to place in your hand ♫

250
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:11,700
♫ Yearning for you more than anyone becomes a warm summer ♫

251
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,860
♫ It melts my heart. ♫

252
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,480
♫ My heart is in your hands ♫

253
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,310
♫ I say I want to place in your hands ♫

254
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,270
♫ Yearning for you more than anyone becomes a warm summer ♫

255
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,480
♫ It melts my heart. ♫

256
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Lee Soo Yeon.

257
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,810
I'm fine.

258
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm asking you to hold it for a while.

259
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,810
Yes.

260
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,410
But ... what's wrong with your arm?

261
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,960
I heard you're not feeling well. Did you hurt yourself?

262
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,160
You don't need to know. Bye.

263
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,930
Perhaps, did you meet my mom?

264
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,180
Someone went inside the plane and treated her wound

265
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,280
and told her he was my friend.

266
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,450
Perhaps... it was you.

267
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,870
No.

268
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,970
Earlier, why did you ask for my mom's name?

269
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,170
Just ...

270
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,160
- It's a lie.
- It's not.

271
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,720
Na Yeong Joo saw.

272
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,720
- What?
- She saw you in the plane.

273
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,790
Why?

274
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,390
Why did you go in?

275
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,850
- Why did you come all the way here?
- Because I was curious.

276
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,720
About what?

277
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,760
Perhaps, do you like to secretly do good deeds?

278
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,740
No.

279
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,180
- Then, do you like playing the hero?
- No.

280
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,060
Then perhaps, do you like me?

281
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,250
Yes.

282
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:32,100
♫ I think every moment I walk rest and speak ♫

283
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:39,220
♫ is a moment which is more than just your coming to me. ♫

284
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:56,730
♫ Even a day you aren't there is entirely only you ♫

285
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:06,430
♫ Even if I try to forget you already it is only you ♫

286
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:16,380
♫ At the end of the dream of a rough and unusual day  ♫

287
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,250
♫ It is you. ♫

288
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,460
Where Stars Land♫
