1
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,790
What kind of dream did I have?

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,610
Maybe

3
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,930
Maybe, that all of those things

4
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,550
may be possible in my life,

5
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,670
so will I, too, as I am, be all right?

6
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,590
It's the dream I had.

7
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,710
Let's die together!!!

8
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,380
Let me go... hurry up and let me go!

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,260
- Shut up!
- Let go and talk!

10
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,690
How can I let you go when I love you this much!

11
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,490
But you still love me!?!

12
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,850
Customer, please wait.

13
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,180
Shut up! Go away!

14
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,490
Let go of this first! She might choke!

15
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,820
Be quiet!

16
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,100
Han Yeo Reum!

17
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,250
Han Yeo Reum, are you okay?

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,960
Han Yeo Reum? Han Yeo Reum?

19
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,280
Han Yeo Reum.... Han Yeo Reum?

20
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,610
Han Yeo Reum, wake up!

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,170
I have to go.

22
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,050
What do I do, Lee Soo Yeon?

23
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes, Yeo Reum. Where are you?

24
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,410
Lee Soo Yeon, this is Na Yeong Joo. Han Yeo Reum is hurt.

25
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,130
- Look at the blood!... Are you okay?... Please wake up!

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,610
I'm sorry!

27
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,150
Lee Soo Yeon...

28
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,570
Lee Soo Yeon, are you listening to me?

29
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,410
Lee Soo Yeon.

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,760
Lee Soo Yeon!

31
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,370
Hel-Hello?

32
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,080
Passenger Service Team Lee Soo Yeon

33
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,430
This is Oh Dae Gi from Security. A suspect with weapon has been located at the check-in desk on the first floor.

34
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,720
A Passenger Services agent has been injured. I have the suspect.

35
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,400
I request emergency backup!

36
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,010
- Sunbaenim!
- Stop right there!

37
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,410
The suspect who had a weapon at the eastside information desk is on the run.

38
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,100
Requesting assistance from all patrol teams in the vicinity of area 3.

39
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,930
Move! Move! Move!

40
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,520
Sorry! Excuse me!

41
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,320
Passengers heading to Yongsan, you can board now first. Please come this way.

42
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,870
Yes.

43
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,640
Passengers heading to Bangbae-dong, please wait for a moment. It'll take 20 minutes.

44
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,040
Han Yeo Reum, are you able to stand?

45
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,930
What about Lee Soo Yeon?

46
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,600
I called him, but our call was disconnected.

47
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,380
Oh no...

48
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,340
Can you give me my phone? My phone...

49
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,410
She is still bleeding. We need to move her quickly to the emergency room.

50
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,020
Let's go to the hospital first. I'll try to call Lee Soo Yeon later.

51
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,130
Do you think you can stand?

52
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,620
What do I do?

53
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,720
He's going to be waiting a long time for me.

54
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,110
Excuse me, do you need some help?

55
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,650
Are you alright?

56
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,560
Those kinds of dreams

57
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,660
were still not ones I was supposed to have.

58
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,690
An Excuse from Helplessness

59
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,710
- Where is Yeo Reum?
- Please go in here for now.

60
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes.

61
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,960
Hey, Oh Dae Gi, what wrong with you?

62
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,230
First you lose your radio and now you lose a guy you had captured.

63
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,700
- I'm sorry.
- What happened this time?

64
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,450
I was sure I detained him and while I was communicating on the TCC...

65
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,930
Na Yeong Joo, what were you doing?

66
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,990
I was watching over Han Yeo Reum.

67
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,140
Things do not appear to be going well.

68
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,230
In any case, an armed person entered our airport,

69
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,760
harmed one of our employees and has now escaped.

70
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,820
A Security Team agent was at the scene, but still lost him.

71
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,160
And a lot of people witnessed it.

72
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,220
Not just through SNS, but reporters are reporting this unfavorably.

73
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,500
I have no excuse. I take full responsibility.

74
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,350
I'm not saying this for you to take the blame, Oh Dae Gi.

75
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,040
You should realize what can result from a moment of neglect.

76
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,900
I'm telling you to reflect on this and to pay attention and not make this mistake again! Do you hear me?

77
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,710
How's your nose?

78
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,820
Thankfully, they said it isn't broken.

79
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,130
Yes, Team Leader Yang.

80
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,260
Yes. What about Han Yeo Reum?

81
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,520
Really?

82
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,870
They made twelve stitches on her left arm but she is well otherwise.

83
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,640
But she seems to have suffered a lot of shock. She just took a sedative and went to sleep.

84
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,850
What happened to the guy who got away?

85
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,610
Really?... I understand.

86
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,800
Keep me updated on the status.

87
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,110
Lee Soo Yeon, what happened to you?

88
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,120
What happened?

89
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,540
- Soo Yeon...
- Who did that to Han Yeo Reum?

90
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,050
It was someone who used to date the person at the information desk.

91
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,160
He was unhappy about a recent breakup. Han Yeo Reum got hurt when she was trying to stop him.

92
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,900
I thought I heard you say he got away?

93
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,300
The police are looking for him now.

94
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,620
But you, what happened to you? Why have you come out looking like that?

95
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,510
Soo Yeon... Lee Soo Yeon!

96
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,270
Team Leader, what are you doing here?

97
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,830
Was Lee Soo Yeon here?

98
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,690
What's the problem?

99
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,460
I just got a call from the General Manager.

100
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,340
- Why did he call?
- He must have seen the news.

101
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,100
He called to yell at me because you weren't answering your phone.

102
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,910
I understand. I'll call and report to him,

103
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,370
so please don't concern yourself with this.

104
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,040
Yes, I understand.

105
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,350
- You're here.
- Oh, Eun Seob.

106
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,150
Is she hurt a lot?

107
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,780
The urgent care is done. She was given a sedative and is sleeping now.

108
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,150
Eun Seob. Do you know who is Lee Soo Yeon?

109
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,620
She kept calling for him before she fell asleep.

110
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,720
Do you know who he is?

111
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,850
Go Eun Seob

112
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Korea University Hospital Airport Medical Center

113
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,560
I love you Seung Hee. You know my heart, right?

114
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,730
Where is that man right now?

115
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,830
You know where he is, right?

116
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,150
I don't know. I already told the police everything I know.

117
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,550
Next time, it could be you who is hurt.

118
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,740
Whether I report him or not, he's going to get away again.

119
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,300
Then he'll retaliate two- or three-fold.

120
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,860
No, I don't want to say anything.

121
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,080
I will make sure

122
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,520
he won't ever be able to retaliate. I promise.

123
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,930
Where is he right now?

124
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,650
This is the man. There is a PC room he goes to frequently.

125
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,690
Wha... What are you, you bastard!

126
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,610
Do you want to die?

127
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,560
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

128
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,260
I'm also going.

129
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,010
- Goodbye!
- Aren't you leaving?

130
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,100
You can leave.

131
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,270
Should I get that?

132
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,080
This is the Security Team... Excuse me?

133
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,840
Who are you?

134
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,580
What's wrong?

135
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,010
Na Yeong Joo, you can go home. Han Joon, come with me.

136
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,850
Yes sir.

137
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,510
What happened? I heard they found Nam Dong Gaek in the airport bathroom.

138
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,870
We found him severely beaten up in the men's bathroom landside on the east.

139
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,760
- Where is he now?

140
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,280
Who are those people?

141
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,780
They seem to be with Nam Dong Gaek. But they seem to be a bit... sketchy.

142
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,870
Did you locate where the call came from?

143
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,950
It was a payphone near the airport.

144
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,900
He seems to be moving knowing exactly where the CCTV cameras are.

145
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,720
Look, he doesn't look at the cameras even once.

146
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,300
What do you think?

147
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,870
- About what?
- Our friend with the hood.

148
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,300
Doesn't he look familiar?

149
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,400
No, I don't know.

150
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,440
You really don't know?

151
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,340
He's wearing a hood and a mask.

152
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,540
How can I recognize him?

153
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,410
Really? There is someone he reminds me of.

154
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,270
Don't accuse anyone based on a hunch.

155
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,010
You act like you know whom I'm thinking about.

156
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,730
I told you, you've got it wrong.

157
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,470
You said he wanted to live an ordinary life. That's why I'm turning a blind eye.

158
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,810
If it's going to be used to harm someone,

159
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,960
I can't pretend not to know about it anymore.

160
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,780
You know what I mean, right?

161
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,510
Accusing without evidence

162
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,530
is a form of assault as well.

163
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,860
You know what I mean, right?

164
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,490
Soo Yeon hit someone?

165
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,650
I told Choi Moo Ja that it wasn't,

166
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,840
but based on the CCTV footage, I think it is Soo Yeon.

167
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,490
You must have seen something incorrectly.

168
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,620
Soo Yeon isn't someone who would hurt anyone. You know that.

169
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,080
Han Yeo Reum was hurt in a knife attack.

170
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,810
And a little while later, the person who hurt Han Yeo Reum

171
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,620
was found beaten up in the airport bathroom.

172
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,420
Have you been in contact with Soo Yeon?

173
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,020
He's not answering his phone. What do we do?

174
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,700
Mister Jang

175
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,690
Na Yeoung Joo. I thought I told you to go home. Why are you still here?

176
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,310
What happened to the assault victim?

177
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,100
I just saw them transfer him from the ER into police custody.

178
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,580
He used a knife and ran away, so I'm sure he will be detained.

179
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,960
But ... were you waiting because you were curious?

180
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,740
Your nose.

181
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,040
What... nose?

182
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,950
This is an ointment that works really well.

183
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,020
This is something used a lot by athletes. If you use this, you will heal quickly.

184
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,110
Aren't you going to accept it?

185
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,280
Don't tell me that... you waited here to give this to me?

186
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,240
I didn't realize it would be this late. I didn't wait long really.

187
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,520
Don't be concerned.

188
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,290
Have you eaten?

189
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,660
If you haven't, you can eat with me before heading home.

190
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,990
No, thank you. I have a date with my boyfriend.

191
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,810
Boyfriend?

192
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,880
Boyfriend.

193
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,590
Well then...

194
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,310
I hope you recover quickly and will be healthy.

195
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,390
May I sit next to you?

196
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,630
Na Yeong Joo?

197
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,520
What about your boyfriend?

198
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,590
He had something urgent come up.

199
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,640
Yes, that's why...

200
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,350
Good. I didn't want to eat alone.

201
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,750
Can I eat with you?

202
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,680
Thank you, Na Yeong Joo.

203
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,410
Excuse me?

204
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,630
For the ointment, I mean.

205
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,700
I'll use it well.

206
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,460
Yes.

207
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,850
Thanks a lot for today, Eun Seob.

208
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,310
My pleasure. Are you going to rest?

209
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,310
I was going to. And tomorrow is Sunday.

210
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,680
Then I'll come back tomorrow as well.

211
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,740
Sure. Take care.

212
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,170
Is someone here?

213
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,130
Did you come?

214
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm sorry. You waited long for me, right?

215
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,970
Don't look at me that way.

216
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,360
I'm... fine.

217
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,240
You, are saying that again.

218
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,420
I'm okay.

219
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,950
I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me.

220
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm fine.

221
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,100
I'll be fine alone too.

222
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,660
I'm fine. I can go by myself.

223
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,330
I'm fine. I'm really alright.

224
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:26,730
Those words... that can never make me feel at ease.

225
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,400
Did you hit someone?

226
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,330
Lee Soo Yeon, I'm asking if you hit someone.

227
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,970
Yes, I did.

228
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,400
That first time you put on the assist device, do you remember what I said?

229
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,160
This new strength you gained is not yours.

230
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,430
It's a gift for the 'normal life' that you wanted.

231
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,100
So don't use that gift carelessly.

232
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,450
You can't use it to hurt someone or for personal gain.

233
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,010
He was a bad man.

234
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,400
The police are supposed to get the bad guys, not you!

235
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,860
But the person I love got hurt. Am I supposed to just do nothing?

236
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,320
A piece of trash who would hurt an innocent person...

237
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,150
I thought I could punish him!

238
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,700
I have the strength to do so!

239
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,380
If there was only one bad guy on this earth...

240
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,990
Fine... then you can do that. But that's not the case!

241
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,660
This world is full of bad and immoral people.

242
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,990
Everywhere you look, there are bad people everywhere!

243
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,810
Do you think beating up one will make a difference?

244
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,760
At least, I can protect the people who matter to me.

245
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,330
Protect them? How?

246
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,050
You don't even know what will happen to your body!

247
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,200
Don't get greedy, Soo Yeon.

248
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,670
Ordinary routine, ordinary life,

249
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,690
it's just until that. Alright?

250
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,370
Just until that.

251
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,000
Call taxi for the disabled
77 waiting, 18 vacant vehicles (subject to changing)
Estimated waiting time 2 h 38 min.

252
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,240
Call taxi for the disabled
61 waiting, 15 vacant vehicles (subject to changing).
Estimated waiting time: 2 h 7 min.

253
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,480
Call taxi for the disabled
56 waiting, 13 vacant vehicles (subject to changing).
Estimated waiting time: 1 hour and 59 minutes.

254
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,710
The only thing I could do then,

255
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,550
was just until that.

256
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,480
