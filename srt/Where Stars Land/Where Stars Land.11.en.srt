Where Stars Land

2
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,990
Perhaps, do you like to secretly do good deeds?

3
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,670
No.

4
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,030
Then, do you like playing the hero?

5
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,990
No.

6
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,820
Then perhaps, do you like me?

7
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,070
That's what she asked me.

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,080
♬ Even a day you aren't there is entirely only you  ♬

9

♬ Even if I try to forget you, already it is only you ♬

♫ At the end of the dream of a rough and unusual day  ♫

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,850
♬  It is you. ♬

12
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,020
♫ My heart won't let you leave.  ♫
Yes.

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
That's how he responded.

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:38,860
♫ Every walking, resting, and talking moment  ♫

15
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:48,980
♫ is all time looking forward to you. Every moment I am waiting feels that way. ♫

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,500
♫ Running while watching the clock, right now I'm going to see you ♫

17
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:06,910
♫ The moment is so happy that I shed tears ♫

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,870
Yeo Reum

20
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,460
Han Yeo Reum!

21
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,560
What are you doing?

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,810
Huh? Oh...

23
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,870
What about you? What are you doing here?

24
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,370
I was sitting just waiting for you. Because it suddenly started raining.

25
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,340
Did something happen?

26
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,310
What's wrong?

27
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,870
It's just a bit...

28
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,810
What is it?

29
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,290
Lee Soo Yeon...

30
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,090
What is it with Lee Soo Yeon?

31
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,500
Did that jerk upset you again?

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,150
He said

33
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,920
that he likes me.

34
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,730
Why did you bring Soo Yeon to T2?

35
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,260
Did it just happen or did he ask you to take him?

36
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,060
What if it just happened? And what would be different if he had asked?

37
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,990
He thinks

38
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,120
that I made his life become miserable.

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,140
What of it? You think he came to T2 because he holds a grudge?

40
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,960
Because of you? Isn't that a serious leap in logic?

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,090
Do you know what the actual leap in logic is?

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,410
It's seeing Soo Yeon as he is now.

43
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,560
Walking on two legs and using two hands, two arms, as if nothing were wrong.

44
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,460
What's wrong with that? What's wrong with him using his legs and arms?

45
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,210
That's not

46
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,080
realistic at all.

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,970
He definitely damaged the nerves in his right arm and leg in that accident.

48
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,030
On paper, it clearly says "Level 1 of physical disability".

49
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,860
So?

50
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,670
- He's too normal.
- Is that so wrong?

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,900
Yes, that is absolutely impossible.

52
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,790
You know, sometimes,

53
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,770
things that are unbelievable by the world's standards,

54
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,210
happen to some people, like miracles.

55
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,560
And Lee Soo Yeon just happened to have such a miracle occur to him.

56
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,440
All of that is coincidence ... and there was a miracle?

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,900
You might not believe it, but it's the truth.

58
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,530
So, what about common sense and disability?

59
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,430
Don't force your personal standards everywhere.

60
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,020
You shouldn't go around messing with other people's lives.

61
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,590
Understand?

62
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,040
Then let me ask again.

63
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,150
That arm of Soo Yeon's,

64
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,460
what is it?

65
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,400
What you call a miracle and something that just happened.

66
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,420
What really is that unbelievable arm?

67
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,420
What the heck is it?

68
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,060
To some people, these unbelievable events

69
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,500
happen, like a miracle.

70
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,100
And to other people, as if by fate, fleeting moments

71
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,990
happen as if they were meant to happen.

72
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,740
Where Stars Land

73
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,390
So what are you going to do about it?

74
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,830
Do about what?

75
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,940
You said that Lee Soo Yeon likes you. So is today

76
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,990
- your Day 1?
- What? Day 1?

77
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,890
Hey! That's ridiculous!

78
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,660
My plate is already too full.

79
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,810
When I've got enough to worry about, having no place to live, Day 1 with Lee Soo Yeon?!

80
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,800
- Do I look as if I could start that?
- Is that the case?

81
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,830
Of course it is! And an office romance at that— Wow!

82
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,500
Just the thought of it is so much pressure.

83
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,710
I'm going to tell Lee Soo Yeon as soon as I get to work tomorrow.

84
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,340
- How?
- Firmly.

85
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,950
Please fix my right arm, right now.

86
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,400
What? Is something wrong with it?

87
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,820
Is there any pain?

88
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,150
No, just because...

89
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,700
Just because what? What's wrong with it?

90
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,260
I just...

91
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,570
I want to go to work tomorrow.

92
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,540
Work?

93
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,240
Yes.

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,070
Just because you want to go to work, you came here at this late hour?

95
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes.

Episode 11

97
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,200
Ow, my arm. Tap, tap, tap!

98
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,690
Sunbaenim, is Na Yeong Joo struggling with something?

99
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,890
Na Yeong Joo.

100
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,100
You're fighting well this morning.

101
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,790
Are you stressed out over something?

102
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,350
No, nothing like that.

103
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,620
Okay then.

104
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,220
Would you like to go a round with me?

105
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,460
Huh?

106
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,420
Don't you need someone to practice with?

107
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,850
Should we then?

108

Agent Lee Soo Yeon, I don't think it will work out between us.

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:12,450
An office romance at the same office, in the same department at that, is...

119
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,780
An office romance? That word sounds too direct.

♫ To you, to you, to you. ♫

121

Agent Lee Soo Yeon, I don't think it will work out.

122
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,260
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything yesterday.

123
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,390
I'm really sorry.

124
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,770
What are you sorry about?

125
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,980
Oh my gosh. Section Chief.

126
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,130
What? What is it about?

127
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,600
Pardon? What do you mean?

128
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,630
You said you'd pretend you didn't hear it.

129
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,420
What did Lee Soo Yeon say that you're pretending not to have heard it?

130
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,930
Nothing. It wasn't anything.

131
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,330
What is it?

132
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,750
Lee Soo Yeon, did he...

133
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,410
ask to borrow money?

134
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,930
- What?
- How much?

135
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,700
No, Section Chief, it wasn't that.

136
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,360
As someone with more life experience, I'm warning you to be careful when it comes to money.

137
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,520
Nine times out of ten you will lose both the money and the person.

138
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,220
It really isn't about money, really.

139
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,810
I understand. I'll pretend I didn't hear it either.

140
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,540
Listen to me. Don't end up regretting it later.

141
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,020
Aren't you coming in?

142
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,910
Yes, I'm coming!

143
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,050
Lee Soo Yeon, I don't think it will work out. I'll pretend I didn't hear anything yesterday. I'm really sorry.

144
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,330
- Lee Soo Yeon.
- Yes!

145
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,160
Ah, sorry. I thought you were calling me.

146
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,780
By any chance, do you need some money, Lee Soo Yeon?

147
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,030
Pardon?

148
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,640
I mean, I was just wondering if you suddenly needed some money.

149
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,040
No, there's nothing like that.

150
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,930
Really?

151
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,720
Oh, that's a good thing then.

152
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,020
You two don't need any money?

153
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,360
No,

154
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,270
You shouldn't borrow money from each other.

155
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,630
I'm just saying this because I heard something.

156
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,990
Borrowing money is something you should never do with colleagues at work.

157
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,650
If you really have an urgent need, then come to me instead.

158
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,990
Understand?

159
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
Everyone worked hard until late yesterday.

160
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,330
From the response to the emergency to the orderly handling of the conclusion

161
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,110
our airport has been found to be very capable.

162
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,400
No passenger, relative of a passenger, or airline filed a complaint.

163
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,250
After I left work, I got a text just as I was entering Seoul.

164
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,210
So I turned my car back around. And traffic was so terrible.

165
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,790
Yes, you worked hard.

166
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,090
It looks like the president is personally coming this afternoon to praise your efforts.

167
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,710
The president? Then we'll have to clear our afternoon schedule.

168
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,830
The performance indicator, which was plateauing, is rising again.

169
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,050
Even customer complaints, which are the biggest headache, are on the decline.

170
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,680
Team Leader Yang, in particular. In the last few days, since you transferred,

171
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,540
Passenger Service Team complaints have been halved.

172
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,260
Then... If we keep going this way, it will not be a problem to reach our target for this year.

173
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,350
Let's keep working hard until the year-end ASQ*.
(Airport Service Quality assessment)

174
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,260
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,180
Since the president is coming, let's keep this meeting short.

176
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,200
But before that, I'd like to ask the Security Team something.

177
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,820
About what?

178
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,950
How are you currently handling employees

179
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,540
who use assisted walking devices?

180
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,780
I'm not specifically handling disabled employees who use an assisted walking device.

181
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,940
Because there is a personal privacy issue, there is a self-report system.

182
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,920
Why all of a sudden?

183
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,000
There is an employee in an operating department who was diagnosed with a Level 1 disability,

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I don't think it is a simple arm or leg prosthetic, but a walking assist device which is being used.

185
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,390
What is the problem with that?

186
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,130
I think it is a model which has never been seen before.

187
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,520
Have you confirmed whether its safety was properly established?

188
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,180
Did you not hear what Team Leader Choi just said?

189
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,460
I'm asking if you've checked into it.

190
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,100
He said it's an employee's privacy matter.

191
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,280
An airport is at the first level of security!

192
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,730
Not only is it at the same security level as the Blue House*,
(The Korean President's residence and work place)

193
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,160
but security takes precedence over personal privacy.

194
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,990
For any perceptible risk

195
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm just saying that it should be checked first. You should understand.

196
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,580
Is there something I don't know? Why is a person's assisted walking device a perceptible risk?

197
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,530
Team Leader Seo, don't you think what you are saying is ridiculous?

198
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,700
Shall we discuss this, Sunbae Yang, after we determine whether what I am saying makes sense or not?

199
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,500
Which employee is this? Whose department is it?

200
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,540
Team Leader Yang, is it someone in your department?

201
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,320
Or is it someone in Team Leader Choi's department?

202
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,630
Oh, this is so frustrating. Who is it?

203
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,090
- Look, Team Leader Choi.
- Yes, General Manager.

204
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,780
You should check out what Team Leader Seo In Woo is saying about the risk.

205
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,250
Report to me before the week is over.

206
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,690
Yes, sir, I will.

207
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,030
- Director!
- Now, now. Let's all just focus on the president today.

208
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,070
Team Leader Choi, are you really going to investigate Lee Soo Yeon?

209
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,300
I have to, since the order was given.

210
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,030
Must you dig into someone who wants to simply wants to do his job?

211
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,990
Seo In Woo expressed his opinion and the Director ordered me to do so.

212
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,030
It's not an issue I can just bury now.

213
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,510
The moment you start digging into it, Lee Soo Yeon is going to quit.

214
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,030
That's his own decision.

215
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,250
- Moo Ja.
- What can I do?

216
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,850
He has to go through this to gain experience. This is the world of adults.

217
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,630
All I wanted was a quiet, normal life.

218
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,780
Like this, side by side with someone...

219
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,890
Today's daily routine ... Living as usual today

220
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,510
Excuse me, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

221
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,560
I have something to say.

222
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes, go ahead.

223
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,050
So, about what we talked about last night ...

224
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,680
Yes?

225
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,530
Because we had such a conversation,

226
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:14,020
how do I put it ... it doesn't mean yesterday was Day 1, right?

227
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,140
Day 1?

228
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,950
You said, "yes," to me yesterday.

229
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,080
Ah, is that what it means?

230
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,410
Doesn't it?

231
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,500
It's not that.

232
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm sorry. I didn't think that far.

233
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,440
Then why did you say "yes"?

234
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,930
Since you asked.

235
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,400
I expected you to say "no."

236
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,150
Why is that so?

237
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,110
Last time, you definitely said so.

238
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,810
You are full of self-victimization, low self-esteem,

239
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,580
self-pity, animosity against the world, lame excuses

240
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,770
And futile efforts... You definitely ignored me.

241
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,860
I think I already apologized for that.

242
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,480
In any case ... I'm a little caught off-guard by this situation.

243
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,510
In which way specifically?

244
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,910
The part where

245
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,840
you said that you liked me.

246
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,670
Why would it?

247
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,060
Why me of all people?

248
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,810
So, I...

249
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,710
I'm too average.

250
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,520
Compared to you who is so great and does everything well, I am ...

251
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,120
insignificant and someone who isn't even seen.

252
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,430
So, perhaps ... did you think I'm too easy?

253
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,720
I never thought of you in that way.

254
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,900
Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense.

255
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,290
Why do you like me? How long have you known me?

256
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,840
It's only been three weeks.

257
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,540
Does the amount of time really matter?

258
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,620
It could take three weeks to move a heart. Or it could take three years.

259
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,820
It could even take three seconds.

260
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,190
Three seconds?

261
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,330
You can like someone after three seconds?

262
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,550
A person's first memory of someone could be different from the other's.

263
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,900
You do remember, don't you?

264
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,230
You definitely remember that accident a year ago, don't you?

265
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,950
Right?

266
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,840
Her first memory of me was that accident.

267
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,890
My first memory of her was that place.

268
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,070
Fox Bride Star.

269
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,070
[Fox Bride Star]

270
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,240
Do these people even know how to use their eyes?

271
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,370
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,430
Hello!

273
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,080
It's so good to see you!

274
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
Nice to see you!

275
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,190
- Step aside.
- Who are you?

276
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,310
Team Leader.

277
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,590
We're here. How have you been?

278
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,290
Hello!

279
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,010
What brings you here?

280
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,750
What else? We're just trying to make ends meet.

281
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,820
When you threw away our rice bowl,

282
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,630
my kids and I have had a hard time making a living.

283
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,680
Even if it's hard to make a living, it seems you have enough money to drink.

284
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,480
You reek of alcohol.

285
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,350
Please release the valet parking service again.

286
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,320
Don't try to grab onto work you're not allowed to do.

287
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,710
I'm not here to negotiate. I've come to fight until I get it, Team Leader Lee.

288
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,380
That's enough, just go back.

289
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,690
Is that so? Then we have no choice.

290
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,450
- Boys!
- Yes.

291
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,210
Lie down.

292
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,150
Let's lie down.

293
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,650
Lie down? Here?

294
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,400
Let's lie down.

295
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,110
I'm so tired.

296
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,520
Yes.

297
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,960
Team Leader Lee, what is this ruckus?

298
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,850
Didn't you hear that the president is coming this afternoon?

299
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,500
I know.

300
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,110
When these guys lie down, it takes some time.

301
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,890
What should we do?

302
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,040
Why are you asking me? You should resolve it.

303
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,880
Do whatever it takes to get rid of these people.

304
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,050
Team Leader, what should we do?

305
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,190
Can you carry these guys?

306
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,350
How could I? Their sizes...

307
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,290
Then leave them alone. Don't waste your energy.

308
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,090
Let's take a nap.

309
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,920
Yes, Hyungnim.

310
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,560
Give me some coffee.

311
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,400
What a sight! The collection of all the tatoos makes a landscape.

312
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,090
Wow. Isn't Team Leader Lee being too laid back?

313
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,140
The president is coming. It doesn't look as if he's going to take care of this.

314
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,330
Don't say. Is he trying to screw him over?

315
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,370
What? Screw him over?

316
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,670
You didn't know?

317
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,920
The two of them used to be best friends.

318
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,330
But when he was promoted to General Manager, they became complete enemies.

319
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,170
Really? Then why did the General Manager bring him here?

320
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,660
So that's what makes him a scary person.

321
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,720
