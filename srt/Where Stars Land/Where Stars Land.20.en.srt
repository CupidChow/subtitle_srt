1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,400
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,500
Episode 20
Hello?

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,200
If you have my radio with you, can you hear my voice?

4
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,740
If you have my radio... You're listening to me, right?

5
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,480
Can I give it a try?

6
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,740
Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi. Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi, where are you?

7
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,300
Oh Dae Gi's~not here! I said he's not here, why do you keep looking for him?

8
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,630
He only answers if I call him by your name.

9
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,800
Look here, sir! That radio is not something you should be playing with.

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,160
I don't know who you are but I demand that you return it to me this instant.

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,300
The act of not returning things you've found is also considered as theft.

12
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,970
Elder!

13
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,600
Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,900
Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi.

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,780
Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi!

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,870
Who are you?

17
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm Oh Dae Gi from the Security Team.

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,590
- This crazy guy...
- What?

19
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,730
Who's he calling Oh Dae Gi when he's Oh Dae Gi?

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,130
It's not like that. This is because you are not answering me.

21
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,120
So... You want to find your radio?

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Yes, I hope you return it back by all means because it's an important thing for security.

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,920
Then sit down.

24
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,500
- What?
 - I said to sit down.

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,490
Yes, I sat down.

26
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,170
Stand up.

27
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,130
I stood up.

28
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,010
Sit down again.

29
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,090
I sat down.

30
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,050
Look at you lying. You must not want your radio back.

31
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,320
- Elder. Perhaps, you are looking at us now?
- Sit down.

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,930
Elder, stop playing.

33
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,060
Playing?!

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm testing you to see how badly you want your radio back.

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,770
So... You want to find your radio? Then, sit down.

36
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,310
Elder!

37
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,610
Elder!

38
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,290
Elder!

39
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,130
I told you that I'd treat you.

40
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,800
We aren't allowed to accept anything from others.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,120
And especially you, since you're associated with the airport.

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,350
Are you dating that man from before? Are you two a couple in the same office?

43
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,520
Oh, my god.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,110
Right, you were popular with boys since high school. Right?

45
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,580
What do you want to talk about?

46
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,010
You seem to be busy so I'll make it short. Get me four fast-track tickets.

47
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm actually flying some VIPs out next week.

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,500
Do they have physical disabilities?

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,560
Their personalities are a bit difficult. I told you, they're V-I-P.

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,650
Fast-track was made for passengers that have difficulties moving around.

51
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,890
Regular customers, even if they're VIP, can't use Fast-track.

52
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,940
So that's why I'm asking you.

53
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,490
Isn't it a piece of cake for you since you're on the Passenger Service team?

54
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,010
What are friends for?

55
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,190
Have you ever been a friend of mine?

56
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,780
Will you do it?

57
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,240
No, I can't.

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,850
And I have no desire to. If you really want it that badly, go about it the proper way.

59
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,500
Please ask the airline directly by yourself.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,410
Will you keep doing this?

61
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,480
If you keep acting like this, I'm going to want to open my mouth again.

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,040
This time, who do you want me to go to? To that man who was next to you earlier?

63
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,210
Or should I go to your office and blab it out? Would you be okay with that?

64
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,790
Look down.

65
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,670
Get it for me by this weekend. It's just four passes.

66
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,930
Thank you for yesterday. I apologize for the late greetings.

67
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,410
What happened in the parking lot yesterday?

68
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,860
How did you break the car like that?

69
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,460
How exactly are you sick and how serious is it? Is it an illness that causes seizures?

70
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,080
Do I need to talk about it to you?

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,180
Of course not.

72
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,590
But, I wonder if it's something I should tell Yeo Reum.

73
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,120
Including what I saw at your house yesterday.

74
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,940
You saw? What did you see?

75
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,850
It was in the room.

76
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,100
I ended up seeing it.

77
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,680
I've told you this before but Han Yeo Reum and I, we talk about everything, even our deepest thoughts.

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,160
Wouldn't it be better if you told her about it yourself than her hearing it accidentally from me?

79
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,330
It's not a matter for you to talk about that easily.

80
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,000
You said you like Yeo Reum?

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,050
Yes, I like her.

82
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,460
If you like her, don't you think there shouldn't be any secrets?

83
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,220
Because I like her, there is something I want to hide from her.

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,790
Is that so?

85
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,450
Then, I can't help telling Yeo Reum what I've seen either.

86
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,580
Even if I ask you not to, you're going to tell her?

87
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm not your friend. I'm Yeo Reum's friend.

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,680
I don't want her to get along with someone who's trying to hide something from her.

89
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,590
So, please, Lee Soo Yeon, tell her directly.

90
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,400
I'll give you until the end of the week.

91
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,750
Focaccia set please. Put the coffee in mugs instead of plastic cups. No need for straws.

92
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,470
And I just need exactly two paper napkins.

93
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,930
Just help yourself.

94
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,880
No. I have no appetite.

95
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,640
Are you not eating because I bought it?

96
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,220
Just wait until that jokester gets caught...

97
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,660
Are... Are your injuries okay?

98
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,670
I'm fine. I used to get these kind of injuries in the past when I was a professional athlete.

99
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,550
I'm talking about your shoulder.

100
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,830
So... Did you see it?

101
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,650
Long-time friends who are athletes tend to attack directly.

102
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,190
But the punks we deal with don't care if others get hurt or not.

103
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,780
So... don't just run into situations like that. You'll end up really getting hurt.

104
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,490
Do you understand?

105
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,690
And endure it until the end of this month.

106
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,170
Next month, when we get three new members, I'll change your team.

107
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,840
Yesterday, I was a bit harsh.

108
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,470
But you were making demands in front of my juniors, so ...

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,590
After you left, I regretted it a lot.

110
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,410
I'll switch your team for you. If it's really that difficult, then I have no choice.

111
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,520
Why are you coming back alone? You didn't meet Lee Soo Yeon?

112
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,070
I met him but we were in different sections.

113
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,880
I plan on going around one more time later.

114
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,170
Good work. The thing about work is, it's only fun when you're doing your own work.

115
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,590
If it's someone else's work, you really don't want to do it.

116
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,780
Excuse me, Section Chief Gong...

117
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,230
Ah, what is it?

118
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,710
About the Fast-track card, which department can I get that from?

119
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,480
It's the Operations Planning Team.

120
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,780
The Operations Planning Team?

121
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,520
After being approved by the Team Leader of the Operations Planning Department, it's handed over to the Airport Love Team. But why?

122
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,450
What? It's nothing.

123
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,170
How is the highway construction proposal going?

124
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,440
It's still under review.

125
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,690
Check that quickly.

126
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,480
This time, since the counters requested by J2 Airlines and PV Airlines are overlapping, then...

127
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:30,370
Ah... I was just passing by. Then...

128
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,950
First, go to the Public Relations Team. I'll catch up with you soon.

129
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,530
Yes.

130
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,510
This is really driving me crazy!

131
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,960
What do I do? I can't ask the favor, but I can't not ask either.

132
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,880
What kind of favor I can do?

133
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,000
Team Leader.

134
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,450
Do you have something you want to ask me?

135
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,400
Ah, that thing is...

136
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,180
Han Yeo Reum

137
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,040
Just tell me. Let me hear what kind of request you have.

138
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,740
I mean that thing is...

139
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,540
Han Yeo Reum?

140
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,770
I can't. I really can't tell you about it.

141
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,600
So, let's do this.

142
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,010
Why don't we both do favors to each other?

143
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,060
You do what I asked of you yesterday. And I'll grant your request.

144
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,030
I'm sorry, but I can not do that.

145
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,350
There's so much I don't know about Lee Soo Yeon either,

146
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,520
and I don't know how my getting involved between you two can help.

147
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,150
I don't think your request is something I can do anything about.

148
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,660
What did he request from you?

149
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,390
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

150
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,630
What did this person ask you to do?

151
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,740
No need for you to know. I was just rejected anyway.

152
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,410
I asked Han Yeo Reum.

153
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,070
Aren't you going to answer me?

154
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,550
Team Leader Seo wanted to be on better terms with you.

155
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,900
He said you were brothers once.

156
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,100
Did you even talk about that?

157
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,710
With Han Yeo Reum?

158
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,270
I assumed that Han Yeo Reum knew it.

159
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,130
But when I brought it up, she didn't seem to know much about you.

160
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,480
About the fact that you and I were family for a while,

161
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
about the accident twelve years ago,

162
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,480
and also about your current condition.

163
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,620
But... Han Yeo Reum, have you not felt curious about it, not even once?

164
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,090
What do you mean?

165
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,320
You saw Lee Soo Yeon's personnel record on my desk.

166
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,520
You must have seen it clearly written that he has a level 1 of disability.

167
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,610
Usually a level 1 disability is a serious disability in the arms or legs.

168
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,900
It means it's difficult to move on one's own.

169
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,070
But somehow, Lee Soo Yeon ambulates freely and without any abnormality

170
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,670
and, even more, he has this strange super strength.

171
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,400
Han Yeo Reum, have you really never felt curious about it?

172
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,980
I just thought there would be a reason for that, or it could have been an error in the record.

173
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,450
I know it has nothing to do with an error in the record.

174
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,990
Soo Yeon, would you like to answer?

175
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,550
How in the world is that possible?

176
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,940
What exactly are you hiding underneath your clothes?

177
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,950
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

178
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,830
I'm sorry.

179
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:58,220
Everyone has something within them that they wish to keep hidden.

180
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:20,270
♫ Someday in your life, running in different ways ♫

181
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,970
♫ Can someone come and take me to my way? ♫

182
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,390
I don't want anyone to see it.

183
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,290
♫ So lay down just for one night ♫

184
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,630
A secret I do not want to tell anyone...

185
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,460
♫ Will I know. Or see the way of life ♫

186
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,900
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

187
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,640
♫ Will I ever know what's going on? ♫

188
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,710
Look down.

189
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,420
♫ Will I ever see you, ♫

190
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,990
Stomp on her.

191
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,940
Just thinking about it still is a sharply cutting feeling,

192
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,130
a terribly painful memory

193
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,420
Those memories seem to appear in the most unexpected places,

194
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,920
they come out and strike me at present so that they are merciless.

195
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,180
♫ Every time I look at myself in the eyes  ♫

196
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:26,890
♫ Sometimes when I see it
I’m lost in my own eyes ♫

197
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,480
♫ Every time it feels like an ending for all  ♫

198
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,260
Agent Lee Soo Yeon. Where are you now?

199
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,960
♫ Maybe it's our day to stop  ♫

200
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,890
If you can hear me, please give me an answer.

201
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

202
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,400
Lee Soo Yeon.

203
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,800
♫ Life is too short to cry ♫

204
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:04,830
♫  Every time I look at myself in the eyes  ♫

205
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:13,100
♫ Sometimes when I see it, I'm lost in my own eyes  ♫

206
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,770
So what about your radio? You haven't found it yet?

207
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,880
Yes. I haven't found it yet.

208
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,940
Ah... Okay.

209
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,050
For the time being, you'll be on stand-by until you find it.

210
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,850
Na Yeong Joo.

211
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,150
You too be on stand-by with Oh Dae Gi. Every time other teams request help, provide them with support.

212
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,800
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

213
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,130
Team Leader, I'll be on stand-by alone. Please exclude Na Yeong Joo.

214
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:45,020
Why? Does it bother you that she'll suffer for her senior's sloppy work?

215
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,450
That's not a bad attitude to have. But, teamwork isn't only when things are good.

216
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,280
It's enduring together when things are bad and difficult.

217
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,970
Then, good teamwork is going to be created from it at the same time.

218
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,410
Do you have any objections to what I said?

219
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,830
No, sir, I don't.

220
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,580
If it pains you to see Na Yeong Joo suffering, then find the radio quickly.

221
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,660
Understand?

222
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,140
My husband

223
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,940
Yes, it's me. I was too busy to pick up the phone.

224
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,400
Did you finish the work needed on your business trip?

225
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,660
Okay, I got it. Be careful on your way back.

226
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,470
While it's important to work quickly, it's more important to do good work.

227
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,710
Because it's a rest area lounge for our employees.

228
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,470
Ah, yes. I understand.

229
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,290
Oh, look at the time!

230
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,690
It's a shame to part ways already. Should we stop somewhere for a drink?

231
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,860
What?

232
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,660
Ah, well...

233
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,060
Okay.

234
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,260
Let's go then! Let's have a drink and order some eel.

235
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,110
Han Yeo Reum, are you not leaving?

236
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,670
Ah, Lee Soo Yeon has not come back yet.

237
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,650
He'll be back when he's ready to come back. You can call it a day.

238
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,090
Yes, I understand.

239
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,710
Fast Track Pass

240
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,330
Now it's four, but next time it's going to be five...

241
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:24,170
If you keep going along with it, you'll end up in a position that you won't be able to handle.

242
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,720
Either get to that point and regret it, or stop it now.

243
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,850
You're the only one who can make that decision.

244
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,910
Team Leader.

245
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,750
Lee Soo Yeon will be fine. You don't have to worry about him.

246
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,590
Fast Track Pass

247
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,090
What brings you here at the end of the work day?

248
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,000
You needed 4 fast track passes, right?

249
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,500
I asked for them by the weekend, but you already got them?

250
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,510
See? I knew you could get them if you tried. Girl, thanks!

251
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,220
Do you happen to know this?

252
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,000
Because of you, I lived with no self-esteem or confidence.

253
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,670
My mom and dad both adored me to no end,

254
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,830
but I wasn't able to see their love.

255
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,220
Because the abuse and hate that you and your friends projected towards me,

256
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,350
it hurt so much.

257
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,170
Without hesitation, I would feel intimidated and cower.

258
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,080
Because I seemed ugly to myself.

259
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,080
Hey, why are you bringing up the past?

260
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,920
Those were pranks that everyone does when they're young.

261
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,570
They were just pranks to you?

262
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:33,490
To me, it was horror and felt like death.

263
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,820
"Should I have never been born?"

264
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,350
"Maybe it would be better if I wasn't living."

265
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,920
Those are some thoughts I had.

266
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,280
This isn't any fun.

267
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,290
Stop talking about the past and just give them to me.

268
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,490
Now I won't live like that anymore.

269
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,530
Han Yeo Reum! What are you doing now?

270
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,280
I won't concern myself with you coming and going in the airport, since it's your job.

271
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,040
However, let's not act like we know each other.

272
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,430
That's how I'm going to be with you.

273
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,450
You! Are you saying you're going to ignore me?

274
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,220
Yes.

275
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,780
Are you sure you won't regret it?

276
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,400
Yeah. So you also should live a proper life.

277
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,710
How old are you to still be acting this way?

278
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,860
Aren't you even embarrassed living that way?

279
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:49,350
Lee Soo Yeon, do you know why my name is Han Yeo Reum?

280
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,960
It's because I was born in the middle of summer.

281
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,350
Mom, it's me. What are you doing?

282
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,890
Did you have dinner?

283
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
Yes.

284
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,350
But the season I like the best is actually autumn.

285
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:19,150
Because I first met my parents in autumn.

286
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,450
How about you, Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

287
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,480
What is your favorite season?

288
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:32,090
It's summer. Because I first met you

289
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,460
in that season.

290
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,090
I'm sorry.

291
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,950
Truthfully,

292
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,390
I was excited.

293
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,500
Thank you.

294
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,050
In any case, I'm thankful.

295
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,010
Truthfully, I was shaking,

296
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,310
and my heart felt like it was going to explode.

297
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,110
You saw Lee Soo Yeon's personnel record on my desk.

298
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,660
You must've seen that it said Level 1 disability, too.

299
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,020
Like crazy,

300
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,390
and I was angry,

301
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,060
What? You think you found out the cause of it?

302
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,530
Yes. I think I know what it is.

303
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,220
What is it? What is causing the malfunctions?

304
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,870
Han Yeo Reum.

305
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:13,570
♫ If you see me today, my heart beats. ♫

306
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:20,560
♫ You comfort all my days. ♫

307
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,390
♬ Because I know you, the yearning for you makes my heart beat  ♬

308
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,070
Where Stars Land
