1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,930
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,410
You sure did buy a lot of stuff.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,930
Bags, shoes, and more bags,
Episode 6

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,550
wallets, and more bags, and more shoes...

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,630
Never mind this, Lady!

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,020
Those female employees who did this to me, BOTH of them!... bring them here right now.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,360
If not, I'll sue the whole airport immediately..

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,730
Especially that female in charge of security. Bring her and have her kneel in front of me immediately.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,700
What are you doing?!

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,670
First of all, that employee was wearing street clothes and she's never seen her before.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,130
Are you sure she said she was part of the security team?

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,790
Yes. She said she was leaving work.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,260
Who was the other female employee who was with her?

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,050
Team Leader Yang, how do you train your employees?

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,870
What are you saying?

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,510
I heard that Han Yeo Reum from your team used violence on a customer.

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,360
- Does this make any sense to you?
- Pardon?

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,070
Excuse me, Han Yeo Reum. Did you use violence on a female guest?

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,810
No, I didn't do that.

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,170
You and another security agent were on one side,

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,350
I heard you beat a female customer in the restroom in the customs area.

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,190
Han Yeo Reum, did you do that?

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,410
I think there must be a misunderstanding. We weren't at fault.

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,520
That customer was taking off the yellow customs sticker off her luggage secretly in the restroom.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,260
Never mind that. Who was the female agent who used force with you?

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,900
Give me her name.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,640
You know the female agent who was with you there at the time?

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,870
Give me her name.

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,430
What are you doing? Hurry up and tell her.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,940
You're not going to tell me?!

31
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,150
We'll take care of that issue ourselves.

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,130
This is a matter between the Passenger Services and Security Teams.

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,770
Team Leader Yang and I will take care of it.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,720
Moo Ja, the situation is not as good as I thought.

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,800
The victim has a wound on her face and she's making a fuss now saying she'll sue the airport.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,980
And on top of that, do you know whose daughter she is?

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,550
She is the daughter of National Assemblyman Cho! Assemblyman Cho!

38
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,350
What are you going to do about that?!

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,020
That guest was the one who started being violent.

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,500
She shouted first, and bit the agent's arm and slapped my face.

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,640
- So you joined her in a match?
- That's not what happened.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,060
- That's enough, Han Yeo Reum.
- But, Team Leader!

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,950
Team Leader Heo, I think you should stop, too.

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,970
Like Team Leader Choi said, this is a matter for Passenger Services and Security Teams.

45
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,400
You don't need to get involved.

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,500
A close friend of the Assemblyman's daughter is our client.

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,220
He personally called me and made such a fuss. How could I not get invo—

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,610
Give me the phone number. I'll handle it personally. Is that good enough?

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Han Yeo Reum, come see me.

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,760
Ugh, that trouble-maker, that Human Time Bomb.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,410
How could she cause such huge trouble right after arriving at T2?

52
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,850
This time she is a big napalm bomb! A napalm bomb!

53
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,050
How could she of all people to an Assemblyman's daughter?

54
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,790
Don't you agree, Heo—

55
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,350
It's okay. Since it's already occurred, we're just trying to resolve it.

56
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,310
Could you tell us the name of that female agent who was in the restroom with you?

57
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,530
Tell him honestly.

58
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:47,260
I'll say it once again, but I don't know what she or I did wrong.

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,020
That female customer was the one who took off the yellow customs sticker.

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,810
And that guest was the one who started it, by speaking harshly to us.

61
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,220
We were both trying to prevent the customer's wrongful behavior.

62
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,190
And because I was slapped in the face, that agent was only defending me.

63
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,280
I understand the situation,

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,770
but in any case, since the guest was injured, we have to resolve this.

65
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,950
Who was that agent? Is it someone you know?

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,280
No. I don't know her.

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,770
Are you sure you don't know her?

68
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,330
No, I only arrived here at T2 today.

69
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,900
I don't know who she is.

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,240
It's alright for now. Go wait at your desk until further notice.

71
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,660
It seems as if she knows who it is. What should we do?

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,100
- Yes, Sunbae.
- Where are you right now?

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,950
I'm at the store right now.. What is it?

74
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,470
When you were getting off work, did you use the restroom in the customs area, by any chance?

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,770
How did it go?

76
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm not sure.

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,860
Again? It was changed last month, how could that be?

78
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,320
I understand.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,030
What? Is there a problem?

80
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,890
At the Immigration area, there is a problem again with the water dispenser.

81
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,250
I'm sure it was fixed last time by the engineer whom I called.

82
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,430
Does the Passenger Service Team also handle water fountains in T2?

83
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,090
Originally it was the job of Facilities Management, but somehow we ended up taking care of it.

84
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,430
That's how it works here.

85
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,930
We get pushed and pulled in every direction. We have to fix this and that.

86
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,070
In a word, it's everything else, and so on, etc. etc.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,510
Why do they keep making me wait? This is so annoying.

88
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,570
What is it?

89
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,730
I heard the water dispenser wasn't working. I'll just take a look at it quickly and go.

90
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,390
Yes, Attorney Kim. How far are you?

91
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,900
Yes.

92
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,090
Team Leader Yang. Team Leader Yang Seo Goon!

93
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:57,150
What is this all about? A female agent used violence on a customer?

94
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,430
We haven't assessed the situation yet.

95
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,760
Face the facts, she's an Assemblyman's daughter.

96
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,420
Her face is hurt too and now she's suing Incheon Airport. What situation haven't you assessed?

97
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,120
Have the agent go apologize immediately. Whether she kneels or bows,

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,040
have her apologize and remedy the situation. Do you understand?

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,570
Our employee says she did nothing wrong.

100
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,030
The guest attacked her first. How could I make her apologize?

101
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,330
You should know better. It's not important whether we were wrong or not.

102
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,490
It could be ended by simply having our employee kneel. Are you going to complicate things?

103
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm sorry, but I cannot give an apology in this situation.

104
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,730
Please give us time to assess the situation.

105
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,810
How long? Until it appears in the news that two female employees assaulted a guest who then sued the airport?

106
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,990
Until the press swarms the airport?

107
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,290
Until all of our airport people form a pack, transform into a gang and beat people up?

108
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,210
- Director!
- I'll go.

109
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,500
Are you Han Yeo Reum?

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,060
Yes.

111
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,690
I'm that Han Yeo Reum.

112
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,420
Han Yeo Reum, stay out of this. Don't you see we're discussing something?

113
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,030
I'll go, Team leader.

114
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,430
Having a female employee simply kneel

115
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,970
isn't such a big deal.

116
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,870
Go and apologize properly.

117
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,570
If you can't apologize properly and this gets out,

118
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,520
or the media hears about it, be prepared to resign.

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,390
Understand?

120
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,220
Driver, could you go a little faster?

121
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,590
This is an automated traffic enforcement area. I can't do that.

122
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,030
Passenger Terminal 2

123
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,450
Han Yeo Reum just went in to apologize. Where are you at?

124
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,960
I just arrived.

125
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,670
Hello. I'm Gong Seung Cheol of the Passenger Service Team.

126
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,490
I heard you were caused some discomfort by a female agent on our team.

127
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,840
Lee Soo Yeon?

128
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,170
What are you doing there?

129
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,180
We received a complaint that the water dispenser was broken. I'm almost finished.

130
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,320
In any case, because our customer suffered grave inconvenience while using the airport,

131
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,940
indeed, I can't do anything but feel regret, so ...

132
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,780
So...

133
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,580
Our employee wanted to give you an apology,

134
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,360
and she came to see you like this.

135
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,130
Han Yeo Reum?

136
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
How about starting with the things you don't want to hear?

137
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,820
You should know better. It could be ended by simply having our employee kneel.

138
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,500
Han Yeo Reum, you've never directly said what you're thinking.

139
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,190
If you keep silent allowing the other party to think they're correct,

140
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,000
you'll never hear what you want to hear.

141
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,840
Han Yeo Reum, why are you just standing there? Hurry up and apologize.

142
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,580
Why did you come alone? What about the Security Team woman from earlier?

143
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,920
Ah, if you would first hear our Passenger Serivice employee's apology,

144
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,950
you can hear the Security Team's apology later.

145
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,110
Regarding the incident that occurred in the ladies' restroom earlier,

146
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,410
Apologize...

147
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,430
Please apologize to me.

148
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,790
- Look, Han Yeo Reum,
- What are you saying?

149
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,980
Aren't you here to apologize?

150
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,760
It wouldn't be enough if you were on your knees. Have you lost your mind?

151
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,920
You're the one at fault.

152
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,260
You were secretly removing the customs label in violation of the law.

153
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,670
You were the first to both use foul language and use violence.

154
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,550
So please apologize to me.

155
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,570
At the same time, please apologize for slapping me in the face.

156
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,170
Look here, Ham Yeo Reum. Have you gone crazy?

157
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,890
Until now, why was I always sorry about everything?

158
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm sorry. I'm sor ...

159
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,400
Why have I never thought to face things head on?

160
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,660
If you cause a ruckus without being able to control your emotions once more,

161
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,040
it will not end with just a warning.

162
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,440
Why am I the only one responsible?

163
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,020
As anyone can see, this was obviously sexual harassment by a drunk.

164
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,390
I didn't fail to control my emotions. It was self-defense.

165
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,730
I wasn't making a fuss.

166
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,300
I was protecting myself.

167
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,700
Although we are supposed to provide friendly service for your comfort,

168
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,330
my human rights are not at your service.

169
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,200
Earlier in the restroom, you were at fault.

170
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,600
Please apologize.

171
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,060
I'm sorry, everything is due to my inadequacy as a superior.

172
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,610
- Please forgive me just this once.
- Forget it!

173
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,430
I don't need this, so all of you better be prepared.

174
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,930
I'm going to call my lawyer right now and I'm going to sue all of you!

175
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,560
Yes, Lawyer Kim. Where are you now?

176
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,130
Yes, yes.

177
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,870
No! Don’t tell my dad anything about it yet.

178
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
If my dad finds out about this situation, then he will kill me.

179
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,040
Don't ever tell him, okay?

180
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,320
I mean, I'm just going to just scare these airport employees telling them I'll sue them.

181
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,990
and then settle with them calling it even with the customs items.

182
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,030
Aigoo. What should I do?

183
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,710
This kind of thing was accidentally recorded.

184
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,390
Who are you? You're not a repairman for the water dispenser?

185
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,770
I'm Lee Soo Yeon from the Passenger Service Team.

186
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,850
The water dispenser falls under the Passenger Team's responsibility.

187
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,420
All of you! Did you just all conspire to put me in a trap? Is that it?

188
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,550
Hey! Do you even know who my father is?

189
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,830
We are well aware.

190
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,430
You know? But do you dare do this to me?

191
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,510
I think you're the one daring to do this.

192
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,080
- Hey!
- Throwing a tantrum is something

193
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,600
you should go home and do in front of your great father.

194
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,920
You shouldn't have such embarrassing behavior in public.

195
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,470
What? What?

196
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,840
Really!

197
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,500
Hey!

198
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,440
How did it go? What happened?

199
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,770
I'm not sure. Since it's taking long, I don't think it's a good atmosphere.

200
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,140
The situation is settled. You didn't have to come.

201
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,220
Is she stupid or what?

202
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,170
How could she make such a call with someone right beside her?

203
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,200
It isn't because she's stupid, it's just

204
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,940
because she thought I was of no consequence.

205
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,190
I mean, I'm just going to scare these airport employees a little saying I'll sue them.

206
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,960
Then I'll settle with them calling it even with my customs merchandise and go.

207
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,670
Is there anyone who can hear you over there?

208
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,940
You don't need to worry. There's nobody here.

209
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,040
To that kind of people, we don't even qualify as human beings. Clearly ...

210
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,730
Thus, although she was exerting her power ...

211
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,200
You have two options.

212
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,110
You may pay the duty and quietly leave the airport or come with me.

213
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,820
We'll go along with whichever you decide.

214
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,660
Ah, really!

215
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,160
Team Leader.

216
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,670
You showed a bit of hot temper.

217
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,310
Overall, I'm a pretty patient person. But, once that switch gets flipped,

218
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,040
Swearing back at a passenger is a basic rule.

219
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,290
Now you even want to add receiving an apology from a passenger.

220
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,170
I'm sorry for making it difficult for you.

221
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,130
Team Leaders are supposed to handle the difficulties of their team members.

222
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,130
To cover the mistakes and accidents that you make.

223
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,520
So don't worry about it.

224
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,630
Still, it was refreshing to hear

225
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,690
you being confident and courageously using your voice.

226
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,610
Good job.

227
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,640
Thank you.

228
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:53,120
♫ Someday in your life, running in different ways ♫

229
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,660
♫ Can someone come and take me to my way ♫

230
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,790
♬  All people in here.  ♬

231
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,270
♬  Walking in different ways  ♬

232
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,940
What are you doing here?

233
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,940
Just... passing by.

234
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,650
♫  So lay down just for one night.♫

235
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,890
♫ So I'll never lose you in my eyes. Will I know? ♫

236
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,030
What about the water dispenser? You fixed it well?

237
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:32,000
Ah, yes. Well...

238
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,940
♫ Every time I look at myself in the eyes ♫

239
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,030
Why is no water coming out?

240
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,820
Oh!

241
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,430
What's wrong with it?

242
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,940
That's a relief.

243
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,650
So now... For the time being, Lee Soo Yeon will take care of the water dispensers.

244
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,510
♫ Maybe it's a day to stop ♫

245
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,130
For the time being... Can you do that?

246
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,800
♫  for a moment to smile.  ♫

247
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,670
♫ The life is too short to cry.  ♫

248
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,310
Yes, for the time being.

249
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,010
That is good.

250
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,800
♫ The life is too short to cry.  ♫

251
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,730
You can just come to work as usual. As if nothing happened.

252
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,580
Understand?

253
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,640
What about Han Yeo Reum?

254
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,030
♫  Will I ever gonna make it  ♫

255
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,900
Is she going together with us?

256
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,220
Who would I entrust that troublemaker to?

257
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,520
Don’t worry, we will move together.

258
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,550
♫  So I will never lose you in my eyes. Will I know  ♫

259
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:46,200
♫ Or see the way of life. ♫

260
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,850
♫ And will I ever know what is going on.
Even when I close my eyes. ♫

261
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,140
♫ Will I ever see you? ♫

262
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,270
Dust.
♫ Mystic world? ♫

263
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,420
Dust.

264
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,200
Dust.

265
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,220
Dust.

266
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,490
Dust.

267
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,940
Dust.

268
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,820
Dust.

269
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,700
Dust.

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,760
Dust.

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,270
Dust.

272
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:57,380
♫ Hey, hey, hey. I started thinking about you. ♫

273

♫ Hey, hey, hey. You met me and passed by. ♫

274
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,190
♫ I don't think everything was a coincidence ♫

275
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,490
♫ Am I the only one who thinks that? ♫

276
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,650
♫ Am I the only one who thinks that? ♫

277
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,940
Actually, I was going to send you a text message.

278
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,030
To me? What's wrong?

279
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,690
Thanks to you, I had courage to face this situation.

280
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,240
Thank you, agent Lee Soo Yeon.

281
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,780
I... Can I ask you something?

282
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,760
Why don't you ask me anything about my hand?

283
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,010
You must be curious about it.

284
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:06,280
You must have already answered tens of thousands of times about it.

285
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,820
"Why did it happen?", "How did it happen?".

286
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,850
People would be asking about it out of passing curiosity but...

287
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,310
Every time you have to answer them, then it will hurt you each time.

288
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,930
It was an accident.

289
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,130
A very long time ago.

290
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,540
Hyung!

291
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,670
Hyung!

292
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,030
We've been waiting for you.

293
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,630
I'd like to thank you for what happened today.

294
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,180
It would have been better if I you didn't pretend to be cool alone.

295
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,880
Hey, Na Yeong Joo.

296
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,360
Anyway... Thank you.

297
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,330
Would you like to go to drink a beer together?

298
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,950
I have a friend in the Ramp Team who knows the beer houses very well.

299
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,690
Han Yeo Reum! I'm here.

300
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,800
What's this? Was there a well-known beer house inside T2 (Terminal 2)?

301
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,990
How is it? Isn't this a great spot?

302
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,200
It's such a good place, we can drink and watch planes land at the same time. Together, cheers!

303
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,730
Good. Cheers!

304
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,350
Cheers!

305
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,440
A player doesn't do cheers.

306
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,690
Cheers!

307
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,190
By the way, how did you get to work at the airport?

308
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,300
I basically wanted to a job in which I wore a uniform. I fit the physical requirements.

309
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,250
I'm a judo specialist. What about you?

310
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,670
Of course, money.

311
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,910
Yes, because of the annual salary.

312
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,120
What about you, Han Yeo Reum?

313
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,690
Because of my dad.

314
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:07,660
Dad, at the place I work hundreds of stars land every day,

315
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,450
many hundreds of stars land and leave every day.

316
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:18,050
♫ Why everything in my life ♫

317
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,420
♫ is Stars ♫

318
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,270
My dad called that place "Fox Bride Star".

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,430
So... you decided to stay?

321
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:43,930
Yes, I'd like to see a little bit more of T2.

322
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,980
Will you be okay?

323
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,790
If a problem arises, then I will quit first.

324
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,990
How is your arm? Do things still stick to it?

325
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,580
It's fine again.

326
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,510
Let me check it.

327
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,390
Naturally, in order for you to see personnel records, you have to go through procedures.

328
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,930
I'm in a bit of a rush. I'll check in with the Director later.

329
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,380
Please do so.

330
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,970
Don't forget to hold the reservation for next weekend.

Hyung!

335
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,890
How did he recover from that?

336
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,580
That's right. That's right.

337
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,920
I told you that, right?

338
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,300
♫ It must be you; my heart must know it's only you ♫

339
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,970
♫ I talk and make endless gestures ♫

340
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,190
♫ The feeling of just you which is as familiar  ♫

341
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,380
♫ as the smell of the rain on a windy day ♫

342
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,360
♫ It must be you ♫
