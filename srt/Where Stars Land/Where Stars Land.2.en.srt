00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,790
Episode 2

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,920
- Make sure to check the time so we won't be late.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's not make any mistakes.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,450
Yes!

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,870
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,720
Lee Soo Yeon is a rookie who just finished his three month internship

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,540
and it's only a month since he's become a regular employee.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,720
- So?
- I've been here for a year.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,010
- And?
- What?

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,180
What if you've been here for a year? Why does that matter?

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,010
I mean... I've been here for a year, how could you pair me with a complete rookie?

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,100
How long have you been on the Passenger Service Team?

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,180
Today's my first day.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,190
Including his three-month internship, Lee Soo Yeon has been in six different teams in four months.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,020
Someone with four months of experience is guiding you on your first day. Is there a problem here?

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,130
Even so, isn't making the last hire the leader a bit much?

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,340
Even I have pride.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,810
Are you possibly looking down on me now because of several incidents I had in my prior department?

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,170
- Look here, Han Yeo Reum.
- Yes, Team Leader.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,300
- Do you want to show off your self-pride here?
- Yes, I want to.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,490
Then get the work done.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,470
Don't be late and give me useless excuses.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,270
I couldn't care less about what kind of trouble you ran into previously.

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,000
So don't parade those petty slights in front of me.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,560
I only have one criterion: whether you work well within my team or not.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,520
Who is the leader or who has seniority ... all these things are trivial. Stop spouting nonsense. Do you understand?

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,260
What? Do you have anything else to say?

27
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,180
No. I don't.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,490
- Then go.
- Yes.

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,180
I'll get going then.

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,770
See, I told you it was hopeless.

31
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,360
When it comes to work, she's a dictator who doesn't budge. Why else do you think her name is the Airport Witch?

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,630
- Once you get on her bad side, it's over for you.
- What do I do?

33
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,630
- Don't you think I've completely moved on over to her bad side with this?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,820
Han Yeo Reum.

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,820
Han Yeo Reum?

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,240
Aren't you going to answer?

37
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,100
Yes, please speak.

38
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,860
We've got an alert for a missing child. Hurry on over to the third post.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,380
Ah, what are you doing? He said there's a missing child alert.

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,030
Han Yeo Reum, are you listening?

41
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,800
Han Yeo Reum. Han Yeo Reum?

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,470
- Yes, I'm heading over now.
- Are you going?

43
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,980
I can't end my first day with just having received hate from the chief and team leader.

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,630
I have to stay here, I have nowhere else to go.

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,370
So, what do I need now? Something that'll get me out of this situation.

46
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,420
I will be the one to find the missing child. We'll have a happy ending today, okay?

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,660
I'm going.

48
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,690
Why did you have to be late on your first day?

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,760
(AB Airline Lee Myeong Heon)
And why did the plane arrive early today?

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes, Chief Jeom, it's Go Eun Seob.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,260
What? The plane has already landed. What can I do about it now?

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,530
Who knows what could happen?

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,660
And it's been six hours since he's taken his medication?

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, yes.

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes.

56
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,850
- So there's a child missing, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.
- Yes.

57
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,620
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- A boy.

58
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,250
- How old is he?
- He's 31.

59
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,330
Thirty ... one years old?

60
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,350
Are you kidding right now? If he's 31, then he's an adult.

61
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,570
This is his prescription medicine.

62
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,060
He needs to take it on time but he was so excited about the trip that he's forgotten to bring it.

63
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,700
Read this.

64
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,660
Take it at the first sign of schizophrenia—

65
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,580
- Schizophrenia—
- I've already reported to the team leader.

66
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,430
You and his mother should wait here for now.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,970
I'm going to look around airside with the Security Team.

68
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,360
Wait a minute. Let me go with you.

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,770
Did you not just hear my instructions?

70
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,300
Isn't it just a month since you completed your internship?

71
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,220
And you are a hot shot.

72
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,050
Even though you're eager to earn points in front of the higher-ups, this is not the way.

73
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,960
You give away jobs that are of no consequence and yet you take the credit for it.

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,250
- What do you mean?
- Let's make a living together, huh?

75
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,160
One moment please.

76
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes. Go ahead.

77
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,250
Let's stick together. The person we have to deal with may suffer from schizophrenia.

78
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,730
We don't know what may happen. Don't act alone.

79
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:40,230
Oh my, are you worried now about me, Mr. Newbie?

80
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,390
No, I'm cautioning you as your superior.

81
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,580
I can deal with your annoyance but please don't cause any trouble.

82
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,450
I hope there will be no attention-drawing incident because you caused trouble.

83
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,290
As for me, as much as possible, I enjoy working behind the scenes,

84
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,460
quietly and out of sight.

85
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,710
I ask for your cooperation, Ms. Han Yeo Reum.

86
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,220
Ah, excuse me...

87
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,400
By any chance...

88
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,220
Have we met somewhere before?

89
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,690
Not this morning but way before.

90
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,660
Didn't we meet before?

91
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,600
No, I don't think so.

92
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,370
- Not once?
- I don't remember.

93
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,650
That's strange. You look very familiar.

94
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,410
I've had women using those lines on me before.

95
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,560
Is that what you mean?

96
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,490
I'm sorry. Let's just go.

97
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,790
The man suffering from schizophrenia is 31 years old; his name is Kim Geun Woo.

98
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,830
He is believed to be wearing a yellow shirt.

99
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,300
Flight AB 127 goes to the North Sea.

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,380
It departs at 10:40. Gate 6.

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,700
We have one hour before boarding time.

102
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,560
- Please check all areas near the gate as well as the duty-free shop.
- Yes.

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,450
Just in case, make sure to check all the men's restrooms.

104
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,690
Yes. Will do.

105
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,330
It's me, Chief Yang. Do you happen to be airside?

106
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,530
Can you catch sight of a man wearing a yellow top?

107
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,620
He's a schizophrenia patient, 31 years old. Please check Gate 6 first.

108
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,270
I don't see any man wearing a yellow shirt in front of Gate 6.

109
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,890
- You don't see him?
- No.

110
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,290
There are some men there but none wearing a yellow shirt.

111
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,910
Section Chief Gong, I don't see the man wearing a yellow shirt yet.

112
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,430
I would like the on-site team to start searching the duty-free area.

113
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,350
Yes.

114
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,860
Do you hear me? Back, get back. Start at the duty-free.

115
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,290
What do you mean? There is a squabble?

116
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,620
It'll only take about 40 minutes. Why can't you yield?

117
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,830
Even if it's just housekeeping at Gate 6, will you arrange it?

118
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,710
I was in the same situation two weeks ago, and I was promised it wouldn't happen again.

119
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,220
Ask me who delayed our flight departure time.

120
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,920
Ask me whether I don't see a plane waiting on the runway.

121
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Please ask why she's asking me this?

122
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,060
- You heard, right?
- Oh man, I'm not Aladdin.

123
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,090
- What should I do? 
- Let me speak to them.

124
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,190
Hello, it's me, Ramp Chief Park Tae Hui.

125
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,700
I understand both of your positions but could you just compromise a bit?

126
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,840
Could you compromise this time? The shoe will be on the other foot next time and you will receive cooperation.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,830
Team Leader Park, are you taking her side right now?

128
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,390
I'm not on anyone's side.

129
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,240
We have to work fair and square from our end.

130
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,630
There is no favoritism toward anyone here.

131
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,930
This gate was assigned to us from the start. If our flight gets delayed, will you take responsibility for it?

132
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,090
- And so, you really cannot yield?
- No, I cannot!

133
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,890
Then I have no choice. You go ahead to the boarding gate.

134
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,230
Team Leader Park!!

135
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,500
He's going to have to apologize anyway to the passengers for having them disembark late.

136
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,490
It's fine that he will have to apologize once more, "I'm sorry that you will have to walk farther."

137
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,500
So will you be responsible if the passengers file a claim?

138
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,070
You guys are funny. Why do you keep telling me I am responsible?

139
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,180
Did I pull you down and tell you to land the plane early?

140
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,540
Even If I suggest an alternative for your convenience,

141
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,970
if he says he doesn't want to, we also can't force him.

142
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,590
Go take your complaint to the westerly wind.

143
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,630
"Wind, I'm so annoyed I could just hit you."

144
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,190
What are you going to do? Time keeps passing.

145
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,710
You have been receiving complaints from a bunch of passengers. Leaving aside this conversation,

146
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,490
will you for once receive appreciation from all of them?

147
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,830
So then?

148
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,700
Then go do it.

149
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,500
Passengers, there is an announcement.

150
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,250
Because of a delay due to an airport situation,

151
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,910
we kindly request that you remain seated for a while and wait.

152
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll repeat is once more. Because of a situation in the airport ...

153
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,940
I'll look in the men's restroom again. He's surely around there.

154
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,380
Are you having fun telling me what to do? Why? Are you really my superior?

155
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,600
- What's this?
- Why aren't we going in?

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,040
KR 097, is there a ramp yet?

157
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,870
KR 097, hold short of Romeo 2.

158
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,670
Ramp Control, can you change the ramps quickly?

159
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,810
The plane is coming in now ahead of schedule.

160
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,030
What's the reason?

161
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,240
Exactly! It's just forty minutes! Once again, it's one in a million, and you couldn't keep your word.

162
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,200
If there's a delay because of that, know that I will lodge a formal complaint with the Ramp Control Team.

163
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,490
- Open the gate! Hurry! Hurry!
- Yes, we will.

164
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,020
Gate Control.

165
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,350
All right. Work hard.

166
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,740
- Excuse me ...
- Yes?

167
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,860
Open Gate 6 for KR 097.

168
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,760
Yes. I understand.

169
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm about to collapse.

170
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm not the type of person who wishes for the moon.

171
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,290
What's this?

172
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,640
It's all ice!

173
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,760
Thanks.

174
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,750
Bye.

175
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,020
Sorry to keep you waiting.

176
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,130
Boarding Pass. Kim Geon Woo. From Incheon to New Chitose.

178
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,850
Miss Han Yeo Reum.

179
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,380
Ex-ex-excuse me.

180
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,700
The plane ... Why has the plane changed?

181
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,120
Pardon?

182
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,090
P-p-plane.

183
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,210
Oh! That plane is only unloading the passengers; another will come soon.

184
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,840
Because of the westerly winds, the plane arrived early so there was no ramp for it,

185
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,100
so we loaned our gate temporarily.

186
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,210
According to whose wish?

187
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,030
Who changed the planes according to his wish without asking me? Huh?

188
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,600
Are you okay?

189
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,210
It looks like there's a staff member in front of the restroom at Gate 6.

190
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,260
Let me see the man in the jacket.

191
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,750
Go back a little. Let me see that for a second.

192
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,590
That's the yellow shirt, right?

193
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,300
It is. It's the yellow shirt.

194
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,790
Can you all hear me? We found him.

195
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,720
The yellow top. He's at Gate 6. Wearing a dark jacket over it.

196
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Gate 6. Gate 6. 6.

197
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,860
Han Yeo Reum is around Gate 6. Are you listening?

198
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I think Han Yeo Reum's radio is off now.

199
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,190
Contact her by cell. She shouldn't be alone there.

200
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,360
Security Team. I'm requesting assistance.

201
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Right now at Gate 6 we have spotted a man ...

202
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,640
May I have the phone number for Han Yeo Reum? She's a female team member.

203
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,250
According to whom was the plane changed? Who wanted to sell me the plane tickets?

204
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,820
According to whom? I don't like it, bastard.

205
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,440
Mr. Kim Geun Woo?

206
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,630
You are Kim Geun Woo, right?

207
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,420
Who are you?

208
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,970
Right now your mother is outside looking for you. Would you like to go with me?

209
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,650
You? What are you? Aren't you the police?

210
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,780
I'm not. I'm a member of Incheon Airport's Passenger Service Team.

211
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,450
Truly, your mother is worried about you.

212
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,570
Won't you come with me? Huh?

213
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,240
Don't come any closer. You came to arrest me.

214
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,840
You're going to arrest me ... you're going to arrest me and lock me up again.

215
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,410
Go. I said to go away.

216
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm not here to arrest you. Please calm down. Calm down.

217
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,080
I said to go away!

218
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,420
I remember.

219
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,030
This person ...

220
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,960
It's that person!

221
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,830
Your mother asked me to take this to you.

222
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,010
She's outside.

223
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,650
She's there right now and is worried.

224
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,270
Team Leader.

225
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,270
What happened? Did you get hit?

226
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,640
Manager Lee Ji Jeom seems to have been injured.

227
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,030
What? He's been hurt? Really. Where?

228
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Let's do the incident report later.

229
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,730
Let's go. Let's go.

230
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:22,970
♫ Someday in your life, running in different ways ♫

231
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,550
♫ Can someone come and take me to my way ♫

232
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,680
♬  All people in here ♬

233

236
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,500
♬ So I will never lose you in my eyes.
Will I know  ♬

237
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,320
My father said there are no coincidences in life.

238
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:06,780
♫ Every time I look at myself in the eyes ♫

239
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,770
♬  Sometimes when I see you  ♬

240
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,450
Everything that happens in life has a reason.

241
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,420
Reading passport

242
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,880
The trivia of everyday life, the moments which passed like coincidence,

243
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,180
which seemed not to have any connection,

244
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,400
♬ for a moment to smile ♬

245
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,240
as time passed, by ones and twos ... started to be connected.

246
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,590
♬ Life is too short to cry
Life is too short to cry  ♬

♫ Sunday you're lost in maze ♫

248
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,530
♫ Monday you are out the way. ♫

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,650
♬ So lay down just for one night ♬

253
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,600
♬  Will I ever know what's going on? ♬
What is this?

254
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,070
Who would do such a thing?

255
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:31,130
♫ Will I ever see you?
Mystic world? ♫

256
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,040
What is it, did something happen?

257
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,240
You should see this.

258
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,620
Excuse me, Lee Soo Yeon.

259
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,290
We've met once before, right?

260
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,210
Right?

261
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,030
I told you not to go alone, didn't I?

262
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,080
I can put up with the annoying stuff, but don't cause trouble.

263
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,530
I want to live quietly, so don't disturb other people's lives.

264
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,680
Do you really not remember?

265
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,890
Sorry, but I do not have any memories about you.

266
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,870
Why? Because I've never seen you and met you.

267
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,490
No... We met. Back then...

268
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,420
Transport Bus Stop

269
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,790
The day I went for an interview at the airport.

270
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,330
It was you.

271
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,920
Definitely ... It was you.

272
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,690
♫ Always in my mind ♫

273
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:42,210
♫ the same memory which is a question mark ♫

274
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,590
♫ the day in front of me ♫

275
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,410
♫ The day which was like an unfolding movie ♫

276
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:57,460
♫ Ooh my whole body feels throbbing ♫

277
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,890
♫ I couldn't emit a sound, I was muzzled  ♫

278
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,190
♫ I looked only at you as though I would bore a hole ♫

279
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,780
♫ It must be you; my heart must know it's only you ♫

280
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,490
♫ I talk and make endless gestures ♫

281
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,650
♫ The feeling of just you which is as familiar  ♫

282
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,820
♫ as the smell of the rain on a windy day ♫

283
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,030
♫ It must be you ♫

284
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,030
♫ It really must be you ♫

285
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,340
♫ Ooh ♫
