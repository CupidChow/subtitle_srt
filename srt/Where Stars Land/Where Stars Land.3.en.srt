1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,520
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,530
♬ Your light, as a little star.  ♬

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,940
♬ I am going, looking at the star  ♬

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:24,340
♬ Where in the sky is my love?  ♬

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,570
Why did you apply for Incheon International Airport Corporation?

6
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,320
When I was 19 years old, I wanted to become a pilot.

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,320
That's the truth.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,340
But when I was in high school I was hurt in an accident and gave up that dream.

9
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,050
That's also true.

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,680
Even now, whenever I see an airplane, my heart races.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,210
So I applied.

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,790
I wanted to work in a place that makes my heart race.

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,340
That is a lie.

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,150
Incheon Airport. This is where the number of planes taking off and landing

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,760
averages a thousand per day.

16
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,000
Reading passport

17
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,890
The number of passengers who utilize this airport each day

18
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,570
averages about two hundred thousand.

19
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,810
The number of administrative staff here at this airport

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,550
averages sixty thousand per day.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,260
On a daily basis, there are about two hundred and sixty thousand people

22
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,010
who pass through or work in this place.

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,230
There is only one thing I wish for.

24
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,260
That my true identity is not revealed.

25
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,850
The pharmacy is in that direction.

26
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm attentive to my daily duties without drawing any attention to myself;

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,110
I don't have the need to befriend anyone

28
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,540
so that no one will remember anything special or odd about me.

29
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,270
- But then ...
- Perhaps...

30
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,990
have we seen each other somewhere before?

31
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,770
We met once before. I'm sure.

32
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,040
I met you

33
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,140
who remembered me.

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,390
Thanks to you, I was able to go to the interview that day.

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,340
Thanks to you again, I was able to be here right now.

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,270
Do you really not remember?

37
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,790
I'm sorry, but I do not have any memories of that.

38
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,100
Why? Because I never have seen nor met you.

39
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,040
Thank you.

40
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,080
Whether you remember or not,

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,060
I do appreciate it anyway.

42
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,730
I just came back from the Internal Operation Center

43
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,550
and the CCTV recorded the entire incident which happened earlier.

44
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,180
Do you mean all of it?

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,380
Yes.

46
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,310
I think Section Chief Mo was a little surprised to see it.

47
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,700
For now I extracted a promise that he would keep his mouth shut.

48
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,030
But if you keep acting so obvious,

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,170
the rumor will soon spread.

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,040
Both the situation where you saved the child in the duty free area and

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,780
the incident with the schizophrenic patient.

52
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,280
Living like an ordinary person ...

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,320
Don't you want to live an ordinary life like everyone else?

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,270
Then, just live like that

55
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,710
and keep your eyes closed and ignore everything

56
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,480
while pretending to be indifferent and to not see.

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,050
Otherwise, you won't be able to stay here long.

58
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,980
I understand.

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,740
Is there some secret he's hiding?

60
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,780
This person... I'm curious about him!

61
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,040
Where Stars Land

62
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,560
Hello, this is the Passenger Service Department at Incheon Airport. How may I help you?

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,820
Passenger Service. How may I help you?

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,430
(In Japanese)

65
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,020
(In Chinese)

66
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,520
Yes, this is Incheon Airport Help Desk. How may I help you?

67
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,660
What? What did you just say?

68
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,280
I placed a bomb in the airport transit area.

69
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,940
You are all dead now, you bastards.

70
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,050
Yes, this is Assistant Chief Oh of the Security Team.

71
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,250
Okay. Yes, I understand!

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,710
It is a RED 1 situation. Everyone hurry!

73
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,720
From Team 1 through 4, go airside. From Team 5 through 9, go landside.

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,180
Yes, sir!

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,230
Passenger Service Team

76
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm from the Security Team. Could I hear the recording of the threatening call?

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,700
Yes, right here.

78
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,250
I think this is another obvious prank call.

79
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,580
What can I do? The threat call already came.

80
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,080
Now there's going to be chaos for a couple of hours.

81
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,550
Yeah.

82
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,740
Hey, Security Team, I think you should go over there.

83
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,450
You guys read the manual, right?

84
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,650
Suspicious bags, trunk bags, plastic bags, etc.

85
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,220
If you find anything suspicious, never touch it.

86
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,420
You must contact the Security Team or the police.

87
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,250
Understand?

88
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,180
From a commotion yesterday over a disturbed customer with schizophrenia,

89
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,860
to a phone call today threatening a bomb.

90
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,880
What a variety I have!

91
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,400
That's why we are in this position and why a person has to join in.

92
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,080
A person.

93
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,940
Yes, Han Yeo Reum.

94
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,380
Why? What is it?

95
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,290
Has she had another incident?

96
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,180
She said she discovered something in a trash bag.

97
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,780
What are you talking about? What bag?

98
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,610
It looks like someone threw out a plastic bag.

99
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,480
Hey, whatever you do, don't touch it. Understand? Don't touch.

100
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,910
You already touched it?

102
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,690
I only peeked a little bit—

103
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,420
Hey, Why would you touch that? You don't even know what it is.

104
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,620
There is even a posted message that there's been a bomb threat. Didn't you see it?

105
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,450
What do I do? The inside ...

106
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,150
Then. .. no way ...

107
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,420
Something like a bomb?

108
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,720
IS IT A BOMB?

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,420
- Gold bars.
- Gold bars?

110
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,820
Yes. There's a lot of gold inside. What should I do, Chief?

111
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,250
Gold bars ...

112
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,750
For thirty minutes, this bag was left alone with no owner.

113
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,440
Tell the EOD Team (Explosive Ordnance Disposal, i.e. bomb squad) first and tell the others to get the equipment.

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,220
Yes, sir.

115
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,420
Chief, this is Assistant Chief Oh.

116
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,970
Yes, go ahead and speak.

117
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,040
Alright, I understand. Do not let passengers get within a 15-meter radius. I'll be right up.

118
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,390
- First, we'll be taking the file of the recording.
- Yes.

119
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,940
Send the voice recording file to the Analysis Team.

120
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,180
Let me know as soon as they have traced the voice. I'm going to the transit area.

121
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,120
Yes, I understand.

122
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,240
I've worked at the airport for about 20 years.

123
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,850
Wow, this is my first time seeing this many gold bars.

124
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,700
What did the person who threw these away look like?

125
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,170
He's a man.

126
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,060
You said he looked about 40 years old, right?

127
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,820
Yes, his height was 170 cm and he was wearing sunglasses.

128
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,330
He did look Korean, but his exact nationality is unknown.

129
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,810
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right, Section Chief.

130
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,540
First, we'll be taking the gold bars.

131
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,160
Just if ... what happens if the owner doesn't show up?

132
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,400
Do the ownership rights go to the person who found it?

133
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,260
Items that are related to crimes are kept in the National Treasury.

134
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,870
It could be lost property.

135
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,790
Then doesn't the person who found it usually get a reward?

136
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,060
To my knowledge, they get 10 to 15%.

137
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,850
I'm not sure. I guess it depends on the situation.

138
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,620
They give it, right?

139
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,620
See, I told you they do.

140
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,650
Let's move it.

141
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,090
Sheesh, that rascal.

142
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,270
Did you see that? As soon as I brought up the reward, he backed down right away.

143
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,760
If you get a reward later, remember that it's all thanks to me.

144
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,060
Ah, yes, of course.

145
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,910
Then, will I get a little something also?

146
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,760
Ah, of course. We'll share it 50-50, Section Chief.

147
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,770
Look here, Han Yeo Reum,

148
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,680
I see now that you know how things work.

149
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,440
That's right, this is how work should be done.

150
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,200
You're really refreshing. I like it.

151
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,610
I just got complimented by the Section Chief, right?

152
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,750
It looks as if you were taken for a fool.

153
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,500
Oh my, you have a talent for throwing cold water on someone else's good fortune.

154
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,380
Compared to your talent for making a big deal out of nothing, it's very low level.

155
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,600
Section Chief Gong said that I did well.

156
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,010
"This is how work should be done".

157
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,990
You should never touch any items that are discarded or suspicious. You should report it first.

158
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,220
Don't you know that's the most basic of common knowledge?

159
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,850
They were gold bars.

160
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,950
They might not have been gold bars.

161
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,050
What would have happened if it were a bomb or a biological weapon?

162
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,400
From now on, don't ever thoughtlessly touch discarded items again. Do you understand?

163
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,110
Is it possible you are worried about me?

164
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,760
A suggestion.

165
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,320
That's what it is.

166
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,570
It's not there.

167
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,240
But ... is your arm okay?

168
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,660
Usually a bruise hurts the day after rather than the same day.

169
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,960
Is there a bruise?

170
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,190
I'm really curious but are you skilled in martial arts?

171
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,810
Or do you have something like super strength?

172
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,670
To break a brick or to bend a piece of metal—

173
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,940
How did the organizing of the stanchions go? Is everything in place?

174
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,970
Ah, right.

175
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,240
It's the EOD (bomb squad). Want to go with them?

176
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,880
No.

177
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,990
You're really not curious?

178
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,150
Not at all. I'm going to look for the stanchions.

179
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,260
Living like an ordinary person ...

180
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,900
Don't you want to live an ordinary life like everyone else?

181
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,160
Then just live like that and keep your eyes closed and ignore everything,

182
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,750
while pretending to be indifferent and pretending not to see.

183
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,830
What? T2?

184
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,110
You just told me to go to T2?

185
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,920
Yes, come here.

186
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,090
What about Team Leader Jeong?

187
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,750
He said that T2 doesn't suit his abilities. And he's not comfortable with it being a smart airport.

188
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,800
He doesn't have much left till retirement so he's asked to remain in T1 as much as possible.

189
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,040
What about Deputy Chief Seo?

190
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,830
He took a leave of absence to follow his child who's going to school abroad.

191
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,680
The guy who came in a year ago left because it was too hard for him.

192
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,710
Truthfully, as soon as T2 opened, there were a lot of incidents and trouble.

193
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,220
They even blamed the airport for mistakes made by the airlines.

194
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,330
It's a mess.

195
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,950
You come here and make some improvements.

196
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,270
But you don't like me, Director.

197
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,040
You said my style and the way I work were completely tiring and troublesome.

198
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,140
But you still do your work well.

199
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,010
I'll deal with it.

200
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,460
Is this a situation that I'm able to refuse?

201
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,930
Let's just have you start here next week.

202
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,150
Wow, Team Leader Yang Seo Goon, it's been awhile.

203
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,120
When did you get here?

204
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,420
Yesterday afternoon.

205
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,340
No way, are you transferring to T2 as well, Sunbae?

206
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,230
Yes. I don't know why, but he wants to keep me by him.

207
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,030
If it's a team leader with as much ability as you,

208
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,350
anyone would want to keep you close.

209
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,390
It's rumored that he's after the Vice President position.

210
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,230
Is it related?

211
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,080
- I missed you.
- You are on his side, you really don't know anything?

212
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,520
Why do you keep getting more attractive, more and more?

213
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,300
I'm still legally a married woman. Stop speaking nonsense.

214
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,720
Don't say. You aren't still mad at me, are you? It's been two years.

215
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,380
You don't want to answer, do you?

216
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,500
Ok, I understand, crazy bastard.

217
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,370
Do you want to have lunch together?

218
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,470
Huh?

219
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,850
That's odd. Where did it go?

220
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,100
I definitely put it over here.

221
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,280
What's that? What about Team 2's equipment?

222
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,330
There's an abandoned suitcase on the west side, so it's over there.

223
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,280
It will take some time for Team 5 to get ready and come in.

224
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,750
What happened?

225
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,920
Where is EOD? They're not here yet?

226
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,090
We're here now.

227
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,710
First, I'll put the barricade up.

228
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,820
Incheon International Airport Security Control

229
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,570
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (in English and Korean)

230
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,180
Banners that aren't reported can't be displayed outside.

231
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,460
Passengers could get caught on them and get hurt. It also doesn't look good.

232
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,690
I understand. I'll remove it.

233
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,640
- But which arm is it?
- Pardon?

234
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,310
I heard that yesterday the schizophrenic patient broke the stanchion badly?

235
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,670
Which arm is it? The right arm? The left arm?

236
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,410
I mean, you don't look like it on the outside, but you must be completely different on the inside.

237
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,070
What kind of exercise do you need to do to become like that? Huh?

238
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,810
I just do various things.

239
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,710
Judo, Taekwondo, kickboxing, Muay Thai, etc...

240
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,850
Oh, my goodness!

241
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,080
You look like an honor student, but you secretly have those tough hobbies.

242
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,670
Please remove the banner. I'll be back again to check tomorrow morning.

243
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,920
Pretend indifference ...

244
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,670
I'm telling you the truth. I saw it with my own two eyes.

245
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,130
He prevented the heavy stanchion from crushing him with just one arm!!

246
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,490
- Wow!

247
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,670
While pretending you don't see ... like that ...

248
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,200
What the... where are your eyes?

249
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,100
You can't come in here. Please step away.

250
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,900
You can't come in. Please step away.

251
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,980
Please step away.

252
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,770
You cannot come in until the inspection is done.

253
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,370
Ah, but I'm an employee.

254
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,920
You can't come in until the safety inspection is done. Please step aside.

255
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,270
Ma'am, step back. Please step back.

256
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,060
Yes.

257
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,350
Did you find the stanchions?

258
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,500
I did find them, but the Security Team is using them now.

259
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,050
Do you see anything?

260
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,200
From the pictures, it doesn't look like there are any problems.

261
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,880
That's right. That's my suitcase.

262
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,630
We're traveling to Japan.

263
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,830
We were looking around the airport because we had some extra time.

264
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,590
But what do we do about that?

265
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,790
First, I'll need to verify your passports and plane tickets.

266
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,660
Plane—

267
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,860
Where did you go, and why are you just coming back? I told you to watch the luggage.

268
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,140
Yes, it's me.

269
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,210
Did you get the results?

270
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,270
Yes. Okay, I understand.

271
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,770
They're a family traveling to Tokyo, Japan. There doesn't seem to be any peculiar activity.

272
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,360
- I think they're in here right now.
- Excuse me?

273
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,600
The threatening phone call was traced back to this airport area.

274
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,740
First, return the suitcase. I'll see you at the TCC (Terminal Counter-Terrorism Center).

275
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,320
I understand.

276
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,680
Na Yeong Joo, clean up the site and get moving right away.

277
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,310
Yes.

278
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,620
Excuse me.

279
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,710
What is it?

280
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm Han Yeo Reum, a member of the Passenger Service Team.

281
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,990
Was this stanchion barrier you are using right now in front of the elevator?

282
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,030
If it is?

283
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,770
That's equipment that our team takes care of.

284
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,870
Is that so? Then you can take it back.

285
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,660
Here you go.

286
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,290
It's all done. Let's go, Sunbae.

287
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,880
Excuse me, just a moment please.

288
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,760
Okay, so I understand you used the stanchions without permission due to an emergency,

289
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,100
But if you used them, you should clean them up at the very least.

290
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,730
Na Yeong Joo, did you take them without saying a word?

291
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,070
I just brought over something that was left abandoned.

292
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,650
It wasn't abandoned, I just left it there for a moment.

293
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,800
I went around this airside for more than two hours this morning.

294
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,470
I worked hard to collect them.

295
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,460
Then take them back.

296
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,200
Anyhow, it's your department that takes care of them.

297
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,740
Our department doesn't take care of things that the Security Team leaves out.

298
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,000
Can't you help us, knowing that it's an emergency situation?

299
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,580
Then you should have politely asked for my help from the beginning.

300
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,600
Since we're both doing hard jobs.

301
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,150
I understand. I'll come clean up as soon as this situation is over.

302
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,860
Don't touch them. Leave them just as they are.

303
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,500
We'll clean this up for you right now.

304
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,400
Where should we leave them for you?

305
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,300
Never mind. You can just leave.

306
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,350
Next time, don't act like this again.

307
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,810
I told you to do your work properly, didn't I?

308
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,610
If you borrowed equipment that doesn't belong to our team, then cleaning it up should be a given.

309
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,950
Anyhow, this is their job.

310
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,780
Hurry and clean it up.

311
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,150
Just leave it. She said she would take care of it.

312
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,520
Yes.

313
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,210
Do you even know how heavy the stanchions are?

314
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,690
My shoulders, back and hips ache like crazy every time I move these things around.

315
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,120
There was nothing in that trash container.

316
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,610
I went to the trash container you told me to.

317
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,280
There was no black plastic bag in there.

318
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,910
Are you sure you put it in there?

319
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,040
I searched all the nearby trash containers, but there was nothing.

320
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,770
Lee Soo Yeon.

321
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,930
What are you doing here?

322
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,260
We need to complete our inspection of the airside facilities by this morning.

323
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,320
After lunch, we need to inspect the landside, so I'd appreciate if you could hurry a bit.

324
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,900
Th-th-th-

325
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,030
Those people! I think they are the smugglers.

326
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,520
Remember the gold bars I found earlier wrapped in the black plastic bag, thrown in the trash can that was turned in to Customs?

327
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,110
I'm talking about unauthorized fixtures, Han Yeo Reum.

328
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,180
I think those people are trying to find the gold.

329
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,380
What should we do? Should we report this? Where should we report it?

330
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,440
Whether it's about the gold bars or smuggling, these are Customs issues.

331
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,900
That's not our business.

332
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,720
How does it not relate to us? I personally witnessed the crime scene in the airport.

333
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,590
There are other people who will deal with these kind of things.

334
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,990
The work you and I have to do today is

335
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,050
taking care of unauthorized fixtures throughout the airport.

336
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,440
Did I say we won't clean them up?

337
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,080
An emergency situation has appeared, so we need to fix that first.

338
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,680
Then we will do it next. Ok?

339
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,120
If you keep on insisting on these type of acts and handling things by yourself,

340
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,390
I can only report you to the team leader.

341
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,070
- Then report me.
- What?

342
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,170
The ticking bomb of the Passenger Service Department, Han Yeo Reum,

343
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,510
played a big part in apprehending the gold smugglers in one shot.

344
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,120
I also want a cool title and get noticed by my superiors.

345
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,850
You better report me.

346
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,720
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

347
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,420
There was definitely gold in a plastic bag found inside of a trash can.

348
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,170
In addition, the gold bullion found in the trash this morning was discovered and turned in to Customs by her.

349
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,210
Lately, the smugglers have been offering free trips to the public in exchange for smuggling gold.

350
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,170
I think it's the case now.

351
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,050
Please alert Customs, Immigration, and the Police.

352
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,210
Yes, sir.

353
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,240
You've worked hard. What department are you from?

354
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,790
I am Han Yeo Reum from the Passenger Service Team.

355
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,080
Team Leader.

356
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,310
Truthfully, I was coming from the TCC.

357
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,180
I was the key player in reporting the people related to smuggling.

358
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,700
Smuggling issues need to be turned over to TCC and not to Customs.

359
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,010
But the Security Captain said I worked hard and did a good job.

360
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,510
He praised me a lot.

361
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,040
Did you remove all the surplus equipment I asked you to remove?

362
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,410
- What?
- Lee Soon Yeon did not tell you?

363
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,090
I asked that you make your rounds to the airside as well as the landside.

364
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,750
Ah, actually...

365
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,670
What? Are you saying that Lee Soo Yeon is covering all of that area by himself?

366
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,730
I was actually leaving. I'll be back.

367
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,520
What's this? I thought for sure she was going to praise me for a job well done.

368
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,550
Could you please remove these unregistered banners?

369
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,710
- I'll come back tomorrow to check on them.
- Yes.

370
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,860
There are more unregistered banners than I thought.

371
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,350
You must be very proud of yourself since the team leader appreciates you so much.

372
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,610
She was so upset with me that I let you cover this huge area all by yourself.

373
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,410
It probably wasn't about me but you. She wants you to do your job well.

374
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,990
Look here, Lee Soo Yeon! Or rather, Agent Lee Soo Yeon!

375
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,420
Could you please remove this unregistered banner?

376
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,610
I'll be back tomorrow morning to check on it.

377
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,370
If you don't remove it by then, I'll have to confiscate all of them.

378
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,410
Don't you think we should work according to priorities?

379
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,600
Smuggling is a serious crime but removing the banners can be done at any time.

380
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,040
There was a seven-year-old child who tripped on a banner this morning.

381
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,110
His elbow was cut at least ten centimeters due to the fall.

382
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,080
He received treatment but missed the plane.

383
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,270
As a result, his mother missed her one and only sister's wedding.

384
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,880
Did you say priority?

385
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,200
Completing your daily assignments well and on time,

386
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,090
checking in advance to ensure passenger safety,

387
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,950
these are the priorities of the Passenger Service agent.

388
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,280
Wow...you're so cool!
