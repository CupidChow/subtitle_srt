1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,360
What?

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,970
You think you found out the cause of it?

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,810
Yes. I think I know what it is.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,400
What is it? What is causing the malfunctions?

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,270
Han Yeo Reum.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,020
The first time a malfunction began to happen was that day.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,080
Just when I met her again.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,310
Again that day too.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,790
Again that day too.

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,660
As my feelings for her grew stronger,

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,400
the anomalies gradually grew out of control.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,210
What are you talking about? Anomalies?

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,140
You said you had definitely completed your examination.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,850
But it appears that you didn't.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,450
Why? What fight are you trying to pick now?

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,860
I saw all sorts of iron objects fly toward him and stick onto his arms.

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,130
It seems there is a lot of magnetic substances in his arm.

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,330
In the unlikely case that a malfunction occurs at our airport, what will happen?

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,880
We have a lot of state of the art equipment. Right?

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,420
So, what are you going to do now?

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,140
I wanted to do whatever it took to stay with her for just a month.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,470
Han Yeo Reum

24
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,010
Yes, Yeo Reum. It's me.

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,130
Lee Soo Yeon, are you alright?

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,560
Ah... I'm fine.

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,660
If you don't want to talk about what happened earlier at work,

28
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,560
It's okay if you don't tell me.

29
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,580
I'm sure there's a reason for it.

30
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,430
That's how I will think,

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,430
so you don't have to force an explanation.

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,380
It's really okay.

33
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,900
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

34
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,240
Are you listening to me?

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,430
Will it be really okay?

36
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,070
If I like you,

37
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,940
will it really be all right?

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,250
The difference between knowing your wounds and embracing your wounds.
Episode 21

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,130
You've worked hard. Shift is over.

40
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,870
Thank you.

41
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,810
Hello!

42
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,230
Where should I go for departures?

43
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,750
Oh, departures. Go that way and then go up the escalator.

44
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,400
By the way, I forgot my passport at home but how can I get a temporary passport?

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,790
Ah, right. Go straight that way until you reach Gate 6.

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,210
Hello.

47
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,750
Oh! It's Team Leader Lee.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,230
What's going on?

49
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,260
We prepared something not that big as a reward for your hardwork so just accept it.

50
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,580
Omo!

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,330
The shower room in the transit area is constantly flooded so there is a high risk of an accident.

52
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,830
Someone go in and check it.

53
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,150
Did you hear that, Assistant Nam? Go and contact the manager.

54
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,030
Me, again?

55
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,520
I've been crazy busy with the construction of the west resting area lately.

56
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,550
Excuse me, Assistant Kim.

57
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,590
I'm tied up all afternoon with the casting of the Christmas performance.

58
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,790
I'll be back.

59
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,510
What about you, Assistant Choi?

60
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,680
I have to go out to replace the furniture at the Nap Zone.

61
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,450
- Over there...
- Han Yeo Reum,

62
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,110
- we should get going.
- Pardon?

63
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,370
We'll do rounds landside.

64
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,790
Okay.

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
We'll be back.

66
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,440
Team Leader Yang.

67
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,040
See me for a moment, we have to talk.

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
Where shall we go first?

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,930
Landside or airside?

70
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,580
Landside. We've been ordered to crack down on illegal call vans all this week.

71
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,780
Ah, yes.

72
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,230
Do you want the east side or the west side?

73
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,860
How about not splitting up east and west, and go around together today?

74
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,200
Alright, I'll take the west side.

75
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,830
So, when are we going on a date?

76
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,370
You're the one who broke our date last time.

77
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,580
You said we'll reschedule, but you haven't yet.

78
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,710
When can we have that dinner, Agent Lee Soo Yeon?

79
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,510
Later.

80
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,580
Let's talk later.

81
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,800
Wait a moment! Wait a moment!

82
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up and get in.

83
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,380
Aigoo, thank you.

84
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,580
We're sorry to intrude.

85
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

86
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:35,460
♫ The person I'm curious about
Quietly makes me worry ♫

87
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,470
♫ Will you please tell me more about you? ♫

88
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:50,630
♫ My heart which was not heavy, gradually saw you ♫

89
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,350
♫ When I kept looking, it grew more intense ♫

90
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:03,160
♫ It was an accident like fate ♫

91
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,470
♫ I got close to you and reached out ♫

92
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:17,140
♫ In the moment which seemed to be an instant coming like fate  ♫

93
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,720
♫ I felt it when I saw you ♫

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,750
♫ The small bit of warmth left in my hand ♫

95
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,320
♫ I want to place in your hand ♫

96
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:44,290
♫ Yearning for you more than anyone becomes a warm summer ♫

97
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,270
♫ It melts my heart. ♫

98
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:55,880
♫ Tell me more about yourself. ♫

99
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,980
♫ You who are smiling warmly ♫

100
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,120
Let me ask you about two things.

101
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,360
Yes.

102
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,890
Han Yeo Reum, don't you find me strange?

103
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,780
By any chance, if you are talking about your arm...

104
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,990
Yes, I thought it was strange.

105
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,630
Since the time my locket stuck to your arm.

106
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,780
Don't you think I'm scary?

107
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,060
What do you mean by that?

108
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,650
I mean, you saw what happened yesterday.

109
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,970
What's more, I heard you know I have a level 1 physical disability.

110
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,940
Then, is it something I should be scared of?

111
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,430
Anyway, I'm different.

112
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,050
Anyway, aren't we all different?

113
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,980
We were born different. And we've lived different lives.

114
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,020
I want to live a special life, but you want to live an ordinary one.

115
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,340
I want to do everything well and hear I'm talented, but you ...

116
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,820
I detest attracting attention.

117
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:27,060
I already know that we're different people.

118
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,020
What is it you are worried about more?

119
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,320
To keep malfunctioning.

120
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,420
Because of you ... I

121
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,860
keep malfunctioning.

122
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,860
What do you mean by saying that?

123
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:07,030
♬  Someone's appearance can make my today a day which is entirely painful ♬

124
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,480
♫ Someone's laughter can make my whole heart happy ♫

125
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,840
I like you this much.

126
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,470
Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

127
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,780
But the more I like you,... because of you...

128
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,960
my heart trembles and hurts,

129
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,780
♬ Just the heavy burden you carry  ♬

130
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,180
and I keep malfunctioning more severely.

131
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,910
♬  I am happy I can share it with you ♬

132
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,820
Lee Soo Yeon.

133
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,480
♫  I'm speaking from my heart♫

134
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:51,630
♫  All the times when we loved are precious♫

135
00:12:52,740 --> 00:13:00,010
♫ I want to say It's okay, it's okay ♫

136
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,460
♫ I'm saying you are everything I need ♫

137
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,250
I'm sorry.

138
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,310
Please give me some time.
♫ Your very existence as you are now is precious  ♫

139
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,470
I'm sorry, Han Yeo Reum.

140
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,810
♬ I am saying you are enough. I am saying you are enough. ♬

141
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:39,840
♫ Because I know you, the yearning for you makes my heart beat  ♫

142
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:52,940
♫  Because you hold and hug me, I can think about tomorrow  ♫

143
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,480
♫ Because of you  ♫

144
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,500
Come up to the Operations Planning Department for a while.

145
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,240
So he keeps breaking. What an interesting metaphor.

146
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,480
So? Just where is he broken?

147
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
His heart? His soul?

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,230
I'm not sure.

149
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,800
Are you sure you like him?

150
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,030
Did you tell him you like him?

151
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,420
No, not yet.

152
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,430
What would you do if you were in a serious relationship?

153
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,660
Just let it casually pass by.

154
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,930
There. Would you like to eat one?

155
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,060
Thank you.

156
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,360
By any chance, isn't it a radio?

157
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,080
Yes, you're right. I picked it up.

158
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,600
I think this belongs to our airport.

159
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,320
No.

160
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,030
That's right. I'm sure it belongs to the airport.

161
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,020
It's not. This is Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi's.

162
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,980
What? Sunbaenim Oh Dae Gi?

163
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,090
Oh Dae Gi?

164
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,540
By the way, where did Na Yeong Joo go? I don't see her around.

165
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,460
I think she had something to take care of.

166
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,990
Where? Were there any backup requests from the patrols?

167
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,110
No. It's not like that.

168
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,610
What is it?

169
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,780
Excuse me. Did you see one of the homeless people, one wearing a fedora hat, a trenchcoat and horn-rimmed glasses,

170
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,430
in his late fifties or early sixties?

171
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,350
I'm not sure.

172
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,920
What happened?

173
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,500
The Security Team Leader asked me to limit your work radius to landside from now on.

174
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,860
Why are you limiting my work radius?

175
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,260
I heard that yesterday, while in front of Team Leader Seo In Woo, iron objects stuck to you.

176
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,260
You told me there has never been any error at all.

177
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,380
If things keep happening contrary to what you told me,

178
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,970
I don't think I'll be able to give you that one month I promised to you.

179
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,880
I know the cause of the error. I'm trying to find a way of controlling it now.

180
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,430
Can't you get it fixed?

181
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,840
If he can't get it fixed, he should quit.

182
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,250
You shouldn't go around attached to a walking assist device which has developed problems,

183
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,640
and repeat a dangerous situation like yesterday. Don't you agree, Lee Soo Yeon?

184
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,300
Team Leader Seo, we'd like to discuss this amongst ourselves now.

185
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,770
Although he is a member of your team, is there something to cover and hide in private?

186
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,590
This isn't just a team issue. Furthermore, for operation headquarters,

187
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,760
this involves the airport's safety as well. Isn't that so, Team Leader Choi?

188
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,770
Don't exceed your authority.

189
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,900
I've told you that several times, Team Leader Seo.

190
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,560
I've already checked with the NIS ... There's no report on Lee Soo Yeon yet.

191
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,830
I don't know what connections you have, Team Leader Choi,

192
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,700
but when I asked you to review the issue, that doesn't matter, does it? Right?

193
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,530
Don't you agree?

194
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,830
Please stop, Team Leader Seo.

195
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,250
I'm talking to the Team Leaders, Lee Soo Yeon.

196
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,380
An employee should stay out of it.

197
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,930
It's my problem, so let me talk, Hyung!

198
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,380
This way.

199
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,130
However, could I return that radio myself?

200
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,870
No, you can't.

201
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,680
I have to give it back to him myself and I'll receive greetings of gratitude politely.

202
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,770
It's even better if I can get a portion of jajangmyeon (black-bean noodle dish) out of it, too.

203
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,850
Stay right here. I'll check if it belongs to Oh Dae Gi.

204
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,580
You can't go anywhere else. You know, right?

205
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,220
All right, go ahead.

206
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,760
You should stop now.

207
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,630
I know you hate me. But no need to harass other people because of it.

208
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,450
You are going to leave like that and when you do, you should do it quietly.

209
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,730
Why are you being obstinate and making it noisy for several others?

210
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,850
What are your intentions?

211
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,620
Are you trying to get revenge on me or what?

212
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,120
You think I'm here to get revenge on you?

213
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,450
While being attached to some sort of unidentified assist machine

214
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,720
and making an unimaginable effort, you've been hanging around my turf.

215
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,120
You're spooking me, f***ing with me, and threatening me now, aren't you?

216
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,530
Everything was fine before you came here.

217
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,650
You, that accident, I had forgotten it all and was living just fine.

218
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,730
While being moderately nice, moderately cool, moderately boastful ...

219
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,730
But, after seeing me, you can't do that anymore?

220
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,370
Because you keep thinking about how you cowardly abandoned me and ran away,

221
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,040
Hurt, found at fault and rebuked. Is that it?

222
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,820
Hurt, found at fault and rebuked.

223
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,710
The sound I make when there is a conscience in my mind, Soo Yeon.

224
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,780
It's been a long time since I let that all go.

225
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,420
I've never lived thinking I was a good person.

226
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,250
And I've never even tried to become a good person.

227
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,230
Honestly, from birth,

228
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,570
I wasn't born that way.

229
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,280
So, you and I,

230
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,740
let's end this doomed relationship.

231
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,410
If you loathe seeing me so much, you should be the one to quit.

232
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,450
If I could have quit on my own,

233
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,380
I would never have come here in the first place.

234
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,100
What do you mean?

235
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,450
There are people in the world who paint pictures which are so large, your mind can't fathom them.

236
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,700
I am just a very small part of those people's pictures.

237
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,460
So Soo Yeon, please just leave this place.

238
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,410
Before you get hurt again. Got it?

239
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,820
Ah, I'm sorry. I got lost.

240
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,060
Ahjussi!

241
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,060
Oh... Team Leader.

242
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,250
Who is this person, Han Yeo Reum?

243
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:01,220
He said he picked up something that belonged to the Security Team.

244
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,800
So I brought him over here.

245
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,110
Do you know Team Leader Seo, by any chance?

246
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,690
Ahjussi?

247
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm Soo Yeon.

248
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,190
Director Jo

249
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,510
What? Really?

250
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,950
Lower your voice.

251
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,710
Are you sure you saw Team Leader Lee taking money from them?

252
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,660
Yeah, he still has that envelope in his pocket.

253
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,930
Do you see that yellow envelope?

254
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,760
What? Who took what?

255
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,010
Team Leader Lee Yoo Taek. They said he accepted a money envelope.

256
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,310
Oh my god!

257
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,910
Say something that makes sense. Where did you hear such a ridiculous thing?

258
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,790
Shhh. Speak quietly, everyone will hear you.

259
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,720
Assistant Yoon saw him with his own eyes. Before work,

260
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,990
he saw him go to the son of the call van taxi manager. And even the envelope ...

261
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,090
Everything was seen with his own eyes.

262
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,080
I think this looks good now.

263
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,600
Yes, sir.

264
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,580
Have you seen a man in his 50s or 60s wearing a fedora hat, a trenchcoat and horn-rimmed glasses?

265
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,710
No, I haven't.

266
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,520
Na Yeong Joo, what are you doing here?

267
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,730
What happened? Is it a support request from another team?

268
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,000
How many times have you circled around here?

269
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,120
Three times around.

270
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,580
Are you going to keep getting me embarrassed?

271
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,900
Think about it if you were me. A hoobae is working like a dog because of a sunbae's mistake.

272
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm not doing it because you made me. I'm doing it because I want to.

273
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,860
In any case, as a sunbae, I'm ashamed to face my hoobae.

274
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,100
Were you very ashamed before other team members also?

275
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,880
Whom else on the team would I be ashamed to be seen by?

276
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,560
To whom?

277
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,910
You.

278
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,380
I'm ashamed in front of you.

279
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,800
From now on, you'll forget about the radio that I lost, Na Yeong Joo.

280
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,650
That means don't turn your work in the field into something else, do you understand?

281
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,990
Have a pick-me-up drink.

282
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,110
Oh, Sunbaenim, here you are.

283
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,510
Yes, what's going on?

284
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,800
Passenger Services Han Yeo Reum stopped by. She found the person who picked up your radio.

285
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,640
She found him? Where is she?

286
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,700
- Please give me a morning combo.
- Yes.

287
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,950
I didn't recognize you. I didn't know you had grown up so well.

288
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,500
- Is your mother well?
- Yes.

289
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,130
I think I heard you were seriously injured in a car accident.

290
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm fine now.

291
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:24,300
I think I lost touch with In Woo about then.

292
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,820
Having lost touch for over ten years,

293
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,790
not long ago, I heard about him from an acquaintance of mine by accident.

294
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,860
That he thought In Woo was working in the airport.

295
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,420
Please eat while you're talking.

296
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,960
Sit down and eat with us.

297
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,730
No, it's all right. Please enjoy your talk. I have business to attend to.

298
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,590
Sure?

299
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,280
Then I'll excuse myself.

300
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,480
Are you the one who is broken?

301
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,180
What?

302
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,240
I heard that someone is broken because of Han Yeo Reum.

303
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,130
It's you, isn't it?

304
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,390
Hey! Let go!

305
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,710
Let go! I love you, Seung Hee!

306
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,750
You can't ever break up with me!

307
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,870
Please look at me, Seung Hee!

308
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,850
Yes, I am Han Yeo Reum.

309
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,680
Oh?

310
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,190
A homeless person picked it up and wanted me to give it to you, since it seemed to belong to Security.

311
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,140
By any chance, was it a man wearing a fedora hat and a trenchcoat?

312
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,780
Yes, that's right. An ahjussi wearing horn-rimmed glasses.

313
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,240
- It's too bad. I should have caught him.
- What?

314
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,040
He said he had the object he acquired for more than a full day. Isn't that very intentional?

315
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,200
I don't think he had it with bad intentions.

316
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,660
And I don't think he used it for anything bad.

317
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,340
In any case. Thanks for finding it. I'll repay you.

318
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,700
Sunbaenim, I have your radio.

319
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,440
Oh!!!

320
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,350
Wow, Na Yeong Joo, you're quite amazing.

321
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,990
You have the guts!

322
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,300
I told you not to look for my radio, didn't I? Ignoring your sunbae's instructions.

323
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,800
Hey, Oh Dae Gi, what are you talking about?

324
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,230
You should be thankful if your hoobae worked hard and found your radio.

325
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:53,040
Passenger Team's Han Yeo Reum recovered it for you. She's my roommate.

326
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,630
Usually, you would have to write an apology if you lose your radio.

327
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,740
But you're getting off easy, because of your hoobae. Got it, Oh Dae Gi?

328
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,930
Yes, I understand.

329
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,580
Thank you, Na Yeong Joo.

330
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,670
It's alright.

331
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,700
- Hey, you are so cool!
- We'll have to ask her for help if we lose our radio.

332
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,630
- She is great! She's good at everything.
- As expected, she's so cool.

333
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,560
This is your radio, isn't it?

334
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,880
Yes, just a minute please.

335
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,640
Why are you saying that?

336
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,090
Could you give it to Na Yeong Joo?

337
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,590
To Na Yeong Joo? Why?

338
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,000
I'd like to give my hoobae some encouragement. I ask this favor of you.

339
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,990
Ms. Fantastic Na Yeong Joo!

340
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:50,590
She is so cool!

341
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,120
She's so persistent that it scares me.

342
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,920
