00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,570
Where Stars Land

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,410
Episode 28

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,580
Han Yeo Reum, stop being so stubborn and let me do it.

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,460
I said no.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,130
I said no, Agent Lee Soo Yeon.

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,740
Han Yeo Reum.

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,330
Hey, Han Yeo Reum. Come this way, this way.

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,720
Yes, I'm going.

9
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,130
I'm alright. Really.

10
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,190
- Would you like a cup of noodles?
- Yes.

11
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,140
Excuse me, my baby has to eat some too.

12
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,920
Ah, there is some bread ready but how old is your baby?

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,750
Is that organic? My baby only eats organic food.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,960
Right, baby?

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,950
Oh, so pretty! Are you hungry? Alright, alright..

16
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,900
Compensate us! Compensate us!

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,260
They said it's foggy and the plane can't leave. What about my vacation?

18
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,580
Compensate us! Compensate us! Please say it with me.

19
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,560
Section Chief, you should go over there.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,120
- This is the third time!
- That's awesome.

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,930
Here is the big hit!

22
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,440
But... If you drink too much alcohol, you can not board the plane.

23
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,690
Boarding can be denied.

24
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,920
And, could you tone down the gostop?

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,590
The children's education ...

26
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,690
He's right, let's stop.

27
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,500
Is this a lunchbox? Are you eating it?

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,110
No, it's not for eating. It's Widemobile Pocket WiFi.

29
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,690
Don't you know. Nowadays, I have to travel abroad.

30
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,690
With this, I can use the Internet and everything abroad.

31
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,220
But why is it a lunchbox? It's not even edible.

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,070
A lunchbox is a lunchbox.

33
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,700
Would you like to have this lunchbox?

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,730
Would you like to drink some water?

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,810
I'll do it.

36
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,320
I said I'll do it.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,790
Really... why are you being like this today?

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,520
If you are sick, you should go and rest. Promptly.

39
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,100
- Let me see it.
- Oh, no. It's alright.

40
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,790
When did you buy that?

41
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,570
You won't let me do anything. What can I do then?

42
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,130
Shall I spray something which I bought?

43
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,570
Tell me now.

44
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,520
About what?

45
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,650
Something happened last night after you parted from me, right?

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,160
No. Nothing happened.

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,590
Why did you drink so much last night?

48
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,740
It was to commemorate become friends with Na Yeong Joo.

49
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,220
Why do you continue to be weird to me today?

50
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,580
That's because your condition doesn't look good.

51
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,310
Look. You still have a fever. Are you really all right?

52
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,900
Don't you really need to go to the hospital?

53
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,490
Wait a moment.

54
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,550
Yes, Na Yeong Joo.

55
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,260
Ah, I'm sorry.

56
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,450
Oh, Na Yeong Joo. What's the matter?

57
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,360
A homeless man collapsed and lost consciousness. He was just moved to the medical center.

58
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,030
But I think he matches the description.

59
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,330
Is he the one?

60
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,890
Middle aged, trench coat and horn-rimmed glasses. When the radio was lost ...

61
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,640
Oh, is that so? I see...

62
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,900
Okay, I'll go. Wait a little bit.

63
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,170
Why? What's the matter?

64
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,390
As many as we have of our information staff should be going to the check-in counter now.

65
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,100
Please add fifteen more.

66
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,120
Do as much as you can.

67
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,790
Because I've got all the idle counters open, please assign them to the passengers who have the longest delay.

68
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,510
Don't let it get too crowded in any area. Keep the lines orderly.

69
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes, I understand.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,060
It's crazy, here too.

71
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,810
What's the matter?

72
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,860
I heard you went out with the General Manager last night.

73
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,020
I happened to run into a hoobae I know. (junior).

74
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,750
It's nice you went.

75
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,140
Is the Security Team now checking on the General Manager and my movements?

76
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Maybe or maybe not, depending on whom you met at the location.

77
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,630
The General Nanager and I went out to have a glass of wine.

78
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,060
Is that so?

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,230
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

80
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,130
Because I'm certain, if you don't have any business, would you please step aside?

81
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,720
Everyone is so busy.

82
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,410
By the way, I heard you were a scholarship student.

83
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,730
One of my closest friends was one too.

84
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,390
But the guy ended up very badly.

85
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,400
What do you mean?

86
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,430
Perhaps if you ever need any help, tell me anytime.

87
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,360
This is completely out of context.

88
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,590
Furthermore, you are someone who bears a grudge against me.

89
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,990
A grudge is a grudge and

90
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,990
living and dying is a different problem.

91
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,470
Director Jo, what happened? Why the Security Team Leader...?

92
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,870
How did the Security Team Leader know about yesterday's meeting with the General Manager?

93
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,740
If, there is any possibility that the General Manager knows about the situation,

94
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,370
then I will immediately nullify everything.

95
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,360
Then the angry Chairman will make you very very uncomfortable..

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,930
Not only me, but you too. It's going to be a very uncomfortable situation.

97
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,560
What do you mean by this?

98
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,390
Hit the cover so well that he can't touch our side any more.

99
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,180
Are you asking me to do that now?

100
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,780
Of course. Follow my instructions so that everything is wrapped out securely,

101
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,270
starting now until it's done.

102
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,650
Seo In Woo

103
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,030
What was that?

104
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,220
What kind of situation General Manager should not know?

105
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,190
This is the work of an adult,

106
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,530
This is the world of adults. You just...

107
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,460
live life as you have been doing.

108
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,850
Ahjussi collapsed.

109
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,170
He has both pneumonia and malnutrition.

110
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,030
He is also unconscious.

111
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,900
He got first aid and is now in a hospital in Incheon, where he was transported.

112
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,030
This is the hospital's address.

113
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,400
I do not know what's going on in my brother's world now,

114
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,330
but even so, you should make time to visit.

115
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,680
The day has been frustrating and very uncomfortable, hasn't it?

116
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
It is foggy in the western and central parts of the country.

117
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,240
There have been disruptions of flights traveling to and from Incheon airport.

118
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,750
Around 7 pm this evening, when the fog is lifted,

119
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,250
normal operations are expected to resume.

120
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,410
It's been confirmed that the current RVR is more than 800 meters.

121
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,930
Cancel the Low visibility category 2 one hour from now.

122
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,710
Apron, AB745 Request Taxi.

123
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:11,430
AB745, Taxi to spot 4 Echo via Romeo 4, Romeo 7.

124
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,690
ST412, Wind 330 degrees, 10 knots. Runway 33 Left. Cleared for take off.

125
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:23,160
Runway 33L cleared for take off, ST412.

126
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,290
Hey, hey, hey. We are starting from now.

127
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,210
It's not over until it's over.

128
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,630
Look at it and see how many connections are delayed.

129
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,990
Do you want to bet?

130
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,700
Last Christmas, we only had 800 connection delays, right?

131
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,770
If that was the case, I expect we'll have 300.

132
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,770
There are 32 plus sections, so it's a total of over 300 connections.

133
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,100
Hey, everyone cheer up!

134
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,420
What, what? Is it coming out now?

135
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,560
Oh, it's strange. I still have one month left.

136
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,910
Inhale and exhale.

137
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,650
Eun Seob, please call the child's father.

138
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,160
Hey! What are you doing? My hair hurts. Call the child's dad!

139
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,790
Are you alright?

140
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,810
- Wait a moment.
- Ah, my hair. My hair...

141
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,830
Hey! Good work, everyone.

142
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,220
Hey, how would it be if I gave you back just a day like this?

143
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,000
Telling you not to go home for two days, like last Christmas.

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,090
If that's a consolation for you.

145
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,640
What happened to the gas, Team Leader Heo?

146
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,370
Ah, right. What happened to the gas?

147
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,600
There is a problem with the line from Incheon City.

148
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,150
It should be repaired by tonight.

149
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,800
Gosh. Feeding thousands of passengers.

150
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,030
It was very cheap and easy to buy and distribute cup noodles and bread.

151
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,630
Aigoo, our Team Leader Heo.

152
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,350
Your face looks gaunt. You've worked hard.

153
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,680
Hurry and punch out. See you tomorrow.

154
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,340
Shall we stop somewhere?

155
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,590
You all did a great job!

156
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,460
I'll keep the domestic passengers waiting area open until all delays are resolved.

157
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,700
I'll stay on duty tonight. Only one other person should stay. Who will it be?

158
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,810
Hey, Assistant Nam.

159
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,710
Yes, I understand.

160
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,620
I'll do it. Instead, arrive early tomorrow. Understand?

161
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,480
Good job, everyone.

162
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,310
See you tomorrow.

163
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,430
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

164
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,520
Shall we also get going now?

165
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,720
Let's wrap things up first.

166
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,410
You like Lee Soo Yeon, right?

167
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,190
Then, please stop him. There isn't any way that he can work any longer.

168
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,980
I'll do what is left and you go first, alright?

169
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,160
Please tell me honestly.

170
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,910
Why are you doing this to me today?

171
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,650
I told you. It's because I'm worried about you.

172
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,950
I've become your person now, even if I'm worried about you, haven't I?

173
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,270
It's not a cold.

174
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,920
If it's not, what is it? Perhaps...

175
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,340
Is it an infection?

176
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,510
Perhaps... Did you meet Mr. Jang?

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,250
Omo, me? It's not that.

178
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,230
- Han Yeo Reum.
- I did not meet anyone last night.

179
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,850
You really haven't heard anything, have you? It's the truth.

180
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,400
Han Yeo Reum, do you know you have a habit?

181
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,130
If you want to hide something or want to avoid it,

182
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,880
suddenly you start to talk non-stop and suddenly you brighten up.

183
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,110
Omo, me? Hahaha...

184
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,260
Omo, me?

185
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,100
It's not like that.

186
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,620
Are you really not going to tell me?

187
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,610
To be honest, I met him.

188
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,080
That Mr. Jang...

189
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,380
What story did you hear from him?

190
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,470
You are...

191
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,470
You're in a bad physical condition.

192
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,000
What else?

193
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,260
He said he is worried because the inflammation level of your body is so high.

194
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,740
And what else?

195
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,450
I heard until there.

196
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,000
Really... only until there?

197
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,330
A high level of inflammation in his body is a bad sign for Soo Yeon.

198
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,020
What should I do?

199
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,700
It's alright. Please tell me.

200
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,020
I can do anything. I'll do it.

201
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,940
He must not use the wearable devices he is using now.

202
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,360
For how long?

203
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,270
I don't know that either, whether it's a month or year or more.

204
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,090
Then, what will happen to Lee Soo Yeon?

205
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,090
For a while,

206
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,950
we must return to the way things were after the accident.

207
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,290
Do you mean he has to ride a wheelchair again?

208
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,800
Yes.

209
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,250
In order for Lee Soo Yeon to live.

210
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,410
Han Yeo Reum.

211
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,200
That's it.

212
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,650
It's the arm you are wearing. It ...

213
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,630
Can't you take if off now? Huh?

214
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,830
If you take it off,

215
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,150
you won't break down anymore.

216
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,330
The infection won't happen anymore and you won't have a fever.

217
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,950
You won't hurt anymore.

218
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,390
Please stop.

219
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,540
- Lee Soo Yeon.
- Stop!

220
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,340
I'll do it, Han Yeo Reum.

221
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,390
Lee Soo Yeon. Lee Soo Yeon!

222
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,680
- We have enjoyed the food.
- Yes, thank you.

223
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,310
- What's the matter?
- Did you visit Han Yeo Reum?

224
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,060
Yes, I did.

225
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,610
After you found her, how far did you go in what you told her?

226
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,280
Almost everything she needed to know.

227
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,120
Why the heck did you?

228
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,950
Why the heck did you tell her? Why?

229
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,320
- Because you wouldn't listen to me!
- Sir!

230
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,300
All the inflammation levels are up.

231
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,120
The CK level means the infection has spread to your kidneys.

232
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,990
That means muscle necrosis has already started!

233
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,460
That's the condition of your body.

234
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,430
You're still being pointlessly stubborn.

235
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,010
You can't wear it right now.

236
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,120
You have to take it off. Do you know?

237
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,020
I don't want to.

238
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,410
If you're stubborn and miss the treatment, you will lose something way more important, Soo Yeon.

239
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,480
Do I have anything left to lose?

240
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,530
In the worst case...

241
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,020
You could die.

242
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,600
- I don't care...
- What?

243
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,100
It's my life. Even if it doesn't work out,

244
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,540
It can't be helped.

245
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,560
Dude! I saved you. I made it for you.

246
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,370
Is that what you are saying to me now?

247
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,010
I want to live too.

248
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,750
Today, now...

249
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,790
I want to live more than anyone else.

250
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,630
But...

251
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,940
Not like that.

252
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,140
Twice, again,

253
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,920
I don't want to feel that way.

254
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,160
I will fix it.

255
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
Not the device.

256
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,450
My body is failing.

257
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,530
Is this something you can fix?

258
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,650
It's not.

259
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,730
Soo Yeon.

260
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,350
Two times again, lying in bed...

261
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,660
I don't want to regret losing today.

262
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,300
Those eleven years ...

263
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,860
They were already enough for me.

264
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,750
Fox Bride Star

265
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,560
Are you going home?

266
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,170
Yes, I'll be going.

267
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,530
You have not answered me yet.

268
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,350
What answer?

269
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,750
What I care about ... you asked what do I care?

270
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,310
Your concern bothers me.

271
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,940
- Is that so?
- But, it's just up to there.

272
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,900
That's as far as your concern goes.

273
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,690
I want to work here for a long long time.

274
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,800
A stable salary and a stable job are my personal priorities now.

275
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,310
I don't want to waver, even if its just an emotion I might not be aware of.

276
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,110
I don't want to feel uncomfortable towards you because of that emotion.

277
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,730
I still prefer being alone.

278
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,250
Then, see you tomorrow.

279
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,410
We haven't even started. Have I just been dumped?

280
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,080
What are you doing, Han Yeo Reum?

281
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,400
You're here?

282
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,160
Why are you like that? What are you worried about?

283
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,930
Yeo Reum, I finally took care of the emergency aircraft today. You want to know what was it like?

284
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,120
How was it?

285
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,040
Just decisively in one fell swoop handling and finishing it. Without any hesitation.

286
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,560
You should have been there to see it.

287
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,950
You should have seen my resolution.

288
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,660
Team Leader Park said "Good Job".

289
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,790
It must have been nice.

290
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,860
Yes, a bit.

291
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,510
Actually, ramp work is not fun.

292
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,490
But it was fun for the first time today.

293
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,800
What's the matter? What happened again?

294
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:06,220
Hey, Han Yeo Reum. Are you crying?

295
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,630
No.

296
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,330
Not when I am like this.

297
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,160
He is a sick person.

298
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,460
What is Lee Soo Yeon's illness?

299
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,180
I have to go.

300
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,460
Congratulations on today's emergency aircraft.

301
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,510
Doing it in one fell swoop. Good! Well done!

302
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:49,050
Although I didn't see it, I think you were really cool.

303
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,520
I'm leaving now. See you tomorrow.

304
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,950
Don't go. Today...

305
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,570
I need you today too. Don't go.

306
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,040
27 Ingak-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon, Hanguk University Hospital

307
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,650
Director Jo

308
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,190
What happened?

309
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,150
Oh, Team Leader Seo. While I was walking along the street, I accidentally met somebody.

310
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,270
Whom did you meet?

311
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,990
I think he's your brother.

312
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,830
His name is Lee Soo Yeon, right?

313
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,550
Hello? Director Jo?

314
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,730
What should we do?

315
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,460
Should we get rid of him somewhere?

316
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,850
It's been a while. To be honest, I didn't recognize you.

317
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:37,960
How are you so intact? At the time, you couldn't recover.

318
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,250
And a while ago, I heard you even beat up someone from my gang.

319
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,320
How could you have done that? Shall we see what your ability is?

320
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:11,220
♫ I want to go down and read ♫

321
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,730
♫ the feelings which I wrote to you ♫

322
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,920
♫ whom I like so much I could die ♫

323
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:24,960
♫ If I do that, won't  ♫

324
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,410
♫ everything change? ♫

325
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:33,680
♫ I dreamed that for a while. ♫
