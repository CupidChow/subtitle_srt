1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,340
 It's time for the last question.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,480
 In the story of Hong Gil Dong, what is

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,280
 the organization that he made in order to provide aid to the poor?

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,130
What was that? I knew what it was.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,940
I know. I think I know this too.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,050
An organization made to provide aid to the poor?

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,980
- Ah, UNICEF! 
- What?

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,330
What? How could Hong Gil Dong createe UNICEF, you idiot?

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,550
Hey, don't even think of answering and just listen, okay?

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,380
I could not know, you know. You're treating me like a total fool.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,270
 The answer is... Hwal Bin Dang.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,850
 You're correct!

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,840
 The 11th Quiz King has finally been decided!

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,670
 Kim Yeong Ja has won a prize of ₩40 million. (~$40K)  
- ₩40 million?

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,560
Hey!

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,740
- The prize is ₩40 million?
 - You didn't know?

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,540
That's why people are trying so hard to appear on this show lately.

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,500
Really?

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,230
Is that so?

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,700
It's time for Soo Yeon's program.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,930
Hey, isn't that you?
  Hello, Mister!

22
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,370

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,060
 No, no. Jaywalking is

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,640
 bad for children.

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,370
 When you cross the road, you must stand at the crosswalk, and look left and right.

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,760
 Raise your right hand up high...

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,520
Joon Ki, what on earth is that?

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,520
What is that?

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,530
What is that? "The Nice Man"? When did you star on that?

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,880
It hasn't been long.

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,300
I wasn't being cast for anything, and I failed all my auditions. What was I supposed to do?

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,400
Your life is so pitiful too.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,720
What's wrong with that? It's educational and nice.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,430
- That's right. 
- I guess.

35
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,730
Shall I go now?

36
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,360
The Nice Man! Here we go, Nice Man!

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,030
- You jerk.
 - Joon Ki!

38
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,030
Swearing is bad. No, no, swearing.

39
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,880
Nice kids shouldn't swear.

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,210
I told you to stop. Stop!

41
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,570
Joon Ki, no, no.

42
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,520
Nice kids shouldn't grab their friends by the collars like that.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,940
Come here. Come here!

44
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,860
Get over here!

45
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,410
 Grown-ups Just Don't Understand

46
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,190
Here we go, Nice Man!

47
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,590
Nice Man!

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,450
No, no.

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,730
Nice kids shouldn't be picky with their food. No, no.

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,560
Don't be picky when you eat food.

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,660
You must eat a balanced diet. Okay?

52
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,320
Here we go, Nice Man!

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,850
Nice Man!

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,680
No, no.

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,100
Nice kids should sleep early and wake up early.

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,460
- Okay?
 - Okay, Nice Man.

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,730
To everyone seeing "Fun For Kids TV," did you see?

58
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,410
I hope you become nice kids who always,

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,920
behave nicely just like me, The Nice Man. Okay?

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,430
I'll see you next time!

61
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,660
Oh. Here we go, Nice Man!

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,870
Cut. Okay. Good work.

63
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,820
- Good job.
 - Thank you.

64
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,990
- Director, thank you.
 - Good job today.

65
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,450
Joon Ki, take this.

66
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,370
- What is this?
 - What do you think?

67
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,110
They're fan letters and gifts from kids all over the country.

68
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,510
You're a total star these days.

69
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,210
Come on. I'm just popular among young kids. I'm not a star.

70
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,820
What are you talking about?

71
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,510
Don't you know how many celebrities become stars though kid programs?

72
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,200
Shin Se Kyung, Jang Seo Hee, Jo Hyo Jung, Ki Tae Young, Kim Sung Soo.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,830
It's countless.

74
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,570
Oh, really?

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,510
A star?

76
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,030
 Fun For Kids TV

77
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,200
How long has it been since I last got a present?

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,100
What if I really become a star at this rate?

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,420
Oh, it's the Nice Man!

80
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,290
Here we go, Nice Man! Hello!

81
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,120
- Do you know me too?
 - Of course!

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,900
You're the most popular person at my kindergarten!

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,440
Really?

84
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,800
BTS, look out!

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,090
Mister, can you sign your autograph on my backpack?

86
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,950
Autograph? Of course!

87
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,460
How long has it been since I last gave out my autograph?

88
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,330
Come here.

89
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,020
Let's see.

90
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:22,580
Lee...

91
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:29,210
Joon...

92
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,190
Ki...

93
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,890
There you go.

94
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,300
Thank you.

95
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,740
No problem.

96
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,140
It's time for the Nice Man to go now.

97
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:51,290

98
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,920
Here we go, Nice Man! Okay, I know.

99
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,590
Joon Ki, so these are all letters from your fans?

100
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,280
That's right.

101
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,490
Not only are there fan letters, but if you look in here,

102
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,860
there are cards, tops and even slime that I could play with.

103
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,960
There are so many presents.

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm about to be a star now.

105
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,270
Star, my foot. Stop overreacting.

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,770
Don't believe me if you don't want to. Goodness.

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,320
- Oh, it's Soo Mi.
 - Soo Mi?

108
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,480
Oh, that girl from your blind date last time?

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,830
Blind date? Did you go on a blind date?

110
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,980
Yes. A friend of mine introduced me to her.

111
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,790
Soo Mi is really cute, sexy, pretty and kind.

112
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,920
She's my ideal type.

113
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,430
- Do you want to see her picture?
 - Leave it. Enjoy it on your own.

114
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,560
Why is she giving me attitude?

115
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,100
Aigoo, there she goes again.

116
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,880
We need to throw out that alp-horn or smoking pipe, or whatever it is.

117
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,620
It's seriously so noisy!

118
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,710
Tell me about it.

119
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,400
But, why isn't "Challenge! Quiz King" calling? Was I disqualified?

120
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,170
"Challenge! Quiz King"?

121
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,860
You really submitted an application?

122
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,100
Yes. I'm going to win the prize money and open Yuri's Kitchen.

123
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,890
No way.

124
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,020
Even if you're chosen, do you know how difficult the questions are?

125
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,250
Do you take me for a fool? Hey, do you think I'm stupid like you?

126
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,210
Stupid? Who are you calling stupid?

127
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,840
You.

128
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,690
Gosh, seriously.

129
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,590
Hello? Yes, speaking.

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,550
What?

131
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,320
Oh, okay. Alright.

132
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,430
What? What was that about?

133
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,770
- It was the broadcasting station. I was chosen to play in "Challenge! Quiz King." 
- Huh?

134
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,870
Really? Are you serious?

135
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes. This is strange.

136
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,200
- I never submitted an application.
 - I did it.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,750
If I did it alone, the chances would have been narrow. So I submitted all your names too.

138
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,520
I really didn't know one of us would be chosen.

139
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,300
This is amazing. It's unbelievable!

140
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,440
Amazing? Do you think it's time to be happy?

141
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,790
They chose Gi Bong. Do you not know Gi Bong?

142
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,660
Oh, right.

143
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,480
Darn it! Why did it have to be this fool?

144
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,380
What? So why did you submit an application in my name?

145
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,930
Forget it, I'm not doing it.

146
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,060
That choice isn't up to you.

147
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,860
From now on, you and I are going to train hardcore.

148
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,580
- Put down your chopsticks.
 - I won't go.

149
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,430
- Put them down. 
- I'm not going...

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,250
- Hey, wait!
 - Put them down.

151
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,600
- That hurts.
 - Follow me.

152
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,410
- I'm not doing it!
 - We don't have time.

153
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,360
Gook Gi Bong. I know I'm grasping at straws here, but I'll try to teach you,

154
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,900
so listen and stay alert. Okay?

155
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,250
Okay.

156
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,170
First of all, in order to warm up, let's start with an easy question.

157
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,190
"When couples share money for their dates, or when people each pay for their own food at work,

158
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,730
what is this word called?"

159
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,110
I know this word. What was it?

160
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,810
- Ah. Dirty pay.
- What? Dirty pay?

161
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,950
Instead of one cool guy paying for everything, it's when everyone acts mean and dirty and pays individually.

162
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,300
That's why it's called "dirty pay."

163
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,520
Hey, that's "Dutch pay." How can it be dirty pay?

164
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,870
How could you be so stupid?

165
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,900
Let's move on.

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,670
"During a dispute, despite one's opinion,

167
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,940
when someone makes abusive remarks about another person's personality or character, what is this word called?"

168
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,900
It's a four-syllable word.

169
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,420
It's ends with "attack"

170
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,460
Attack?

171
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,430
Ah. Pregnancy attack!

172
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,600
- What? Pregnancy attack?
 - Yes.

173
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,460
There's no attack as cowardly and cheap as attacking a pregnant woman.

174
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,970
That's why it's called "pregnancy attack."

175
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,810
Why am I trying to teach you?

176
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,290
I'd rather participate in the Olympics and win a gold medal.

177
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,980
- That might be faster.
 - Shut up.

178
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,230
Hello.

179
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,450
Hello. Hello, everyone.

180
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,810
Director, hello.

181
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,760
- Joon Ki, what were you thinking?
 - What?

182
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,230
- Because of you, our website is bombarded with complaints.
 -  Complaints?

183
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,820
Apparently, when you crossed the road yesterday, you didn't raise your hand

184
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,500
or look left and right.

185
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,760
A kid who watches our program saw you.

186
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,000
- He even posted a complaint saying he won't watch our show!
 - Seriously?

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,610
Don't you know kids all over the country watch our show?

188
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,430
You should watch your behavior no matter what you do from now on. This is so frustrating.

189
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,470
I'm sorry, Director.

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,270
Who was the kid who saw me?

191
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,490
What do you think? Isn't the interior design so refined?

192
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,480
Yes. It is, but how long do we have to do this?

193
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,420
It's time for the next question.

194
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,320
Noona, how long are you going to do this? Don't you see me working?

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,410
It's because we don't have time. Also, I never told you not to work.

196
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,950
Just keep studying whenever you have time while working.

197
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,170
Here's a question. "What are the three elements of a nation?"

198
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,280
The three elements of a nation?

199
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,390
Land, water and wind?

200
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,430
Land, water and wind, my foot.

201
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,070
Is this "Captain Planet?"

202
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,940
I know, right? These are the three elements.

203
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,550
Rocks, wind, and women.

204
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,960
Oh, I see.

205
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,310
What are you saying?

206
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,380
Those are what Jeju Island is known for.

207
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,590
- It's called "Samdado" because it has plenty of the three.
 - "Samdado".

208
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,890
That's why the sashimi place near my house is called "Jeju Samdado."

209
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,620
- Is that restaurant good? 
- Their food is amazing.

210
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,410
Really? Then please send me their address.

211
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,590
If you throw in an option...

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,960
How was it? Did you like the steak?

213
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,160
Yes. It was good.

214
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,500
But, why is it that I rarely get to see you these days?

215
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,470
It's just that I've been very busy with filming. I couldn't really make time.

216
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,500
No, it's okay. It's because of work, so I understand.

218
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,220
You have a heart of gold.

219
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,540
That's the Nice Man! Whoa.

220
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,000
Mom, that's the Nice Man.

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,500
Hi. Here we go, Nice Man!

222
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,200
Oh, why didn't you finish your food? You said that nice kids

223
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,400
should eat everything on their plate.

224
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,370
Oh, this? This is parsley. It's just for decoration. It's not meant to be eaten.

225
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,610
But still, you told us to eat everything on our plate.

226
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,470
- The Nice Man shouldn't do this. 
- What?

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,440
Okay, I got it. I'll eat it. I'll eat this, okay?

228
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,330
It's good. It's delicious.

229
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,930
Why aren't you eating yours?

230
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,520
I have to eat it too?

231
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,780
Soo Mi, I'm sorry. But, could you please eat it?

232
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,440
Do it for me, please?

233
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,420
Here we go, Nice Man!

234
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,700
That must've been uncomfortable for you.

235
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,610
Unexpected things can happen because kids recognize me wherever I go.

236
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,210
It's fine. Thanks for walking me home.

237
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,060
- I'll head in, then. 
- Okay.

238
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,780
Wait, Soo Mi. Are you just heading in like this?

239
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,500
Gosh, Joon Ki.

240
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,520
Alright.

241
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,440
Mom, I'm running behind schedule because of you. The Nice man said all kids must go to bed at 9 pm.

242
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,270
What are you doing? You totally scared me!

243
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,430
The quiz is tomorrow. How could you be sleeping? Did you solve all the questions?

244
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,000
I sure did.

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,390
Really?

246
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,350
The, shall I take a look?

247
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,080
"The government organization that sees all public relations,

248
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,050
and external communications needs regarding governmental affairs, through cultural events, campaigns, and publications

249
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,320
is called YouTube"?

250
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,900
Yes, YouTube.

251
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,020
Goodness. What Archimedes shouted as he was jumping out of his bathtub was "It's hot"? Really?

252
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,200
Was it "It's cold"?

253
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,400
How could you be this ignorant?

254
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,500
I told you that I don't want to go to that show. I haven't even been able to eat since I got off work because of this.

255
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,350
Noona, I'm hungry. Can I have some food first?

256
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,380
You don't have time to eat food right now. If you're hungry,

257
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,290
you can eat this. The new rice cake shop was giving it out earlier.

258
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,890
"Euljimun Rice Cakes"? What an unusual name for a rice cake shop.

259
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,720
Euljimun Rice Cake is good.

260
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,360
Gi Bong, how are you feeling today? You can do well, right?

261
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,900
I don't know. What if I end up embarrassing myself?

262
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,060
Stop being negative. Gi Bong, you can do it.

263
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,610
You've got this, okay? Just go for it.

264
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Gi Bong!

265
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,590
What?

266
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,760
Gi Bong, what do you think of this place? This place is the most similar to my dream restaurant.

267
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,900
- Oh, really?
 - Yes.

268
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,850
It's small, but I love how cute and cozy it is.

269
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,300
If I can actually open Yuri's Kitchen, I'll make sure the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant.

270
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,050
That way, customers can watch the entire cooking process. And each table,

271
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,500
will have a fresh flower bought that day.

272
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Ah. And there will be a small blackboard in front of the restaurant.

273
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,240
On the blackboard, I'll write down "Chef Cha Yoo Ri's Recommendations of the Day."

274
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,180
Just thinking about it makes you happy?

275
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,280
Of course. It's been my lifelong dream.

276
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,540
Okay, I got it. I'll do my very best for you today,

277
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
so just trust me. Me.

278
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,050
Really?

279
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,850
You make me proud.

280
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,130
- Noona, we'll be late. Let's go. Hurry
 - It's so nice. What?

281
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,140
We may run late.

282
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,600
My gosh, look at you!

283
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,870
Hey, Lee Joon Ki.

284
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,730
- Did you kiss some girl on the street last night at 9:30 pm? 
 - What?

285
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,540
How did you know—

286
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,420
Hey, someone posted on the message board again! The Nice Man told people to sleep by 9 pm,

287
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,420
but he was kissing someone past 9 pm. They were disappointed!

288
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,000
Really?

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,030
Yes! The kid is crying now about how they're not going to watch the Nice Man again!

290
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,230
How the heck did they see that?

291
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,160
Wait, Director, I'm an adult.

292
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,400
Aren't I allowed to roam around after 9 pm and date?

293
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,480
What? The first Nice Man put cuffs on his hands and feet after 9 pm.

294
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,460
Why?

295
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,400
He thought that he'd sleepwalk and go outside after 9 pm! You need to have a professional mindset like that!

296
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,290
Cuffs?

297
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,090
Well, but...

298
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,360
Be quiet! You don't want to be a top star?

299
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,700
No, I do.

300
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,520
- Star! 
 - Then, do it right! If something like this happens one more time, we'll replace you.

301
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,020
What? R-R-Replace?

302
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,660
Gosh, what does he want me to do?

303
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,270
Why's Joon Ki so late? It's almost time for the movie.

304
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,160
- Soo Mi! 
 - Gosh!

305
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,600
- Who are you? - It's me, Joon Ki.

306
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,530
I'm sorry. I'm late, right? But, a lot of kids are here, so I had to avoid them.

307
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,400
What's with your shades and the mask?

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,380
The kids keep recognizing me and posting weird stuff on the message board.

309
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,690
Alright. Let's just go. We'll be late for the movie.

310
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,810
It's the Nice Man!

311
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,200
No! I'm not Nice Man.

312
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,730
You are, though. Your voice is just like his!

313
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,100
You tell us not to lie.

314
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,220
- I'm going to tell all of my friends. 
 - No, no!

315
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,500
It was just a joke. I was kidding.

316
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,620
Nice Man does not lie!

317
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,530
But, I'm a bit busy right now, so I'll be going.

318
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,600
Wait, Nice Man!

319
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,700
- Can't you find this dog's owner?  
 - Huh?

320
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,480
Well, Nice Man is a bit busy right now, so next time—

321
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,900
Wow. You told us to always help

322
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,630
when we see animals we should feel bad for. What's with you, Nice Man?

323
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,150
Alright, alright. I'll just help.

324
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,500
Soo Mi, can we just find the dog's owner?

325
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,400
What about the movie?

326
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,000
We'll watch the movie next time.

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,860
Forget it!

328
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,140
I'll be going.

329
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,330
Wait, Soo Mi!

330
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,910
This is driving me nuts.

331
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,730
You don't eat chicken, Jeong Eun?

332
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,190
I just have no appetite.

333
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,430
You've been looking unhappy lately. What happened?

334
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,830
It's nothing.

335
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,330
It's on! Gi Bong!

336
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,160
  Held live right here, Challenge: Quiz King  has come back.

337
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,900
  We'll start with the introductions of the contestants before the preliminaries.

338
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,500
Contestant #1, a professor at KAIST, Wang Young Jae.

339
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,800
- Hello. 
 - Contestant #2, with a doctorate from Harvard,

340
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,420
currently working at NASA on a joint Korean-American project,

341
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,930
he's the head researcher, Lee Soo Seok.

342
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,970
  Hello.

343
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,800
Alright, this is Contestant #3. He was a former baseball player.

344
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,370
He's currently a car dealer. Gook Gi Bong.

345
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,700
- Hello! 
 - Harvard and KAIST? Gi Bong has to beat those people?

346
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,080
Gosh, that's simply impossible. It's like an amateur soccer player going up against Ronaldo and Messi.

347
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,300
I feel so bad for Gi Bong.

348
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,010
Alright, we'll start the Challenge: Quiz King, live now.

349
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,000
Incorrect answers will lead to a deduction of points, so think carefully before you hit the button.

350
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,360
Here's the first question. A king's face is called "yongan." A king's tears are called "yongru."

351
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,100
Then, what is a king's feces called?

352
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,530
- I have the answer. 
 - Wang Young Jae?

353
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,100
Defecation?

354
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,990
- Defecation? 
 - That's the answer.

355
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,590
That is incorrect. Ten points have been deducted.

356
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,170
Answer.

357
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,200
Yes, Lee Soo Seok?

358
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,110
Huge poop?

359
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,600
Huge poop? That's incorrect.

360
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,810
Lee Soo Seok, you have lost 10 points, as well.

361
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,560
Alright, the chance goes to Gook Gi Bong now. Gook Gi Bong?

362
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,230
I will pass.

363
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,700
 He passed the question. The correct answer is "maehwa".

364
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,970
  The, we'll move onto the next question.

365
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,860
  Challenge! Quiz King

366
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,900
Answer! A black hole?

367
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,500
Answer!

368
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,920
Happy Home!

369
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,680
Gook Gi Bong?

370
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,500
Pass. Pass. Pass.

371
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,230
Pass! Pass. Pass. Pass.

372
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,430
- Hey! 
 - Pass.

373
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,900
Oh, he has passed again.

374
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,130
  - I will pass.
 - He's passed again. Let's move on.

375
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,690
In the satirical novel "Baebijangjeon", what did the protagonist Bae Bi Jang,

376
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,800
give to the gisaeng, Ae Rang, as a symbol of his love?

377
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,730
Answer!

378
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,550
Lee Soo Seok?

379
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,320
Diamond?

380
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,750
- Incorrect. 
 - Answer!

381
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,400
Tip?

382
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
Tip? Tip?

383
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,140
Incorrect. Twenty points have been deducted.

384
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,690
Alright, the final question of the preliminaries goes to Gook Gi Bong.

385
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,420
Gook Gi Bong?

386
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,330
I will pass.

387
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,860
Oh, he passed until the end!

388
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,170
Alright, so, Gook Gi Bong, who skipped all questions, with a score of 0,

389
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,190
is the winner of Challenge! Quiz King!

390
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,030
Wow! Let's go! Yes!

391
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,360
What happened? So, Gi Bong is going to the finals?

392
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
No way.

393
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:05,460
Gosh. What happened with Soo Min? She won't even answer my calls and she's not at home.

394
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,050
Soo Mi.

395
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,200
Joon Ki.

396
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,930
Who's this man?

397
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,130
I can't date you anymore. It's too hard.

398
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,680
But how can you be like this? You didn't even say anything to me.

399
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,510
You should stop. What are you doing? It's so filthy.

400
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,550
What? Filthy?

401
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,510
Hey, are you done?!

402
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,970
Does this make sense? Who are you?!

403
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,770
Let's go.

404
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,910
It's Nice Man! Nice Man!

405
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,750
What are you doing right now? Are you fighting?

406
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,910
You told us that friends need to treat each other well!

407
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh, well...

408
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,100
  This is driving me nuts.

409
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,770
  I could get fired if I fight in front of kids.

410
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,990
  It's just too unfair to me if I just leave like this, though.

411
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,820
  Gosh, what do I do? Yeah.

412
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,970
Soo Mi! No, no.

413
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,430
No, no!

414
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,980
A nice adult should not go on a blind date,

415
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,940
while she has a boyfriend.

416
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,820
And, you, you nameless man!

417
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,970
You can't do that, either.

418
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,470
No, no!

419
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,490
A nice adult should not steal a girl who has a boyfriend.

420
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,310
That's a very filthy and cowardly thing to do.

421
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:52,800
Anyway, I'll be going off. Live well together until you,

422
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,240
start pooping your pants in old age. I'll be going.

423
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,940
Nice Man, how can you just go?

424
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,790
You have to do that thing!

425
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,240
What? That thing?

426
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,850
Nice, Nice, Nice Man!

427
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,150
Nice, Nice, Nice Man! Bye!

428
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,370
Alright, Gook Gi Bong. By winning the first round, you have won ₩5 million (~$5,000)

429
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,960
If you decide to go on to the final round and get all the three questions right,

430
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,500
you'll win ₩40 million (~$40K).

431
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,480
But, if you get a single question wrong,

432
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,430
your prize money will disappear.

433
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,140
 Gook Ki Bong, would you like to stop?

434
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,450
- Quit, Gi Bong. Quit.
  Or would you like to go on to the final round?

435
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,870
It's beyond your ability.

436
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,500
Right, don't do it Gi Bong.

437
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,260
Give up.

438
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,080
Will you take the challenge?

439
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,960
Gi Bong, it's a miracle that you've made it this far. You have to quit now.

440
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,330
Don't do it.

441
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,850
I’d like to...

442
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,420
Don't do it.

443
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,760
I will do it!

444
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,330
- Ah, he wants to continue! 
- He's crazy.

445
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,600
Why, why, why?

446
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,210
 Noona, trust me.

447
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:37,360
 I'll be the Quiz King today and buy you a restaurant.

448
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,730
I can't believe that idiot. What on earth is he thinking?

449
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,600
Alright. Here's the first question.

450
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,060
Jeju Island is known to have no thieves, beggars or gates,

451
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,920
hence, the nickname "Sammudo."

452
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,260
At the same time, Jeju Island has plenty of three things,

453
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,770
which gives it its nickname "Samdado."

454
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,690
What are those three things?

455
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,920
 I don't know, I have no idea.

456
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,280
 What is "Sammudo" and "Samdado"?

457
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,360
 Wait. "Samdado"?

458
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,290
 Rocks, wind and women are what Jeju Island is known for.

459
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,590
 It's called "Samdado" because it has plenty of these three.

460
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,530
I have an answer.

461
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,980
Rocks, wind, and women.

462
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,750
- That is correct!
 - Yes! Yay!

463
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,940
 Gook Gi Bong gave his first answer and it was correct!

464
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,730
How did he know that?

465
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,880
- I know, right?
 - I guess he got lucky.

466
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,990
- How could they ask that same question? 
- Alright, here's the second question.

467
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,060
This is the world's longest woodwind instrument.

468
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,380
Originally used by the shepherds in the Alps.

469
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,580
It's a traditional instrument in Switzerland.

470
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,670
What's the name of the instrument in the picture?

471
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,440
 I've seen that a lot somewhere.

472
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,070
 That's what Jeong Eun was playing!

473
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,890
 What was the name? 
 I have the answer!

474
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,470
- Alp-horn!
 - "Alp-horn"? It's correct!

475
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,890
- I don't believe this.
 - Nice!
 - This question was pretty hard.

476
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,100
Wow, amazing. They asked him about the alp-horn.

477
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,830
If he gets just one more question right, does he become the Quiz King?

478
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,160
 If you solve the last question,

479
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,510
 you'll win ₩40 million.

480
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,040
Here is the last question.

481
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,040
When the Sui general, Yu Zhongwen invade Goguryeo with his 300,000 troops,

482
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,360
he was ridiculed by a poem written by,

483
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,050
Goguryeo's greatest war hero. Who is this?

484
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,480
 I don't know, I have no idea.

485
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,340
 This is the first time I'm hearing these words in my entire life.

486
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,380
 Gook Gi Bong is having a bit of trouble remember the name.

487
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,630
There's a hint on the screen.

488
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:02,220
 Who's the person in the portrait on the screen?

489
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,940
 Hold on, I've seen that portrait somewhere.

490
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,000
 What an unusual name for a rice cake shop.

491
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,720
Oh, that, I have the answer.

492
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,760
Euljimun Rice Cake!

493
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,030
"Rice Cakes"? Can you say it more clearly?

494
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,340
 I'm sure it was "Euljimun Rice Cake".

495
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,770
 Is it not, then what is it?

496
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:35,650
Gi Bong, Gi Bong, it's not 'tteok". It's "deok".

497
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,200
"Deok". Like a duck.

498
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,710
A duck. Okay? Quack, quack.

499
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,900
Answer!

500
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,430
Euljimun Quack.

501
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,570
"Quack"? "Euljimun Quack"?

502
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,000
Alright, you have three seconds now. One...

503
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,360
Answer! Euljimun Duck.

504
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,960
No, Euljimun Mallard!

505
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,740
- What about my ₩40 million?
 - Euljimun...

506
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,500
 Euljimun Donald Duck!

507
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,220
You idiot! Why did you even try?

508
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,460
Aigoo.

509
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,630
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

510
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,910
Shut up! What? "Euljimun Quack"?

511
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,870
"Euljimun Mallard"? "Euljimun Donald Duck"?

512
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,510
You were saying "quack, quack." So I thought...

513
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,980
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

514
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,870
I promise I'll help you open your restaurant later, okay?

515
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,370
I'm a man who always keeps his words.

516
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,660
"A man's word is worth his height in installments," don't you know?

517
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,800
What did you say? "A man's word is worth his height in installments"?

518
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,140
Yes. It means a man's words are as important as paying installments.

519
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,200
When you sign a contract, do you know how important installments are? If you don't pay that, your contract will be terminated.

520
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,280
You lunatic.

521
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,190
Why? What's wrong?

522
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,910
Hey, I can't stand this any longer.

523
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,070
- Don't come near me. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Don't come.
 - Come here.

524
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,840
Noona, I'm sorry. Don't come near me!

525
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,100
Why does the producer want to see us suddenly?

526
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,910
What if he asks us to buy tickets for his sister's recital again?

527
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,820
I have a bad feeling.

528
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,090
Good morning!

529
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,360
Good morning!

530
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,730
Sir, why did you ask us to gather here?

531
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,930
My book has been finally published.

532
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,460
I wanted to give them to you as gifts. Here you go.

533
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,400
Wow!

534
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,490
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

535
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,990
This isn't just for free, right?

536
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,060
I'll buy these. Give me 10, please.

537
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,200
I'll take 20.

538
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,560
I didn't call you guys for this. You guys are so generous. Soo Yeon, how many do you want?

539
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,590
What? I don't need any. I'm not interested in famous restaurants.

540
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,030
I see you're not interested in that sort of thing. Too bad then.

541
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,040
Soo Yeon, let me see your comments for this report.

542
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,180
Oh, okay.

543
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,690
Here it is.

544
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,500
What's wrong? You don't like my comments?

545
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,260
This isn't interesting or touching at all. It's a total mess.

546
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,160
What's wrong with the spelling?

547
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,500
Look. It's "family picnic", not "family picnik."

548
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,900
It's "fun activities", not "fun activitys."

549
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,130
I'm sorry. I've made a mistake.

550
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,530
This isn't a mistake. Even elementary students know this. How could you be worse than my 10-year-old niece in spelling?

551
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,880
 How could this guy speak so obnoxiously?

552
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,580
I thought your pronunciation was bad. You should learn how to spell from the beginning.

553
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,910
 I just want to sew that mouth shut...

554
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,460
What are you doing?

555
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,700
It's nothing.

556
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,270
I want to check something.

557
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,820
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

558
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,380
♫  Oh what in the world is happening to me  ♫

559
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,450
♫  There's never a quiet day  ♫

560
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,220
Thank you for the meal! 
 ♫   I'm now even   ♫

561
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,520
♫   scared of tomorrow  ♫

562
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,930
It's really tasty!

563
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,900
I know. It melts in my mouth.

564
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,740
You haven't lost your touch, Noona.

565
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,710
Really? Then do you think Yuri's Kitchen 31 will be a success?

566
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,030
What's Yuri's Kitchen 31?

567
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,880
I've decided a concept as 31 types of spaghetti that's fun to choose from.

568
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,390
I've decided the name of this dish as "Mom is a Spaghetti Alien." How's it? Isn't it unique?

569
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,650
Hang on. Yuri's Kitchen 31?

570
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,510
"Mom is a Spaghetti Alien"?

571
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,520
It seems like something I've heard before.

572
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,680
Don't tell me the names of other spaghetti dishes are "Very Berry Spaghetti" or "Almond Vongole," are they?

573
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,950
That... That's a trade secret.

574
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:06,930
Anyway, what's the point of making new menus? I don't even have a restaurant.

575
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,720
Only if he had answered that question correctly, there would have been no problems.

576
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,960
Whoa, this is really tasty! But, why aren't you eating?

577
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,690
Just because I don't have an appetite.

578
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,210
Just leave her be. There isn't enough for me anyway.

579
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,840
Do you even have an appetite after being dumped so pathetically?

580
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,550
Hey! I told you not to talk about Soo Mi.

581
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:30,030
Also, I wasn't dumped. I dumped her. How many times do I have to tell you?

582
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,700
Huh? You broke up with your girlfriend?

583
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,860
- Yeah. 
- I see.

584
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,780
What? You said you had no appetite just now.

585
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,110
Excuse me, where is the ATM near here?

586
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,820
Oh, an ATM? If you go out and take a right, you'll find it nearby.

587
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,790
Really? Thank you.

588
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,490
Doesn't that customer have a weird feeling about him?

589
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm not sure.

590
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,620
Really?

591
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,620
Whatever. Isn't there somewhere I can get the money?

592
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:16,410
Dear Father in Heaven, if you have money to spare, can you drop some down at me, please?

593
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,420
 The Culprit is You

594
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,170
How did Joon Ki know about "Very Berry Spaghetti" and "Almond Vongole"?

595
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,530
He totally read my mind.

596
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,100
Huh? What's that?

597
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,790
For Lease?

598
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,410
What? This shop must be leasing. 
  For Lease

599
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,180
The deposit is ₩ 40,000,000 (~$40K) and the rent is ₩3,000,000 (~$3K).

600
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,590
Whoa, it's expensive.

601
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,090
Doesn't matter if it's for lease because I don't have the money.

602
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,990
Huh? What's that?

603
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,680
₩40,000,000 (~$40K)? The reward money is ₩40,000,000?

604
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,600
If I catch this man, then I can lease this shop.

605
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,240
 Criminal Wanted for fraud, Kim Chul Jung.

606
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,930
But, why does it feel like I've seen this person somewhere?

607
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,380
 Where is the ATM near here?

608
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,990
Doesn't it seem like the customer earlier?

609
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,300
It's the same, right?

610
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,410
I'm sure. It looks similar, but it also doesn't look similar.

611
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,950
But he has a mustache and wears glasses.

612
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,610
Hey, he can just shave his mustache and not wear glasses.

613
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,940
Right, when I think about it, it does look similar.

614
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm sure it's this person.

615
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,220
Gosh, I'm so lucky.

616
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,800
If I get ₩ 40,000,000 (~$40K), I can open Yuri's Kitchen.

617
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,020
What? You're going to open your restaurant by turning him in?

618
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,420
Of course! I should call the police right away.

619
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,870
Are you crazy? How could you report him when you're not even sure?

620
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,080
What if we're wrong? We'll get sued.

621
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,990
- Really? 
- Of course!

622
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,340
Okay, then I have no choice but to confirm it.

623
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,500
How? You can't make him wear glasses or attach a mustache on his face.

624
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,120
I have my methods.

625
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,630
Trust me, okay?

626
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,430
You all did a good job shooting on the weekend.

627
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,170
You did well too, Director.

628
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,870
Shouldn't we throw a welcome party for Soo Yeon?

629
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,500
A welcome party? She's not even an official reporter. What welcome party?

630
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,780
- Even though, we still should. 
- Suit yourselves.

631
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,690
Soo Yeon, what do you like?

632
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,280
I like meat.

633
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,870
This is meat?

634
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,070
Why? Is Chicken Feet not meat?

635
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:01,200
I thought Soo Yeon was only bad at Korean. But she even lacks common sense.

636
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,430
Let's do one shot. Cheers!

637
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,800
Cheers!

638
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,160
Excuse me.

639
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,860
Yes, Sunbae-nim.

640
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,910
Yeah, I got it.

641
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,730
Director, the main writer needs us, so I think we need to go.

642
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,010
There's nothing we can do then.

643
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,720
I'm sorry, So Yeon. Let's do this again another time.

644
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,270
Yeah.

645
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,510
Bye.

646
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,640
Should we also leave then?

647
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,140
Why? You don't want to drink with just me?

648
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,620
No, it's not that.

649
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,770
Are you not good at drinking?

650
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,890
Soo Yeon, you're bad at Korean,

651
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,550
lack common sense, and can't drink well?

652
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,080
- Is there anything you're good at? 
- Okay.

653
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,970
Let's drink. It's okay if I drink.

654
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,650
- Good? 
- You have to drink after the 'cheers.'

655
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,170
You don't even know drinking etiquette, Soo Yeon.

656
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,380
Ta-da!

657
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,510
What are you doing right now?

658
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,770
Congratulations!

659
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,630
You're the winner of the one-year event of our guest house!

660
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,540
Event?

661
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,120
The prize for the one-year anniversary event is just three bottles of beer?

662
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,650
Huh? We can give a few more bottles if you want.

663
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,030
But, it's boring drinking just like this,

664
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,690
so should we play a game?

665
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,410
- How about a word relay?
 - Word relay?

666
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,790
Yes. And to make it more interesting, let's draw on the loser's face.

667
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,390
You know, like drawing a mustache or glasses.

668
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,530
- It sounds fun, right? 
- I'm not sure.

669
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,730
Let's start! Singer.

670
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,400
Su... Su...

671
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,420
You know you have to reply within three seconds, right? 3, 2—

672
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,310
- Spoonful.  
- Tak? Tak...

673
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,330
This was just the practice game.

674
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,950
So, should we start the real game now?

675
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,840
Since you won last time, you should start first.

676
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,920
Yeah, okay.

677
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,630
- Telephone. 
 - Hwa?

678
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,980
- Earth! 
 - Am...

679
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,280
- Hen! 
 - Tak?

680
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,430
This was a warm-up game.

681
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,500
Since we're all warmed up,

682
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,210
let's really begin the real game now.

683
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,270
Okay. Peach!

684
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,010
Ah?

685
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,160
- Young lady. 
 - Ssi?

686
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,460
Ssi... Ssi...

687
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,240
You have three seconds.

688
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,200
- Three, two—
 - Creep.

689
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,790
- Tak? 
 - Aigoo...

690
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,730
I knew you were too overconfident. You got what you deserved.

691
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,950
Is that person a word relay master or something?

692
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,820
He's incredibly smart. I'm sure he's the con man.

693
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,200
Are all the people good at this game criminals?

694
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,320
It's not confirmed so just give up!

695
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,470
No, I can't give up.

696
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,500
To open Yuri's Kitchen 31, I need that cash reward.

697
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,640
I'll prove it no matter what. At all cost.

698
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,770
Aigoo, no one's going to stop you.

699
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,270
Just clean your face already.

700
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,870
I want to do that too, but this is a permanent marker so it won't come off.

701
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,980
Why did you use a permanent marker?

702
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,800
There was nothing at home beside a permanent marker.

703
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,520
This jerk, I'll teach him a lesson.

704
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,550
What are you going to do? Noona! Noona!

705
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,290
Gosh, why can't I eat this?

706
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,580
Soo Yeon, you seem really drunk.

707
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,540
Me?

708
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,170
I'm not drunk, I'm all right.

709
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,530
It's not all right, it's alright. Alright!

710
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,000
How can you be so bad at Korean?

711
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,780
  He started again.

712
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:55,450
But you still want to be a reporter somehow.

713
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,040
  Stop it.

714
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,820
Han Soo Yeon, your pronunciation isn't good,

715
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,100
you can't even spell, and you don't have good drinking manners.

716
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,570
- Is there anything you're good— 
-  Stop it already, you jerk.

717
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,180
Did you just hit me, Soo Yeon?

718
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,620
- Yeah,  I did. What are you going to about it? 
- And with the chicken foot?

719
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,500
Hey. You're being like this because I didn't buy your book, right?

720
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,110
I know that's why you're doing this, you loser. And stop acting like you know everything.

721
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,520
Your mouth is the problem. Your mouth. Your mouth.

722
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,160
You just a lame loser. You little...

723
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,300
Don't you get cheeky with me.

724
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,060
Gosh, I feel so much better now.

725
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,590
What is it this time?

726
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,440
Congratulations!

727
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,350
You've been chosen to participate in our special event celebrating the Year of the Golden Pig.

728
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,550
What? An event celebrating the Year of the Golden Pig?

729
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,220
Yeah, that's right.

730
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,730
The prize is a voucher for a free night stay at our guesthouse.

731
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,750
We'll play a game. You'll get it if you win.

732
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,980
If you lose, I'll draw on your face.

733
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,660
Cham, cham, cham!

734
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,470
Cham, cham...

735
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,980
Cham!

736
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,540
Alright, this time the prize is a voucher for a free week at our guesthouse.

737
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,010
Let's begin the game celebrating the one-year anniversary of our renovation!

738
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,240
Di bi di bi dip!

739
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,120
Okay. Di bi di bi...

740
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,050
- Dip!
 - Ugh!

741
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,700
I'm going crazy.

742
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,200
 Dimwit  
There's no space left on your face to draw.

743
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,590
How could you not even win once?

744
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,650
He's like a master of all games.

745
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,450
He's good at every game. From rock paper scissors to alkkagi (Korean board game).

746
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,670
We played all sorts of games, but he won every single time!

747
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,990
No one told you to waste your time like this.

748
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,780
- You're not even sure.
 - Shut up!

749
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,700
By the way, how can I beat him?

750
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,950
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

751
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,840
Just leave it. Don't do anything. I'll give it a shot.

752
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,430
Hey. Even I couldn't beat him. How can an idiot like you win against him?

753
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,290
I'll suggest a game that uses physical strength. Like arm or foot wrestling, for example.

754
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:38,410
I'm a strong guy, you know. So just trust me. Trust me.

755
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,490
Alright, then. Shall I have at it then?

756
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,930
He's strong. He's incredibly strong.
   Idiot

757
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,170
Really? How could a person be like that?

758
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,290
Gosh, you guys are such amateurs.

759
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,490
- You can't win because you're going by the book. 
- What are you talking about?

760
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:06,400
If we can't beat him 1-on-1, two of us can go up against him together.

761
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,110
He won't be able to beat us if two of us go against him together.

762
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,810
Jeong Eun, let's go.

763
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,250
Me?

764
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,630
You just have to follow my instructions.

765
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,650
Alright, then. Shall we go then?

766
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,240
What the...

767
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,390
Even two people can't beat him. He's really the master of all games.

768
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,740
He's a pro gamer. He's a genius. 
 Sewer /Dumpling / Idiot

769
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,370
You said you could beat him! Gosh. 
  Moron

770
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,410
- Hello!
 - Hello, I got a call that my friend is here, very drunk.

771
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,020
Oh, she's over there.

772
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,180
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon, get up.

773
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,770
- Why did you drink so much?
- What?

774
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,920
They wanted to throw a welcome party for me. That's why we drank a little with the director.

775
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,110
I see.

776
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,470
But, why is there so much sauce around his mouth?

777
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,250
Oh, you're right. I wonder if something happened...

778
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,340
What? You slapped his mouth? With chicken feet?

779
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,620
Yes. I couldn't help it because he was being so annoying

780
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,390
What should I do, Woo Sik?

781
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,840
He holds grudges and retaliates. What if I get fired?

782
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,340
What to do now?

783
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,740
Gosh. I fell asleep.

784
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,830
Who are you?

785
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:48,620
He's my friend. He came to pick me up.

786
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,820
I see.

787
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,730
Gosh, it stings! My lips, why do they hurt so much?

788
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,320
What is all this? Why do I have this sauce all over my lips?

789
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,510
Soo Yeon, did something happen? I don't remember anything.

790
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,060
You really don't remember anything?

791
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,740
No, I black out often when I drink.

792
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,280
What on earth happened?

793
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,150
Hold on.

794
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,940
I think someone slapped my mouth with chicken feet.

795
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,590
I vaguely remember something, but I can't recall...

796
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,010
What do I do? I think he remembers what happened.

797
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,340
 He said he blacks out easily.

798
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,810
Director, how about another drink with me?

799
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,640
I finally wiped it all off.

800
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,210
By the way, how are we going to find out who he really is?

801
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,690
Unni, Unni, Unni!

802
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,350
What is it? What's with all the fuss?

803
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,680
The man just checked out.

804
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,190
He left saying something urgent came up.

805
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,060
What? Did he figure out that we're suspicious of him?

806
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,240
Darn it! My ₩40 million (~$40K).

807
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,610
- Wait up!
 - Where are you going?

808
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,990
Taxi! Taxi!

809
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,780
Taxi! Yes, here! taxi!

810
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,280
Gosh, why is it so hard to hail a taxi?

811
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,110
Wait!

812
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,540
- What's going on?
 - Where are you going right now?

813
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,970
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

814
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,060
Let's have a quick chat before you go anywhere.

815
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,100
I'm in a rush now. Taxi!

816
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,520
Where do you think you're going?

817
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,690
Guys, get him.

818
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,950
Let go, what are you doing right now? I have to go!

819
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,150
- No, don't open it! Don't open it!
- Stay still.

820
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,920
- What is this?
- A mask! A knife!

821
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,400
- Don't touch my stuff!
- What? Ropes?
- I knew it.

822
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,090
- Let go!
- A wig!

823
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,480
Something's really suspicious. Guys, don't let him go.

824
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,690
What on earth is this?

825
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:00,200
- No, no.
- Don't move.

826
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,910
What? He's not that man?

827
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,560
That can't be.

828
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,340
Look, he looks just like this man.

829
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,020
I told you that we caught that man a few days ago.

830
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,950
That's impossible.

831
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,590
Open his bag.

832
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,280
You'll find a knife, a wig, a mask,

833
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,080
- and many more suspicious things. 
- Suspicious things? Like what?

834
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,420
You mean this?

835
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:39,530
- This is for a magic trick.
- Magic tricks?

836
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,900
I work as a recreation instructor.

837
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,380
I sometimes do some magic tricks.

838
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,880
What? You're a recreation instructor?

839
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,020
So that's why he's so good at games. He did seem like an expert.

840
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,280
I know. There was no way we could win.

841
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,440
Whatever!

842
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,430
You did this to my face and I missed a gig. What are you going to do?

843
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,940
I'm sorry.

844
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,650
We'll make sure to compensate you, sir.

845
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,680
I'm really sorry.

846
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,840
This is so embarrassing.

847
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,670
It's all your fault!

848
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,520
I know. We lost our money and made a fool of ourselves.

849
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,600
I'm sorry. I didn't do that on purpose.

850
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,790
Sir, why are you taking that off?

851
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,350
What? This place got leased today.

852
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,150
It's a nice spot, so it's quite popular.

853
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,170
Don't be too disappointed. We'll find another place.

854
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,620
There's no point. I don't have any money anyway.

855
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,510
Let's just go.

856
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,250
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

857
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,220
But, who are you?

858
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,300
What? I'm Soo Yeon's friend.

859
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,530
- You don't remember?
 - No, I don't.

860
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,660
Good. You forgot everything.

861
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,160
Whoever you are,

862
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,290
- let's drink!
 - Okay.

863
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,180
What is this? Are you sleeping, Soo Yeon?

864
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,210
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon!

865
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,250
You scared me.

866
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,170
Why did you have to yell? You scared the heck out of me.

867
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,730
My goodness. I scared the "heck" out of you?

868
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,680
How can someone who wants to be a reporter,

869
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,020
use such language? Do you really think that's okay?

870
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,970
 Gosh, there he goes again.

871
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:44,780
Do you really think it's that easy to become a reporter?

872
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,580
 Hey, knock it off.

873
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,230
Do you think this job is some kind of joke?

874
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,550
Hey, stop it already!

875
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:59,100
Did you just slap me with that grilled fish?

876
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,620
Yes. I did.

877
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,230
You were getting on my nerves. What are you going to do?

878
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,320
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

879
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,800
This jerk was asking for it.

880
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,590
Shut your mouth, you jerk. I hate you!

881
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,520
I can't let her get away with this one.

882
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,560
I'll fire her!

883
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,120
Director, another glass with me?

884
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,820
Noona, where are you going?

885
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm going to look for a job.

886
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,310
A job? What about Yuri's Kitchen 31?

887
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,830
I have to make a living for now.

888
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,180
I feel bad living off you guys.

889
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,280
Are you going back to the hotel you used to work at?

890
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,950
No. I don't think they'll accept me back anyway.

891
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:52,180
I'm thinking of asking my ex-colleagues first.

892
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,770
- I'll see you guys later. 
- See you.

893
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,660
See you.

894
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,540
Hello, Coach?

895
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,000
What?

896
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,630
Oh, okay. I understand.

897
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,870
Thank you. Bye.

898
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,830
Why did the coach call? He wants you back on the team?

899
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,500
No.

900
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,340
There's something else.

901
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:29,820
I'm sorry. I'd love to hire you, but there's no vacancy in our kitchen right now.

902
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,330
I understand.

903
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,030
Can you at least give me Young Jin Sunbae's (senior)phone number?

904
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,320
You want to ask him too?

905
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,890
Yoo Ri, there's no point in asking others.

906
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:46,850
What? What do you mean?

907
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,690
My head.

908
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,710
Woo Sik.

909
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,030
What happened to the director?

910
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,870
Don't worry. I made him completely pass out.

911
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,310
Gosh, why is it so noisy?

912
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:18,250
Oh, Soo Yeon. Who's this guy, by the way?

913
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,560
What? He's my friend.

914
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,370
You've been drinking together all night. You don't remember?

915
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,230
I don't remember a thing.

916
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:30,800
See, I told you he doesn't remember anything.

917
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,990
I should really quit drinking.

918
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:37,910
Gosh, why are my lips burning?

919
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,420
What's up with my face? What are these bruises?

920
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,900
What happened?

921
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,960
What's the big deal if you get a 'kisu' on your lips?

922
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,040
Stop fussing.

923
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,750
Did you just say 'kisu'?

924
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,370
It's Japanese, don't you know?

925
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,980
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

926
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,920
How could you make such a mistake?

927
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,600
I didn't know you were such a careless person.

928
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,290
 He's getting out of line.

929
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:08,120
What did you learn during Korean classes?

930
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,560
 You better stop.

931
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:14,670
Young people these days say things without thinking. It's a problem.

932
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:19,140
Stop it, you jerk!

933
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,880
- Did you just hit me?
 - I did. What are you going to do?

934
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,300
With the pumpkin-flavored gummy stick, you've been sucking on?

935
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:31,020
You know what? You say such obnoxious things.

936
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,010
You humiliate people with your words.

937
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,700
That's why Soo Yeon slapped you with those chicken feet.

938
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,460
What did you just say? Soo Yeon hit me?

939
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,660
With chicken feet?

940
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,320
Woo Sik, are you crazy?

941
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,790
Oh, right. It was supposed to be a secret.

942
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,800
Still, I won't tell him you hit him with a grilled fish too.

943
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,450
You hit me with a grilled fish too?

944
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,610
What are you doing here?

945
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,700
Why are you drinking alone?

946
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,980
Gi Bong.

947
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,100
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

948
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,560
How much did you drink?

949
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,020
Were you able to find a job?

950
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,540
No, I couldn't find any.

951
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,710
The hotel chef I used to work for,

952
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,500
banned everyone from hiring me.

953
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,800
The thing is,

954
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,690
I threw spaghetti at his face before I left.

955
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,650
Why?

956
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,140
I worked for him for ten years,

957
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:59,330
but he gave the sous-chef position to someone who worked there for less than five years.

958
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:07,760
I never studied abroad, and I don't have an impressive background. He said it would be embarrassing to put me in charge of the kitchen.

959
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,640
That's why I threw the spaghetti.

960
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,510
Are you okay?

961
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,400
I'm fine.

962
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,060
If my ex-colleagues can't hire me,

963
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,680
I'll just find some sort of part-time job.

964
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,470
What about your dream? Your dream has always been to open your own restaurant.

965
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,670
How many people in the world

966
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,460
actually achieve their dream?

967
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,140
I give up.

968
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,270
Are you sure you're okay with that?

969
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:53,780
Of course. I'm fine.

970
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,940
I'm really fine. So, don't worry about me.

971
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,740
Noona, look at me.

972
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,240
Why?

973
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,970
Hey! What are you doing right now?

974
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:23,040
Don't you remember what you told me? You said I should cry if I want to.

975
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,600
So don't hold it back. Cry if you want to.

976
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,470
Gi Bong. What should I do now?

977
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,820
I really wanted to make it work this time.

978
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,610
But now...

979
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,650
I feel...

980
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,920
I feel like I don't have a future.

981
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,350
What should I do now?

982
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,040
What should I do?

983
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:22,500
 Bonne Vacance in Waikiki

984
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:35,610
Hey, Woo Sik. Come to your senses!

985
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,580
You're so heavy.

986
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,310
Where is this? Am I at home?

987
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,720
Soo Yeon, how did we get here?

988
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,240
I brought you here. Me.

989
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,650
Seriously, you're way too heavy.

990
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,980
Really?

991
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,720
Oh, what happened to your producer?

992
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,600
Don't you remember?

993
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,110
You told him I hit him with chicken feet and he went crazy.

994
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,830
Really?

995
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:13,180
Don't worry. I took care of everything.

996
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,240
- Mister, get up. Get up!
- What? What do you want?

997
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,370
It's time for us to close, so please leave.

998
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:23,630
Where am I? Why am I here?

999
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,720
No matter how hard he tries, he won't remember.

1000
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,170
Do you know how hard I tried to make him drink?

1001
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,820
I'm sorry, It's all because of me.

1002
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:40,480
It's fine. I know you did it to help me.

1003
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,850
Thanks for helping me.

1004
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,110
You don't have to thank me.

1005
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:51,130
It's just, I always feel thankful to you.

1006
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,680
You let me live here,

1007
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,580
and you always come to see me whenever I'm in trouble.

1008
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:05,090
Don't worry about it. I just did it because I liked it.

1009
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,510
You liked it?

1010
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,750
It's just...

1011
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:15,410
When you smile, I feel happy too, and when it's hard for you, it's hard for me too.

1012
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:18,800
When you're sad, I feel sad too.

1013
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:26,760
When I can't see you, I feel concerned and you're always on my mind.

1014
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,520
Do you like me?

1015
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:38,180
What's wrong with you?

1016
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,480
I was just kidding.

1017
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,190
I'm not kidding.

1018
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:54,070
Soo Yeon. I have something to tell you.

1019
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,990
 Waikiki Guest House

1020
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:01,520
That's so loud.

1021
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,970
Who is it so early in the morning?

1022
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,050
Hello? Oh, Gi Bong. What is it?

1023
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,790
Noona, come out for a second. Hurry!

1024
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:22,080
What is this about?

1025
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,600
I'm so sleepy.

1026
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,450
What does he want to see me for?

1027
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,360
I feel dizzy.

1028
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,330
Noona!

1029
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:39,080
Hey, why are you calling me out so early in the morning?

1030
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,070
Come down. Hurry.

1031
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,760
Gosh, this is so annoying.

1032
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,640
What is this?

1033
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,200
 Yuri's Kitchen 31

1034
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,190
Ta-da!

1035
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,590
 Yuri's Kitchen 31

1036
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,210
Gi Bong.

1037
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,390
I promised you. I would open a restaurant for you.

1038
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:18,370
But I can't afford to open a real restaurant now. I only had enough for a food truck.

1039
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,170
It's also a used truck.

1040
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,930
Where did you get the money?

1041
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,170
Actually, I received my last salary yesterday.

1042
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,340
It's the last money I made as a baseball player.

1043
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:35,690
I wondered what I should do with the money and decided to invest in you.

1044
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:39,410
So you should work hard to make money and pay me back.

1045
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,050
Gi Bong.

1046
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,080
Noona, are you crying?

1047
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:53,020
Thank you. Thank you so much, Gi Bong.

1048
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,550
No problem. I was just keeping my promise.

1049
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,410
"A man's words are worth his height in installments," don't you know?

1050
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,230
Of course, I do.

1051
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:06,710
"A man's words are worth his height in installments," definitely.

1052
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,120
Don't cry. Stop crying now.

1053
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,040
Woo Sik, wake up, dude.

1054
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,010
Wake up.

1055
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:27,100
- Hey!
 - You scared me. Who are you?

1056
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,370
Oh, Joon Ki.

1057
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:33,260
How much did you drink last night?

1058
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,470
What? I don't know, something came up.

1059
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,610
Ow, my head.

1060
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:43,040
But, I think something happened last night.

1061
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,780
Hold on.

1062
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,460
Soo Yeon, I have something to tell you.

1063
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,130
What is it?

1064
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,210
To be honest,

1065
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,720
I like you.

1066
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:02,840
I like you very much.

1067
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:10,680
From the first moment I saw you, I've never forgotten you for a single moment.

1068
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,770
I really mean it.

1069
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,960
What? Did you do something stupid last night?

1070
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,250
Well, the thing is... I got drunk and told Soo Yeon

1071
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,540
that I like her.

1072
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,960
You confessed?

1073
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,580
So how did it go? What did Soo Yeon say?

1074
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,170
I don't know. I don't remember anything.

1075
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,210
Joon Ki, what should I do?

1076
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,930
You're such an idiot.

1077
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:49,970

1078
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:56,050

1083
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,890
 How long are you going to keep this up? Aren't you going to tell her you like her officially?

1084
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:16,300
 He's a producer who joined recently.

1085
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,200
 He was shooting a show at a shooting range and hurt his ear.

1086
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,410
 Soo Yeon, I have something to say to you.

1087
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,100
 I can't hear. I can't hear anything.

1088
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,110
 I'll work really hard and pay Gi Bong back for his kindness.

1089
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,210
 Why do you look so down?

1090
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,690
 My boss said he'd fire me if I don't sell a car within this week.

1091
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:31,180
 I haven't sold one yet.

1092
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,360
 How about changing cars?

1093
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,710
 Please save Rebecca.

1094
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,850
 What did you do for your car to be in this state?

1095
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,840
