1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,370
Han Soo Yeon. Why are you here?

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,790
Wh-Who are you, people?

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,260
How do you know me?

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey, you really don't remember us?

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,100
Hwang High School, Year 2, Class 3.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,390
We were in the same class!

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,350
It's me! Gi Bong!

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,720
The baseball club's ace! I won an excellent player award!

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,020
It was just high school.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,550
H-How about me?

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,410
Me, Lee Joon Ki! The handsome one of the acting club!

13
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,650
Gosh, how frustrating.

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,630
Hold on.

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,490
Are you the one who wanted to act and always took that crappy form everywhere you went? Lee Joon Ki?

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,050
Yeah, that's him!

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,160
You're Gook Gi Bong, right?

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,890
Yeah, that's Gook Gi Bong! Oh, you remember!

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,670
How about him? Do you remember him?

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,420
The one who always had a guitar with him because he wanted to start a band!

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,560
- He was the lead singer of that band!
 - Cha Woo Sik?

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,900
Yeah, that's him!

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,840
Oh, right, you know the masked singer who sang the congratulatory song earlier?

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
That's him.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
We listened to your song well.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,520
That was really you?

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,980
Huh?

28
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,560
Oh...

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,370
What happened to you? Why are you here?

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,830
Huh?

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,370
Uh... I don't really know myself.

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,830
I don't know.

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,560
  The Butterfly Effect: A small difference causes great changes

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,770
Alright, so let's sum this up clearly.

35
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,030
So, the creditors were chasing Soo Yeon and she coincidentally ended up hiding in Rebecca.

36
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,060
Hey, this isn't even a coincidence. It's fate!

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,780
Shush. It's not fate.

38
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,590
What? We were united with our first love!

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,220
What's wrong? They're not picking up? Not even the groom?

40
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,790
No.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,790
Thanks for letting me use your phone, Gi Bong.

42
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,460
I'll be off then. I'm worried about my dad.

43
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,010
Hey, wait!

44
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,160
You said you can't get in touch with him. How will you go?

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,700
I need to go home first.

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,940
There are probably so many creditors in front of your house. Do you think he'd be in there?

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,710
Is that so? Then, what do I do?

48
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,430
Then, you should stay here for the night.

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,280
- Hey, what are you saying? Have her stay the night? 
 - Then you're going to kick her out?

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,800
- Say something that makes sense for once. 
 - No!

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,170
The second floor's empty. It's fine.

52
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,570
- No, it's fine. 
 - No, no.

53
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,260
- I'm here. 
  - Hi.

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,610
- Who's this? 
 - Soo Yeon. It's a long story. Whatever!

55
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,980
- Let's go, Soo Yeon. 
 - Get some rest.

56
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,640
It's fine, it's fine.

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
Soo Yeon?

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,670
I've heard that name a lot.

59
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,950
Where have I heard her name?

60
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,470
Wait. That girl's the first love from the yearbook, right?

61
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,930
Why's she here?

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,420
What's with her wedding dress?

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,860
Hey! Tell me before you leave!

64
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,950
  Waikiki

65
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,210
What are you guys doing so early in the morning?

66
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,040
It's been ten years since we met our first love.

67
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,380
We should leave a good impression.

68
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,830
Wow.

69
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,170
You can't see my nose hair, right?

70
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,950
No, I can't.

71
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,040
Hey. How do I look?

72
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,790
You look fine, but something's missing.

73
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,120
Hold on.

74
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,770
It's done now. Wow, you look so great now! You're not missing a thing.

75
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,030
That's true. I'm not missing a thing.

76
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,590
Hey, Soo Yeon's as beautiful as ever, right?

77
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,020
She's gotten prettier than before.

78
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,760
I know, right?

79
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,790
Come to your senses!

80
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,600
We might be kicked out for not paying rent. Why are we focusing on our first love?

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,560
Hey! Don't say that in front of her, okay?

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,740
Why not? You don't want to show Soo Yeon that pathetic side?

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,860
Of course not.

84
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,260
That's what first love is for men.

85
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,790
You always want to show them your best self.

86
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,420
You want to leave the best memories with them.

87
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,190
It's just like that.

88
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,940
So, tell Soo Yeon that I'm a really successful actor, okay?

89
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,720
Tell her that I'm a successful baseball player,

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,780
but that I'm here momentarily because of an injury.

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,120
That's a good idea.

92
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,440
Do you really want to do that in this situation?

93
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,680
That's all an act!

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,840
That's the most pathetic thing in the world, you know that?

95
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,230
- I know! 
 - You do?

96
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,260
Who cares? It's important to leave a good impression on your first love.

97
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,310
We shouldn't be blabbering about first loves right now.

98
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,070
What are we going to do about rent?

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,620
It's really hard for me

100
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,340
to pretend that I'm dating the boss.

101
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,080
She wants to go to the theme park again!

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,890
Just be patient!

103
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,280
We'll try to talk to her.

104
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
Hey, Soo Yeon must be hungry. We should wake her up and feed her, right?

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,680
- Should we? 
 - Yeah, let's go.

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
So, just come over to eat later, okay, Sir?

107
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,550
Let's go.

108
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,700
- I'll wake up Soo Yeon. 
 - My hair's looking good.

109
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,100
Oh, hey. Where are you going so early in the morning?

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm going to a new part-time job.

111
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,400
But, what's with those sunglasses?

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,380
I got them on discount.

113
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,840
Geez, that scared me!

114
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,520
What's this? Why's she sleeping here?

115
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,430
Soo Yeon, wake up! Soo Yeon!

116
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,860
Why are you sleeping here?

117
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,010
Good morning.

118
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,240
I was calling my dad, but I must've fallen asleep.

119
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,700
Oh, I see. But, he's still not picking up?

120
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,230
No, he's not.

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,150
Is this phone broken? It keeps getting disconnected.

122
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,130
This is Gulliver. It's faulty.

123
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,210
There's a reason why the cord is long.

124
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,290
You have to step here, then bite.

125
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,590
- See? Gulliver! Gulliver! 
 - Yeah, Gulliver!

126
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,050
This is what you do.

127
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,800
Oh, really?

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,210
Why didn't you change? Is it because men's clothes are uncomfortable?

129
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,090
Do you want to borrow clothes from Jeong Eun?

130
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,520
- No, it's fine. 
 - Alright.

131
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,420
What the heck? Was I just looked down on? Right?

132
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,410
Is my style so weird?

133
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,310
- What time is it now?
 - I think my arm hurts.

134
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,790
Never mind. Look at yourselves.

135
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,460
Oh, she's all annoyed again.

136
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,950
Soo Yeon!

137
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,510
Soo Yeon-san!

138
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,120
You'll be able to get in touch with him soon. Don't worry too much.

139
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,730
Yeah. I hope so.

140
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,950
But, what's wrong with that?

141
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,320
Oh, like we said yesterday, a meteor fell.

142
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,230
Oh, I see.

143
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,150
Oh, we put that there to cover the hole.

144
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,330
Oh, I see.

145
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,250
But, it's been so long. How have you all been?

146
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,540
Huh?

147
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,090
Oh, I'm an actor. An actor.

148
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,840
I've been filming movies, dramas,

149
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,030
- and I've been working with Hun. You know him, right? 
 - Hun?

150
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,220
"Tell me, why did you do that to me?" Hun. Lee Byung Hun.

151
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,740
- Wow, that's amazing! 
 - No, no.

152
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,350
- How about you, Gi Bong? 
 - Me?

153
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,330
I'm a pitcher. A professional baseball pitcher.

154
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,050
I'm here momentarily due to an injury.

155
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,510
But, they're making a big deal at the league and telling me to come back already.

156
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,430
Hey, hey. You guys said you were busy. Aren't you leaving?

157
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,820
We'll be leaving now.

158
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,710
Soo Yeon, I'll be going off to train.

159
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,490
I'll be off to film. Let us know if you need anything.

160
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,030
Geez.

161
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,310
Let's move this. One, two,

162
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,730
three!

163
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,490
Done.

164
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,160
See you soon.

165
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,590
- We'll be going. 
 - Bye!

166
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,280
Okay, goodbye!

167
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,160
Bye!

168
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,760
They've all succeeded.

169
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,680
How about you, Woo Sik?

170
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,740
What?

171
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,780
Oh, me?

172
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm a singer. A musician.

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,300
A singer? Oh!

174
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,630
That's why you sang at my wedding yesterday?

175
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,290
What? Well,

176
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,020
the wedding planner, a sunbae of mine, kept asking me, so I had to.

177
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,720
I see.

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,290
Oh, the announcer said you were going to debut soon.

179
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,210
What? Oh, about that.

180
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,330
I already did. A three-person mixed dance group, Taj Mahal.

181
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,270
Hey, hey. Get off quickly.

182
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,410
Is it okay if I use the bathroom?

183
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,240
- Yeah, go quickly. 
 - Thank you.

184
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,070
- Hey stunt team! 
 - Yes, director? 
 - Why are you only coming now?! Come here right now!

185
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,190
Yes, Director. We're coming!

186
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,310
This won't do. The director's mad. Let's just go quickly.

187
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,180
Wait, but I just have to go quickly.

188
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,820
Can't you see the director's mad? Come quickly!

189
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,300
- Wait, wait, but. 
 - Director, we're coming!

190
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh, it's so urgent, though.

191
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,620
This is driving me crazy.

192
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,300
- Come quickly! 
 - I am!

193
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,100
A while ago, I got a call from BTS to feature on their song.

194
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,850
You know BTS, right? Bangtan Sonyeondan.

195
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,870
I used to perform with them a long time ago.

196
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,320
Oh, did I tell you about the national tour I did?

197
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,720
Oh, yeah, you did. You said it all.

198
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,980
Anyway, after I kept working without taking a rest, I felt myself being drained.

199
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,280
So, that's why I'm recharging myself. I'm taking a short rest.

200
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,390
You said you were a singer. Why did you start the guesthouse?

201
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,030
Oh, that? Well,

202
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,430
many foreigners come to the guesthouse.

203
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,580
So, I communicate with them and I've decided to grow a global mindset.

204
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,950
Oh, I see. You've succeeded too, Woo Sik!

205
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,500
Oh, no, no.

206
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,660
How about you? How have you been doing?

207
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,460
Me?

208
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, I've been doing well. Well, even though it turned out like this now.

209
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,540
What's your husband like?

210
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,930
Oh, Min Seok?

211
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,250
He's a really good person.

212
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,320
He's very kind to me. He adores me.

213
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,950
That's a relief.

214
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,230
What about you? You don't have a girlfriend?

215
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,200
A girlfriend?

216
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,690
I do. Who? Music.

217
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,920
I married music.

218
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,070
Woo Sik!

219
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,310
Oh, boss! Why are you here so early?

220
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,390
I came because I missed you.

221
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,040
But, who's this?

222
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,310
This is my friend. My high school friend.

223
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,550
But, her clothes...

224
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,590
Oh, she just... has her own reasons.

225
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,900
Who's this?

226
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,870
Hello. I'm Woo Sik's girlfriend. Kim Jeong Sook.

227
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,560
It's been three days.

228
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,000
What?

229
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,880
Oh, I see.

230
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,070
Woo Sik, you haven't had breakfast yet, right?

231
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,570
I brought ginseng chicken soup. I'll prepare it right away!

232
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,050
No, I'm not hungry. Not at all!

233
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,420
You can just eat it later.

234
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,030
You fool! Just wait a little, okay?

235
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,330
Oh, I'm fine, though! For real!

236
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,000
Woo Sik, she's dating you? What is this?

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,490
- She's your girlfriend? 
 - Well, about that...

238
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,670
You said you didn't have a girlfriend earlier.

239
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,040
You said you married music.

240
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,590
Well, about that...

241
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,890
There she goes again.

242
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,650
Actually, the boss is a bit ill. Up here.

243
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,760
Here? Then...

244
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,860
Yeah. She thinks I'm her boyfriend.

245
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,980
She said that I resemble the man she used to love before.

246
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,010
Oh, I see.

247
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,710
But... boss?  Aren't you the boss of this place?

248
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,560
Huh? Well...

249
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,330
She owned the guesthouse a long time ago.

250
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,930
But, she still thinks that she's the owner. That's why she keeps coming by.

251
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,910
So, you should pretend to not know, okay?

252
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,700
She's so pitiful.

253
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,180
I got it.

254
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,570
Did you not call your dad yet?

255
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,810
Oh, my dad! I'll call him again.

256
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,850
This is driving me insane.

257
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,070
Boss, you must be so tired. Why would you prepare all of this? Let's just eat outside.

258
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,150
No, no. I wanted to do this.

259
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,920
But, still. You must be tired. Let's just eat out.

260
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,570
Tsk. Woo Sik, are you looking down on my sincerity right now?

261
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,960
No, no.

262
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,270
I'll eat it. I will.

263
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,040
You should've decided that earlier.

264
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,290
Oh, I wasn't thinking straight. I forgot to bring green onions.

265
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,020
- Woo Sik, do you have green onions at home? 
 - Green onions? No, I don't.

266
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,580
Well, could you go and buy green onions, then?

267
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,960
Ginger chicken soup isn't complete without green onions. Do it quickly, okay?

268
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,920
Oh, alright.

269
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,980
Yes, my son?

270
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,760
Me?

271
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,300
I'm at Woo Sik's house.

272
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,710
What? You're sick?

273
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,130
Where?

274
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,320
So? Where does it hurt the most?

275
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,470
Huh? Your legs?

276
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,540
Oh, you're all grown up but such a crybaby.

277
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,930
Do you want me to massage your legs?

278
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,540
You don't want that? You want acupuncture, then?

279
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,710
Oh, just hold it in then.

280
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:47,260
If you get acupuncture and have a nice, hot bath, your body will be okay.

281
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,290
Yeah.

282
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,680
Rest easy.

283
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,700
Oh, my! What do we do?

284
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,990
What was that? Why's she like that?

285
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,750
  I have to pee. I'm going to go insane.

286
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,760
We've finished setting it up. Where is Min?

287
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,210
He said he had to make a call.

288
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,660
Hey, we have no time here. He's making a call?!

289
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,830
Does he not have experience or what?

290
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,140
I apologize.

291
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,420
  The main role isn't here yet. Should I ask if I can use the restroom?

292
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,920
- Excuse me... 
 - Director!

293
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,390
Can I use the bathroom really quick?

294
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,120
Bathroom? Hey, are you insane or what?!

295
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,580
We'll be filming soon.

296
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,940
Does the staff have to wait for you to pee?!

297
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,470
Hey, Director Jo. Remove him instantly.

298
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,710
I don't want to film with a selfish person like him, so remove him!

299
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,190
Yes, Director. I apologize.

300
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,760
Hey, leave. Quickly!

301
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,730
I'm sorry, Director. Can you give me one more chance?

302
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,350
Hey, drag him out quickly!

303
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,370
Don't put him in any more of my projects, got it?!

304
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,480
- Take him out! 
 - I apologize.

305
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,140
- Hey, hey. 
 - I don't think I have to use the bathroom!

306
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,090
- Don't you dare appear in front of me again! 
 - I'll do well, Director, please!

307
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,140
- What's this? You have something to say, too? 
 - What? No.

308
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,580
No, I don't. Fighting!

309
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,410
Oh, you startled me.

310
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,670
These so-called actors are not professional at all!

311
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,710
Oh, I'm so sorry.

312
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,990
Oh, Min!

313
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,890
I was late, right?

314
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,970
My puppy was sick, so I was on the phone.

315
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,880
It's totally fine. This filming isn't that important!

316
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,130
- Your sick puppy is more important! 
 - Thank you for understanding, Director.

317
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,040
Oh, no, no. I'm more thankful to be working with a top star like you.

318
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Oh, so, let's make a great scene together, got it?

319
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,380
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

320
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,310
What are you doing right now?

321
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,770
What? Oh, I was expressing my affections.

322
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,520
I don't like that.

323
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960

324
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,320
You can do this, Lee Joon Ki.

325
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,620
Alright, ready.

326
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,240
Action!

327
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,490
Are you Bidam?

328
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,230
Yes, I am. Do you have something you want from me?

329
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,990
Yes, I do. His Excellency wants you brought to him.

330
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,560
- Director! Director! Hold on. 
 - Cut!

331
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,290
What's the matter, Min?

332
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,450
This scene is a bit boring.

333
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,410
- We shouldn't just have a dialogue here. 
 - Alright.

334
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,290
How about this? He should take my drink away and have it himself.

335
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,060
He takes the drink away and drinks it himself?

336
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,930
Oh, that's such a good idea.

337
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,220
Top stars are truly something else.

338
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,500
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

339
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,270
Stop it! I don't like that.

340
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,890
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,040
Alright, so like he said, take his drink away,

342
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,430
and then start your lines. Okay?

343
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,330
- Alright, let's start. 
 - Hold on.

344
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,980
Are you telling me to drink this right now?

345
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,140
What's the matter? You don't want to?

346
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,720
No, I like it.

347
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,280
Scene 35, 1-2.

348
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,910
Action!

349
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,340
Are you Bidam?

350
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,420
So, what if I am?

351
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,920
Cut!

352
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,650
Hey, Min, it's not, "So, what if I am?"

353
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,940
It's "Yes, I am."

354
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,590
- Oh, "Yes, I am." I'm sorry. One more time. 
 - Again?

355
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,730
"Yes, I am." Okay, one more time!

356
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,770

357
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
Are you Bidam?

358
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,010
- The dust!  
 - Cut!

359
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,150
Can you stop the dust from coming here? I can't act like this!

360
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,450
Take 4.

361
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,140
- Are you Bidam? 
 - This bug.

362
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,280
- Catch the bug! 
 - Take 5.

363
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,770
- Are you Bi Dam? 
 - One more time.

364
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,300
Again?

365
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,090
- Are you Bi Dam? 
 - One more time.

366
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,510
One more time.

367
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,070
 Scene 35, Take 13

368
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,780
Are you Bi Dam?

369
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,450
Yes, I am. Do you need something from me?

370
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,890
Yes, I do. I really do.

371
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,430
His Excellency wants me to bring you to him.

372
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,460
Your neck—!

373
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,960
Hey! What are you doing right now?

374
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,260
Why are your legs twisted like that?

375
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,480
Did you come here to seduce somebody? Did you?!

376
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,640
You're an assassin!

377
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,920
Why are your legs crossed like that?!

378
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,420
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,260
We'll start again from the drinking part.

380
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,020
- Alright, fill the drink up quickly! 
 - Quickly!

381
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,090
Hey, hey, fill it completely!

382
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,200
That sound...

383
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,050
Eat up, Woo Sik!

384
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,810
Yes, thank you.

385
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,610
I was going to call you over. Have a seat and eat with us.

386
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,070
Oh, no, no. I asked her earlier, and she said she wasn't hungry.

387
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,760
No, Woo Sik. She is not well, and yet she prepared it with so much effort.

388
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,960
I should eat.

389
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,380
Thank you for the food.

390
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,070
Oh, it looks good. Soo Yeon, eat up!

391
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,210
Boss, eat up!

392
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,210
Yes, yes.

393
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,670
Oh, you're eating so well!

394
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,120
Eat slowly!

395
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,570
Oh, yes.

396
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,090
  This is driving me crazy.

397
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,670
How is it? Is it good?

398
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,940
What do I do?

399
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
What's wrong?

400
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,150
Something's on your face.

401
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,200
Hold on. I'll wipe it for you.

402
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,420
If it's hard for you to eat, should I feed you?

403
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,710
What?

404
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,890
No, there's no need for that.

405
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,790
Then, should I at least bone the chicken for you?

406
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,320
No, I can eat by myself.

407
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, of course.

408
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,270
I've seen on TV that even if it's hard, it's best to try by yourself.

409
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,720
Well, then.

410
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,700
Thank you for the meal.

411
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,070
How pitiful that she got such a disease...

412
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,050
A disease? Honey, what is your friend saying?

413
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,680
Why would she wipe my face and offer to feed me?

414
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,950
What's wrong with her?

415
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,130
Oh, about that. So...

416
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,430
There she goes again.

417
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,520
Actually, she's a bit ill.

418
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,350
Up here.

419
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,500
Here?

420
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,650
Is she really?

421
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,190
How did that happen?

422
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,930
Since her wedding fell apart, she was traumatized.

423
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,140
- Really? 
 - Yes.

424
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,150
Alright, since we don't have time,

425
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,370
we're going to do it in one take this time, okay?

426
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,950
Yes, sir!

427
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,690
Action!

428
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,030
Yaa!

429
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,530
Cut, cut, cut!

430
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,690
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you running like that?

431
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,580
- Are you giving him a warning right now? 
 - I'm sorry.

432
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,350
Do it with more force.

433
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,530
Run at him with all you've got!

434
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,690
One more time. One more!

435
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,280
Hurry up!

436
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,060
Ready!

437
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,520
Action!

438
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,480
- Hold on, hold on. 
 - Cut, cut!

439
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,000
It's going to come out! Ow!

440
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,780
He just hit you a tiny bit!  Why are you overreacting?!

441
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,250
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,100
We don't have enough time. Are you going to keep this up?

443
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,830
If you do this one more time, we'll change your role. Do it properly.

444
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,850
Alright. I can do it!

445
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,940
I'll do it! Fighting!

446
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,170
  I'll hold it in even if I die.

447
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,480
  I had to fight so much to get this role.

448
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,280
Boss, let's have coffee out.

449
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,650
No, I ground the beans just to give it to you.

450
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,620
It smells so nice, right?

451
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,260
What? Oh, yes!

452
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,550
I'm here.

453
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,640
Boss!

454
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,270
Oh, Jeong Eun, you're here! Would you like coffee?

455
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,230
What? No, I'm fine.

456
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,260
Don't be like that. Have a cup with us.

457
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,090
Poor girl.

458
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,880
What? What are you talking about?

459
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,490
That girl.

460
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,450
I heard she's mentally ill.

461
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,100
What? Soo Yeon?

462
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,650
Didn't you know? She's insane.

463
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,960
That's what Woo Sik said.

464
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,850
That doesn't make sense—

465
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,920
Did you do what I asked of you?

466
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,230
What? What did you ask me for?

467
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,740
Hey, how could you forget?

468
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,490
- What? 
 - Come see me for a bit.

469
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,140
Why are you being like this?

470
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,250
What a manly man.

471
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,170
What? Soo Yeon thinks the boss is crazy,

472
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,000
- and the boss thinks Soo Yeon is crazy?  
- Yes.

473
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Why would you lie about something like that?!

474
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,920
A successful singer? Are you getting married to music?

475
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,430
Jeong Eun. That's what first love is like to a man.

476
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,810
He always wants to show them his best self and leave them with the best memories.

477
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,920
Shut up!

478
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,200
Gosh, everyone is going crazy over their first love.

479
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,990
Anyway, act like you don't know. If I'm caught, I'm dead. You know that, right?

480
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,150
Alright, throw it ten more times, then we'll end the practice.

481
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,990
Yes, Coach.

482
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,360
Excuse me, Coach.

483
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,290
Our shining star! Practice ended. Why'd you come?

484
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,680
I went to the shower, but the water wasn't coming out.

485
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,230
I think it's broken. What do we do?

486
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,320
That won't do.

487
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Gi Bong. Go and fix it.

488
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,360
- Me? 
 - Then, will I do it?

489
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,380
There are a lot of shower stalls. Do it somewhere else.

490
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,210
After I practice, I have to shower in the third stall from the right.

491
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,260
- It's a routine. 
 - Routine?

492
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,450
If not, I get bothered by it and get in bad shape.

493
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,820
What are you doing? Go and fix it!

494
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,860
I'm not even done with practice.

495
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,690
Your practice isn't even important!

496
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,070
This one is going to get contract offers from Japan soon.

497
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,460
If he's in bad shape, will you take responsibility?

498
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,730
Alright, then. I'll just fix it.

499
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,080
You should've said that earlier.

500
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,840
Why does he want me to fix this?

501
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,340
I guess if you're not a shining star you have to do tedious tasks like these.

502
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,930
What is this? Why isn't it coming out?

503
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,660
What is this? I think something's stuck there.

504
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,470
It's stuck there so tightly!

505
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,530
  I need to block it from coming out. Even if I die!

506
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,770
The most important part of the scene is your gaze.

507
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,120
Look at your opponent as if you're going to kill them!

508
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,590
You need that psychopathic gaze, like a crazy person.

509
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,830
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, sir!

510
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,580
 This is my last scene.

511
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,520
  I need to end it at once.

512
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
  At once!

513
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,680
Ready?

514
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,390
Action!

515
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,460
Cut!

516
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,340
Director, I apologize. Oh, why is my shoe here?

517
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,880
This is driving me crazy.

518
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,590
What is wrong with the costume team?

519
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,780
Hey, hey, Min.

520
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,700
We don't have time!

521
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,030
So, come to your senses, okay?

522
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,680
Kang Min, come to your senses!

523
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,310
Are you going to be like this all day? We have no time!

524
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,590
Let me live!

525
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,600
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

526
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,570
Shut up! Go film already, Director!

527
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,690
What's wrong with you?

528
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,720
Are you immersed in your role?

529
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,690
Everyone saw that, right? That's the gaze!

530
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,330
Shut up!

531
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,520
You're getting in the way of my focus!

532
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,600
Let's hurry and film before you break out of character.

533
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,580
That was great. Great!

534
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,390
Let's go!

535
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,790
Hurry, get to your spots!

536
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,060
Ready! Action!

537
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,270
I'll wait for you in the afterlife, Bidam.

538
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,180
Cut! Okay!

539
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,940
That was great! So great. Bravo!

540
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,850
Oh, that was great.

541
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,840
Man, his acting is so great!

542
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,550
Are we done?

543
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,830
Of course. Get up, Joon Ki!

544
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,290
That was so great.

545
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,240
Applaud! What are you doing?

546
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,120
Your acting was so great.

547
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,110
- You did so well. 
 - Don't touch me!

548
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,420
I have to go. I have to go.

549
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,850
You did so well.

550
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,120
Hey, man.

551
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,240
I want to work with you on my next project. How's that?

552
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,490
Yes, I got it.

553
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,620
So... Can

554
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,560
we talk about it later?

555
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,830
Where are you going?

556
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,530
Are you trying to escape?

557
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,340
No, It's just urgent. It's urgent.

558
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,550
Why isn't it coming out?

559
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,160
What's wrong? What's wrong?

560
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,090
Let go!

561
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,700
Anyway, your acting today was so great!

562
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:22,230
Oh, it came out. One drop came out.

563
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,850
Oh, oh!

564
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,700
-  It's coming out.  
 - Oh, it's coming out!

565
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,590
That's good! One more drop!

566
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,970
A little more, a little more!

567
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:51,660
Oh, it came out! It came out! Come out!

568
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,560
What's wrong with your expression?

569
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,330
What's wrong with you?

570
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,830
What the heck? Why is there water?

571
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,230
Don't tell me you just peed.

572
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,060
- What's wrong with him? 
 - His pants are wet.

573
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:32,340
- Why is it wet? 
 - What's up with him?

574
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,930
Ah, this color matches you so well. Right?

575
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,820
You should go now, it's getting late.

576
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:47,270
Oh my gosh, it's already this late. Anyway, when I'm with you, time goes by so quickly.

577
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:52,050
- Hurry up and leave. 
 - It's a shame to be apart from you.

578
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:56,970
- Should I stay the night? 
 - Excuse me? What kind of wicked statement is that?

579
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,540
- Your sons are waiting for you. 
 - It's a joke.

580
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,050
But, you'll take me back to my place, right?

581
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:09,060
Ah, yes. Of course. I'll go get my coat.

582
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,060
Ah, he's cute.

583
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:20,030
Because of my successful junior, I had to fix the shower.

584
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,080
It's so dirty and cheap that I'm definitely going to succeed and show them.

585
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,830
Oh, that scared me! What's that?

586
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,320
What is this? Is he a crazy man?

587
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,630
- Joon Ki! 
 - Gi Bong!

588
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,170
- What are you doing here? And what's up with the clothing? 
 - Gi Bong!

589
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,830
What's wrong with you? What happened?

590
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,500
What kind of smell is this?

591
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,960
Ah, Joon Ki!

592
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,350
Joon Ki! Don't move!

593
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,860
Seriously!

594
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,560
What should I do with you?

595
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,490
What is this? Why did they leave a plant there?

596
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,150
And what is that? Why did they put a picture up there? It looks messy.

597
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,190
Oh, that? A meteorite fell through, so they put those there to hide the holes.

598
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,390
- What? A meteorite? 
 - Yes.

599
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:36,000
Don't you know what a meteorite is? It's a rock that comes from space.

600
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,310
Oh my gosh, what should I do?

601
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,470
Please come to your senses, miss.

602
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,940
You are pretty, but why did you lose your mind?

603
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,900
Excuse me? Who lost their mind? Me?

604
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,970
Then, was I referring to myself? Forget it.

605
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,910
- Why am I talking to someone who lost their mind? 
  - What do you keep saying?

606
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,070
Wow, I'm speechless.

607
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,760
Forget it. A crazy person only sees crazy people.

608
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,940
A crazy person? Who? Me?

609
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:19,060
Then, Ahjumma, am I referring to myself? They really said a meteorite fell through.

610
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,290
Do you want to see?

611
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,430
- Here. 
 - What is that?

612
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,060
This, too.

613
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,750
- Here. You see what I meant? 
 - What is that?

614
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,330
Boss, let's go!

615
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,390
Woo Sik, what is that? What is all of this?

616
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,250
- What happened here? 
 -  Well... What I mean is that...

617
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,340
We are here!

618
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,890
- Boss. 
 - Hello. 
 - Why do you look like this?

619
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,170
No, it's not time to talk about this.

620
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,290
Then, did you also know?

621
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,330
All of you knew, so you were hiding it from me?

622
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,190
Tell me the truth right now!

623
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,880
Well, Woo Sik, why did you say such a lie?

624
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,880
How can you lie that you love the boss?

625
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,410
What are you saying now? Loving me was a lie?

626
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,470
You were not talking about the love part?

627
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:45,900
Woo Sik, tell me. Did you really lie to me?

628
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,900
What? Well, I...

629
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,660
What is this? Why is the atmosphere like this?

630
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,220
Jeong Eun, you knew, too? Did you know that Woo Sik was lying to me?

631
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,760
Excuse me?

632
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,490
Ah, well, I... I...

633
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,660
No, but Woo Sik, why did you say the landlady was crazy?

634
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,680
You can't call a normal person a crazy person like that!

635
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,310
What are you saying this time?

636
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,270
Crazy? Who? Me?

637
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:31,130
Woo Sik, then this person is not crazy? You told me she was crazy earlier.

638
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,030
Miss, did he also say I was crazy to you?

639
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,590
Is that true?

640
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,060
- Well, I— 
 - Hey, Cha Woo Sik!

641
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,490
You... You are dead today!

642
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,890
- Boss! 
 - Stop her!

643
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:02,490
- Stop! Stop! Stop! 
 - Boss!

644
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:10,040
 Confiscation Notice

645
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,210
- What should we do now? 
 - But still, she didn't kick us out immediately.

646
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,830
She gave us today, then it's fine.

647
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,040
It's fine, my butt!

648
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,380
Hey! She stuck those stickers and wants $10,000 by today.

649
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,610
What's the difference between this and getting kicked out? Huh? Why did you say such a lie? Why!

650
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,870
- I'm sorry. I didn't know it would turn out like this. 
 - And you went on and on about first love and men.

651
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,470
- You  really  showed a good side of you. 
 - Why are you like this, too? I'm going crazy already.

652
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,090
Speaking of which, where are we going to get that huge sum in a day?

653
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,840
- Hey! 
 - What? Ah!

654
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,310
- Is it the time to trim your nose hair? 
 - I was thinking while trimming my nose hair!

655
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,450
We don't have any other way. We should go to someone we know and explain the situation.

656
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,750
I'll ask the players in my team to lend me money.

657
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,090
Me, too. I'll find any way to get money even if it means getting looked down on. I'll be leaving.

658
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,220
Go safely.

659
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,140
Hey, hey. Let's get up.

660
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,880
That's right. Let's move. There's no point in sitting here.

661
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,020
- Let's go. 
 - Are you bleeding?

662
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,230
Soo Yeon, do you need something?

663
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,270
No, it's not that. I'll go now.

664
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,110
Now? But, you said you couldn't contact your father. Where are you going?

665
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:28,400
But still, I'll try going home. Speaking of which, can you take me home?

666
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,260
- What? Us? 
- I'm sorry, but we have something urgent right now so I don't think we can.

667
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,690
Don't be like that and take me there.

668
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,920
I'll give you this in exchange.

669
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,370
Isn't this your wedding dress?

670
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,000
- What's the use of this? 
 - It's brand name.

671
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,610
If you sell it as used, it'll be worth at least around $5,000. Forget it, if you don't want it.

672
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,090
Where is your house?

673
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,150
- CEO Han, come out! 
 - Come out! Come out!

674
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,420
CEO Han, come out!

675
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,710
See, I told you creditors would be here.

676
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,990
Then, what should I do?

677
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,750
Soo Yeon, should we go to your father's company?

678
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,880
Hey, the creditors are even here. Do you think they won't be at the company?

679
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,490
- Do you have a better idea? 
 - I'm just saying that it won't be helpful.

680
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:29,290
- Then, is there someone that might know where your father is? 
 - Well...

681
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,870
Yes, there's Secretary Kim who should know.

682
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:39,120
- Really? Then, try calling him. Hurry.
 - I lost my phone, so I don't know his phone number.

683
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,930
- Ah, but it might be saved on my old phone. 
 - Really? Where is it?

684
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,800
- In my room, in my vanity table drawer. 
 - What?

685
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,310
- Then, it's inside the house, right? 
 - Yes.

686
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,700
So, can you guys go and get it?

687
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,840
Us? You're telling us to go in?

688
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,290
Why? You don't want to?

689
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:09,090
That wedding dress is super expensive. It was handmade by a master designer in Korea.

690
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,900
I get it, I get it! Who said we didn't want to? We just need to go get it for you.

691
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,540
What are you saying? There are creditors everywhere. How do you want us to get in?

692
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,220
- We just need to climb the wall. Just climb the wall. 
 - We don't have time for that!

693
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,840
Then, what should we do! We will go, us men.

694
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,870
Gi Bong, let's go!

695
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,490
Hey! Hey!

696
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:43,510
We don't have time for this. It's driving me crazy.

697
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,420
Ah, the sky is so blue.

698
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,070
- Show your manliness. 
 - Huh? No!

699
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,990
Hurry and go up!

700
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,290
I'm scared.

701
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,480
Joon Ki!

702
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,590
Come up quickly! What are you doing?

703
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,500
- Hurry! 
 - Okay, I'm coming.

704
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,530
How do I go up?

705
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,080
What are you doing?

706
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,640
Hey, you're amazing. You're not even Spiderman or anything.

707
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,260
Geez, you're just tall for nothing.

708
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,720
Are you playing around right now?

709
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,870
- I can't do it anymore! 
 - Hurry!

710
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,150
Hurry up!

711
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,160
I think I'm done. Go first. Joon Ki!

712
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,120
Joon Ki! Ow!

713
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,310
Joon Ki!

714
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,860
Are you a tuna or halibut or what?

715
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,230
Gosh, I thought I'd die. Do we have to go this far?

716
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,620
Then, what do we do? We got a $5,000 dress from Soo Yeon. We should at least do this much for her.

717
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,170
Let's just get her phone, then leave.

718
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,990
Is this a house or a palace? Wow, she's so rich.

719
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,320
Hey, let's find her room first.

720
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,190
Hurry up.

721
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,430
Joon Ki! Joon Ki!

722
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,870
This is Soo Yeon's room, I think.

723
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,410
Really?

724
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,820
Oh, yeah, that's her. How pretty.

725
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,750
Her vanity.

726
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,460
The phone.

727
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,290
Look here.

728
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,530
I found it!

729
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,360
Let's get out.

730
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,220
Search the place!

731
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,210
Yes, sir!

732
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,360
Everywhere you can see!

733
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,140
Come on!

734
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,280
Don't come out right now. If you do, you're dead.

735
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,020

736
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,900
Who are those people? Are they the creditors?

737
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,040
What do we do? This is driving me crazy.

738
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,010
Just take a look around and take what looks good.

739
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,130
Like that. And this.

740
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,470
Take them all out. You can just take out what's in the rooms, too.

741
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,540
Sir, the door is locked.

742
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,150
Well, then... Break through.

743
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,450
Break?

744
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,240
What do we do?

745
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,860
Sir, it's open.

746
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,530
Look at that. There's so much here.

747
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,220
Take this. Take all the good things and leave.

748
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,220
This dressing table, the bed, and the closet.

749
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,060
What's in here?

750
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,210
Look! It all looks expensive. How useful.

751
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,780
Just take out the whole closet.

752
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,490
Alright.

753
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,140
- Please take care of it all! 
 - Yes, sir!

754
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,130
Over there, and things like that.

755
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,420
It's moving!

756
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,400
Why aren't they coming out?

757
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,900
Oh, what's that?

758
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,920
That's my dressing table. That's my closet!

759
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,270
Place that here.

760
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,390
Yeah.

761
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,080
It's so hot.

762
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,700
What do we do?

763
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,590
Let's move it. One, two!

764
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,430
What are they doing?

765
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,430
It's Joon Ki.

766
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,320
What happened? Why aren't you here?

767
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,650
Woo Sik, we're being taken away!

768
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,580
We're stuck right now!

769
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,300
Stuck where?

770
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,290
We're in Soo Hyeon's closet!

771
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,790
Closet? What are you talking about...?

772
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,840
  Place that there.

773
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,600
Is it the pink closet?

774
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,570
How'd you know?

775
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,490
Hey, you guys are being loaded on a truck right now!

776
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,260
What?! Hey, hey

777
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,650
Woo Sik, Woo Sik!

778
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,300
  Save us! We're dead!

779
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,100
You fools!

780
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,540
What's wrong? What happened?

781
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,560
Oh, I don't know! This is driving me nuts.

782
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,360
Gosh, I asked you to do that, and you didn't?

783
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,370
Where did they all go?

784
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,090
Why would she just leave her clothes there?

785
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh, it's so pretty!

786
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,460
It suits me well.

787
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,410
I want to get married too!

788
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,380
What if I'm single all my life?

789
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,680
Whatever, whatever. Just take it off. Keep it on and get caught and you'll be humiliated.

790
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,440
Oh, my hair!

791
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,070
Ouch, this is driving me crazy.

792
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,160
Oh, it's stuck!

793
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,570
What do I do?

794
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,590
Oh, I'll just cut it.

795
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,620
Scissors. Where are the scissors?

796
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,340
Scissors.

797
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,020
Oh, this is driving me crazy!

798
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,900
Oh, whatever. Scissors.

799
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,550
Scissors. Scissors!

800
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,830
Oh, what's this?

801
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,940
Why can't it get out?

802
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,610
Excuse me? Is anyone there?

803
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,590
Hello? Is anyone there?

804
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,820
What do we do now? This is driving me crazy.

805
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,580
Let's move it after a smoke.

806
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,390
Yes, sir.

807
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,060
They're going. Okay, we're good.

808
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,450
Joon Ki, Gi Bong, are you okay?

809
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,560
Oh!

810
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,320
Woo Sik! Take us out!

811
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,130
Just wait a bit!

812
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,330
- Woo Sik! 
 - Shut up!

813
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,460
We have no time, hurry up.

814
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,780
Yes, yes, we're here. We're going up!

815
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,730
Darn!

816
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,780
It's so freaking heavy.

817
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,230
What is this?

818
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,850
Why is it loose? Wow, that would've been bad!

819
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,920
Anyway, let's move this closet first.

820
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,520
Yes, sir.

821
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,490
Help us, hurry up.

822
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,990
On three.

823
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:29,320
No! No! No, they can't do that.

824
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,120
Have a safe ride back.

825
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,230
- Thank you! 
 - No problem.

826
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,800
Oh, I fell asleep. You're here?

827
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,430
Yeah.

828
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,730
What's all of this?

829
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,280
Oh, we went to CEO Han's house and I got all the valuable items.

830
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,500
Oh, that's nice.

831
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,880
This closet's so pretty.

832
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,340
Pink, pink. My favorite.

833
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,010
Honey, what's all of this inside?

834
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,450
What else? I brought them to give to you.

835
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,190
This?

836
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:16,890
Yeah, I did. Just choose what you want.

837
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,840
I like this one.

838
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,680
Are you crazy?

839
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,780
Who are you? Why are you here?

840
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,010
Oh, yes, so what happened is...

841
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:30,240
Who are you, people? Why are you here?

842
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,850
Oh, yes, about that.

843
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,060
Hey, Professor Cha, we finally succeeded.

844
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,440
Professor Gook, we succeeded!

845
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,490
Success? What are you saying?

846
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,870
Oh, let's greet them.

847
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,490
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too.

848
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:58,070
We are from America's NASA.

849
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,340
We are researchers secretly studying teleportation.

850
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,470
Teleportation?

851
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,800
Yes, we have finally succeeded in teleportation, which is why we are here!

852
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,900
You teleported? Into this closet?

853
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,460
As you can see.

854
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,490
There's nothing that can be done. I'll have to show you proof.

855
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,640
This is the teleportation device.

856
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,790
If we use this, we teleport into another closet.

857
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,410
Alright. Close your eyes.

858
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,210
Why?

859
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:37,000
The light from this device destroys your eyesight.

860
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,430
If you want to lose your eyesight forever, you can keep your eyes open.

861
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,700
- My eyesight? 
 - Well, then.

862
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,000
Alright.

863
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,360
I'll start it now.

864
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,440
H-Honey.

865
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,310
I will count to three.

866
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,850
One.

867
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,150
Honey! Close your eyes for now!

868
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,500
Two!

869
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,270
We're from NASA!

870
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,640
NASA!

871
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,320
Three!

872
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,680
What happened? Did they teleport?

873
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,280
Oh, well...

874
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,500
You punks!

875
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,220
I knew you'd do this!

876
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,590
You guys are on the same side as CEO Han, aren't you?

877
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,950
Start the car!

878
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,510
Hurry up!

879
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,410
Alright!

880
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,960
You bastards!

881
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,810
Stop where you are!

882
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,120
You're dead when I catch you.

883
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,010
- I thought I'd die. 
 - Me, too.

884
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,220
Wow, I was so scared to death.

885
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,680
I told you not to go in! Look at yourself!

886
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,830
It was great before they came in—

887
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,930
Shut up!

888
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:53,010
Anyway, this is all because of Han Soo Yeon.

889
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,540
Still, she's our first love!

890
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,710
Hello? Secretary Kim?

891
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,090
Do you know where my dad is?

892
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,700
Oh, he's with me right now.

893
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,230
- Soo Yeon! 
 - Dad!

894
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,290
Soo Yeon, where are you? Are you okay?

895
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,970
Yeah, I'm okay. How about you?

896
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,250
I'm okay, too.

897
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,570
I'm really sorry, Soo Yeon. Because of me...

898
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,800
No, it's fine. But, what happened?

899
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,460
I think I was scammed.

900
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,630
I'll figure it all out and call you back. Just hang in there.

901
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,690
- Okay? 
 - What are you saying?

902
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,740
I can't talk for long, so I'll call you later.

903
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,080
Dad! Dad!

904
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,980
Soo Yeon, what's wrong?

905
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,550
What did your dad say?

906
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,890
I think this is it.

907
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,160
- Is this your husband's house? 
 - Yeah.

908
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,780
But, it seems as if the creditors aren't here.

909
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,290
Yeah. But, you said you can't get in touch with your husband, right?

910
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,080
What are you going to do?

911
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,110
I'm going to wait until he comes.

912
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,930
Anyway, thanks for everything you've done.

913
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,030
I'll make it up to you guys one day.

914
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,000
Oh, don't worry about it.

915
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,570
Goodbye, Soo Yeon.

916
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,730
If something happens, let us know.

917
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,150
Get home safe, guys.

918
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,450
Yeah, goodbye!

919
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,960
Is she going to be okay?

920
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,920
Should you be worrying about her right now? Let's go and earn some money.

921
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,460
Yeah, let's go.

922
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,980
Hold on, hold on.

923
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,060
- That hyung... 
 - Yeah.

924
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,640
- Soo Yeon. 
 - Hi, Oppa.

925
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,410
Isn't that the groom?

926
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,210
Oh, yeah!

927
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,990
What happened? Why couldn't I get in touch with you?

928
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,060
Oh, well...

929
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,960
I'm sorry. You must've worried so much, Mother.

930
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,210
Who are you calling Mother?

931
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:17,830
- Excuse me? 
 - Do you know how much my family was humiliated because of you?

932
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,230
What's going on?

933
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,630
What is it?

934
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,880
There's no need to drag things out.

935
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,740
Let's just pretend this wedding never happened.

936
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,160
Wh-What are you saying?

937
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,490
Are you clueless or just dumb?

938
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,580
Do you think we proceeded with the marriage because we liked you?

939
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,140
It was because of your father's money!

940
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,770
So, you should understand your situation and not come here again.

941
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,770
Don't contact us.

942
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,730
You have no sense of shame.

943
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,050
Wow, she's brutal.

944
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,160
Oppa.

945
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,860
I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it.

946
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,480
That trash.

947
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,010
How can a man like that exist?

948
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,730
Right? How are they human...

949
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,120
Let's just go.

950
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,910
Hey, we're going home! Hey!

951
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,660
Don't go, just go home!

952
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,620
Get up.

953
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,340
Hurry and get up. Let's go.

954
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,360
Go where? I have nowhere to go.

955
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,230
Why? Are you going to get on your knees and beg them?

956
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,080
Are you not even angry after hearing all of that?

957
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,840
I am! I'm angry and it feels so unfair.

958
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,160
But, what do I do?

959
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:17,490
What can I do in my state right now?

960
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,760
Nothing's going to change by you doing this.

961
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,940
So, just follow me.

962
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,480
I'm not going!

963
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,520
I'm not going!

964
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,720
All of my belongings are there.

965
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,520
Who is it?

966
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,630
You startled me.

967
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,430
We're here to get Soo Yeon's belongings.

968
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,450
Belongings?

969
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:57,250
Soo Yeon, who are these people?

970
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,630
That's none of your business.

971
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,070
Move aside.

972
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,330
Who are you to be doing this?

973
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:08,150
Us? We're Soo Yeon's first loves. What about it?

974
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,630
First loves? All of these people

975
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,530
are your first loves? All three of them?

976
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:18,250
No! Soo Yeon is our first love!

977
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,190
I'm Number One!

978
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,390
I'm Number Two!

979
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,350
I'm Number Three!

980
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,780
Is that good enough? What are you doing? Go get her belongings.

981
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,260
Let's go.

982
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,390
You people!

983
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,750
Hey! Soo Yeon! Hey!

984
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,980
Excuse me! Where—

985
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,910
What are you people doing right now?

986
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,440
Can you not tell? We're getting Soo Yeon's belongings.

987
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,160
- What did you say? 
 - You wanted to pretend the wedding never happened.

988
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,740
So, we need to calculate things correctly.

989
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,510
Geez, you have no sense of shame.

990
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,810
You people, the more I stand by—

991
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,540
The more you stand by, what?!

992
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,450
What?

993
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,310
Soo Yeon, you got all your things, right? You haven't forgotten anything?

994
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,510
There's one more thing.

995
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,250
What is it?

996
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,030
What? The suit?

997
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,650
Did you buy that for him?

998
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,380
What?

999
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,510
Are you clueless or just dumb? Take off your suit!

1000
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,620
What did you say?

1001
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,950
Oh, geez, you're so bad at listening!

1002
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:51,490
Take it off while we're being nice!

1003
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,320
Hurry up!

1004
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,920
Here you go.

1005
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,250
Geez, you must be dumb. What is a suit, guys?

1006
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,160
It's a set!

1007
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,890
- What do you mean? 
 - Take off your pants!

1008
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,260
Hurry up!

1009
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,990
Soo Yeon, are you going to be like this to me?

1010
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,590
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about it.

1011
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,420
Take it off!

1012
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:43,830
Soo Yeon, look around. There's nothing left, right?

1013
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,390
Oh, right! Minky!

1014
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,820
I forgot about Minky!

1015
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,450
- Minky? 
 - There's something left?

1016
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,380
- Minky? 
 - What's that?

1017
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,590
Minky is an iguana?

1018
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:03,350
Yeah. I've had him since I was young. He's family to me.

1019
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,900
Oh, I see. But, Soo Yeon, what will you do?

1020
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,170
Should we drop you off at your relatives' house?

1021
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,050
My relatives?

1022
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,820
It's been a long time since we've separated because of money issues.

1023
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,630
Is there anywhere you can go to?

1024
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,980
I should look for that now.

1025
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,290
Really? You have to look?

1026
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:28,050
You can just stay at our guesthouse. Right, Woo Sik?

1027
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:32,630
Right? We have a lot of empty rooms and no guests.

1028
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,260
Really? Can I do that?

1029
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,210
Of course.

1030
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,730
It's okay, right, Woo Sik?

1031
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,270
Well, whatever.

1032
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:46,090
Really? Oh, thank you so much!

1033
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:48,130
I'll make it up to you guys one day. I will!

1034
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,490
Don't be too happy about it. We don't know when we'll be kicked out yet.

1035
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,660
Oh, it's fine! It's fine!

1036
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:57,790
We have Soo Yeon's wedding dress. We can sell it and pay the boss ₩5,000,000 (~$5,000).

1037
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,990
She'll let it slide.

1038
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,240
Phew.

1039
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,260
Joon Ki!

1040
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,330
I'll do it, Soo Yeon!

1041
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,190
Let's see.

1042
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,230
Watch your hands.

1043
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,490
Be careful.

1044
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:22,770
Thanks so much, guys. I really will make it up to you guys—

1045
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,600
What is it? What is it?

1046
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,350
That.

1047
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,750
It's Jeong Eun.

1048
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:39,080
Hey, Kim Jeong Eun. What are you doing here? Why are you sleeping here?

1049
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,070
Hey, Kim Jeong Eun!

1050
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,100
Oh, Joon Ki!

1051
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,060
Why are you here like this?

1052
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,860
Hey, isn't this Soo Yeon's wedding dress?

1053
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,030
Oh, well, it was in the living room, so I tried it on.

1054
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,850
It's not even yours! Why would you wear it? Do you know how much it is?

1055
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,020
Wait. Why is the dress stuck there?

1056
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,990
This. This. Why did it rip?

1057
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,200
What happened? What happened to this?!

1058
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,360
I tried to take it off,

1059
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,420
but then my hair got stuck.

1060
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,560
If you were going to take it off, you should've done it properly! You fool!

1061
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,060
We're all screwed, just because of you!

1062
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:32,330
Oh, my $5,000! Oh, it's all gone!

1063
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,250
CEO Cha!

1064
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:38,190
The boss is here. What should we do?

1065
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,960
Let's go down. Quickly!

1066
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,830
Hey, where are you going? Hey! Get me out first!

1067
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,730
Where did they go? Oh, my gosh!

1068
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,160
What's that?

1069
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,240
Boss!

1070
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,650
Boss, you've arrived?

1071
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:59,200
Woo Sik. I mean, CEO Cha.

1072
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,250
Did you prepare the money you promised?

1073
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,590
Pardon? Well...

1074
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,030
Of course, you didn't.

1075
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,030
Well, there's nothing we can do.

1076
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,260
You may start.

1077
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,350
Alright.

1078
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,460
What? Start what? Why?

1079
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,130
Why, why, why?

1080
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,830
Boss, please let it go just this once!

1081
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:20,490
Please just wait one more week!

1082
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,870
Boss, please, I'll beg. Please give us one chance!

1083
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,370
Oh, let go! I can't let it slide any longer!

1084
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,690
Let go!

1085
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:32,380
You are being too harsh.

1086
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:36,310
Excuse me. You said you just needed the money by today, right?

1087
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,960
And?

1088
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,330
Guys, how much rent do you owe?

1089
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:44,930
Well, with everything combined, about $10,000.

1090
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,800
Really?

1091
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,160
Guys, get Minky.

1092
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,910
Here you go.

1093
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,260
The iguana is worth $10,000?

1094
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:04,360
Minky is a really special breed of the iguana. He's really rare.

1095
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,640
Oh, I see. Will you be okay?

1096
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,730
There's nothing I can do.

1097
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:16,060
Minky, I'll come back one day to get you.

1098
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,860
Eat well, okay?

1099
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,060
Now that we got the money for the boss, the world seems so beautiful, right?

1100
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:34,370
I know, right? I really thought we'd be kicked out this time.

1101
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,520
- Right, Woo Sik? 
 - What? Yeah.

1102
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:41,650
Anyway, you saved us today. Thank you.

1103
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:46,100
Oh, don't be. I told you I'd make it up to you guys.

1104
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,860
Looking at them, it makes me think of the old days. Right?

1105
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,750
That's true. We were always together like that back in the day.

1106
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,700
Do you remember, Soo Yeon?

1107
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,590
Of course! Those were the good days.

1108
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,530
  Put honey in it.

1109
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:07,930
Oh, right. I'm curious about something.

1110
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,690
What is it?

1111
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:13,330
Am I really your guys' first love?

1112
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,090
For all of you three?

1113
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh, it's cold.

1114
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,760
It's cold. I'll have to run.

1115
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,090
- I'm so tired. 
 - What's going on?

1116
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,740
- Why are you changing the subject? 
 - What's wrong?

1117
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,760
Am I not your first love? Huh?

1118
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,210
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

1119
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,930
It's so cold. Let's just run.

1120
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:31,090
Should we? Okay.

1121
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,200
- Alright. 
 - Why are you running?

1122
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,630
Hey, just run!

1123
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,590
♫  Hold my hand, follow me, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1124
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,700
Where are you going?

1125
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,090
♫  It makes me happy every day  ♫

1126
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:41,270
Let's go together!

1127
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,670
Hey, let go! Let go!

1128
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,290
Let go!

1129
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:50,340
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1130
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:57,660
♫  The excitement hidden in memories, again  ♫

1131
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:02,300
♫  It blooms in front of us like magic  ♫

1132
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,040
  Preview

1133
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,760
  Why do we have no guests?

1134
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,570
  We need to promote. It's best to do it at a broadcasting station.

1135
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,500
  Hey, Gi Bong, the producer from the broadcasting station came.

1136
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,230
  Is it true that you never feel the cold?

1137
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,830
  Go in here?

1138
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:18,420
  Why is this here? It can't be.

1139
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,460
  Right?

1140
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,240
  Hurry and leave!

1141
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,470
  How do I look? Do I look like a successful career woman?

1142
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,530
  I'm going to get a job.

1143
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:27,230
 Ah!!!!

1144
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,760
  How is it that you always get into trouble?

1145
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,320
  Should you be saying that to an injured person right now?

1146
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,010
  It's a promotional event?

1147
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,930
  Jeong Eun can't be fired because of me.

1148
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,710
  Soo Yeon might be fired because of me.

1149
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,470
 Two free ones!

1150
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,390
  That one! That one!

1151
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:43,270
  Excuse me! The angel and the flower are fighting!

1152
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,470
  What is it now?

1153
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,700
  You suffered so much because of me today.

1154
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,860

1155
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:59,490
♫  My thumping heart keeps looking for you  ♫
