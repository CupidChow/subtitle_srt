1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,020
Why? Did you do something wrong last night?

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,250
Well, I got drunk and told Soo Yeon that

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,380
I like her.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,240
You confessed? So what did Soo Yeon say?

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,020
I don't know, I can't remember. Joon Ki, what do I do?

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,760
Hey, Woo Sik?

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,370
About last night...

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,310
Soo Yeon about that.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,310
How did we get home?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,820
- I can't remember anything at all. 
 - What?

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,560
You don't remember anything? Since when?

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,960
Ah, well, I can't remember anything that happened after we left the chicken feet restaurant.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,860
Did I do anything wrong?

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,340
No! No! You didn't do anything wrong at all!

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,520
What a relief, I thought I did something wrong and was worried.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,190
Oh, I need to get myself together. This won't do.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,760
Oh, that's a relief.

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,160
How much longer are you going to be like this? Aren't you going to tell her how you feel?

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,720
Well... I don't have the courage yet.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,800
I'll just do it later. Later.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
  Do I Tell Her I Love Her Again?

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,370
Becca, what's wrong?

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,660
Gi Bong! Why are you so early? What about work?

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,620
I needed to get something, so I'm back.

25
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,700
Oh, really? Hey, hey. How's this?

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,910
Since this is a food truck you got for me, Mr. Investor, I've been washing it since this morning.

27
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,680
Isn't it so clean now?

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,580
Yeah.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,500
What the heck? Why do you look so lifeless?

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,380
Well, the boss said he'd fire me if I didn't sell a car this week.

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,620
I still haven't sold a car.

32
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,980
Oh, really? What will you do?

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,300
Gosh, is there no one who would buy one?

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,500
Becca, why are you being like this today? Are you upset with me about something?

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,680
What's with you?

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,060
Rebecca's engine isn't starting.

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,700
Maybe it's broken.

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,220
No! Rebecca is so strong!

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,780
Strong, my butt. The doors open by themselves. Nothing works properly.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, right. Joon Ki, don't be like that. Why don't you change your car?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,980
Hey, what? Rebecca's going to hear! Don't you know that Rebecca sulks for a long time if something upsets her?

42
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,560
Gosh, how could a car hear you? Don't you even feel bad for Rebecca?

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,800
It's been 20 years! I bet she wants to rest now.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,530
Really?

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,700
Of course. So,

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,450
a pretty nice car came out at our store. Have a look, yeah?

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,910
- Oh, Rebecca! Rebecca came back! 
 - What?

48
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,030
What's with the engine all of a sudden?

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,600
See? I told you Rebecca's really strong!

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,370
Hey, you're not going to get a new car then?

51
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,710
No, no! Why would I when she's doing just fine!

52
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,290
Oh, if, in the very long future, Rebecca crosses the rainbow bridge,

53
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,300
I'll definitely buy a car from you then. Okay?

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,450
Rebecca! Rebecca! Good job!

55
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,190
Ow, Brother! Be gentle, I said!

56
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,000
Why would you clean the car all day? You didn't have to work so hard.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,150
Gi Bong bought me that using his last paycheck. How could I?

58
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,100
I'm going to work so hard and repay Gi Bong for this. I will.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,350
Oh, you've become mature now. So, are the preparations for the business going well?

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,170
Of course. But, I need a permit for the location.

61
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,890
There's a lot of other things to prepare for.

62
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,530
I'm here!

63
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,300
Oh, Soo Yeon, you're here?

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Who's this?

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Oh, this is a producer that joined the show recently.

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,070
Oh, hello.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,680
- Hello.
 - What brings you here?

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,130
Oh, we were filming, but Soo Yeon got hurt.

69
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,200
Hurt? Where?

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,300
I hurt my ears while filming at the shooting range.

71
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,140
Your ears? Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

72
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,230
No, I just had some ringing for a while, but I'm fine now. Don't worry.

73
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,900
Thank you for dropping me off.

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,400
Oh, it's no problem. But, will you be able to film tomorrow?

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,590
We can just call in another reporter for the shoot.

76
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,830
Oh, no, I can do it! Really!

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,390
Alright. Take care of yourself, then. I'll come by tomorrow morning to pick you up, so I'll see you then.

78
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,900
- Yes. 
 - Alright.

79
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,190
Goodbye!

80
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm going to go in and rest.

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
Hey, give it to me. I'll carry it.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,550
Oh, I can carry it, though.

83
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,080
Just go in, Soo Yeon.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,070
Thanks, Woo Sik.

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,510
But, will you really be okay filming tomorrow? You should rest for a few days.

86
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,210
No, I can't. I finally have my own segment now, so if I mess up, it could be taken away.

87
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,600
And, I'm truly fine, so don't worry.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
Alright. You should rest then.

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Okay.

90
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey, let's talk.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,330
What is it?

92
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,710
Well, I don't feel so good about it.

93
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,440
About what?

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,670
That producer or whatever who just came over.

95
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,600
He took her all the way home. His gaze towards Soo Yeon, too.

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,460
I'm sure he's interested in her.

97
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,770
Hey, no way. You could do that if you're coworkers.

98
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,160
Hey. Coworkers are the most dangerous!

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,300
They're together all day, they eat together, and have company dinners together.

100
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,010
Coworkers become "dear," then, "honey."

101
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,810
Really?

102
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,980
So, that's why you should confess quickly.

103
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,100
Brother. Love is about timing. Don't you know?

104
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,360
Confess? No way.

105
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,600
Oh, Woo Sik? What is it?

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, I was just wondering if you were resting well. What are you up to?

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,270
I couldn't sleep, so I'm editing what I'm saying tomorrow in my report.

108
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,300
Oh, is that so?

109
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,090
Well, you know that producer from earlier? What kind of person is he?

110
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,670
The producer?

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,900
He's very nice and friendly.

112
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,350
He's handsome, too, so he's really popular among the female staff.

113
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,690
I see.

114
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,320
But, why are you asking about him?

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,100
Oh, it's nothing.

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,860
Hey, Soo Yeon. I have to tell you something.

117
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,190
Tell me something? Okay. What is it?

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,310
Oh, well. Um...

119
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,600
What is it? Tell me quick.

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,590
Alright. S-Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon, you know...

121
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,200
I... I...

122
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,130
Soo Yeon! What's wrong with you?

123
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,440
I can't hear. I can't hear anything.

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,660
What? What are you saying? Suddenly? Why?

125
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,150
Stop it, already. Why are you sighing so much since earlier?

126
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,110
I'm going to be fired if I don't sell a car this week. But, I didn't sell one today either.

127
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,300
Is that so? That's a huge problem. What will you do?

128
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,410
Gosh, I'm frustrated. I want some fresh air.

129
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,860
It's fine, it's fine! I don't know what's wrong,

130
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,300
but Rebecca does this.

131
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,560
Gosh, all these problems.

132
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,380
What do I have to do when I want to roll down the window?

133
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,790
Oh, if you're going to do that... Well, I don't know.

134
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,430
What?

135
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,800
But it's best to keep them closed. Many were victims of that window.

136
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,440
Let's turn on the AC, then. What the heck? Why is the radio coming on?

137
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,410
Oh, it's fine, it's fine. We can just listen to music on the way.

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,060
What do I have to press for the AC?

139
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,590
Geez, what is this now?

140
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,000
Hey, I can't see the front!

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,690
  Expert Repair Shop

142
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,400
Oh, gosh.

143
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,510
Oh, wow, this...

144
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,810
What is the matter? Is Rebecca not looking so good?

145
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,500
There's nothing good about this thing.

146
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,740
But, this car really worked?

147
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,440
Yes, this car was just fine until the accident.

148
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,400
Is that so? Well, from what I see, I think it's reached the end of its life.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
You should just get rid of it.

150
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,280
What? Get rid of her?

151
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,220
What are you saying right now? No, get me another mechanic.

152
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,900
I need the best mechanic here! Come out now!

153
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,300
What's all this?!

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,560
What is this noise in this sacred repair shop? What's the matter?

155
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,210
Well, he is insisting that we fix his car, even though it has reached the end of its life.

156
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,700
But, who are you?

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,660
Hello. I'm the director of this place, Jang Joon Hyeok.

158
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,800
He is the most skilled mechanic here.

159
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,740
Oh, really? Could you please save Rebecca?

160
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,420
Well, let me look at the condition of the car.

161
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

162
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,490
There's nothing good about this thing.

163
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,320
And there's a serious problem that has been spread all throughout the insides.

164
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,800
What did you do for the car to get in this condition?

165
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,130
Well, I thought it was an easy fix.

166
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,800
Are you saying you can't save Rebecca, sir?

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,900
I didn't say that. I, Jang Joon Hyeok,

168
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,350
do not know the word impossible.

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,810
I will personally do this repair.

170
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,510
Oh, thank you so much, sir!

171
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,940
Okay, we'll start the operation now.

172
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,430
Monkey wench!

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,470
Screwdriver!

174
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,980
Screwdriver.

175
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,240
Wrench!

176
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,750
Wrench.

177
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,730
Come to your senses, will you!

178
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,260
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,440
Damn it!

180
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,250
What are you doing? I can't see!

181
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,650
- Rebecca is crying! 
- Suction!

182
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,300
There's a problem. Various oils are dropping rapidly!

183
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,920
Stop fussing and put five liters of engine oil and ten liters of transmission fluid immediately!

184
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,710
The battery is dead, sir.

185
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,560
- Damn it. Let's revive the battery first. Get me jumper cables!
 - Yes, sir.

186
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,890
Do it!

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,420
Clear!

188
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,720
Oh, Rebecca! Rebecca!

189
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,870
Oh, Rebecca!

190
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,620
Clear!

191
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,920
Oh, Rebecca!

192
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,580
- Switch it to the maximum voltage! Clear!
 - Rebecca! Rebecca!

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,150
Is Soo Yeon okay? What did the doctors say?

194
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,510
Her eardrums are a bit damaged. She won't be able to hear for a while.

195
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,700
But it's only temporary. After some medication and rest, they said she'll get better.

196
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,050
That's a relief. Soo Yeon, go in and get some rest.

197
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,420
- What did you say?
 - Get some rest!

198
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,280
What?

199
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,820
You can go in, Soo Yeon.

200
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,880
Her poor ears. Oh, right. Did you confess to her?

201
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,540
- No. Just when I was about to, she stopped being able to hear.
 - Gosh.

202
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,300
How can you be so unlucky?

203
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,610
I don't know. Why just at that moment?

204
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,800
Hello.

205
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh, hello. What brings you here?

206
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,840
Soo Yeon texted me that she's having trouble with her hearing.

207
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,040
I was worried, so I thought I should stop by. Is she okay?

208
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,720
She just came back from the hospital. She's resting right now.

209
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,700
Oh, really? Is she in her room? Can I see her for a moment?

210
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,970
Well, the doctors said that it's important that she gets good rest. I'm afraid you can't see her.

211
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,740
I see. Then I'll have to come back tomorrow. Please give this porridge to her.

212
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,150
Oh, okay.

213
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,300
Well, goodbye.

214
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,190
Goodbye.

215
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,290
See? See? That man ran here as soon as he found out Soo Yeon was sick.

216
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,860
What if he tells Soo Yeon he likes her before you?

217
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,700
What am I supposed to do? I can't tell her how I feel if she can't even hear.

218
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,290
Why not? She can still see. You can text her.

219
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,940
I can't tell her how I feel through texts!

220
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,020
Is that a bad idea? You saw the movie, "Love Actually"?

221
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,800
In that movie, the man uses a sketchbook to confess his feelings for the woman.

222
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,090
I thought it was so romantic.

223
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,370
Forget it! A sketchbook? Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,710
 Soo Yeon, I have something to tell you.

225
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,130
Why can't I turn it over? Are they stuck together?

226
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,080
Give me a second.

227
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,030
 Soo Yeon, I have something to tell you.

228
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,370
 Actually, I was hesitating a lot.

229
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,430
Soo Yeon.

230
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,660
Soo Yeon!

231
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,370
Soo Yeon, are you okay?

232
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,520
What did the doctor say?

233
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,700
Her corneas are scratched a little. If she uses eyes drops and rests well for a few days, she'll be fine.

234
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,720
I see. Soo Yeon, go inside and rest well!

235
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,100
She can't either see or hear now. Jeong Eun, take her inside.

236
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,660
Sure.

237
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,370
Who is it? Who are you?

238
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,990
- It's fine. It's fine.
 - It's me, Jeong Eun.

239
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,330
- It's me.
 - Jeong Eun?

240
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,400
I can't believe this happened.

241
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,280
When you tried to ask her out verbally, she lost her hearing. When you tried in writing, her eyes got hurt.

242
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,630
Isn't this the heavens just blocking your confession?

243
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,420
Shut it.

244
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,520
But, Are you going to give up like this?

245
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,500
You want me to try again? She can't either hear or see. How can I tell her how I feel?

246
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,480
You could try writing on her palm. Like this.

247
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,500
Are you crazy, Noona? Who tells someone they like them through their hands?

248
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,300
Okay. Don't do it then. Even if you lose Soo Yeon to that producer,

249
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,790
and come crying out to me, I won't bat an eye. Don't blame me then, okay?

250
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,830
Forget it! Do you think I'm crazy enough to confess like that? I won't do it!

251
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,900
Soo Yeon.

252
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,130
No. No. This is not okay. Darn it!

253
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,880
They're finished!

254
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,950
Sir, are you all done with the repair? How is Rebecca?

255
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,600
We experienced some difficulties, but the repair was successful.

256
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,630
Try starting the car.

257
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,400
Yes, sir!

258
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,970
The car won't start, sir.

259
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,480
- It won't?
- What?

260
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,040
I thought it would. I guess it won't.

261
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,690
What...

262
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,950
What are you talking about?

263
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,910
You said you were the best mechanic here.

264
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm a mechanic, not a deity.

265
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,100
As you have seen, this car cannot be saved even by the most modern car repair technologies.

266
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,000
You'll have to let it go.

267
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,650
What? "Let it go"?

268
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,940
"Let it go"? Nonsense.

269
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,850
No. There's no way. I can't.

270
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:34,500
Joon Ki, calm down. You have no choice. You have to let Rebecca go.

271
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:47,800
- I'm... not ready to let Rebecca go yet.
 - You have to accept reality, you punk! This can't bring her back.

272
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,740
By the way, do you remember you promised me,

273
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,870
you'd buy a car from me when Rebecca crossed the rainbow bridge?

274
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,000
Would you like to take a look at our catalog first?

275
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,970
Here.

276
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,940
Rebecca, is that you? Are you there?

277
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,580
Gi Bong, did you hear that? Rebecca just made a noise.

278
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,490
No, I didn't. You must be imagining it.

279
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,090
Am I?

280
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,500
Here.

281
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,100
Rebecca, is that you? Are you back alive?!

282
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,930
No way.

283
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,370
This is a miracle!

284
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,790
Rebecca, you scared me. Don't joke around.

285
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,360
Rebecca, let's stay together forever.

286
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,500
Gi Bong, now that our Rebecca has revived, why don't we have some ramen with eggs and ham and everything?

287
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,510
Forget it! I don't want anything to eat, so go ahead.

288
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,910
Why are you being so irritable?

289
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,990
Rebecca, get some rest. See you tomorrow.

290
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,290
This is driving me nuts. I have only two days left. Who am I going to sell a car to?

291
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,640
But, is Rebecca a phoenix or something? Why does she keep reviving?

292
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,800
Hold on.

293
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,320
Right. If I pull out the spark plug, the car won't start ever again.

294
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,600
I'm sorry, Rebecca. But I'm doing this for your sake.

295
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,900
This is getting too hard for you too, isn't it? So, don't hold a grudge against me, okay?

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,410
Gosh, what's that noise?

297
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,780
What is this?

298
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,960
What is this?

299
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,090
It's me, Rebecca.

300
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,220
Rebecca? What are you doing here?

301
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,700
Do you know how much Joon Ki loved me?

302
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,240
Why did you do that to me? Why?

303
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,490
I'm sorry. But it was getting too hard for you too.

304
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,500
What I did was for your sake, so—

305
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,160
You're lying! It was not for my sake but your own.

306
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,290
You did that so you could sell a car so that you could keep your job. Isn't that right?

307
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,000
Th-That...

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,580
I'll never forgive you. I'll destroy you!

309
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,670
Give me back my spark plug.

310
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,000
Give me back my spark plug.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,670
Give me back my spark plug!

312
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,210
What? What's wrong?

313
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,600
Nothing.

314
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,060
Ta-da! Guys, try some of this.

315
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,350
What is up with this spaghetti? What is this, Noona?

316
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,300
It's a new menu for Yuri's Kitchen 31 food truck.

317
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,050
This is "Cherry Jubileegetti," and this is "Gone with the Wind Spaghetti."

318
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,390
What do you think? Don't they look tasty? Go on and try them.

319
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,100
What? Oh, okay.

320
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,630
It looked really horrible, but it's really tasty.

321
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,410
See? See? I knew I haven't lost my touch.

322
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,730
What about Soo Yeon?

323
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,640
She doesn't have an appetite. She's been busy watching something on her laptop since this morning.

324
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,300
What is she watching?

325
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,780
Hold on. Does that mean her eyes are okay?

326
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,200
Yes, she can see clearly now.

327
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,150
Really? That's great.

328
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,420
Hey, brother. Brother! How could you go without trying these?

329
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,970
Gi Bong, can you try this for him instead?

330
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm sorry, but I really don't have an appetite right now.

331
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,700
What? You don't have an appetite? That's never happened to you before.

332
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,130
Well, I had nightmares all night and couldn't sleep.

333
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,920
 Rebecca!

334
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,160
What was that? What was that sound? Wasn't that Joon Ki's voice?

335
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,800
What's wrong with him? Is something wrong?

336
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,900
Hey. What's the matter with you?

337
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,470
Something's wrong with Rebecca. I had no problem starting her engine till yesterday,

338
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,800
but she suddenly won't start. This feels bad. I better call Master Jang Joon Hyuk from Expert Car Repair.

339
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,020
Hey, Soo Yeon.

340
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,150
- Soo Yeon.
 - You scared me!

341
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,620
Woo Sik. What is it?

342
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,200
Soo Yeon. Can you lower your voice a little bit? Your voice.

343
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,750
What?

344
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,510
My voice is too loud? I got it!

345
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,620
Does this sound okay?

346
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,220
No, it's still too loud. Way too loud.

347
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,600
Can you lower it a little bit more?

348
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,830
Does this sound okay?

349
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,920
Yes. That sounds perfect.

350
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,430
What were you just watching?

351
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,900
I was monitoring another program. The producer sent me a text earlier,

352
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,060
and said he'll replace me with a different reporter until I'm better.

353
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,990
I'm worried my spot might get taken away from me, so I want to at least do something.

354
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,800
But I can't understand a word because of my ears.

355
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,230
But, what is it? Do you have something you want to ask?

356
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,640
No, it's nothing. You should keep watching. Go on.

357
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,140
What am I thinking? She's going through enough already.

358
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,430
Isn't there any way I can help her?

359
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,680
 Spray Cleaner, Car Polish, Ethanol Washer Fluid

360
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,250
Rebecca, this is your favorite fuel additive.

361
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,780
I brought your favorite fuel additive.

362
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,100
Why can't you drink it? Why?

363
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,950
Joon Ki, calm down.

364
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,590
Becca is gone, but you should at least continue to live.

365
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,070
I know. I know that, but...

366
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,990
The fact that I can't see Becca ever again...

367
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,550
I can't believe it.

368
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,400
Becca,

369
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,050
we've gone through so much together.

370
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,640
Right?

371
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,260
  - What's with that car? 
 - I'm going to be filming a drama soon.

372
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,700
  So, I got it!

373
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,240
  Oh, yeah, nice.

374
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,850
  Becca, you're mine.

375
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,140
  Is it good?

376
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,100
Becca! Becca!

377
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,130
Joon Ki, every meeting also has a farewell.

378
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:06,730
A farewell also means a new meeting, too. So...

379
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,920
I chose a really nice car.

380
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,720
Want to take a look?

381
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,470
Wait. I need to,

382
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,120
say goodbye to Becca for the last time.

383
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,380
All this time, I put you through so much.

384
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm sorry. In your next life,

385
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,370
I hope you meet a better owner, and I hope he tunes you up often

386
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,100
and feeds you a lot of premium gasoline. I hope you are happy.

387
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,650
Becca? Becca, is it you?

388
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,030
Becca, is that you?

389
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,480
Becca! Gi Bong!

390
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,200
Becca's alive! Becca is back!

391
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,240
  What? Does this make sense? I definitely disconnected the spark plug, though!

392
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,940
Becca, you're alive?!

393
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,740
Becca is responding. Becca!

394
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,900
Becca is responding!

395
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,480
Becca! Becca! Becca.

396
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,580
No way. No way!

397
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,490
Why is he sleeping here?

398
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,950
Brother, wake up. Brother!

399
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,840
Oh, what?

400
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,350
I fell asleep.

401
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,600
But...  What have you been doing all night?

402
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,960
Oh, well, I had something to do.

403
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,730
What about Soo Yeon?

404
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,290
Oh, she went to the broadcasting station a while ago.

405
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,350
What? Broadcasting station? In that state?

406
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,100
She's okay now. She can hear now.

407
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,560
Already? No way.

408
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,440
Why'd she go to film in her state?

409
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,780
Soo Yeon!

410
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,490
Hey, Han Soo Yeon.

411
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,790
Oh, Woo Sik! Why are you here?

412
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:49,500
Huh? Just... Are you really okay? Can you film?

413
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,690
Yeah, I'm better. My ears are okay now.

414
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,430
Let's go check with the hospital if you're really okay.

415
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,350
No, I'm fine. I already told the producer that I'm on my way to the shoot, so I have no time.

416
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll be off.

417
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,040
Soo Yeon!

418
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,660
Soo Yeon, are you okay? Soo Yeon!

419
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,150
I'm fine.

420
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,710
How are you fine?! Why are you being so stubborn?

421
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm sorry.

422
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,000
Forget it, you can't go film today. Let's go to the hospital.

423
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,690
Wait, I need to go to the shoot! I'm going to get my spot taken!

424
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,680
But, how can you go in this condition? Stop being stubborn!

425
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,800
Let go! I said I'm fine!

426
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,010
I said I'm fine, so why are you being like this? Who are you to do this?!

427
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,650
I like you! That's why I keep caring about you and worrying about you.

428
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,230
What did you say?

429
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,480
What do you mean?

430
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,730
She's alive.

431
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,950
What's wrong with him?

432
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:21,120
I'm not sure. He's been like that since earlier. Did he see a ghost or something?

433
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,840
What? What's with you?

434
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,850
I... I  did it. I did it.

435
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,050
Did what?

436
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,800
I confessed to Soo Yeon.

437
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,030
Really?

438
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,960
You confessed? What? You like her?

439
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,300
Yeah, it's something like that. So, what did she say?

440
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,330
I don't know. I was so shocked that I just ran away.

441
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,540
What? You confessed and ran away?

442
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,300
My mind went blank and I just... What do I do?

443
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,450
You're here, Soo Yeon?

444
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,870
Woo Sik, can we talk?

445
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,090
Huh? Y-Yeah.

446
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm sorry for being stubborn earlier.

447
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,890
I guess I was getting anxious about work, so I was being stubborn.

448
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, no. It's fine.

449
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,890
I'm greedy since this is something I really want to do for the first time in my life.

450
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,100
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

451
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,680
Woo Sik, you know

452
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,070
I really like what I'm doing now. I love it,

453
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,560
So, I really want to work hard and succeed.

454
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,080
Of course, you should.

455
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,340
So, that's why

456
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,170
I'm not in a place to date someone right now.

457
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,150
You know what I'm saying, right?

458
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,920
Woo Sik, we're still good friends, right?

459
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,660
Yeah. We're friends.

460
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,630
Are you really okay?

461
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah! Soo Yeon, don't worry about me. I'm really okay.

462
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
So, I'll be going first.

463
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,590
Brother. What did Soo Yeon say?

464
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,990
I was cooly rejected.

465
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Really? Brother, are you okay?

466
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,310
Nothing I can do about it. It's how she feels.

467
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,500
It's fine. I'm fine.

468
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,800
  In Between Love And Friendship

469
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,490
Hey, you look nice. Are you going somewhere?

470
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,560
I have a part-time job at a live cafe today.

471
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,000
I'll be off.

472
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,700
Wait.

473
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,360
You're going like this?

474
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,020
Yeah, you said it's nice. What's wrong?

475
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,420
Gosh, I'm out of it.

476
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
- I'll be going. 
 - Hey!

477
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,580
Not this.

478
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,050
You... aren't wearing any pants!

479
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,030
Oh, I see. What's with me?

480
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,220
What will we do with him?

481
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,670
I'm off to work.

482
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,350
You're working?

483
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,240
You should just rest today. You must be feeling a bit upset.

484
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,420
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

485
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,330
I'll be going.

486
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,830
Woo Sik, you're going to work?

487
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,570
Yeah.

488
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,930
You?

489
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,460
I have to buy something. Should we go out together?

490
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm a bit late, so I'll go first.

491
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,890
Gosh, look at that mood.

492
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,480
It's going to be so uncomfortable from now on.

493
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,910
Right? Gosh, will he be okay?

494
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,050
Okay? He almost left the house without pants on!

495
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,590
He had his boxers on and was slinging his guitar!

496
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,370
There's no way that he's okay.

497
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,630
It's not like he liked Soo Yeon just a little.

498
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,100
Yeah, right? I'm worried.

499
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,780
How about you guys take Woo Sik and go out for some air?

500
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,290
Should I? I have a day off tomorrow, so sure.

501
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,630
I have to film tomorrow, so I can't.

502
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,270
Nice Man, Nice Man! This one.

503
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,490
Oh, really? I'll take him by myself then.

504
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,190
You?

505
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,090
I can't trust you.

506
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,820
What? Are you looking down on me?

507
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,550
Don't worry. I'll make him feel completely better.

508
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,310
Just trust me. Me.

509
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,340
It's so nice out.

510
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,170
Yeah, it is.

511
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,500
We came all the way here. How about you smile?

512
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,160
Let's have a lot of fun today and forget all the bad stuff.

513
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,130
Alright.

514
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,530
Alright, let's set up the tent. Hey!

515
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,960
You stay still. I'll do it all.

516
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,160
Hold on.

517
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,130
Hello? Yes, Boss?

518
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,030
What? Okay.

519
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,040
What's wrong? Who called?

520
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,160
I was fired. He said not to come in.

521
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,340
Really?

522
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,930
It makes sense.

523
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:26,360
I didn't sell a single car all month. I'd fire me, too.

524
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,160
It was such a hard job to get, though.

525
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,540
Hey, we're both not in the mood for camping. Should we go back?

526
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,420
What are you saying? We came here to make you feel better.

527
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,230
Don't worry about me. Let's set up the tent.

528
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,160
Oh, it's all done.

529
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,800
Hey, Gi Bong. The tent is ready.

530
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,720
Oh, really? Good work.

531
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,240
No, but, are you okay?

532
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,890
You want to go in and rest a little?

533
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,170
What are you saying? We came here to make you feel better. I can't do that.

534
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,190
I'll make you a nice kimchi stew, so just wait.

535
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,380
Where's the stove?

536
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,090
Gah.

537
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,640
What is it? What is it this time?

538
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,100
I thought it was the gas stove.

539
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,210
It's a toolbox.

540
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,670
It looks the same, so I thought it was the gas stove.

541
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,190
Gosh, a person like me should just die.

542
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,560
Hey, it's fine!

543
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,580
We can cook the stew over a campfire.

544
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,810
Is that so?

545
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,630
Then, I'll take the kimchi out.

546
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,670
What is it again?

547
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,560
What? What's wrong?

548
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,520
It's red pepper paste.

549
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,030
Gosh, it was red so I thought it was kimchi.

550
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,970
A person like me should just die.

551
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,320
Hey, it's fine!

552
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,620
If we mix it with rice, it'll be delicious.

553
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,130
- Is that so? 
 - Yeah, it's fine.

554
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,650
Then, I'll make the rice right now.

555
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,950
Where'd the rice go?

556
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,120
What is it this time?!

557
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,430
It's thick salt! Thick salt!

558
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,270
It was white, so I thought it was rice.

559
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,160
Of course, I would think that.

560
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,170
A person like me should just die.

561
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,870
I wonder if Gi Bong's doing well.

562
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,180
It makes me nervous.

563
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,220
Yeah.

564
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,280
Hey, did you memorize this script?

565
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,430
Don't worry. I did.

566
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,590
What is it? You're going to appear on TV with Joon Ki?

567
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,290
Yeah. It's Nice Man's assistant, Dumpling Lady.

568
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,280
Dumpling Lady?

569
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,250
I introduced her to the director, and he said she looked perfect for a dumpling lady and she got cast right away.

570
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,630
Her face looks like a dumpling!

571
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,390
Are you going to be a dumpling?

572
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,360
I told you not to call me dumpling!

573
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,130
Ow, you hit me in the wrong spot! Ouch!

574
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,630
Joon Ki, are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

575
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,850
Oh, my back. My back!

576
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,470
Your back? Where?

577
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,090
Here?

578
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,990
Again! You always fall for it and you fell for it again!

579
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,950
Joon Ki, you're dead today.

580
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,960
Ow, save me! The dumpling is attacking me!

581
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,150
You terrible, violent dumpling!

582
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,590
You deserve it.

583
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,850
How could you play that kind of prank on a girl?

584
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,780
Hold on. What?!

585
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,530
A girl, you say? Are there any other girls here other than you?

586
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,550
What?! Are you done talking?!

587
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,900
Gosh, she's so mad again.

588
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,640
Why do you keep doing that?

589
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,730
You can't go a day without getting beaten?

590
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,990
Yeah. I find it the funniest thing in the world to tease her.

591
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,460
Yeah, alright.

592
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,210
He doesn't see me as a girl?

593
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,660
Hey, Joon Ki!

594
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,450
Ta-da! How do I look?

595
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,740
Ugly as always!

596
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,560
No, I wore a dress for the first time in a while. How is it?

597
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,870
Oh, a dress? You look like an ugly person wearing a dress.

598
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,650
What?!

599
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,860
I have earrings on, too.

600
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,230
Oh, earrings? You look like an ugly person wearing a dress with earrings on.

601
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,950
I worked hard on my makeup too.

602
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,680
You look like an ugly person wearing a dress with makeup and earrings on.

603
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,060
What?! You little...

604
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,150
 No. I need to hold it back.

605
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,380
What? Why aren't you hitting me? Hurry and finish it!

606
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,980
Why would I hit you? You were just teasing me.

607
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,290
I wasn't teasing.

608
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,330
I was really sincere about it.

609
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,610
Why are you wearing a dress, though?

610
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,750
Just because. I want to start dressing well.

611
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,670
Blegh!

612
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,850
But, what's this?

613
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,960
Oh, this is a magic—

614
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,820
Do you want to see a magic trick?

615
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,980
Really? Yeah!

616
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,340
Okay, good thinking. Let me show you.

617
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,870
So, this is a trick where the coin goes inside the bottle.

618
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:59,610
Look. It isn't going in, right? But, it will.

619
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,420
Look.

620
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,920
Abracadabra!

621
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,240
It's not working.

622
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,590
Oh, I forgot I have to put nose grease on.

623
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,620
Get some nose grease... wait.

624
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,970
Cheek grease, forehead grease, grease, grease, grease.

625
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,450
Okay, the grease is all there.

626
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,520
Okay, let's see.

627
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,320
Wait, no. I'm not doing it. I don't want to. I'm not feeling it.

628
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,690
What? I'm just going to read the script then.

629
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,360
Alright. Bye.

630
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,300
Gosh, she fell for it again!

631
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,170
That fool. Fool!

632
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,530
What is this?!

633
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,960
Joon Ki! You!

634
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,180
You prankster.

635
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,560
I'm just going to wash up.

636
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,930
What? Why's she like that? Is she sick somewhere?

637
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,460
Joon Ki! Joon Ki!

638
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,900
What is it?

639
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,180
Ah, well, the male guests keep staring at me.

640
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,650
They sure know how to recognize a pretty face.

641
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,500
Really? Oh, yeah.

642
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,670
Of course, your face isn't average!

643
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,320
Oh, you're embarrassing me!

644
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,260
Oh, and, show me when you perfect the magic trick, okay?

645
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,050
Of course, I will.

646
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,260
I'm going to go get ready for filming now.

647
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,270
Great.

648
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,810
Gosh, what's with everyone? Am I just looking great today?

649
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,760
Well, beauty is such a pain! Truly!

650
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,990
Oh, I'm so hungry.

651
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,100
Gi Bong. Cheer up!

652
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,600
I want to, but I can't.

653
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,980
Is that so? Then, let's just go back.

654
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,360
What? Go back? We came here to make you feel better.

655
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,760
Alright. Let's just forget it all and play a board game.

656
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,950
I even bought a board game for us to play.

657
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,970
This is the most famous one.

658
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,650
Do you know it?

659
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,840
Yeah, I do. I played it as a kid a lot.

660
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,390
Can you teach me how to play it? I've never played it.

661
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,400
It's simple. You just roll the dice and move as much as you've rolled.

662
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,430
You have to pay when you land on the property that I bought.

663
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,060
I have to pay? Why?

664
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,560
It's because you're on the land that I bought. It's like a toll.

665
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,230
Oh, okay. Toll.

666
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,590
But, what is this?

667
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,590
Those are buildings.

668
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,460
You can put a villa, hotel, or building on your property.

669
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,130
A hotel is the most expensive, then it's building—

670
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,800
Wait, wait. Why is the hotel the most expensive?

671
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,380
- Aren't buildings more expensive? 
 - What?

672
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,760
Oh, of course, it's like that in real life.

673
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,830
But this game's rules are like that.

674
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:01,370
Why must you stop for three rounds if you land on a desert island?

675
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,790
Does there have to be a reason?!

676
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,700
It's just the rule!

677
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,930
How about if I buy the deserted island?

678
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,360
You can't buy it! How many times do I have to tell you?

679
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,390
Why not? A deserted island is land too!

680
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,650
How do you know?!

681
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,690
It's just the rule! That's how it was since this game was made!

682
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,270
Gosh, it's so frustrating. Hey, let's just not play!

683
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,600
Why are you getting mad?

684
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,840
How can I not?!

685
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,830
I've been explaining the rules for an hour, but you don't understand!

686
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,030
You're driving me crazy!

687
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,830
I'm sorry. Of course, I'm like that.

688
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,220
I packed the toolbox instead of a gas stove, and can't even understand the rules of the game.

689
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,860
Of course, I was fired from work.

690
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,220
It's finally erased.

691
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,340
Lee Joon Ki, just wait 'till I catch you!

692
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,080
How dare he draw on my face?

693
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,220
I'm so embarrassed. Gosh!

694
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,220
I'm here!

695
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,800
Oh, you're here? Did you eat?

696
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,390
No, I don't have an appetite.

697
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,010
I'm going to go in and rest.

698
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,910
Oh, wait. Soo Yeon.

699
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,130
What is it?

700
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:18,050
Well. I heard that you rejected Woo Sik.

701
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,640
What?

702
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,820
Yes.

703
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,870
Why? Is Woo Sik not a good guy?

704
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,860
Even though he's not very capable, he's a really nice guy.

705
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,730
I know that Woo Sik is nice. He's a good person.

706
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,030
but I feel like I don't have the time for that right now.

707
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:46,420
It hasn't been long since I started working, and there's still my dad.

708
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,630
You know.

709
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,370
Yeah. That's true.

710
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,030
Alright, Soo Yeon. Don't pay much attention to my words, okay?

711
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,440
Alright.

712
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,000
I'm going to go in.

713
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,200
I understand Soo Yeon's feelings,

714
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,990
but I feel so bad for my brother. What do I do?

715
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,530
Gi Bong, I said I'm sorry about earlier.

716
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,620
Just let it go, yeah?

717
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,440
No. I'm so stupid. That's the problem.

718
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,510
Well, neither of us are in the mood for this. Let's just go home.

719
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:45,380
What are you saying? We came here to make you feel better. How can we go?

720
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,230
Let's just have a beer.

721
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,410
Here.

722
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,160
Alright. Let's drink, feel better, and have some fun!

723
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,380
Sounds great.

724
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,670
Cheers!

725
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,410
Cheers!

726
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,430
Drinking is only fun with a lot of people.

727
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,610
What? Are you saying you want to join those girls?

728
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:38,390
No. What kind of girl would like to drink with an unemployed guy?

729
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:44,820
I still want to drink, but it's not that fun if it's just the two of us.

730
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,310
Fine! I'll go talk to them.

731
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:53,920
So, will you please stop sighing? Aigoo!

732
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,800
Cheers!

733
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,900
We're friends, and this guy got dumped a few days ago.

734
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,950
So, I took him out here to cheer him up.

735
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,110
I see. You're such a good friend.

736
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,450
Come on, it's nothing.

737
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:15,170
Any friend would do the same.

738
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,430
But isn't it kind of dull to just drink like this?

739
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,930
Do you want to play a game? How about the "Image Game"?

740
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,000
Sounds good. I know that game too.

741
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,700
Then I'll go first.

742
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,920
Alright. Everyone, hold a chopstick.

743
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,900
Woo Sik, here. Hold your chopstick.

744
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,700
Among us, who do you think is the nicest person?

745
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,090
One, two, three!

746
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,220
What? Me?

747
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,280
Do I really look that nice?

748
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,520
Well, you just look like a really nice guy.

749
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,950
Anyway, you got picked, so have a drink.

750
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,710
Alright, then.

751
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,710
Woo Sik is quite nice too.

752
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,440
It's my turn now.

753
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,470
Among us, who do you think is the funniest person?

754
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,840
One, two, three.

755
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,850
What? Is it me again?

756
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:14,020
My gosh. Woo Sik is quite funny too.

757
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,440
I'll drink then.

758
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,000
Since I'm a funny guy.

759
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:27,180
Is it my turn now? What should I ask?

760
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:32,110
Right. Among us, who do you think is your ideal type?

761
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:33,760
Hey, how could you ask such a question?

762
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,090
What? It's fun!

763
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:39,410
Alright. One, two, three!

764
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,520
I'm feeling tired, so I'll go and rest.

765
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,120
Gi Bong, what's wrong? Hey, Gi Bong!

766
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,900
Gi Bong!

767
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,960
What's the matter with him all of a sudden?

768
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,460
Here we go, Nice Man!

769
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,690
Nice Man!

770
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:17,070
No, no. Nice kids should not eat junk food.

771
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,690
No, no.

772
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,770
Why not?

773
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,790
Dumpling Lady will come out and explain that to you in detail.

774
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,350
Shall we call her out?

775
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:29,640
- Dumpling Lady!
 - Dumpling Lady!

776
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,450
Here we go, Dumpling Lady!

777
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:36,520
Da Yong, junk food includes many ingredients that are harmful to your body.

778
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,940
You may get a stomach ache

779
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,910
and even suffer from a bad disease.

780
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,990
That's why all of you should never eat junk food.

781
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,720
Okay, Nice Man.

782
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,550
We'll see you next time!

783
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,780
- Here we go, Nice Man!
 - Here we go, Dumpling Lady!

784
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,930
Cut. Good job.

785
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,260
Great job, everyone.

786
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,050
- Thank you, everyone.
 - Thank you.

787
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,770
Thank you.

788
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,060
Joon Ki, how was I today? Did I do well?

789
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,160
You did well.

790
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,970
You look so cute wearing a costume like this.

791
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,870
What are you saying all of a sudden?

792
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,080
You just look so adorable.

793
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,010
Come here. Ah, you're so cute!

794
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,650
You're so cute. Cute.

795
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,420
Cute, cute.

796
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,170
So cute!

797
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,150
What is this? Joon Ki, I can't see.

798
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,560
I can't see a thing.

799
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,760
I got you again. You're so stupid.

800
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,320
I can't see. Hey.

801
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,790
I got you again.

802
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,150
Jeong Eun! Hey!

803
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,250
Jeong Eun, I'm sorry.

804
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,860
Jeong Eun. I know I went a bit overboard.

805
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,190
Forget it.

806
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,550
Jeong Eun. Are you okay?

807
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,930
Did you twist your ankle?

808
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,530
You even scratched up your heels.

809
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,550
Why did you wear heels all of a sudden?

810
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:02,350
I just wanted to wear them. Why? Can I not wear heels?

811
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,880
Why are you getting angry?

812
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,910
Get up. Can you get up?

813
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,690
There's no other way.

814
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:16,980
Come on. I'll carry you on my back.

815
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,370
What? Forget it.

816
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,290
How will you walk like that? Come on, hurry.

817
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,290
Come on!

818
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,660
I'm telling you, I'm okay.

819
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,530
You're so heavy! What's wrong with gravity?!

820
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,890
- You're heavy as a rock. How much do you weigh? 
- Hey.

821
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,090
Don't you know it's rude to ask a girl that?

822
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,990
Let me tell you one more time? Where the heck is a girl right now?!

823
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,340
I'm a girl too.

824
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,320
- You really don't see me as a girl?
 - No.

825
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,890
Fine then. Let me ask you one thing.

826
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,500
If you and I are stranded on a deserted island,

827
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,010
and we're the only ones left, what will you do?

828
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:01,230
What? What kind of example is that?

829
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:09,090
Then, I'll find myself a pretty sea turtle and have a boy turtle and a girl turtle.

830
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,600
I'll have one of each

831
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,630
and live happily ever after.

832
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,900
What? Then what if all the sea turtles go extinct?

833
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,730
You and I are the only ones left. Then what will you do?

834
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,540
What is that?

835
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:28,570
Aigoo, then that deserted island will become deserted again.

836
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,620
What? Does that mean you don't even see me as a sea turtle?!

837
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,760
You don't see me as a guy either.

838
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,920
You and me, we're just friends.

839
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,930
Just friends, like Woo Sik and Gi Bong.

840
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,800
Why are you suddenly asking that?

841
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,800
I just asked. Why?

842
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,590
- Jeong Eun.
 - What is it this time?

843
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,840
I'm really happy that you're my friend.

844
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,680
We can joke around and practice acting together. We can rely on each other during hard times.

845
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,190
So, don't get upset when I joke around and tease you.

846
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:06,080
Just stay by my side forever.

847
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,690
Okay, friend?

848
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,790
Sure. We're friends.

849
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,560
Friends.

850
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,830
Let's go eat some ramen.

851
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,000
Can you please stop?

852
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,670
What's wrong with you? It's not even a big deal.

853
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,100
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable over nothing.

854
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,020
Well, I brought a toolbox instead of a gas stove,

855
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:45,610
and didn't even understand the game rules. I'm just a loser who isn't popular among women either.

856
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,750
No wonder I was fired from work.

857
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,410
Hey, you can just find another job.

858
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,540
That's not as easy as it sounds.

859
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,700
Well, how would you know how I feel?

860
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,890
I wouldn't be like this if I a girl merely dumped me, like you.

861
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,410
- What?
 - You were just dumped by a girl.

862
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,660
You made everyone worry and made me come here with you.

863
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,680
What? You're the one who practically dragged me here when I didn't want to.

864
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,070
Oh, so this is my fault? Now you're showing your true colors.

865
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,690
I'm sorry for dragging you to the camping site.

866
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:18,880
All I wanted to do was to cheer you up. How could you repay my kindness like this, you jerk?

867
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,050
That's why Soo Yeon dumped you.

868
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,930
What did you say? Say that again.

869
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:27,280
I won't. I have so much to say, but I won't. I'll just hold it in.

870
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,500
Forget it. You're so narrow-minded.

871
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,920
That's why you were fired from work.

872
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,410
What? You jerk.

873
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,880
Did you just hit me?

874
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
Yes, I did. I hit you! What are you going to do? Huh?

875
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,540
You little punk.

876
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,810
My nose...

877
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,490
My nose is bleeding!

878
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:54,160
- You're dead. Come here. Come here!
 - Hey, hey. Oh!

879
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:57,960
Come here!

880
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,800
Come here!

881
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,680
How dare you hit my face?

882
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,720
Come here.

883
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,740
Hey, time out. Let's take a break.

884
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:27,220
Okay. You're dead after we take a short break.

885
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,650
That's what I wanted to say.

886
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,420
If I tried harder, you wouldn't even be alive. Do you know that?

887
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,970
I didn't even use a quarter of my strength.

888
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,380
I didn't even use one-sixteenth of my strength.

889
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,710
What? Why are you laughing?

890
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:44,800
It's just funny. What are we doing here?

891
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,310
I know.

892
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:53,580
Still, I feel much better after we threw some punches at each other like this.

893
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,750
It feels kind of satisfying too.

894
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,200
Really? Do you feel better now?

895
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,190
What's there to feel better about?

896
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,620
Still, since I told her how I feel this time, I don't have regrets.

897
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,640
Good. Forget about her now, you punk.

898
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:16,040
Trust me. You'll find a girl much prettier and nicer than Soo Yeon.

899
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,130
Thanks.

900
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,020
You'll get a job at a company much better than the previous one too.

901
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,230
Do you really think so?

902
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,370
If not, whatever.

903
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:38,750
Sure. My day will come someday.

904
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,280
The sky is so pretty.

905
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,140
It is.

906
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:51,220
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

907
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,980
♫  Oh what in the world is happening to me  ♫

908
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,760
I told you, I'm sorry.

909
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,650
How dare you smear my face and expect to live?

910
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,660
Why are you so cold-hearted?

911
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,530
Can't you just laugh it off?

912
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,510
Shut up! Keep your hands up.

913
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,530
♫  As if Murphy's Law was speaking to me  ♫

914
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,000
Looks good.

915
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,830
Don't rub it in.

916
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,040
Just look at yourself. You said you were going to dress up from now on.

917
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,860
I was going to, but it just wasn't me. Hey.

918
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,890
Keep your hands up!

919
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,630
Are you really going to do this to me? How childish. I'm your friend.

920
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:32,340
That's why I'm doing this to you. Stick your arms to your ears!

921
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,200
We're back.

922
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,540
Did you have fun?

923
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,540
What's wrong with your faces?

924
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,930
Something came up.

925
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,360
Are you feeling better?

926
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,230
I feel much better, thanks to Gi Bong.

927
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,820
I forgot I have to go.

928
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,520
Go where?

929
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,040
I got a call from the live cafe to fill in for someone.

930
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,140
What's the point in playing around? I should earn every penny I can.

931
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,830
I'll go get ready.

932
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,610
What is this? I guess he feels much better.

933
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,390
What happened?

934
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,380
I have my ways.

935
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,000
I told you to trust me.

936
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,710
You're pretty great, Gi Bong.

937
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,230
Want to see a magic trick as a reward?

938
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,920
A magic trick? Sure.

939
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,960
What is it?

940
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,680
What are you doing here?

941
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,180
Woo Sik, when did you come back home?

942
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,950
Just now. But, why are you doing it alone? You should have called for help.

943
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:36,870
Move over, I'll help you.

944
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,170
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

945
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,270
Friends should help each other out. Isn't that right, friend?

946
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:43,990
- What?
 - Let me see.

947
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,090
I just need to take it up to the roof right?

948
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,150
I'll get going.

949
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,510
I'm starving.

950
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:03,130
I didn't have anything to eat since yesterday because of Gi Bong.

951
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,690
Maybe I should have a sweet pancake.

952
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,960
- Hello!
 - Welcome!

953
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,310
- One sweet pancake, please.
 - Sure.

954
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,700
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

955
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,430
Why are you alone today?

956
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,910
What about the pretty girl you always come with?

957
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,790
What? Just because.

958
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:31,480
Why? Did you fight with your girlfriend?

959
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,710
She's not my girlfriend.

960
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:38,180
She's just a friend. A good friend.

961
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:48,690
♫  If I squeeze my eyes shut tight, the path in front of me  ♫

962
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:55,220
♫  Your face wakes my heart  ♫

963
01:02:55,850 --> 01:03:03,040
♫  If I hold it in all day long, it makes my heart flutter  ♫

964
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:08,960
♫  Your voice remains with me  ♫

965
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:15,530
♫  In my love love love you for real love  ♫

966
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:19,150
♫  Love, love you forever  ♫

967
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,070
♫  Love  ♫

968
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,220
 I don't think I can date anyone right now.

969
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:23,850
 Oh.

970
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,310
 Woo Sik, we're still good friends, right?

971
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:29,020
♫  By your side  ♫

972
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:33,460
You two looked so good together. Why don't you ask her out?

973
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,830
♫  In my embrace  ♫

974
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:43,170
What's wrong? Are you okay?

975
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,380
No.

976
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,810
I thought I was okay, but I guess I'm not.

977
01:03:54,810 --> 01:04:00,450

978
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:05,520
♫  In my love love love you for real love  ♫

979
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,210
♫  Love, love you forever  ♫

980
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:13,750
♫  Love love is for with you   ♫

981
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,960
♫  By your side forever  ♫

982
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,640
♫  Your warmth  ♫

983
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,960
♫  I'll embrace it always  ♫

984
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,220
♫  Love  ♫

985
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,960
  - Preview -

986
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,000
 I'm going to start working on making songs again. I should write a good song and make a comeback.

987
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,670
 Are you sure he's heartbroken?

988
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,620
 He's been pretending to be fine, but it was all a lie!

989
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,900
 These words are all for Soo Yeon. He liked her since high school.

990
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,880
 You're Joon Ki, aren't you?

991
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,280
 - It's me!
 - Who is he?

992
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,290
 I would have helped you out if I'd known you were an actor.

993
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,500
 This is driving me crazy! I need him to wake up so I can figure out his number,

994
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,130
  in order to get help from him.

995
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,800
 It's my first time doing food trucks.

996
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,920
 Do you have any tips?

997
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,120
 It just needs to taste good.

998
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,090
 You have to win them over with the taste.

999
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,500
 I can't just stand here and watch. Let's come up with something too. We need to come up with a shocking performance.

1000
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,200
 Thinking about it, I've only been receiving things from Woo Sik.

1001
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,300
 Is there anything I can do for him?

1002
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,650
 - Woo Sik...
 - Teacher!

1003
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,250
♫  Your warmth  ♫

1004
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:21,980
♫  I'll embrace it always  ♫
