1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,420
No!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,800
That's not going to work!

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,000
You've got to use an armbar there!

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,700
You guys are so loud that I can't read!

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,460
I really don't understand how guys find this fun.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,290
Why not? It's so fun to watch them fall and hit each other like that!

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,480
And, martial arts has this thing where it draws some kind of manliness out of you.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,680
So, you two must fight really well then?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,430
Fight?

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,780
Well, I don't just go and fight people randomly.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,450
I've never lost a fight before.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,540
Really?

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,810
So if you two fight, who’ll win?

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,330
Us?

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,230
It’s just that I’m curious.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,060
But, based on height and size, Gi Bong would win.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,680
What?

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,330
Joon Ki has a black belt in taekwondo.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,280
Joon Ki might win.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,240
Hey, does that make sense? The difference in their sizes is way too obvious.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,570
Yeah, but you'll never know until they actually fight.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,700
Ah, stop it. Who cares about winning between us friends anyway?

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,190
But fighting isn't always about size.

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,930
But, you can't ignore the physical when it comes to fights.

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,490
 The Fists Cry

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,500

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,360
  It's not a misunderstanding.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,300
 My first love was you, Cha Woo Sik. You!

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,560
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,270
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,430
Brother! I'm reading!

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,050
Okay?   
 "Actual Love - 100 skills included"

33
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,240
It was me.

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,800
What was you?

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,630
Soo Yeon said that

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,890
her first love was me.

37
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,450
What? Really??

38
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,530
She said that for real?

39
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,330
But, I misunderstood, so I acted like a fool for ten years.

40
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,310
If it wasn’t for the misunderstanding, then I could’ve had a lovey-dovey

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,300
relationship with Soo Yeon. We could’ve even gotten married.

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,320
By now, we would have a son and daughter.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,870
We'd be living so well and happily.

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,500
Wow. Look at you making marriage plans, family plans, all the plans, just sitting here by yourself.

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,220
Well then, you can try your best now.

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,060
What could I do?

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,940
Soo Yeon doesn’t have any interest in me now.

48
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,230
What are you talking about? Listen,

49
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,350
if she doesn’t have any interest in you, then why say you’re her first love?

50
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,130
She only told me so I wouldn't misunderstand anymore.

51
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,200
Yeah! So, why would she do that?

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,260
Ten years passed. Did she have to do that? Right now? Why?

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,890
Because she doesn’t like that you guys had a misunderstanding.

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,520
Why? Because she's interested in you.

55
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,780
No way.

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,280
 Woo Sik, I have something I want to say to you. Can you come see me at the cafe in front of the house?

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,270
What is it?

58
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,170
Soo Yeon wants me to meet her for a bit. She has something she wants to say.

59
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,520
Something to say?

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Oh, I can sense what this is.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,940
This... It’s one hundred percent a confession.

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,590
Confession?

63
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,820
After saying you were her first love, she wants to see you because she has something to say.

64
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,150
What else would it be if not a confession?

65
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,920
This is one hundred percent a confession!

66
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,520
Trust your sister!

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,270
Really?

68
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,720
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.

69
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,170
Ahh, No worries!

70
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,480
Wh-What did you want to say?

71
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,620
The thing is, do you have someone you’re seeing right now, Woo Sik?

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,070
Huh? No, I don't.

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,330
Why?

74
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,820
Oh, that’s a relief.

75
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,050
The thing is...

76
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,470
Da Yeong! Here!

77
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,360
Hello.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,610
Ah. Hello. Who...?

79
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,290
She’s a work friend, she said she was lonely and asked if I knew anyone I could introduce her to.

80
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,580
And I thought of you right away!

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,490
I thought you two would look good together.

82
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,010
What?!

83
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,460
Blind date?

84
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,820
So you’re saying the thing she wanted to talk to you about was setting you up?

85
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes! I’m the crazy one for listening to you again.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

87
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,270
A blind date?

88
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,180
Soo Yeon, she's such a wicked person.

89
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,710
She's so smart..

90
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,440
- Smart? 
 - From what I see,

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,940
this is 100% her trying to get a read on you. I'm sure of it.

92
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,200
What? Read me?

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,490
Why would she?

94
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,530
You're so clueless.

95
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,850
Brother, blind dates have two uses.

96
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,130
There's a normal blind date and a bait blind date.

97
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,520
The important thing here is the bait blind date.

98
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
Bait blind date? What's that?

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,300
What that is... Well, let's say I like a boy,

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,950
but I don't know if he likes me or not.

101
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,540
So I throw out a blind date.

102
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,880
- So? 
 - So,

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,380
if that man takes the bait blind date,

104
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,360
then he's not interested in me.

105
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
But, if he refuses it for no reason, then he's interested in me.

106
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,510
It's one of the very skilled tactics women use to get a read on the men they like.

107
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,470
Does that make any sense?

108
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,580
If you don't believe me, you could say that you'll go out with that girl.

109
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,720
Then, Soo Yeon will be so surprised and make such a big deal out of it.

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,780
No! Do you think I'll get fooled again? Do you think I'm stupid?

111
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,830
I can really trust you on this, right?

112
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,740
This time, I’m a hundred percent, no, two hundred percent sure!

113
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,500
So, trust me, okay?

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,090
Cha Woo Sik, what's up with the clothes?

115
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,560
Huh? Nothing.

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,860
I’ll be back.

117
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,580
Bye.

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,460
Noona, where’s he going?

119
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,780
You guys don’t need to know.

120
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,040
The smell of sweat! Geez, do you train even on rest days?

121
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,010
He never misses a single day of the year.

122
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,860
But, why are you always second string then?

123
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,420
Once I recover from my injury properly, I'll be the first string!

124
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,030
It's so hot. I'll just go shower.

125
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,330
Oh, Gi Bong! Wow! You're a total rock!

126
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,830
But, what? You said such a skinny kid like Joon Ki would beat him?

127
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,960
You never know.

128
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,600
Wow, you're really being insistent until the end.

129
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,190
Gi Bong, tell me honestly. You really can't beat Joon Ki?

130
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,630
You’re on about that again?

131
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,480
Why are you so curious about that?

132
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,280
But, you know, Joon Ki and I are on different levels.

133
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,880
If you think of Joon Ki as an elementary school student, then I'm Mike Tyson.

134
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,260
How can an elementary schooler try to hit Tyson?

135
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,830
It'd be ticklish. But, with one punch...

136
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,340
No, no. If I just flicked him like this,

137
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,860
it'd be a KO. KO!

138
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,800
So, you’re saying that you’d win?

139
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,250
I'm not saying it's like that,

140
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,570
but, whatever. Forget it.

141
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,470
I'm going to go shower.

142
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,120
What? Gi Bong said he’d beat me?

143
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,930
Yeah. He said that compared to him, you're just an elementary schooler. If you hit him, it'd just tickle him.

144
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,870
He said that even if he just flicked you, you'd be KO'd.

145
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,650
What? Flicked?

146
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,110
But, Joon Ki, would you really lose to him?

147
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,530
Oh, who cares who wins or loses between friends?

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,230
But you know what? He's a big guy, so he'll be slow.

149
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,770
I'm fast, though.

150
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,030
What's the point of him using all his strength when I'm going to avoid everything anyway?

151
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,600
Also, I get that he's a big guy, but is he made of steel or what?

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,270
I would...

153
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,780
Dodge all of his hits like this!

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,690
Like this, like this!

155
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,120
I'd hit him, and it would be over for him.

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
The end.

157
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,170
So you’re saying you’d beat him?

158
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,750
No, I'm not saying it's like that, but...

159
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,730
Ah. Whatever, let’s just leave it.

160
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,920
Geez.

161
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,720
We boil pork hocks made in Korea, along with various herbs,

162
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,380
for over ten hours which makes it delicious and nutritious.

163
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,560
- Welcome to Jo An's Jokbal.
 - Hello.

164
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,670
It's delicious.

165
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,120
Soo Yeon, it's hard, right?

166
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,630
Here, take this.

167
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,460
Thanks.

168
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,320
No worries, I’m just thankful you set me up with Woo Sik.

169
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Oh, I only did that because I thought you two would look good together!

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,290
I’m sorry, Da Yeong!

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,920
Sorry? You’re sorry, that’s it?

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,180
Is a sorry enough, you dummy?!

173
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,700
Da Yeong...

174
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,440
Can you not coordinate between your arms and legs?

175
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,800
You can't even stand properly, so why'd you crawl out to do a part-time job?!

176
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,730
You should've just stayed at home, lying down, then!

177
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,060
I'm sorry. I'll clean your shoes.

178
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,670
Do you think I’m like this because you stepped on my shoes?

179
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,660
I don't even need these darn shoes.

180
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,130
These shoes!

181
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,870
I don't need them!

182
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,090
So, don't step on my foot again, okay?

183
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,970
Got it??

184
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,290
Move!!

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,870
What’s wrong with her?

186
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,750
You don’t know? That unni has always been a psycho.

187
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,620
Psycho??

188
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,050
She has an insane temper, and her personality is no joke.

189
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,290
Another part-timer who used to work here accidentally got spit on her when he was talking to her

190
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,520
so she hit him with a mic and he ended up in a hospital

191
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,470
for four weeks.

192
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,620
Four weeks for recovery?!

193
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,030
But Unni, did you really set her up on a blind date?

194
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,520
Why did you do that?

195
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,330
Soo Yeon!

196
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,300
Oh, Woo Sik, why are you here?

197
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,990
I came to take Da Yeong out on a date.

198
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,790
Date?

199
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,830
So you’re really going to date Da Yeong?

200
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,110
Why? Is there a reason why

201
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,150
I can't date her?

202
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,300
Well, Woo Sik...

203
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,080
Woo Sik. What are you doing here?

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,400
You didn't even call.

205
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,790
I came to see you, Da Yeong. I wanted to have a beer with you.

206
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,870
Then, I'll be finishing soon, so please wait a bit.

207
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,750
Ah, okay. Weren't you going to say something just now?

208
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,310
- What? Soo Yeon, were you going to say something to Woo Sik? 
 - Huh?

209
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,060
No, no. It's nothing.

210
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,290
You have nothing to say, right?

211
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,190
Yeah, yeah, nothing.

212
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,950
You must be tired. I told you to go home and rest.

213
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,460
Huh?

214
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,250
Oh, well, I just wanted some beer too.

215
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,120
What's this? Why'd she follow us here?

216
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,640
How strange.

217
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,180
 Mortal Enemy

218
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,860
It's my sister.

219
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,870
I'll take this call real quick.

220
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,690
Yes, Noona?

221
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,050
I'm going to the bathroom.

222
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,990
Soo Yeon. I'm hungry. Can you pick out the side dishes?

223
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,690
I'm the type that gets angry when I'm hungry.

224
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,510
Alright.

225
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,670
- We'll have chicken. 
 - Hey.

226
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,240
Don't you know I'm on a diet right now?

227
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,510
Are you telling me to gain weight by eating chicken?

228
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,450
N-No. I'm sorry.

229
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,120
Then... should we have a salad?

230
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,080
Salad? Is that filling enough?

231
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,990
I'm hungry, I said!

232
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,860
  Soo Yeon...

233
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,620
What? Soo Yeon followed you to get drinks?

234
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,210
Yeah! I told her to go, but she insisted on coming.

235
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,940
Wow, look at her being all antsy.

236
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,680
See? I told you she was interested in you.

237
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,800
- Really? 
 - Of course.

238
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,470
She must've been so anxious for her to follow you to the bar like that.

239
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,410
Really?

240
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
This. Sausage with

241
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,260
stir-fried vegetables.

242
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,110
How many times do I have to tell you that I'm on a diet, you dummy?!

243
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,050
Are you telling me to gain weight by eating sausage?

244
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,930
No, no. I just...

245
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,290
Oh, you're skinny, so you can eat whatever. Is that what you're saying?

246
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,710
It must be nice to be skinny. My fat self will just eat the menu instead.

247
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,260
It's so yummy!

248
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm sorry, Da Yeong.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,230
So, do it again. Don't drag time by looking at the menu.

250
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,130
- Okay? 
 - Yeah.

251
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,460
But, Soo Yeon's gaze seems to be very nervous.

252
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,740
  Of course, it's like that, since she thinks that girl and you might end up together.

253
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,210
But, how do I explain this?

254
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,670
She looks a bit scared rather than nervous.

255
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,300
The fact that you and that girl are dating

256
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,880
is super scary for her! It's scary!

257
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,830
Oh, I see.

258
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,460
Then, Soo Yeon likes me, too.

259
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,000
What? Joon Ki said he'd beat me?

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,220
Yeah, he said that he wouldn't be hit by even one of your punches.

261
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,460
He'd dodge and hit like this.

262
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,900
The end. That's what he said.

263
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah, alright, let's just say that's what'll happen.

264
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,460
I'm so tired. I'm going to rest.

265
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,560
Alright. Go rest.

266
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
What? I'm too slow for him?

267
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,330
He'd dodge all of my hits?

268
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,280
I'm here.

269
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,310
Where are you coming from?

270
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,460
Well, I sent around my profile to some agencies.

271
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:19,160
But, you know, Jeong Eun said that you said you'd beat me.

272
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,900
Oh, that? Well, I didn't specifically say I'd beat you,

273
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,720
but I was saying that in fights, the physique isn't that important.

274
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,020
I just explained that to her.

275
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,850
Oh, I see. I was thinking of something else.

276
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,570
But I heard you said you'd beat me too.

277
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,480
You said that it'd be a KO from just a flick.

278
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,490
Well, I wasn't saying that it was you,

279
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,220
but just in fights, you can't ignore physique completely.

280
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,520
That's what I was saying.

281
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,880
Oh, that was it? I thought it was something else.

282
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,480
But, Joon Ki, did you not hear that during high school—

283
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,200
No, I haven't.

284
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,920
- I'll tell you then. 
 - What?

285
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,180
The Rice Cake Skewers Fighter.

286
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,960
That was about me.

287
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,650
The Rice Cake Skewers Fighter? Yeah, I've never heard of that.

288
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,280
Well, I'll have to elaborate since you'll be curious.

289
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,080
It was a very cold and windy day.

290
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,290
  Isn't that my best friend, Min Goo?

291
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,820
  I'm craving some rice cake skewers.

292
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,230
  You should get the money for that.

293
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,830
  In this broad daylight,

294
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,870
  what are you doing to my best friend?

295
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,280
  Who are you?

296
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,260
  I don't think we need introductions between us.

297
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,620
  Let go of my best friend while I'm being nice.

298
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,730
 They say that fools rush in where others fear to tread.

299
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,640
  Guys!

300
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,630
  You insects that swarm around him like so.

301
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,240
Today, I shall exterminate you all.

302
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,500
- Come at me
 - Hey!

303
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,040
  What?

304
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,640
  Oh!

305
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,930
  Gi Bong, I'm alive thanks to you.

306
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,130
  Thanks so much!

307
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,260
  Friends don't need to thank each other.

308
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,740
  Well, then. Adios.

309
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,720
What a lie. You're telling me to believe those lies?

310
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,660
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

311
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,430
But, what I'm trying to say is,

312
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,140
I'm big in size, but also very fast.

313
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,890
Those taekwondo boys couldn't dodge a single one of my punches.

314
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,060
Alright, alright, whatever. Let's just say that happened.

315
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,510
But, since you're talking of the past, I was suddenly reminded of something.

316
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,260
Have you heard of it? The legend of 18:1?

317
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,940
The legend of 18:1?

318
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,520
The sky was very blue and bright that day.

319
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,130
  Kiddo, hurry up and give me your card.

320
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,420
  No! You can't do this!

321
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,970
  You little... I guess words won't work with you!

322
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,350
  Stop it.

323
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,180
  Who are you?!

324
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,690
 You can call me a human cleaner, who cleans up human garbage like you.

325
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,690
 - What'd you say?
 - What?

326
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,950
 I guess you're really looking forward to your funeral, aren't you?

327
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,310
  Guys!

328
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,780
  After him!

329
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,490
What a lie! 18:1?

330
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,480
Whatever, don't believe me if you don't want to.

331
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,060
But, what I'm trying to say is

332
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,370
even though I'm lacking in physique, I can still cause destruction.

333
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,200
Those huge baseball boys all flew from my punches.

334
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, yeah, we'll just say that happened.

335
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
Thank you for the food, Woo Sik.

336
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,780
Oh, no problem.

337
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,100
Oh, I left my phone. Hold on.

338
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,230
Woo Sik. I have to tell you something.

339
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,390
Tell me something? What is it?

340
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,540
You know... Do you really have to date Da Yeong?

341
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,500
Can't you just not date her?

342
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,540
  What? Look at her. She's so direct.

343
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,800
  She's so anxious that I'll date Da Yeong!

344
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,770
Why are you laughing?

345
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,230
Just because.

346
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,080
But, why? Why can't I

347
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,490
date Da Yeong?

348
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,550
Well, I think I made a mistake.

349
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,690
A mistake? Well.

350
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,810
What mistake did you make, Soo Yeon?

351
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:46,320
Well, Woo Sik, actually, Da Yeong—

352
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,820
Oh, I got it. Don't worry. I know.

353
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,000
You know? Really?

354
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,420
Of course. How could I not know? It's so obvious.

355
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,220
It was obvious to you too?

356
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,170
Of course. You think I'm a fool?

357
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,430
What's this? What are you two laughing about?

358
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,920
Oh, it's secret.

359
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,090
A secret between Soo Yeon and me.

360
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,300
Well, it's late now, so should we separate now?

361
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,500
Already? You can go first, then.

362
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,390
We're going to have a cup of coffee.

363
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,640
- Is that alright, Woo Sik? 
 - Shall we?

364
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,870
Let me find a good place.

365
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,210
What are you saying? You're having coffee with her?

366
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,890
I'll settle all of it, so don't worry.

367
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,090
Just go home. Alright?

368
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, okay. Got it.

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,720
Da Yeong, let's go together.

370
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,430
Wow, my muscles are about to explode!

371
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,090
- It's been a long time, but my kicks are still as fast as lightning.
 - No, they're not.

372
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,950
I should sleep before my muscles explode.

373
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,060
I can still hit this a thousand more times,

374
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,200
but I'll sleep so tomorrow comes.

375
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,790
- Goodnight. 
 - You, too.

376
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,530
But, Gi Bong, what are you doing?!

377
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,090
- What did I do? 
 - I've never said this before,

378
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,450
but did you know you always pull the blankets towards you?

379
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,440
When did I?

380
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,320
- You always take more than me! 
 - Forget it.

381
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,360
If you pull them towards your side one more time, I won't let it go.

382
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,030
Well, what are you going to do?

383
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,020
Oh, so you're going to see yourself being ruined, aren't you?

384
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,740
What nonsense. What are you trying to do?!

385
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,670
You little!

386
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,860
The more I see it, I just...

387
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,260
Hey, did you not see my phone?

388
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,810
What are you doing right now?

389
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,130
This punk keeps pulling the covers towards him.

390
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,920
When did I? Do you have evidence? Do you?

391
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,590
Alright. Let's see who the owner of these covers is today.

392
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,640
Alright, let's do it.

393
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,790
Come out.

394
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,230
Thanks for the coffee.

395
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,040
Oh, no problem.

396
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,320
Woo Sik, when should we see each other again?

397
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,830
What?

398
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,490
Da Yeong, I need to tell you something.

399
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,160
- What is it? 
 - Well, actually...

400
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,890
Hold on. Let me take this. Yes, Noona?

401
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,490
There he goes again.

402
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,700
Why does he always stop in the middle of what he's saying and talk on the phone?!

403
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,390
What crappy manners. Crappy manners!

404
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,120
Really? Soo Yeon told you not to date her?

405
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,490
Yeah! As you said, I think Soo Yeon truly likes me.

406
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,730
Oh, I almost became a fool without you. Thanks, Noona!

407
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,330
No problem. You have to make it official now.

408
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,730
You need to confess to Soo Yeon now.

409
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,270
Confess to Soo Yeon? Already?

410
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,460
You have to confess to her while she's being like that to succeed. You don't trust me?

411
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,260
I trust you. I do. But, how do I confess?

412
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,590
What? You've planned out your family with her, but not a confession?

413
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,540
Still, that part is a bit hard.

414
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,960
I do have an idea.

415
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,920
Crappy manners! Crappy manners! Crappy manners!

416
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,930
I feel a bit better now.

417
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,820
Oh, Da Yeong, I'm sorry. It was an urgent call.

418
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,270
It's alright. What were you going to say?

419
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,070
Oh, well, I think today will be the last day I meet with you.

420
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,070
To be honest, there's another girl I like.

421
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,820
Then, why would you go on this blind date?

422
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,370
Well, I have my reasons.

423
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,440
Reasons? What reasons? Tell me.

424
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,090
Oh, it's a bit hard to tell you. But, why are you speaking informally to me all of a sudden?

425
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,310
Don't say such nonsense. Tell me, you idiot!

426
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,060
Are you playing with me? Why would you come on this blind date if you had someone you liked?!

427
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,130
Is going on blind dates your hobby? Are you writing a report on it?

428
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,950
- You crappy bastard! 
 - Da Yeong!

429
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,810
Alright. I'll give you one last chance.

430
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,240
What's your reason? Tell me.

431
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,300
I can't tell you!

432
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,520
This won't do.

433
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,370
Da Yeong, what are you doing? Are you looking for something?

434
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,210
Why are you holding up that chair?

435
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, shall we find out who the true owner of the blankets is?

436
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,320
Before that, no matter what kind of unfortunate event happen because of this battle,

437
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,360
let's not hold each other responsible. Okay?

438
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,570
Of course. Alright. Let's start.

439
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,860
Don't regret it.

440
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,850
Excuse me.

441
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,930
Sir. I'm asking because I'm hungry, but if you have money please give it to me.

442
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,130
Oh, hold on.

443
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,100
Hey, what are you doing?

444
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,040
Oh, what are you doing right now?

445
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,510
Hey. Are you trying to take money from us right now?

446
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,710
I was just asking you to loan me money, even though I don't know when I'll pay you back.

447
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,530
Even though you don't know? Wow, I can't believe this.

448
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,250
Wow, really?

449
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,490
Hey, Gi Bong. This won't do. Let's deal with him first.

450
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:16,060
Yeah. Hey, Kiddo. You stay right there.

451
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,560
How pretty.

452
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,620
It's so cold. Why would you bring me here at this hour?

453
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,540
Just... The weather's nice and all.

454
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,520
What do you mean? The air pollution is so bad today.

455
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,290
But still, the atmosphere is so nice.

456
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,880
Why are you laughing?

457
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,360
Because it's cute. I thought you were only chic and cold.

458
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,470
You're just a girl.

459
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,880
What are you saying?

460
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,540
I know everything. I heard you set Woo Sik up on a blind date.

461
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,730
What?

462
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,080
But, were you that anxious about it?

463
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,910
Yes, I was. I was so anxious after doing that for no reason.

464
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,330
Yeah, so why would you? You should've told him honestly.

465
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,420
I know, right?

466
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,450
- But, I didn't know she was a psycho. 
 - What?

467
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,720
A psycho? Who?

468
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,820
Woo Sik's blind date. I realized that she was a total psycho.

469
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,470
I was so worried that she might do something to Woo Sik.

470
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,630
What? Wait, wait.

471
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,970
So, that's why you were anxious?

472
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,140
There's no other reason besides that?

473
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,600
Another reason? No. Why?

474
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,880
Oh. This can't happen.

475
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,580
Oh, that scared me.

476
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,130
What is this? What's this song?

477
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,750
I don't know. There must be something going on.

478
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,010
Soo Yeon, let's go. It's cold.

479
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,360
There seems to be an event going on. Let's have a quick look before we go.

480
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,960
No, no. The air pollution's bad. Let's go. Quickly.

481
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,410
Soo Yeon!

482
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,700
It's Woo Sik! Why is he...?

483
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,640
Whoa. Unni, isn’t that a nosebleed?

484
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,230
What’s with the flower bouquet?

485
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,640
Well, that...

486
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,690
Oh, it's his part-time job. He's been doing a part-time job here selling flowers recently.

487
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,910
So, let's not interfere. Let's go.

488
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,810
But we should still say hi before we go.

489
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,150
Hi? What do you mean? You see each other every day! Let’s just go.

490
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,790
Woo Sik. Go.

491
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,010
We're not buying!

492
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,970
We're not buying!

493
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,300
We won't buy flowers!

494
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,900
Don’t come! Don’t come!

495
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,890
We're not buying!

496
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,110
No! No! We're not buying!

497
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,080
We're not buying!

498
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,300
 I’m going crazy. What should I do?

499
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,020
Soo Yeon.

500
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,670
I...

501
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,430
No!

502
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,420
Unni, what are you doing right now??

503
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,700
Oh, I was trying to say I wouldn't buy the flowers.

504
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,980
He kept bothering us.

505
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,700
Yeah, but still.

506
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,870
Woo Sik. Hey, Woo Sik!!

507
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,570
Woo Sik, open your eyes!!

508
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,070
Hey.

509
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,270
Why do you two look like that?

510
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,860
Did you really fight each other?

511
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,600
So, did you guys decide on the owner of the blankets?

512
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,390
What?

513
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,540
It's a tie. It was hard to settle.

514
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,160
Gi Bong's not as easy as I thought.

515
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,030
It was neck and neck.

516
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,660
Is anyone here?

517
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,560
Oh, who are you?

518
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,660
I'm sorry for coming so late at night. Is there a Lee Joon Ki and a Gook Gi Bong here?

519
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,670
Oh, yes. It's us. What's the matter?

520
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,110
Well... Hold on.

521
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,800
Um Seok Dae! Come here at once!

522
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,780
What's the matter?

523
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,270
Oh, well, there were wallets in my kid's bag.

524
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,160
This belongs to you, right?

525
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,630
Oh, yes...

526
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,260
  Lee Joon Ki

527
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,610
These are yours!

528
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,610
Why are these in his bag?

529
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,830
We just gave them to him. So that he could eat something good.

530
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,690
High schoolers have it tough studying these days.

531
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,810
My kid's in middle school.

532
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,120
- What? 
 - He's in Year 2 of middle school.

533
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,960
Y-Year 2?

534
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,380
Oh, he's a middle schooler.

535
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,190
Oh, middle schoolers have it tough going to after-school classes.

536
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,980
Then, you could give him money. Why your whole wallet?

537
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,400
- Huh? 
 - The wallet was old. We gave it to him as a gift.

538
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,240
Is that so? Then, you could give him your wallet. Why are your ID and cards in there?

539
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,830
Oh, well, it for reference. It was out of consideration for him to know that adults' wallets look like this.

540
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,750
No way. Were your wallets stolen by him?

541
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,620
Are your faces like that because he hit you?

542
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,960
Tell me honestly! Did you hit these men?

543
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,820
Well... They were going to hit me first. I had no choice!

544
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,130
What? I'm sorry.

545
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,540
You two were really beaten up by a middle schooler?

546
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,560
Oh, he's not a normal middle schooler! You didn't see him!

547
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,490
He was flying around!

548
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,290
Yeah, yeah. But I was only hit a little. Joon Ki got hit a lot.

549
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,480
- What? 
 - He got his back elbowed like this.

550
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,360
I wasn't being hit! I was trying to defend myself with my back!

551
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,360
You were hit in the back of your neck and were gasping pathetically.

552
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,860
I wasn’t doing that, I was just breathing. Also, it didn't even hurt.

553
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,160
It didn't hurt for me either.

554
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,480
Don't you know who I am?

555
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,280
- My body's a rock.
 - Oh, please.

556
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,160
You got on your knees first!

557
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,400
You begged first!!

558
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,720
You cried first!

559
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,090
You said to hit him first!

560
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,280
Brother, I'm sorry.

561
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,590
Shut up!

562
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,260
I'm the crazy one for believing you!

563
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,870
I said I'm sorry!

564
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,030
What can I do to make it up to you? Tell me!

565
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,220
Really?

566
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,790
Wait a minute.

567
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,680
Alright, I'll wait.

568
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,190
Woo Sik! What are you looking for?

569
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,470
Should I find something for you?

570
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,790
- Woo Sik, why are you holding that broom? 
 - Come here.

571
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,930
- Calm down, Woo Sik. Calm down! 
 - Come here!

572
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,310
Woo Sik!

573
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,700
Woo Sik!

574
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,810
It's uncomfortable. Uncomfortable!

575
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,610
What's this? Joon Ki!

576
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,070
What? What's he doing?

577
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,820
Chairman Kim! Come quickly!

578
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,590
What's he dreaming about?

579
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,670
Chairman Kim!

580
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,720
Let's begin the backstroke.

581
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,390
This crazy bastard.

582
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,120
You... Stop it, you crazy bastard!

583
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,700
Gosh.

584
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,170
Ow, my jaw.

585
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,600
She dared to backspin elbow her brother?

586
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,680
What? And Soo Yeon likes me?

587
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,420
I'm the idiot for believing her again.

588
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,530
Brother.

589
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,080
Have some kimchi with your food.

590
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,920
Do you think I'd be eating porridge if I was able to eat kimchi?

591
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,030
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,740
But, you know, what are you going to do about Soo Yeon now?

593
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,170
I don't know.

594
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,330
- SoI have a good idea on how to get Soo Yeon's heart— 
 - Shush!

595
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,270
I'm not going to trust you ever again!

596
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,950
You're up?

597
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,560
Hello.

598
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,050
You want some porridge? You guys can't eat food since your mouths are all injured.

599
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,250
No, it's fine. I saw something unpleasant this morning and I have no appetite.

600
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,600
Why? Did something happen?

601
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,260
Well, this guy. Did you know he was sleeping in his underwear doing weird things?

602
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,880
What? Why?

603
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,940
Well, I had a really cool dream.

604
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,540
- What dream? 
 - Well, that dream was about...

605
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,920
  In my dream, I was going up a mountain.

606
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,500
  But, I saw a sign saying it was 1,000 meters until the top of Baekdu Mountain.

607
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,860
  So, that mountain was Baekdu Mountain!

608
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,710
  After going up for a long time, I was finally at the summit.

609
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,840
  I could see the skies from there!

610
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,110
  So, I took off my clothes and started swimming.

611
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,060
  I was having so much fun.

612
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,030
 Freestyle, breastroke, backstroke, butterfly.

613
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,470
  But, then!

614
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,420
  Oh, you scared me!

615
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,130
 Chairman Kim?

616
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,330
  What?

617
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,650
So, that man up there visited you in your dream?

618
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,070
Yes!

619
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,040
I started swimming with him in the heavens

620
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,260
and scrubbing his back. It was no joke!

621
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,880
It's cool, right?

622
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,230
You're right.

623
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,430
But they say that when a famous person appears in your dream, it's a lucky dream. What if something good happens to you?

624
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,650
No way. I don't believe in that kind of stuff.

625
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,720
Joon Ki, sell your dream to me, then.

626
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,220
- Sell my dream to you?  
 - Yeah.

627
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,070
Nothing's been working out for me lately, so let me use that dream's luck.

628
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,870
The dream's luck?

629
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,650
Here. I'll buy it for ₩10,000 (~$10).

630
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,650
Really? Sure!

631
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,930
- Alright. You sold it to me, then! 
 - Okay.

632
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,430
Wow, dream money!

633
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,300
Nice play!

634
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,060
Gi Bong, let's take a break.

635
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,120
Alright, Sunbae. Good work!

636
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,620
- Gather around, guys! 
 - Yes!

637
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,670
I have an announcement to make.

638
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,950
I just got a call from the first string coach.

639
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,280
They have a lot of injured players, so they need players immediately.

640
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,970
So, the first string director is coming tomorrow to personally test you guys. Prepare yourselves, got it?

641
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,750
Yes, sir!

642
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,690
Test for first string. Nice!

643
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,820
You can't even eat pizza. What do we do?

644
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,290
Does your jaw still hurt a lot?

645
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,360
No, it's fine.

646
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,000
Why would you keep bothering your sister like that?

647
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,750
From now on, don't bother her.

648
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,520
Yeah. I got it.

649
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,490
- Oh, it's so good. How can it be so good? 
 - Right?

650
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,940
It tastes even better because it was bought with the dream money.

651
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,620
Eat slower! You'll get indigestion.

652
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,480
I don't have time. I need to eat quickly and get to my part-time job.

653
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,860
You're going to one again? How many jobs do you work in a day?

654
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,110
You're not going to act anymore?

655
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,090
Act? Jeong Eun acts?

656
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,750
You didn't know? She was in the same major as me, theater and film.

657
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,560
I used to film movies and dramas with her.

658
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,530
Oh, really? But, why aren't you doing it now?

659
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:51,790
Oh, well I had my reasons. I'll go prepare for my job.

660
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,320
Hey, you should eat first.

661
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,240
Hey, hey! Amazing news.

662
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,200
What is it? What?

663
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,830
Tomorrow I have a test for first string!

664
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,790
If I pass, I'll be moved up to the first string team again!

665
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,520
- Really?! That's amazing! 
 - Right?

666
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,310
But... I think this is all because of the dream that I bought from Joon Ki.

667
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,700
As soon as I bought that dream, I got this unexpected test!

668
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,290
Hey, does it make sense to be because of the dream?

669
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,330
Hey, why does it not make sense? Don't you know?

670
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,890
General Kim Ye Sin's younger sister bought her sister's dream and became a queen!

671
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,960
Right, many people win the lottery after having a good dream.

672
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,820
- What? 
 - Oh, Joon Ki must be upset now. He sold such a lucky dream for ₩10,000!

673
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,390
Hey, hey. Give me my dream back. I'll give you back your money!

674
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,050
What do you mean? You sold it, so that's it.

675
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,700
I'll give you ₩20,000 (~$20)!

676
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,150
No thanks.

677
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,390
- I'm going to go wash up. 
 - Hey, my dream!

678
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,720
- Hey! I'll give you ₩30,000! 
 - No!

679
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,920
₩50,000, then!

680
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,080
Be more careful!

681
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,100
I'm sorry.

682
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,460
It's done. Do you want one more?

683
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,120
No. This looks so silly.

684
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,390
Hey, hey. Give me back my dream!

685
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,790
Hey! Stop it!

686
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,620
You guys are still going at it because of the dream?

687
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,430
Don't even mention it. He's been asking for the dream all night.

688
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,460
- That's my dream! Give it back! 
 - I don't want to!

689
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,620
Alright, what should I have for breakfast?

690
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,010
Gosh.

691
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,330
What's that?

692
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:35,160
- Gimbap. 
 - Oh? I want some.

693
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,800
- What's that? 
 - Hey, this went bad!

694
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,130
Really? Good. Let's see.

695
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,830
Wow, it's definitely gone bad.

696
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,880
Oh, here you go again.

697
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,020
Again? What?

698
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,590
When Gi Bong has an important test or game coming up, he eats gimbap that's gone bad. That's his good luck charm.

699
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,460
What kind of good luck charm is that?!

700
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,600
Alright, let's try it.

701
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,400
Should we try this?

702
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,190
Ooh, it's so good.

703
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,940
Gosh, it tastes like fermented skate.

704
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,010
Oh, it's so good.

705
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,430
You greedy jerk.You can count on this lucky charm,

706
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,220
so give back my dream already!

707
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:16,040
What are you saying? I can't hear. What?

708
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,330
You trash.

709
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,010
Hello.

710
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,950
Oh, this is great. I'm doing great.

711
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,640
This feels exactly like the time...

712
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,030
when I pitched a complete shutout.

713
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,250
It's great.

714
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,620
Hello!

715
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,090
What are you doing right now?

716
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,230
Didn't you know? This is his good luck charm.

717
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,990
Before a game or test, he has to wear those pantyhose to do well.

718
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,520
His good luck charm.

719
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,160
He makes such a big deal out of it.

720
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,370
Let's get ready quickly.

721
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,430
  Son Hyun Woo

722
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,960
Oh! Oh! Oh!

723
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,350
- Gi Bong, you're here early. 
 - Hello, Sunbae!

724
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,950
Gi Bong, you're here early. Gi Bong, you're here early.

725
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,940
Gi Bong, you're here early.

726
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,510
Don't be too scared. His good luck charm is doing the same thing four times.

727
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,880
- Gi Bong, good luck today. 
 - Yes, you, too!

728
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,920
Gi Bong, good luck today. Gi Bong, good luck today.

729
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,350
Gi Bong, good luck today.

730
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,290
Thank you. But, I don't have to respond four times, right?

731
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,160
If you do it, the better it is. If you do it, the better it is.

732
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,410
If you do it, the better it is.

733
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,200
- If you do it, the better it is. 
 - Stop it!

734
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,470
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

735
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,410
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

736
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,630
Why are you so happy?

737
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,840
You were freaking out about Gi Bong not selling his dream earlier.

738
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,390
Oh, I bought it back!

739
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,480
Really? How?

740
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,490
  Gook Gi Bong

741
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,630
Gi Bong, why is there money on your back?

742
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,980
What money?

743
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,640
Look!

744
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,240
  Dream money

745
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,080
Dream money?

746
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,360
No way. Lee Joon Ki, that bastard.

747
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,220
Oh.

748
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,750
Attention! I'm sorry.

749
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:26,320
The coach just got busy and asked to push the test until tomorrow,

750
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,390
so you should just train as usual today.

751
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,150
Okay?

752
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,790
Yes, Sir.

753
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,440
Delayed? Why?

754
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,060
Oh, my stomach.

755
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:44,090
Hold on. No way. Isn't this because the dream was stolen from me?

756
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,680
Lee Joon Ki, you bastard!

757
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,140
Oh, anyway, I bought that dream again, okay?

758
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,510
I don't know. Just hang up!

759
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,820
He can't trust me yet.

760
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,200
Hyung! What?

761
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,460
Really?

762
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,440
Of course, I'm good with it!

763
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,960
Oh, thank you! Yes!

764
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,550
What's up? What is it?

765
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,050
There was a film audition I really wanted to try, and they told me to come!

766
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:11,700
Oh, really?

767
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,150
Wow, I can't believe this!

768
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,600
Wait.

769
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,820
- Noona. 
 - Yeah?

770
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,730
This... Isn't this because of the dream?

771
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,810
Dream? Oh, that dream?

772
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,810
Yeah! As soon as I bought that dream from Gi Bong, I got the call for the audition.

773
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,810
Oh, that's true. It's because of the dream!

774
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,260
Oh, that dream is such a lucky dream! It's real!

775
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,390
Comrade, you go first.

776
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,410
What about you? Let's go together!

777
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,870
We have no time for that. You have to survive.

778
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,210
If you live, I'll live.

779
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,260
You're inside my heart.

780
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,730
Comrade Kang Chal.

781
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,950
I... I love...

782
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,430
Oh, I can't do this! It's so cringeworthy!

783
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,540
Do it seriously for once!

784
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,660
It's making me cringe! What do I do?

785
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,160
Stop it, then! Forget it!

786
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,890
Stop!

787
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:02,630
I'm here.

788
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,090
Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun!

789
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,250
Why are you so late? I was waiting for you for so long!

790
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,530
What is it this time? What are you trying to start?

791
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,890
I have an audition tomorrow, so can you practice with me?

792
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,400
What?

793
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,850
No, thanks. I'm tired from my job.

794
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,730
Hey, can you just help me?! Hey!

795
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,000
I asked you to help me! Hey!

796
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,550
  Waikiki Guest House

797
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,600
Gosh, how petty. She thinks her job is more important than her friend?

798
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,960
She can be so hungry for money.

799
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,320
Oh, you scared me!

800
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,020
Hey, what are you doing? You scared me!

801
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,720
Oh, right. What happened to your test?

802
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,890
It was pushed to tomorrow.

803
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,090
It's because of you!

804
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,950
What? How is that because of me?

805
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,660
You took my dream and it got delayed right after!

806
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,800
So, give me back the dream. Give it!

807
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,590
Dream? Alright, I'll give it to you.

808
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,090
You can just dream it yourself!

809
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,920
Lee Joon Ki?!

810
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,160
Gi Bong! What's wrong?!

811
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,330
My stomach. It hurts so much.

812
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:10,790
Geez, that's why you should've have eaten that bad gimbap.

813
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,090
Go to the bathroom!

814
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:17,160
No! The time I pitched the shutout, I didn't go the bathroom even once after I got a stomachache!

815
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,750
What if I break my good luck by going to the bathroom?

816
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,370
So, you're going to hold it in until tomorrow?

817
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,380
Of course I will.

818
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,380
I already got the dream stolen from me. If I break this charm, I might fail.

819
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,390
I have to go to first string this time.

820
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,780
No matter what, I'll go!

821
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,830
Okay.

822
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,810
What are you doing?

823
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:51,690
If I do this, whatever was trying to come out will go back up.

824
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,290
Oh, what a fool.

825
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,010
  Dry Sauna

826
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,540
I'm done.

827
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,220
It's so hard.

828
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,020
  How many jobs do you do in a day?

829
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,510
  Are you not going to act anymore?

830
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:44,030
You're in my heart. You're in here. Agh.

831
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,170
Why can't I capture the emotions?

832
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,390
Ah, you scared me!

833
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,460
Hey, you're still here?

834
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,060
It's all because of you.

835
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,750
Give me back the dream! Give it back!

836
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,880
Oh, I don't want to!

837
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,490
Stop there! Stop!

838
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,170
Joon Ki! Hey!

839
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,750
Oh, why do you keep following me?!

840
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,820
You're so annyoing!

841
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,340
So give me back the dream.

842
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,560
Hurry up! I need to go to first string this time!

843
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,370
I need to pass this audition!

844
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,490
And, this was originally my dream!

845
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,290
You sold it to me!

846
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,970
So, that's why I gave you back your money!

847
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,960
You little...

848
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,820
Shut up! Give me back my dream!

849
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,840
You dare to strangle me with your feet?

850
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,360
You want to see the end of this?

851
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,160
Yeah! You and your "end."

852
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,240
Let's go ahead and see it.

853
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,800
Give it back! Give it!

854
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,130
Give it back!

855
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,830
Wow.

856
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,360
Where am I?

857
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,700
I must've fallen asleep while cleaning.

858
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,860
What's this? What's that noise?

859
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,690
What is that grandpa doing?

860
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,600
What time is it? It's already five?!

861
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,930
What? That means I fell asleep here.

862
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,400
What do I do?

863
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,340
Whatever. I need to go in

864
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,630
while someone's in there.

865
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,330
This is driving me crazy.

866
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,650
Why isn't it starting?

867
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:10,700
This is all because of Lee Joon Ki, that bastard.

868
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,400
You are inside my heart.

869
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,220
You are inside my heart. You are inside my heart.

870
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,140
You are inside my heart.

871
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,260
Hello!

872
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,560
Let's go!

873
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,690
What's this? You prepared an outfit, too?

874
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,520
Yes. I think these are the basics for making it seem real.

875
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,950
I like your attitude. I'll see you later at the audition.

876
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,650
Good luck.

877
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,160
Yes!

878
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,320
Thank you!

879
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,570
Everything is going so well.

880
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,990
It's a lucky dream! It is!

881
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,600
Alright, next. Gook Gi Bong.

882
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,920
Where is Gook Gi Bong?

883
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,210
I'm here.

884
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,150
What's wrong with you? Are you hurt somewhere?

885
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,960
No! I'm okay.

886
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,740
I'm almost there.

887
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,930
Gi Bong, just hold it in a bit longer.

888
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,430
Who's the next batter?

889
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,120
Me!

890
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,720
  Gwak Ha Ni

891
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,160
It's me. It's me. It's me.

892
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,800
What? He's in the same group as me?

893
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,700
- Next, Joon Ki? 
 - Yes,  it's Comrade Lee Joon Ki!

894
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,160
Don't be nervous, Joon Ki. You can pass for sure this time.

895
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,340
You practiced a lot.

896
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,490
Of course. You have a lucky dream, too.

897
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,430
Let's go! Let's go!

898
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,630
  Why did it have to be him?

899
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,600
  This is driving me crazy.

900
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,150
  How come he has so many

901
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,010
  preparation steps?

902
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,970
  What do I do?

903
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,760
  Alright. Let's calculate this.

904
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,060
  My intestines can hold out for two minutes.

905
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,340
  Let's say he takes 30 seconds.

906
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:07,070
  If I succeed, it'll take 1 minute 30 seconds.

907
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,220
  It'll take 30 seconds to run to the bathroom. Two minutes in total.

908
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,140
  Yeah. Two minutes makes it possible!

909
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,720
  Instead, I need to do these throws with all I've got!

910
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,070
  Just three times!

911
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:22,260
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

912
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,580
Okay, strike!

913
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,210
Why's he repeating that, too!

914
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,160
We have no time! Hurry up!

915
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,760
I'll do it quickly! I'll do it quickly!

916
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,320
I'll do it quickly! I'll do it quickly!

917
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,190
I'm sorry.

918
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,960
Four times?

919
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,960
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

920
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,550
Okay! Two strikes!

921
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,530
Ow, ow.

922
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,170
Hurry up!

923
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,930
  One more.

924
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,930
  I'll end it with this ball.

925
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,850
  No matter what!

926
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:30,220
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

927
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,830
Gi Bong! Are you coming back from training?

928
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,600
How'd the test go? Did you do well?

929
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,620
I failed. Why?

930
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:54,400
I threw a home run, and I failed perfectly. Why?

931
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,490
This is all because of you!

932
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,110
It's because you stole that lucky dream!

933
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,030
Why's it my fault?

934
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,950
Stop with the lucky dream talk. I failed, too.

935
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,720
What? You, too?

936
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,090
Yeah! It was my turn,

937
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,090
and I opened the doors so confidently,

938
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,020
but the director was going to exit. He was hit and fainted.

939
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,960
Anyway, that's what happened.

940
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,760
That's so unlucky!

941
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,420
What? Then, that dream must have not been a lucky dream.

942
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,290
Stop with the lucky dream talk!

943
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,510
That was just a stupid dream. Okay?

944
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,610
Shush. Just go home.

945
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,110
There's somewhere I need to stop by.

946
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,800
Stop by? Where?

947
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,460
  Men's Sauna

948
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,820
Why the sauna all of a sudden?

949
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,940
Don't ask. It'll just hurt your mentality.

950
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,230
Never mind. I don't even want to even know.

951
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,050
Let me just wash up.

952
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,090
Oh, it's so good. So good.

953
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:04,880
So good.

954
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,570
Why isn't anything working out?

955
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,100
What was that dream then?

956
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,610
Oh, whatever.

957
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,970
Let's just wash up.

958
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,830
Oh, so good.

959
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:29,670
Oh, you scared me!

960
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,780
Jeong Eun, are you here to swim? Wait!

961
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,780
Why are you here?!

962
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,660
Why are you in the men's sauna?

963
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,870
About that... I was doing my cleanup job at the sauna,

964
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,720
but I fell asleep.

965
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,530
- What? 
 - Joon Ki.

966
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,170
Please help me leave.

967
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,950
I'm so cold that I'm going to die.

968
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,250
Gosh, why would you...

969
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:55,590
Wait, wait, wait. Kim Jeong Eun.

970
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,140
Kim Jeong Eun?

971
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,160
 Chairman Kim?

972
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:04,790
Then, that dream...

973
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,790
What?

974
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:11,130
Heavens Sauna?

975
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,560
Heavens.

976
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,770
Then, that dream was this?

977
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,360
Oh, that's so funny!

978
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,490
What? So, that Kim Jeong Eun wasn't the one up there,

979
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,110
but this Kim Jeong Eun? And it wasn't the view of the heavens from Mt. Baekdu, but the sauna?

980
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,240
Yeah!

981
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,550
Gosh, she really is no help in life.

982
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,810
Stop it! Did I do it intentionally?

983
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,760
How much money are you trying to earn, working all the time like that?

984
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,710
It seems like she is totally obsessed with money.

985
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,120
Stop it, I said!

986
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,950
What? Why's she being like that?

987
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,500
Why else? It's because of you.

988
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,810
Gosh, you really don't watch your mouth.

989
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,700
What are you doing here?

990
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,630
I'm sorry! I was being too harsh.

991
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,560
Forget it.

992
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,850
That's why you should go easy on part-time jobs.

993
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:25,960
You can't even sleep. You're tired, so that's why that happened.

994
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,380
Is money that urgent?

995
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,890
It's not because of money.

996
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,860
Then, why are you working so hard?

997
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:35,560
Because I might want to do it again. I might feel greedy.

998
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,630
What?

999
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,710
Acting.

1000
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,820
You can just start again!

1001
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,650
Actually, I gave up on acting.

1002
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:49,380
You know, too. I don't have any talent when it comes to acting.

1003
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,990
What are you saying?

1004
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:55,380
- You've done so much until now. 
 - You want me to try it until the end?

1005
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,770
But, what if it still doesn't work out?

1006
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:06,430
That's so scary and nerve-wracking. It's hard, too.

1007
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,690
So I gave up on it.

1008
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:17,070
So, did you feel better after giving up?

1009
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:21,020
You didn't. It made it harder.

1010
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,980
Am I wrong?

1011
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:31,920
Alright, I do random auditions and have side roles with no lines.

1012
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,640
It makes me nervous and tired.

1013
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:40,840
But, you know why I'm not giving up? It's harder if I give up.

1014
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:46,610
Living life while doing something I don't want to do is going to be a hundred, no a thousand times harder.

1015
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:52,560
Jeong Eun. If it's hard to give up and hard to not give up,

1016
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,880
isn't it better to suffer while doing what you want?

1017
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:01,130
Maybe I'm stupid, but it sounds right.

1018
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,150
Maybe it's not.

1019
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,200
I'm going to go and eat.

1020
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,490
Come and eat. I'll be off.

1021
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,800
  Waikiki / Enjoy Today

1022
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,990
- Hey, hey! Lee Joon Ki. Let's go together! 
 - Huh?

1023
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,330
Let's go.

1024
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,590
- You're going to pass around your profile, right? 
 - Yeah.

1025
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,530
There are a lot of new movies coming up.

1026
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:31,120
Really? Then, I'll go with you.

1027
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,920
What? Go together?

1028
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,390
- You're going to start acting again?  
 - Huh? Well...

1029
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:45,520
Maybe I'm stupid too, but what you said was right.

1030
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,700
If it's going to be hard anyway, I might as well do what I want.

1031
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,360
Hey!

1032
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,660
I guess dumb people like us just have to work harder, right?

1033
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,090
Do you have your profile?

1034
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,960
Of course I do.

1035
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,160
What's all of this?

1036
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,970
Look.

1037
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,260
What is this?!

1038
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,200
Stop it! It won't work!

1039
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,590
No! No! It won't work!

1040
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,190
What's this pose? It's not the 1980s.

1041
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,300
It's because it's from a while ago.

1042
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,810
But, isn't it sexy?

1043
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:23,290
Sexy? Sexy? Sexy? What are you saying?

1044
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:25,260
Do you even know the definition of sexy?

1045
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,100
Look at this! You look like a dumpling!

1046
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:31,890
Dumpling? Hey! I told you not to call me that.

1047
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,630
I'm sorry, Dumping. I mean, Jeong Eun.

  It's been so long. Do you think I'll do well?

1059
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:07,260
  What is your name?

1060
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,920
  Are you okay? You're very scared, right?

1061
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,730
  What happened to your friend?

1062
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,120
  - You said she acted well! 
 - She was fired?

1063
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,350
  What? Blind date?

1064
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,600
 He said he'll teach me forkball if I introduce you to him.

  Oh, how handsome.

  My ideal type!

  What? What's wrong with his laughter?

  Why's it like that?

1069

  Soo Yeon's ideal type is a nice boy.

01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,390
  A nice boy?

1071
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,390
  - Woo Sik, teach me how to sing. 
 - Never get angry in front of Soo Yeon.
