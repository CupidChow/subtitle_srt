1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,240
It's late, so you should get going.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,910
Already?

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,210
Teacher, how about we go somewhere and have a cup of coffee?

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,090
What do you mean coffee at this hour?

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,200
Why not? It's not even 9 pm yet. Let's go.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,470
Alright then.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,870
Oh, my head.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Where am I? There's no way my room would be this clean.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
What's this?

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,450
So loud.

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,530
Gi Bong. I'm sleeping. Be quiet.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,860
What? Why are you here?!

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,590
I don't know. What on earth happened?

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,500
Wait. Hold on.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,870
So, last night, we sold a lot

16
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,610
so you and I had drinks in my room to celebrate.

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,110
  How cute!

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,300
  Oh, stop it!

19
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,290
No way.

20
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,180
Then... You and I...

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,500
Noona, I'm coming in!

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,600
Hey, hide!

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,140
Noona, I have big news! What the heck? Do you even know what time it is?

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Oh, what a relief.

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,550
Huh? But... Who?

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,270
Oh, this is my friend.

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,150
Friend? Who?

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,200
Gi Soon. You don't know her.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,910
Really? When did she come in? I didn't see.

30
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,240
Oh, she came in a bit late last night when everyone was sleeping.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, I see.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,540
But, wow, she's so tall. Her feet are so big, too!

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,840
Oh, she used to be a basketball player!

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,940
Oh, really?

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,400
But, why are you here?

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,610
Oh, right. There's a leak in one of the ceilings in the guest room. It's total chaos.

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,590
So, we're trying to find the source of the leak. I think I'll have to take a look here.

38
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,100
Right now? Can't you do it later?

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,390
No, I've already looked at the other rooms. Your room is the only one left.

40
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,200
The repairman is waiting, so get up. Wake your friend up, too.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,640
Alright, so go out for now. I'll come out once I get changed.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,770
Alright, come out then.

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,390
Noona. What do we do now?

44
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,730
I don't know! For now, let's change first.

45
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,380
Change!

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
Noona, you're not ready yet? The repairman is waiting!

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,490
Alright! Just wait a bit! Hurry up!

48
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,400
- But what do we do? What do we do? 
 - I don't know.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
Hide for now. Hide.

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,390
Oh, there.

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,100
Noona, you're done, right? We're coming in!

52
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,120
Oh, what'd take you so long? What? Why is she still lying down?

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,100
Oh, she's just so sick that she can't move.

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,850
Oh, really? We have to search this whole room, though.

55
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,900
Just do it. Leave her to sleep.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,990
It'll be noisy, though. Oh, well we have no choice. You can start now.

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,180
Alright. I'll start here.

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,330
Alright, I'll help.

59
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,800
Alright.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,530
But, have you seen Gi Bong?

61
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,660
Gi Bong? No, I haven't.

62
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,600
Oh, where did he go? I didn't see him all night.

63
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Didn't he drink with you last night?

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,530
Oh, yeah, we drank but only for a bit. He left right afterward.

65
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,110
Oh, really? Should I call him?

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,430
Oh, his phone is turned off. What is he doing?

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,000
He must've gone over to a friend's house. Woo Sik, I'll hold onto the ladder, so you can leave and see to your business.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,100
Okay. Thank you.

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,550
Unni! Unni! I have an audition tomorrow...

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
Who's that?

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Her friend. Gi Soon.

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,910
Oh, really? But, why's she like this?

73
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,700
She's so sick that she can't move.

74
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,520
- Anyway, Noona, I'll leave this to you. 
 - Alright.

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,120
Jeong Eun, what's the matter? What is it?

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,050
I have an audition tomorrow. Could you lend me some clothes?

77
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,300
There are clothes here, so you can choose whatever and leave quickly. Yeah?

78
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,120
Thank you, Unni.

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,580
Did you find the water leak?

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,100
No. They're looking in my sister's room. But, you've been at home a lot lately. You're not filming Nice Man?

81
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,460
I stopped it. They said it was only a matter of time for me to become a star if I did that.

82
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,630
But no one's looking for me and I've failed all my auditions. It's not looking great.

83
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,160
Yes, Director? What?

84
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh, yes, I'll be there. Right there!

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,700
What is it?

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,190
Oh, a director I know said someone playing a side role bailed. He told me to come quickly. I'll be going!

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
I should go finish my song.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,700
Woo Sik!

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,780
Oh, Soo Yeon? You didn't go to film today?

90
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,020
No, I have today off. So, Woo Sik...

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,130
Here.

92
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,100
What is it?

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,440
Open it.

94
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,670
Oh, okay.

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,390
How'd you get this?

96
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,660
Well, I got my first paycheck recently, so I got you a gift.

97
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,900
You were upset about it breaking a while ago.

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,650
Thank you. This must've been so expensive and hard to get.

99
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,370
No, it was pretty easy.

100
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,700
Thanks so much! I'll listen to it well.

101
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,830
Yeah. But, who was the person you were with in front of the guesthouse yesterday?

102
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,450
Who? Oh, Mi Na?

103
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,600
She's a kid I used to give vocal lessons to.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,290
- But, she's debuting soon. She'll be singing the song I made too. 
 - What?

105
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,400
You're not singing it?

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,600
It just happened that way. But I need to start producing for the kid soon

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,990
so I'll be a bit busy. I'm going to go work in my studio.

108
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,220
Alright. Yeah.

109
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,790
Thanks.

110
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,250
Hello? Yes, Mi Na? What? A date?

111
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,400
Gosh, look at you, kiddo, saying whatever you want to your teacher.

112
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,690
Alright. Let me know if you have any questions. Yeah.

113
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,730
Unni, is this better or is this one better?

114
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,100
Both are great. Both.

115
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,650
Really? But, this is a bit too revealing.

116
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,290
Well, you can wear the other one.

117
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,700
But... I like this pattern better.

118
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,680
Wear that, then!

119
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,920
Unni, can't you care a bit more and help me choose?

120
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,430
Gosh. Just take both of them and leave! Leave!

121
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,000
Gosh. What is it now? Hold on, sir.

122
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,000
Hello? What? Really?

123
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,950
Alright.

124
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,990
What happened?

125
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,030
There's smoke coming from my food truck.

126
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,100
Gi Bong drank yesterday, so we left it in the plaza. What do I do?

127
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,290
You need to go!

128
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,800
Gosh. This isn't the situation for that.

129
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,700
This is driving me nuts. Hey, Gi Soon!

130
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,860
I'll be right back,

131
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,240
so don't do anything! Just stay right there, okay?

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,050
Jeong Eun, can you hold onto the ladder?

133
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,980
Alright.

134
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,630
If you let go of this, it'll be a huge problem.

135
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,500
Be safe!

136
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,420
 Filming In Progress

137
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,250
- Director, I'm here! 
 - Oh, you're here!

138
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,700
Gosh, I'm sorry for contacting you so quickly. An actor backed out suddenly.

139
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh, no, it's fine. I'm thankful that you called for me. What is the role?

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,180
Well, our main character is a doctor.

141
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,200
You'll be playing the husband of a female patient who died because of the doctor's mistake.

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,890
You'll be getting revenge on the main character.

143
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,240
- Oh, revenge? 
 - Hurry and read the script.

144
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,500
- Hey, here. 
 - Thank you.

145
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,530
Man, I always got side roles. I'll finally be able to show proper acting for once!

146
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,000
Hello, hello.  Oh, Joon Ki!

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,540
Hyeon Seong! Oh, right.

148
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,830
- Oh, you're the main character of this drama, right? 
 - Yeah.

149
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,000
- What brings you here? 
 - Huh?

150
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,150
Oh, they said they needed me to fill in for somebody suddenly.

151
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,070
Oh, you're playing that role? How great!

152
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,800
What? You two know each other?

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,330
Yes, he's a senior from my college. What have you been up to these days? I saw you on that children's show a while ago.

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,230
Ah, well, I've been doing this and that.

155
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Now, shall we try a rehearsal?

156
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,710
Yes, Director.

157
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,600
Kang Chul San. It's all because of you.

158
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,170
You killed her. You killed Yeong Sook!

159
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,860
Just you wait.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,250
I'll destroy you.

161
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,680
I'll destroy you!

162
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,280
Wow, look at your acting! It's great!

163
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,380
Thank you!

164
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,970
Alright, let's film.

165
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,300
Yes, Director.

166
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,800
Director, we have a big problem.

167
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,900
What is it?

168
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,090
There's a product placement we left out. I should've used it at the last shoot, but I forgot.

169
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,600
Hey, today's the last episode! How could you tell me that now?

170
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,470
This is driving me nuts.

171
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,320
- What's the product? 
 - This. It's a vegetable chopper.

172
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
What? Hey.

173
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,400
The only scenes left are the husband getting revenge for his wife. How can we put in a vegetable chopper?

174
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,110
But, if we don't do this, it'll be violating our contract with them. What do we do?

175
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,570
Violating the contract?

176
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,370
Gosh, what do I do?

177
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
Ready.

178
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,880
Action!

179
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,430
Kang Chul San, it's all because of you.

180
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,100
You killed her. You killed Yeong Sook!

181
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,450
Just you wait. I'll

182
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,270
destroy you.

183
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,670
I'll destroy you!

184
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,280
Even though I hit it only 5 times,

185
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,620
the picture was sliced perfectly to the size that I wanted.

186
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,420
If it can do this to paper, it'll be perfect for chopping vegetables.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,370
Okay!

188
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,380
Then next, let's do a check on the tight shot.

189
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,160
Wait, Director.

190
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,780
Is that okay? I don't think ripping the picture with a vegetable chopper in this situation is right.

191
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,080
Why not? You're not ripping it,

192
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,410
you're just angry enough to chop it up.

193
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, but this is a bit...

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,490
What? You can't do it?

195
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,710
Well, if you won't be seeing me in the future, you can just not do it.

196
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:30,130
Oh, no, no! I will do it! I can do it.

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,320
I hear the water. I think it's somewhere here.

198
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,040
Oh, really?

199
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,600
Yes. We'll have to make a hole and then insert a tube to examine it. I can do that, right?

200
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,360
There's nothing we can do about it. Go ahead.

201
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,980
Alright, where should I make the hole?

202
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,200
Oh, oh, Miss! Are you okay?

203
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,510
Isn't she hurt? Miss, can you check?

204
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,700
Yes. Unni, are you okay?

205
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,760
Why isn't she responding? Unni, are you okay?

206
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm fine.

207
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,020
What the heck? Why is your voice..?

208
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,600
I have a bad cold, so...

209
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Gosh, I'm sorry for doing that when you're sick.

210
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,020
It's okay.

211
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,920
I should do it again.

212
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,230
Oh, what the heck? Why isn't it working? This ceiling is so sturdy.

213
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,520
Oh, Miss!

214
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,950
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,450
I'm okay.

216
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,000
You should be careful! Unni, are you okay? Let me see.

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,990
I'm okay!

218
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,240
I'm really okay!

219
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,220
I don't think she's okay.

220
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,010
I'm really okay, I said!

221
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,700
Stop it!

222
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,540
Alright, in this scene,

223
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,730
the character, who lost his wife, goes to the main character's house to get revenge.

224
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,620
You need to focus on showing your anger.

225
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,700
Alright, Director.

226
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,360
Director! We have a problem.

227
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,780
- What is it now?! What?! 
 - Mi Sun says she can't do the product placement.

228
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,490
Oh, what to do.

229
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,600
She says it's a violation of a contract she has with a rival product so she can't do it.

230
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,280
Tell another actor to do it!

231
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,030
No, they're all not doing it.

232
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,100
What is the product placement for?

233
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,800
It's this.

234
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,630
An LED mask.

235
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,260
That's huge.

236
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,160
Gosh, who can we use it on?

237
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,510
What?

238
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,100
Ready! Action!

239
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,590
Get up! Won't you get up?!

240
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,000
What the heck? What is it?

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,700
Who are you?

242
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,510
What's the matter, honey! Oh, my!

243
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,520
Who are you? Who?!

244
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,600
Do you remember Kim Yeong Sook?

245
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,440
Kim Yeong Sook? Do you mean the patient that was hospitalized for arrhythmia?

246
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,700
That's right! You were performing surgery on a CEO of a huge conglomerate,

247
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,310
so her surgery got pushed back and she died before you could do anything!

248
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:33,510
I was her husband. My Yeong Sook

249
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,200
is buried in the cold ground, never to see sunlight again.

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,910
But your wife was using this LED mask,

251
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,900
perfect for brightening, erasing wrinkles, and skin elasticity?!

252
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,900
So, that's why your wife's face is so clear and nice, like a baby's.

253
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,740
What do you want?

254
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,570
I want your life.

255
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,290
Die!

256
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,400
Cut! Okay!

257
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,600
Gosh. Good work.

258
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,530
Thank you. Director, but, will this really be okay?

259
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,300
I came to get revenge, but appearing with an LED mask is a bit...

260
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,150
Why not? The LED mask brings out red light by your eyes and creates a malicious feeling.

261
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,820
Hey, hey. We're going to switch up the angle and do it again.

262
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,360
This is driving me nuts.

263
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,460
Is this acting or advertising? What the heck?

264
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,990
Woo Sik! I'm going to go grocery shopping. Do you want to come along? I'm going to buy some sweet pancakes on the way back.

265
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,500
Oh, I have to leave in a bit.

266
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,650
Mi Na said she has business in the area so we're going to get food together.

267
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,010
Oh, really? Oh well then. I'll be going off.

268
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,680
- Move!
  - Oh my!

269
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,390
I think something just passed by.

270
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,810
I think it was my sister. What's with her?

271
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,420
Jeong Eun.

272
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,510
Oh, you're here? What about the food truck?

273
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,150
It was a small fire, but we put it out.

274
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,180
I can hold the ladder now so you can go.

275
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,660
Okay.

276
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,320
Unni, thank you for the clothes!

277
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,300
Gi Bong. Gi Soon! Are you okay?

278
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,130
Hey! What's with your face?

279
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,850
It just happened. But what do we do now?

280
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,120
You should escape now.

281
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,210
Noona!

282
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,830
- What? 
 - Why are you getting so scared?

283
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,920
I wasn't scared. What is it?

284
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, I was just wondering if you found the water leak.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,560
Oh, I don't know. Has he found it?

286
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,660
Oh, it's here.

287
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,700
I found the leak.

288
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,680
What do we do now?

289
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,330
We need to take a bit of the ceiling out to fix it. 3-4 hours would be enough.

290
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,100
Okay, you can get started right away.

291
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,470
But something might fall during the repair, so I think this lady will have to move.

292
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,500
Oh, is that so? Then, Noona, you should wake your friend up. Let's move her to another room.

293
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,700
But, Gi Soon sweats a lot.

294
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,410
We'll have to change her clothes. Can you just leave a bit?

295
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,540
Alright. Sir, let's step out for a bit.

296
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,000
Sure.

297
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,420
Noona. What do we do?

298
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,960
I don't know. What do we do?

299
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,540
What do we do?

300
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,080
Oh, Noona.

301
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,910
Alright, we have one more scene left. Let's get it in one take.

302
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,150
- Alright! 
 - Ready!

303
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,050
Hold on. Director.

304
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,500
What is it this time? Now what?!

305
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,820
I got a call from the head of the department, and we got an additional product placement.

306
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,920
What? An additional product placement?

307
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,200
We have one last scene left. What are you saying?

308
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,760
Tell him we can't do it!

309
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,300
The director said that we don't need to do it if we don't plan on seeing him in the future.

310
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,730
What?

311
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,700
Gosh!

312
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,610
Ready, action!

313
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,930
Ha, ha, so fun! So fun!

314
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,700
It automatically puts you in balance, how wonderful.

315
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,060
But, what will you do? You won't be able to use something as great as this again.

316
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,470
What do you want us to do?

317
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,890
Sir, please save us! Please!

318
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,800
Shut up!

319
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,790
Shut your mouths!

320
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,020
Now it's quieter.

321
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,110
I thought it was only a product to help skin elasticity. How multi-functional.

322
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,150
You want to live?

323
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,600
Then try flapping it harder. Until your cheek fat disappears!

324
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,710
Show your will to live! Hurry!

325
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,730
But, why did you ignore my wife when she asked you to save her life?

326
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,270
Why did you ignore her?!

327
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,220
Do you have anything to say?

328
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,700
Let's wrap things up now, shall we?

329
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,900
We can't forget about music in this situation.

330
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,250
Sinbad.

331
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,980
Yes, Master?

332
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,570
Play music that is good to hear before you die.

333
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,280
Yes. I will play music that is good to hear before you die.

334
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,550
Oh, what a clever thing.

335
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,780
She understands my commands precisely and chose the perfect music.

336
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,650
How is it? Is it nice to hear?

337
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,190
I asked you if it was nice to hear!

338
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,560
Time is up.

339
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,800
Goodbye.

340
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,790
I forgot about erasing the evidence.

341
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,670
My hair may have fallen on the floor and could be used to cross-check DNA. Just a moment.

342
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,410
 Cleaning is starting.

343
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,780
Thanks to this movable vacuum, my hair strands and all the dust in every corner in the house will be gone!

344
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,400
Perfect!

345
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,750
Alright, let's finish this for real now.

346
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,060
Cut. Okay. Everyone, good work.

347
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,370
Good work.

348
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,780
Good work.

349
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,020
Hyung, good work.

350
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,700
Yeah, you, too.

351
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,950
Hyung. It's been a while. Should we go for drinks?

352
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,250
Drinks? I'm a bit tired today, so let's do it next time.

353
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,130
Alright.

354
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,700
I'll be going first.

355
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,650
Noona, what's taking you so long? He's busy! Hurry!

356
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,830
Okay!

357
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,360
Wow, she's so tall.

358
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,460
Oh, I'm sorry for doing this to you while you're sick. You should rest in another room.

359
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,900
No, Gi Soon is going home now.

360
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,770
Oh, really? Can you take her by yourself? Should I drop her off?

361
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,270
No! It's fine. I can do it by myself.

362
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,430
I have to meet someone, so I was on my way out. I'll give her a ride.

363
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,020
No, I said it's fine! Just do what you're supposed to do!

364
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,500
Okay! Why are you getting mad when I'm saying I'll help?

365
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,610
Well, Gi Soon is just so shy, so...

366
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,450
Oh, really? Well, have a safe trip home, Noona!

367
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,830
Let's go, Gi Soon.

368
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,450
Are you okay?

369
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,510
She's okay. Just go on.

370
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,900
Gi Soon! Are you okay? Get up! Hurry!

371
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,860
You're okay, right?

372
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,700
Wait.

373
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,010
What is it, Brother?

374
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,120
You have to take the sunglasses and the hat.

375
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,200
That? No, it's fine. Just leave that.

376
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,870
What are you saying? This is Gi Soon's.

377
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,160
It's fine, though.

378
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,270
- What do we do? 
 - Gi Bong.

379
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,830
Run!

380
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,200
Oh, Noona! Take this with you!

381
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,910
She doesn't need her hat.

382
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,750
She doesn't!

383
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,740
What? What's with her?

384
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,720
She's too shy. I told you.

385
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,700
But, she's so shy to the point where she'll jump off the second floor? Isn't she hurt?

386
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,160
It's fine. She's quite athletic.

387
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,080
Oh, my legs.

388
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,140
Gosh, how am I supposed to face Yoo Ri again?

389
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,900
I should stay the night at a sauna and go back in tomorrow.

390
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,310
I have to get out of the area before I get caught by the others.

391
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,500
Hurry up. Ow! My legs!

392
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,530
I thought I was going to have a heart attack because of Woo Sik!

393
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,360
Is Gi Bong okay? He probably got away, right?

394
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,300
But why would he do something like that?

395
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,950
How am I supposed to face him again? This is driving me nuts!

396
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,390
Gosh. I was going to act for real this time, but

397
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:28,000
what is this?! I'm grateful for the gift, but...

398
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,150
Where would I use this?

399
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,180
I can give it to Jeong Eun. Yeah, Jeong Eun.

400
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:44,380
Ow! My knee!

401
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,790
Miss, you should watch where you're going.

402
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
Miss, are you okay?

403
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,800
  This is driving me nuts. What do I do?

404
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,900
Miss, get up! Miss! What?

405
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,160
Miss, where are you going? Miss! Gosh!

406
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,620
That's my mask! Give it back!

407
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,140
How is she so fast?

408
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,360
Gosh, why'd she take my LED mask?

409
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,380
This is for Yoo Ri Unni, and you, and you, and you.

410
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,980
Thanks.

411
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,750
What's with the mask pack all of a sudden?

412
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:35,200
Well, I got my first paycheck the other day. So I got you all presents, though it isn't much.

413
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,300
What do you mean?

414
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,350
It looks so cute. Thank you! I'll use it well.

415
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,000
No, it's fine. I've caused so much trouble until now.

416
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,730
This smells so good

417
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,670
and it's totally my style. Thanks, Soo Yeon. I'll use it well.

418
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,600
But, if it wasn't for that giant lady, I would've given you an LED mask.

419
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,750
What are you saying?

420
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,610
Oh, I got an LED mask from a shoot, but a giant lady stole it on the street.

421
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,500
She better not show up in front of me. I have all the evidence.

422
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,820
I don't see Gi Bong though.

423
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,420
He's still not here. We have to work here. Where did he go?

424
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,310
Noona, has Gi Bong not contacted you?

425
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,220
- Noona! Noona!  
 - Yeah?

426
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,020
What is it?

427
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,740
Have you not heard from Gi Bong?

428
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,500
Why are you asking me? I don't know!

429
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,610
Why are you getting all mad if you don't know?

430
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,990
Noona, did you fight with Gi Bong again? That's why he's not coming in, right?

431
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,140
No.

432
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,700
Hey, Gook Gi Bong. Where did you go?

433
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,830
I was at a friend's house.

434
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,510
You should've let us know! We were worried.

435
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,130
I'm sorry. I'm tired, so I'll be sleeping.

436
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,100
Me, too. I'm going to my room.

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,340
What? Why are they like that?

438
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,250
Those two definitely fought again.

439
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,040
So awkward. So awkward!

440
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,160
I can't even look at her face. We have to go work at the food truck soon. What do I do?

441
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,990
Gosh, how could that happen?

442
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,160
But... Was it really a mistake?

443
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,430
Then, do I...

444
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm crazy. How could I do that with Gi Bong?

445
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,710
Why? Why would I?

446
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,300
Well, she has a nice personality and a pretty face.

447
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,830
She comforted me when I got kicked off the team. She's a good person.

448
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,500
Well, Gi Bong is nice and cute.

449
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,710
He even used his last paycheck to get me my food truck.

450
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,500
But, still. I've never thought of him as a man.

451
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,560
But I've never seen her as a woman!

452
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,700
Then... Does she like me?

453
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,650
Then... Does Gi Bong like me?

454
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:30,240
What do I do, then? Gosh, he's making things so difficult.

455
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,590
How complicated.

456
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,970
How nice.

457
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,860
Anyway, when they fought all the time then suddenly said they were going to run a food truck together, I knew this was going to happen.

458
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,410
What did they fight over this time?

459
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,780
I don't even know. They won't even answer when I ask.

460
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,800
They probably fought over nothing. Don't worry about it.

461
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,780
Yes, hello? Yes, that's me.

462
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,340
Oh, yeah. What's up?

463
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,870
Hyung. If you have time today, do you want to audition for something?

464
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,700
Audition? What audition?

465
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,980
There's a role that hasn't been cast yet for a movie I'm shooting.

466
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,990
So, I recommended you, and the director wants to see you.

467
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,800
Really? Oh, I'd be grateful.

468
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,000
Right, I got it. I'll get ready and come quickly.

469
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,040
What is that? You got an audition? Who introduced you?

470
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,000
Hyeon Seong.

471
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,640
Hyeon Seong? The one from our department?

472
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,900
Yeah. I saw him by coincidence at the filming site yesterday.

473
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,450
Hey, Lee Joon Ki. You've been put through so much because of him. You want to go to the audition he got for you?

474
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,490
It's all in the past. I'll be off.

475
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,960
What happened? What was Joon Ki put through?

476
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,280
Well... You know the actor Kim Hyeon Seong, right?

477
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,060
Yeah, he's so popular nowadays.

478
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,400
- But, he was an underclassman at your school? 
 - Yeah.

479
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,260
Actually, there was a movie that Joon Ki was cast in as the main character a while back.

480
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,000
Someone backed that bastard and he stole Joon Ki's role. That movie, "Nineteen."

481
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,100
"Nineteen"? That was so famous! But, Joon Ki was supposed to be the main character?

482
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,360
Yeah. Gosh, is he not even angry?

483
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,200
That fool.

484
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,120
A nation? What exactly is the nation you're speaking of?

485
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,260
I know.

486
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,300
I know it so well. Article I, Clause I, of the Constitution of Korea!

487
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,380
All sovereignty in the Republic of Korea comes from the people, and all rights belong to the people! It's a nation for the people!

488
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,700
But the nation you're speaking of? Stealing the power of this nation and giving it to the military?

489
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,950
That can't be!

490
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,500
Tell the truth.

491
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,500
Is this true patriotism?

492
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,200
Yes, that's it.

493
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,530
Wow, thank you. No wonder Hyeon Seong recommended you.

494
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,340
Thank you.

495
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,040
That's great. Let's work well together.

496
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,460
So, you're going to cast me?

497
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,990
With this big role?

498
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,000
Why?

499
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,290
You don't want it?

500
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,270
No, I'd love it!

501
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,880
Thank you, I will work hard!

502
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,910
Thank you, thank you so much.

503
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,120
Thank you so much.

504
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,240
  Even If The World Deceives You

505
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,210
  Even If The World Deceives You

506
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,600
Hello, I am Special Forces Reporter Han Soo Yeon.

507
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,110
We heard about a special cat, so we came to Yangyang in Gangwon Province.

508
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,560
Yangyang... Oh!

509
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,130
Should I help?

510
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,630
It's fine. You must be busy getting ready for the shoot. Just do what you have to do.

511
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,450
What are you filming tomorrow?

512
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,610
In Yangyang of Gangwon Province, there's a talking cat.

513
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,070
A talking cat?

514
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,960
Yes! When it wakes up, it goes to the door and says, "I want to leave! I want to leave!"

515
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,630
Really? I guess it says, "I want to go in! I want to go in!" too.

516
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,690
Yeah! It does.

517
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,490
Really?

518
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,980
And, if it's hungry, it says, "I'm hungry! I'm hungry!"

519
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,460
Wow, is that a human or a cat?

520
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,110
- Teacher. 
 - Oh.

521
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,130
What? How are you here?

522
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,070
Woo Sik, who is she?

523
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,540
Oh, she's one of my students. I gave her vocal lessons before.

524
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,400
Hello. I am Choi Mi Na.

525
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,800
Hello.

526
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,990
What's this, all of a sudden?

527
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,760
I had a few questions about the song you produced.

528
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,470
Alright.

529
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,260
Let's go up to the studio.

530
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,090
The studio is a bit stuffy.

531
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,660
It's nice out. How about we go talk outside? I'll buy us ice cream.

532
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,530
What? Gosh, we're not even kids. Why ice cream?

533
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,120
I want to have some.

534
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,150
- Let's go, Teacher. 
 - Let go, will you?

535
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,020
Hey.

536
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,840
Bye!

537
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,620
Soo Yeon, don't you think that girl's interested in Woo Sik?

538
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,150
What? I'm not sure.

539
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm 100% sure. I have great instincts.

540
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,700
Yes, Joon Ki?

541
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,230
What? You passed? Really?

542
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,600
Yeah, yeah!

543
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,400
Yeah!

544
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,590
It's the opposing role of the main character. There's a lot of lines! The character's really great, too!

545
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,190
Hey, this isn't a dream, right?

546
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,250
You can try pinching your cheek, then.

547
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,320
Cheek? Okay, hold on.

548
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,110
What?

549
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,030
Ow, it hurts! It hurts so much!

550
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,320
This isn't a dream!

551
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,090
- You're that happy?  
 - Yeah.

552
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,330
It's nice, so nice. It's the best.

553
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,390
I'll be home soon, so let's have a celebratory drink!

554
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,600
Yeah, yeah! Goodbye! Yeah!

555
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,180
- Director. 
 - Yeah?

556
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,890
Will Lee Joon Ki be okay?

557
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,810
There's no other way.

558
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,590
But, giving someone without that much experience such a big role...

559
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,260
I'm a bit uneasy about it, too,

560
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,760
but Hyeon Seong said that if he isn't cast, he wouldn't do the film.

561
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,450
It'll be a huge problem if he doesn't.

562
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,260
Gosh, people being backed are the real problem. It's so cheap and dirty.

563
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,510
  Yuri's Kitchen 31

564
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,280
Then, should we start?

565
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,770
Yeah, sure.

566
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,750
Noona, hold on.

567
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,310
Yeah, what?

568
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:06,120
The thing that happened a few days ago was a mistake, right?

569
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,190
  What? A mistake?

570
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,200
  A mistake? He didn't like me?

571
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,080
  So what? That's a relief, a relief.

572
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,640
Of course. It was a mistake.

573
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,670
It's all because of alcohol. Let's just say it never happened.

574
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,110
It never happened.

575
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,660
  It never happened? Then, she doesn't like me?

576
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,900
  Great, then.

577
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,640
Yeah. It never happened.

578
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,080
Yeah! Let's do that. Let's just start the business.

579
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,290
Okay!

580
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,460
  Yuri's Kitchen

581
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
  What? A mistake?

582
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,240
  Is this something that just ends if we say it was a mistake?

583
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,960
  Gosh, he doesn't even have a bit of responsibility.

584
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,160
  What? It never happened?

585
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,530
  So, something that happened never happened?

586
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,490
  Gosh, she lives such an easy life.

587
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,560
What's this?

588
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
Hey, Gook Gi Bong. You did this, right?

589
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,860
What?

590
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,100
The pepper's in the salt tube!

591
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,690
What? I'm sorry. I must have made a mistake.

592
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,630
What?

593
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,920
A mistake? A mistake, you said?

594
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,580
How could you always make mistakes?

595
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,670
This was the first time!

596
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,030
And, you're in charge of the kitchen.

597
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,330
We divided the kitchen and waiter roles when we weren't selling.

598
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,330
Whatever, we'll say it never happened.

599
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,010
What? It never happened?

600
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,000
It never happened, you say?

601
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,520
Noona, do you think that the problem gets solved when you say that something never happened?

602
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,690
What? Are you trying to pick a fight?

603
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,340
Whatever. Let's just not talk.

604
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,070
That's what I wanted too.

605
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,780
Joon Ki passed, so shouldn't we throw a party?

606
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,860
Of course, we should.

607
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,120
He's going to be a star now.

608
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,580
He's gone through so much. Maybe things are finally looking up for him now.

609
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,790
I'm here.

610
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,530
Did things go well on your date?

611
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,090
It's not a date. We just had tea.

612
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,600
And she's a student of mine.

613
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,760
She didn't just seem like a student. Hey, hey.

614
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,400
From what I see, she likes you. I'm sure of it.

615
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,490
Shush! You're saying nonsense.

616
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,290
  Teacher, I got home safely.

617
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,210
  It was so great to see you today. I'll see you soon.

618
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,260
What is it? Is it Mi Na?

619
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,720
Yeah. She said she got back safely.

620
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,410
What's this? What is this?

621
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,010
What? Let me see.

622
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,220
Why'd she only send letters?

623
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,440
What is this supposed to mean? No way...

624
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,980
What do you mean no way?

625
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,370
No, kids these days only send letters like that

626
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,330
and confess their true feelings.

627
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,660
What? What are you saying?

628
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,130
Hey, let's see. I'll analyze it.

629
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,510
You don't have to analyze it. It's not like that.

630
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,090
- You're saying useless things. 
 - Hey.

631
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,420
My instincts have never failed me! Hey!

632
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,500
I'm sure. I'm confident.

633
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,250
Why won't this scrub off?

634
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,850
Why isn't this opening up?

635
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,490
Excuse me.

636
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,500
You're going to order? The menu is over there.

637
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,100
No, it's not that. I just wanted you to have this while you work.

638
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,420
Thank you.

639
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,220
You are player Gook Gi Bong, right?

640
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,650
You got the Best Player award Bang Mun University, right? I've been a huge fan since high school.

641
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,430
Really?

642
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,360
Oh, I still have fans!

643
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,300
This is my business card. I'd like to buy you dinner sometime.

644
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,690
Oh, I'd be grateful.

645
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,190
Thank you.

646
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,360
Thank you.

647
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,160
Hey, Gook Gi Bong. What are you doing instead of working?

648
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,500
What? I cleaned and set up the tables.

649
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,440
Is that it?

650
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,770
You have to organize the utensils and the chopsticks.

651
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,030
You need to chase out the flies!

652
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,600
Alright, alright. You're getting mad for nothing.

653
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,600
Then, thank you for the drink.

654
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,020
Oh, yes. I'll see you next time.

655
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,990
Thank you!

656
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,820
Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon!

657
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,630
Isn't that Woo Sik's phone?

658
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,520
Yeah! Woo Sik was sleeping, so I got it without him knowing.

659
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,530
- Why? 
 - I wanted to analyze Mi Na's text.

660
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,530
I'm pretty sure she confessed to him.

661
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,550
- Do you want to do it with me? 
 - What?

662
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,650
No, I have a lot to do. I'm not really interested.

663
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,490
Is that so? Okay.

664
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,690
Then, where should we start?

665
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,580
Here it is.

666
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,240
B... L... What is this?

667
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,650
Oh, is it this?

668
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:44,170
Bruce Lee's abs are scary. New Journey to the West.

669
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,160
Bruce Lee's lottery will be given to you. Shower head.

670
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,830
No? Is it not Bruce Lee?

671
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,100
Gosh, what is it?

672
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,290
What could it be?

673
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,240
This sound?

674
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,750
Maybe it's a word that has the characters W and S.

675
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,550
Is that so?

676
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,720
W and S...

677
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,460
But, you said you weren't interested.

678
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,090
I'm not interested, but I'm curious since you're doing this next to me.

679
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,380
Really?

680
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,270
But, what words are there that start with W and S?

681
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,310
Wait. Woo Sik?

682
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,070
Yeah, it's Woo Sik! It is!

683
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,480
It was Woo Sik.

684
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,770
- Yoo Ri. 
 - Yes?

685
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,830
Try this.

686
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,930
Oh! Thank you!

687
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,680
No problem. I don't know if you'll like it or not.

688
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,580
- It looks delicious. 
 - Thank you.

689
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,950
Well, would you like to have a beer someday after work?

690
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,880
Beer? I'd love to!

691
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,190
I love beer.

692
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,490
- Me, too.  
 - I see.

693
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,350
Noona, what are you doing instead of working? Did you prepare all the ingredients?

694
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,020
I did everything.

695
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,660
Really? How much did you prepare?

696
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,760
A hundred servings.

697
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,800
A hundred servings? Is that enough? Prepare 200 servings!

698
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,010
What? Two-hundred servings?

699
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,930
What if we don't have enough customers?

700
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,640
Why do you think we won't have any?

701
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,550
Well, there's no guarantee that there will be.

702
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,860
I just feel like we will today. I feel it.

703
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,840
If we don't have enough customers, I'll buy everything. So. hurry and prepare the food.

704
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,580
Alright! Gosh, why are you being so fussy?

705
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,810
Thank you!

706
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,820
It looks good.

707
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,100
Sir, are you not going to prepare for business? You're really sticking around.

708
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,670
I will.

709
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,500
Kim Hyeon Seong.

710
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,430
Hyung, what brings you here?

711
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,210
Oh, right. I heard from the director. You got the role!

712
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,260
Congrats.

713
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,000
Congrats? For what?

714
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,190
What are you congratulating?

715
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,040
What's wrong?

716
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,250
I heard you asked the director.

717
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,810
Why did you? Why?!

718
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,350
Hyung, how'd you...?

719
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:22,750
You don't have to know. Just tell me why.

720
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:28,910
Well, I just thought the role would fit you. I'm also in your debt from before.

721
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:33,560
What? Debt? Did I ever tell you to repay me?

722
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,850
I won't work like this, so you tell the director

723
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,060
I'm not doing it.

724
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,320
Hyung, you're the same as always.

725
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,390
What?

726
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,400
Do you not get tired of acting so clean and proper?

727
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,000
In your eyes, you must see me as a bad person who stole your role because I had connections.

728
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,960
But, I don't regret it.

729
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,440
If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be in this spot.

730
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,970
What?

731
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,630
You little piece of trash!

732
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,400
Yeah, I'm trash. But, what about you being all clean?

733
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,970
You're a substitute, someone who runs in and does someone else's character when they bail. Aren't you?

734
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:23,200
Your pride won't feed you. And everyone else lives like this.

735
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,430
No matter how clean you try to be, no one will acknowledge it.

736
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,880
You know it's true!

737
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,240
Anyway, I repaid my debt to you.

738
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,280
So, whether you keep living pitifully like that or take that role,

739
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,660
it's your decision.

740
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,760
We have no more guests. Let's start closing up.

741
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,560
Alright.

742
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,360
But, you should go home first.

743
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,070
What? By myself?

744
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,940
I'm going to have a beer with the guy next door.

745
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,250
You can go home first.

746
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,960
What?!

747
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,460
Have this.

748
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,490
Thank you!

749
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,240
Let's have a drink!

750
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,890
Yes!

751
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,590
I can't believe I'm having a beer with you, Gook Gi Bong. What an honor!

752
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,590
An honor? No, no.

753
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,890
Shall we cheers?

754
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,140
- Should we? 
 - Yes!

755
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,470
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers.

756
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:56,250
But, what kind of relationship do you have with that lady?

757
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,480
She's just my friend's older sister. That's all.

758
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,410
But, even though she's a "noona," she is no help at all. She's no good!

759
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,770
No good at all!

760
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,270
Oh, so Gi Bong is your brother's friend.

761
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,310
I thought you two were dating at first because you seemed so close.

762
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,680
What? Me and him?

763
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,560
Gosh, that doesn't make sense at all.

764
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,770
I hate guys like him.

765
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:29,040
Even if I don't have a boyfriend, I'd never date someone like him.

766
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,780
Bo Ra, you should never misunderstand.

767
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,580
She's totally not my type.

768
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,640
Her personality is terrible, she's so shameless, wicked, and

769
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,950
she's the absolute worst!

770
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,910
The absolute worst!

771
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:49,980
Do you know what kind of man he is?

772
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,360
And, a while ago, he went on Quiz King

773
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,660
and answered "Euljiro Quack" instead of "Euljiro Duck"!

774
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,100
When we were in school, she stole money from us many times!

775
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,760
- And... 
 - Hold on.

776
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,900
But, can we talk about other things besides her?

777
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,280
Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

778
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,140
Of course. Another mistake.

779
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,150
Your whole life is a mistake.

780
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,470
You don't even have a bit of responsibility. Cheap jerk!

781
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,630
What? Cheap? Are you done talking?

782
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,800
Yeah, I'm terrible! What about it?

783
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,320
Alright, whatever.

784
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:34,290
Yeah, let's just quit the business while we're at it!

785
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,720
What? Quit the business?

786
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,700
Okay, with my terrible personality,

787
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,660
my shamelessness, and wickedness, what would you gain from working with me?

788
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,660
Just quit if you want to, you jerk!

789
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,220
You started this.

790
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,120
Yeah! I'm sorry!

791
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,820
I'm going to go home first, so go have fun.

792
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,370
What's with you?

793
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,900
Don't worry about me! Just keep having fun!

794
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,060
I worry, though.

795
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,940
What?

796
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,690
You worry me! So, don't drink with another man!

797
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,690
What?

798
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,680
Noona,

799
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,710
Noona, do you not worry about me?

800
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,100
I do.

801
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,820
So, don't smile at another girl!

802
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,410
Don't be nice to them!

Best?

806
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,170
Are there any others?

807
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,340
No, I think that's the only one.

808
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,470
So, I think we'll get it if we combine the words.

809
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,420
So, I'll try to read the best combination.

810
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,170
- Listen to it. 
 - Okay.

Woo Sik Rambo Runs Devilish Homicide?

812
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,120
I don't think so.

814

That's even worse.

815
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,690
I think the combination is just wrong.

816
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:39,060
No... This is what makes sense.

Yeah.

What? Did you drink?

824
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,620
We were going to drink in celebration, but you drank by yourself?

825
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:07,420
I'm sorry, but I'm tired, so I'll be going in.

00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,960
What?

850
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:14,190
I think that we have to define our relationship.

851
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,670
Yeah. We do.

852

Let's just speak honestly.

Honestly, I do worry about you.

Yeah.

But... If we just start things between us, I feel like things won't work out.

I'm worried about that too.

I know. I don't want to get awkward with you.

And, Woo Sik is a problem, too.

Yeah. If Woo Sik finds out, he'll go crazy.

How about we just go on one date?

869
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:33,150
If we do it and we don't feel anything, we'll just act like it never happened. Okay?

870
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,490
That's good.

871
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:38,540
Yeah? Okay, let's do it.

 - Why would she wait at the Soyang River?

Why is my phone here?

Well... We were trying to analyze the text Mi Na sent you yesterday.

I'm sorry.

Woo Sik, we're almost done with it.

907

Look at it. Woo Sik Love I Will Wait For You.

908

It's this.

909

00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,400
So, Mi Na is waiting for your love.

911
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,370
That's nonsense! I told you she's just a student.

912
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,190
Teacher!

913
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,200
What? What brings you here?

914
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,460
I was practicing singing, but my tone wasn't so good.

The text that you sent Woo Sik yesterday.

918
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,060
What? What text?

919
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,010
This. The one you sent the letters of.

920
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,760
It says Woo Sik Love I'll Wait For You. Right?

921
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,660
What?

922
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,180
But, what's the SYR in the end?

923
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,230
I don't know.

924
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,090
I didn't send that. Oh,

925
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,890
Jae Min must've done it.

926

Who's Jae Min?

927
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,560
My cousin.

928
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,070
He's four now, but he always takes my phone and presses random keys.

929
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,590
Oh, gosh, he did it again.

930
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,650
Of course. I told you it wasn't like that!

931
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,990
Wasn't like what?

932
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:34,360
She keeps saying that you were confessing to me through text.

933
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,660
It's all nonsense!

934
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,620
It's not nonsense.

935
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:44,730
I actually liked you a while back.

936
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,670
You were my first love.

937
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,860
What? First love?

938
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,940
This is all done.

939
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,770
Director, I analyzed the character.

940
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,960
Since the character, Myeong Sik has social phobia,

941
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,050
I think it'd be great if we could add traits

942
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,850
like where he stutters and can't look people in the eyes so it'll be more obvious. How's that?

943
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,700
I think that's good. It's a good thought.

944
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,300
Joon Ki, you must've studied the script really hard.

945
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,660
Thank you.

946
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,280
You haven't eaten, right? Do you want to talk while we go eat something?

947
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,120
Alright.

948
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,050
Director.

949
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,340
Gosh, you're here again?

950
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,950
Director, I couldn't understand.

951
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,820
Why? How could you do this?

952
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:48,590
Joon Ki, you should go find a restaurant nearby. I'll find you.

953
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,490
Alright, got it.

954
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,960
That role... I was confirmed for that role!

955
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,860
I passed the audition! Why would you fire me all of a sudden?

956
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,490
How many times do I have to tell you?

957
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:05,370
I found a better person for the role!

958
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:08,990
Director... I've been an unknown actor for 10 years.

959
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:12,810
This is my last chance, so I practiced so much!

960
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,270
I can do really well. Truly!

961
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:17,430
This is a done deal.

962
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,890
How come you don't understand?

963
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:23,040
Director! Please! I'm begging you!

964
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,700
Please! Please give me another chance.

965
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,490
Please think it through again!

966
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,200
Director. Please, I ask of you.

967
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,020
Please, please.

968
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,520
Please, I beg you.

969
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,120
  Director, please I beg you.

970
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,170
  I have no other choice.

971
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,730
 Without Hyeon Seong, we can't get funds for the film.

972
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,990
  Still, how can you do this?

973
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,280
  That role was supposed to be mine!

974
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,790
  I passed the audition and got picked!

975
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,870
  It's a done deal.

976
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,250
  Please, Director.

977
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:02,960
  I didn't even eat or sleep. I practiced so much.

978
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,930
  I can do well!

979
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,100
  Director, please.

980
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:13,030
  Director.

981
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,180
 Please, Director.

982
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,470
Please, Director.

983
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,840
Please.

984
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,720
  An Underhanded Game

985
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,000
Woo Sik, you must be happy. You were the first love of Mi Na. She's so cute and pretty.

986
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,160
Stop that.

987
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,190
It's not even a big deal. Why are you like this?

988
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,880
Why is it not?

989
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,920
Hey, don't you think Mi Na still likes you?

990
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,570
What? Hey, she said it was in the past.

991
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:07,760
But, why would she say that right in front of you? It's weird.

992
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,990
Don't you think so, Soo Yeon?

993
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,270
What? Oh, I'm not sure.

994
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,830
Kim Jeong Eun, knock it off, or I'll really get mad.

995
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:19,900
Alright. You're getting mad for no reason.

996
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,130
Joon Ki, you're back from the film meeting?

997
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,430
How was the meeting?

998
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:30,700
What's with your expression? Did something happen?

999
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,290
I quit.

1000
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,220
Quit? What?

1001
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:40,300
I quit acting. I'm not acting again.

1002
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,660
What are you saying? Hey, Lee Joon Ki!

1003
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,260
Joon Ki, what happened?

1004
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:54,230
Quit acting? What do you mean?

1005
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,650
Open up!

1006
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,450
Open the door!

1007
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,260

1008

  Episode 14 Preview

1017
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:05,730
  What happened for him to be like that? Why's he quitting acting?

1018
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:06,700
  Is he depressed?

1019
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,520
  I have to find out and make him come to his senses.

1020
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,260
  I told you I don't want to talk about it.

1021
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,730
  I'll tell you all my secrets, so you tell me yours.

1022
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,480
  I liked you.

1023
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,850
  Today's our date. If it doesn't work out, things will go back to normal.

1024
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,830
  I never knew I'd go on a date with you.

1025
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,020
  You and I really don't suit each other.

1026
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,250
  I didn't know we wouldn't suit each other this much either.

1027
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,070
  Hello!

1028
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,430
  I think Mi Na still likes Woo Sik, don't you think?

1029
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,350
  I'm not sure.

1030
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:36,730
  Does it worry you?

1031
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:43,810
