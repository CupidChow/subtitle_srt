1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:10,670

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,420
I'm glad you passed the interview.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,490
I know.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,880
How about some chicken and beer tonight?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,720
That sounds great!

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,990
Soo Yeon.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,120
Woo Sik, you're here early.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,380
The person who was supposed to perform live at 5 o'clock bailed.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,340
What are you staring at so blankly?

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,780
I was just jealous.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,250
Jealous of what?

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,380
Those girls over there. They seem to be about my age, but they go to work and do what they like.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,900
They're moving forward in their life one step at a time.

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,360
I was wondering how long I have to work part-time like this.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,090
It's not like I have a particular dream, and it's not like I'm good at anything.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,840
I just feel a bit frustrated.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,910
I see.

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,230
Right, didn't you say your dream was to become an announcer?

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,550
Well, I guess. But it's not easy to become an announcer. What can I do now?

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,210
Why? There are private academies that teach you stuff like that.

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,340
You can enroll in a class and prepare.

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,320
Come on, I don't have money to enroll in a class like that.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,730
It's all right. I'll get back to work then.

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,300
 Waikiki Guest House

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,510
₩3,000,000 ($3,000) for 6 months?

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,250
Why are these academies so expensive?

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,930
Where are you going, Gi Bong?

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm obviously heading out for my training...

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,240
Right, I got kicked out.

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,240
It's become a habit.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
I should get some sleep.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,670
That poor thing.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,070
By the way, how am I going to get that money?

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,780
I should get some sleep first.

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,420
 A Bittersweet Life

36
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,310
 Tell me. Why did you do that to me?

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,590
Tell me. Why did you do that to me?

38
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,320
Say something!

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,110
Our Hyun's acting is awesome, don't you think?

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,790
How can you be watching a movie right now?

41
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,730
Gi Bong got kicked off his team. Aren't you worried?

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,880
The other day, I saw him crouching in front of his room, crying his eyes out.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,020
Really?

44
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,060
I'm worried. He hasn't even been eating.

45
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,800
I have no choice but to get involved once again.

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,060
Hey, I'll make Gi Bong feel better. Just trust me.

47
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,660
Trust you, what a joke.

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,950
You cause trouble every time you say that!

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,030
Don't do anything, please.

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,260
I'm telling you. I have my ways.

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,680
I just told you to trust me.

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,700
Hold on.

53
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,580
What kind of trouble will she cause this time?

54
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,720
Tell me.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,310
Oh, Hyung. What happened with the event I asked you about?

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,090
Oh, today?

57
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,500
₩1,000,000? ($1,000)

58
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,100
Okay, I'll be there. Yeah. Thanks.

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,850
An event? You said you'd rather starve than take such jobs.

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,650
You don't need to know.

61
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,780
I'll see you later.

62
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,420
See you.

63
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,670
Tell me. Tell me what kind of event it is.

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,750
Excuse me, but what kind of event is it that it's taking place here?

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,830
Is it a wedding?

66
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,640
No. It's our boss' wife's birthday today.

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,070
What? You're throwing her a birthday party here?

68
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,270
Everyone in the family must be very open-minded.

69
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,290
Let's hurry.

70
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,990
Why did you do that?

71
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,020
You should've watched your tongue. He beat you up to a pulp.

72
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,130
Please don't worry. There was a small quarrel earlier.

73
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,460
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

74
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,260
Hyung-nim. The singer is here!

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,590
Oh, hello.

76
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,520
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yong Pal.

77
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,970
Hello.

78
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,200
 Hold on. Kim Yong Pal?

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,360
 The name sounds very familiar.

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,310
 Where did I hear it? No way...

81
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,510
Are you Kim Yong Pal of the Yong Pal Gang?

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,660
I guess you saw me in the news.

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,270
Don't believe what they say.

84
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,540
I'm just a hard-working businessman.

85
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,520
Of course, Hyung-nim.

86
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,760
I mean, Sir.

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,620
I love my wife more than my life and it's her birthday today.

88
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,450
Please sing for her and make the mood nice.

89
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,590
She loves music very much.

90
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,740
I see. D-Don't worry, sir.

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,700
Your wife's here.

92
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,120
Really? Honey!

93
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,130
You're here.

94
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,840
Ta-da.

95
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,140
- Hello, ma'am!
 - Omo!

96
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,510
Everyone is here because it's my birthday?

97
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,600
Thank you so much.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,060
Did you get a haircut, Dong Soo?

99
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,740
My gosh, you look so cute!

100
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,860
Thank you so much, ma'am.

101
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,520
Take him and shave his head off.

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,390
No. Hyung-nim! I'm sorry!

103
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,140
I only cut my hair because it was too long. I didn't know I would look this cute!

104
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,420
I'll go get another haircut!

105
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,550
Please spare me! I'm sorry, Hyung-nim!

106
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,050
Honey, why are you being like this again?!

107
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,480
I just complimented his haircut.

108
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,150
No. I never like the way he looked at you.

109
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,990
Alright. Don't worry about it. Let's enjoy this party.

110
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,320
Goodness. You kill me, Honey.

111
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,420
And this is the singer for today.

112
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,160
Say hello.

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,270
Really. It's nice to meet you.

114
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,920
Hello.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,280
Aren't you Shiva Woo Sik?

116
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,540
You're Shiva Woo Sik from Taj Mahal, right?

117
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,240
Huh? Yeah. But, how do you know me?

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,830
Oh, my goodness! It's me!

119
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,850
Taj Mahal's fan club president, Kang Mi Young!

120
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,500
My nickname is Shiva flower. Shiva Woo Sik, don't you remember me?

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,590
Wait, Shiva flower... Mi Young Noona?!

122
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,610
Yes, that's me!

123
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,690
My gosh, how long has it been?

124
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,760
Gosh, noona! It's been ages. How many years has it been?

125
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,660
It's been a while, ma'am.

126
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,170
Don't call me "ma'am", please. By the way, it's so good to see you. Is it actually happening? Or am I dreaming?

127
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,360
Hey, Gi Bong. How long are you going to be like this?

128
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,120
You need to eat something, or you'll starve yourself to death.

129
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,030
I don't care. I can't play baseball anymore.

130
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,320
I'd rather die.

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,130
What? Hey, how could you say something like that, you punk?

132
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,190
I've been playing baseball since I was a little kid. It was my everything,

133
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,300
but I can't play anymore. I'll never be able to do it again.

134
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,800
Do you even know how that feels?

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
Still... Gi Bong.

136
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,100
Forget it. You guys are annoying me. Get out. I said, get out.

137
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,330
Don't be like this. I bought you something delicious. Try it.

138
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,090
It was really hard to buy. I got it at a handmade chocolate shop I know. The second you put this chocolate in your mouth,

139
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,820
all your worries and stress will melt away because it's so good.

140
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,920
What?

141
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,790
Do you think I'll feel better if I eat that stupid chocolate?

142
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,320
I struggle to swallow even a single grain of rice. I feel like as I'm chewing sand.

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,400
Alright, alright.

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,280
If you just try one, we'll stop bugging you.

145
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,620
You mean it, right?

146
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,350
You have to get out if I eat one.

147
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,150
This is ridiculous.

148
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,770
What do you take me for?

149
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,400
 It's good. This tastes amazing.

150
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,590
 How could chocolate be so delicious?

151
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,700
 Is it the chocolate or my tongue that's melting? I can't even tell.

152
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,020
 This is amazing. It's truly unbelievable.

153
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,700
 The taste is actually melting all my worries and stress away.

154
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,960
How's it? It's good, right? Don't you feel better now?

155
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,090
What? Well, it tastes okay.

156
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,920
Really?

157
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,890
It can't be.

158
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,130
I haven't seen anybody who didn't feel better after eating this.

159
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,240
Stop it. I told you it won't work.

160
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,260
How can just this chocolate make him feel better?

161
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,860
Do you think he's a complete idiot or what?

162
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,030
I'm sorry. Shall I leave it here so you can eat it later?

163
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,800
Gosh, leave it! He's obviously not in the mood to eat chocolate.

164
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Just let him get some rest. Let's go.

165
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,970
Get some rest, Gi Bong.

166
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,230
- Get some rest. 
- Alright.

167
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,810
Okay.

168
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,530
This chocolate is really tasty.

169
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,440
I know, right? I feel so great right after I eat it.

170
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,800
Right. Right?

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,330
But, it didn't make Gi Bong feel better. He must be feeling so dejected.

172
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,820
Hey, why did you come out? Do you need anything?

173
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,130
Well, I just want some water.

174
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,500
Here you go. Have some water and go back to your room.

175
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,860
 What is this? They already ate all of it?

176
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,630
 How annoying.

177
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,290
 I want it. I want it so badly.

178
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,600
 I really want to eat it.

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
 I can't ask them for the last piece after all of that. What do I do?

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,680
Gosh, that was a mistake.

181
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,060
Oh, it's fine. We can just wipe it.

182
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,260
- Joon Ki, go bring a rag.
- Oh, okay.

183
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,760
My clothes are all wet.

184
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,730
- Here, use this.
 - Okay.

185
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,460
Gi Bong, we'll clean this up. You should get some rest.

186
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,450
Where did he go?

187
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,310
Nice. That was so natural.

188
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,200
Alright. Shall I eat this now?

189
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,750
What were you doing behind the door? You startled me.

190
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,450
Nothing. Why couldn't you knock?

191
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,570
Wouldn't it be weird if I knock before entering my own room?

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,040
Let me see.

193
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,820
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

194
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,390
Goodness, what is it?

195
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,330
I almost stepped on it.

196
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,880
Chocolate? What is it doing here?

197
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,050
Did you bring it here to eat it?

198
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,440
No.

199
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,800
Of course not. You said you had no appetite.

200
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,890
Exactly. Give it to me. Let me throw it away.

201
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,610
You will?

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,290
Why would you throw it away? It would be a waste. I'll eat it.

203
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,870
Darn it.

204
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,540
Woo Sik, you haven't changed a bit. You're still so handsome.

205
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,500
Oh. No, I'm not.

206
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,930
It was my dream to marry you in the past.

207
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,690
What did you like so much about that punk...

208
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,690
What did you like so much about that gentleman?

209
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,420
His singing, of course. Woo Sik is such an amazing singer.

210
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,120
Oh. His singing?

211
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,340
I consider myself a pretty good singer.

212
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,870
You're pretty good too, Honey,

213
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,400
but you can't compare to Woo Sik.

214
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,020
Really? Well since we're bored, why don't we find out who sings better?

215
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,930
We'll bet a finger.

216
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,070
A finger?

217
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,150
Relax, I was joking.

218
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,340
The winner will flick the loser on the forehead. How does that sound?

219
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,740
Well, I'm not sure...

220
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,770
What are you waiting for? Get everything ready.

221
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,380
Yes, Hyung-nim!

222
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,990
All right. Let me sing first.

223
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,750
You know my wife's favorite song, right?

224
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,380
Yes, Hyung-nim.

225
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,870
 Playing With Fire

226
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,590
♫  My mom told me every day, to always be careful of guys  ♫

227
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,930
♫  Our love is like playing with fire  ♫

228
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,010
♫  My love is on fire  ♫

229
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,190
 You should practice more. Score:65

230
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,830
Oh, what a disappointment. Only 65 points?

231
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,580
Woo Sik, it's your turn.

232
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,690
 I'm in trouble. He seems to be the extremely jealous type.

233
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,390
 If I end up winning, my life might be in danger.

234
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,590
 I have to lose.

235
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,180
 Which song should I sing?

236
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,480
 Oh, this would do.

237
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,110
 Pheasant Hunting

238
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,640
♫  Pheasant~  ♫

239
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:30,840
♫  Pheasant, Pheasant, Pheasant, let's go Pheasant hunting  ♫

240
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,800
♫  Let's go pheasant hunting  ♫

241
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
 A new singer is born! Score:100

242
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,880
The chocolate box must be around here somewhere.

243
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,310
Darn it. I should have checked the name of the shop.

244
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,920
I'm so stupid. Stupid.

245
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,880
Gosh! What are you doing here?

246
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,610
Why are you going through the trash?

247
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,180
I'm looking for something.

248
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,030
By the way, the chocolate box from earlier...

249
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,770
Where did you throw it away?

250
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,220
Oh, that sweet chocolate? But why do you need that box?

251
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,620
Huh?

252
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,030
i just thought it would be perfect for keeping business cards.

253
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,050
Business cards? But you don't have any.

254
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,340
Who knows whether I'll have them in the future? Do you think I'll stay unemployed for the rest of my life?

255
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,790
That's not what I meant. Hey,

256
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,280
When you'll get a good job, I'll get you a really nice business card holder. Don't worry, you punk.

257
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,130
Hey! Did you say a business card holder?

258
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,320
That's just a waste.

259
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,140
By using a chocolate box, I can save trees, reduce trash,

260
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,280
and prevent global warming. How nice would that be? So tell me where that box is.

261
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,890
- It's trash pickup day, so we already took it out. 
- Out where?

262
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,060
What do you mean? But when I went out, they already took it.

263
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,010
What? Why did you have to take it out so early?

264
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,750
- What were you thinking? 
- What?

265
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,210
Do you have any affection for our planet? You clean up here.

266
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,940
Why do I have to... Hey, hey.

267
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,140
Why is he making such a fuss over an old chocolate box?

268
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,430
This is driving me crazy. Why did he have to throw it away?

269
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,520
I'm craving that chocolate so much. Without knowing the name of the shop, I can't get it.

270
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,250
Right. Yoo Ri bought that chocolate. She knows.

271
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,620
Why isn't she picking up? Why?!

272
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,500
 He's angry. He's definitely angry. I'm sure. Should I just run?

273
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,170
 Then, what about Soo Yeon's academy fees? This is driving me crazy.

274
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,390
Oh right, Woo Sik. Do you remember the time you went camping with the fan club members?

275
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,680
What? Oh, yes.

276
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,290
I remember.

277
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,190
You played pop-up pirate with 40 fans,

278
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,490
and you never lost once.

279
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,940
Did I?

280
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,250
Of course.

281
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,670
You're not just handsome, but also super lucky.

282
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,970
Ah, really? You're lucky?

283
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,060
But I tend to be pretty lucky too.

284
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,930
I've been stabbed around 40 times so far.

285
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,740
And I'm still alive.

286
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,500
Oh, I see. That's truly amazing.

287
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,570
Why don't we find out who is luckier? This time,

288
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,110
Ten flicks.

289
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,520
Ten flicks? Well, I'm not sure...

290
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,600
What are you waiting for? Get everything ready.

291
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,050
Yes, Hyung-nim!

292
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,330
 I have to lose this time. No matter what. If I win again, it could really be my last day on earth.

293
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,300
Alright. Who wants to go first?

294
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,080
 Roulette, it's a game of odds. It's always smart to go first. Then...

295
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,470
You go ahead. You're older than me.

296
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,310
That sounds good.

297
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,340
Alright, here I go.

298
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,060
 That's it. Unless he's the unluckiest person in the world, there's no way he'll get caught in the first tur—

299
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,180
Forget the money. I have to survive first.

300
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,320
- I have to get out of here.
- Hey.

301
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,220
You.

302
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,790
Where are you going in such a hurry? You didn't even say goodbye.

303
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,460
Well...

304
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,060
I think I left the stove on in my house.

305
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,330
But we have matters to settle first.

306
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,330
Matters to settle?

307
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,380
Don't you know what I mean?

308
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,040
Save me. Please.

309
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,700
Stop! I haven't paid you yet.

310
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,190
I'm home.

311
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,500
Is everyone asleep?

312
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,170
I'm so tired.

313
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,780
I better go to bed.

314
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,620
Gosh, you scared me!

315
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,630
Noona, where have you been all this time?

316
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,290
I was doing some market research for Yuri's Kitchen.

317
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,150
Why?

318
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,470
- But why didn't you answer my phone? Do you know how many times I called you?
 - Oh...

319
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,370
I'm sorry. My battery died.

320
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,740
But do you have something to say to me?

321
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,960
Well, that chocolate from earlier...

322
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,340
Where did you get that from?

323
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,150
What? Why do you want to know?

324
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,170
I need a chocolate box. I need something to put my business cards in.

325
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,180
Business cards? You don't have a business card.

326
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,410
I might get one soon!

327
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,390
Why does everyone think I'll be unemployed forever?

328
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,210
Do I look that incompetent?

329
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,330
No, it's not that.

330
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,950
When you get a job, I'll buy you a business card holder—

331
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,350
No way. I told you that's a waste! It's environmental destruction!

332
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,690
So just tell me the name of the shop.

333
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,100
Just tell me the name!

334
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,810
Why are you getting angry?

335
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,800
Can't you just use another box?

336
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
I have a box that's just that size in my room...

337
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,470
It's just that I really love the design and color of that chocolate box.

338
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,960
What's so complicated about that?

339
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,540
Just tell me the name!

340
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,820
O-Okay. Okay.

341
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,160
I'll text you the name and address of the shop.

342
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,140
Fine.

343
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,310
But, is that shop open right now? What time does it close?

344
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,680
- You're going to go now? 
- Yes.

345
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,800
It's closed. Do you even know what time it is?

346
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,920
You should have come home earlier.

347
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,620
Just send me the text. Now!

348
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:27,290
- Why is he getting so angry about a darn box?
 - Help!

349
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,290
What's the matter with you?

350
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,580
Yoo Ri, if someone looks for me, tell them I'm not here.

351
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,960
No, tell them I immigrated to another country, okay?

352
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,150
  Waikiki

353
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,130
Oh my, you scared me.

354
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,330
Brother, what are you doing down there?

355
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,360
Yoo Ri, pass me the milk.

356
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,380
By the way, did anyone come looking for me?

357
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,340
Nobody came, but

358
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,120
what's wrong with you? Did something happen yesterday at the event?

359
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,770
Huh? No, nothing happened.

360
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,900
- Where is Soo Yeon?
 - She has no appetite.

361
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,470
She's been feeling down these past few days. Is something bothering her?

362
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,230
But where did Gi Bong go so early in the morning without even eating anything?

363
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,880
 I can finally eat it. Finally!

364
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,450
 Moist on the outside, sweet on the inside.

365
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,070
 The most delicious chocolate.

366
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,730
Oh, it's here.

367
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,110
What's all this?

368
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,760
  ODIV

369
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,340
E-Excuse me?

370
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,340
What's this line for?

371
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,160
We're waiting to buy chocolate.

372
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,390
This place is really famous, so you can't buy any if you don't wait in line.

373
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,820
Wait. You can't buy it? What do you mean?

374
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,430
They only sell a limited amount of chocolate. If they sell everything, they close down for the day.

375
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,100
What?

376
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,610
That means there's a chance I can't buy it.

377
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,860
That can't happen, no!

378
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,590
I want to eat it.

379
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,830
He won't get revenge on me because of the flick, right?

380
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,050
I can't even work because I feel so worried. Where will I get money for Soo Yeon's academy fees?

381
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,760
I don't know this number.

382
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,790
Hello?

383
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,260
Woo Sik, it's me Mi Yeong.

384
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,910
Noonim.... no, ma'am.

385
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,380
What do you mean "ma'am"?

386
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,500
Why did you call...?

387
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,560
You forgot your money for the performance yesterday. I called to tell you to take your money.

388
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,720
Right, the money.

389
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,260
Well, do you want to come over right now to our house right now?

390
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,540
What? To your home?

391
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,160
Can't you just wire me the money?

392
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,160
But your guitar is at my house too.

393
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,730
Right... I left my guitar behind too.

394
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,240
Can you send it by express mail—

395
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,040
Is it because of my husband?

396
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,100
My husband's at work so come and get it, alright?

397
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,320
Ma'am... hello? Ma'am?

398
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,870
I don't want to go though. I'm scared.

399
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,220
 Just come in.

400
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,720
Why are you wearing a mask?

401
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,450
Um, it's because I've caught a cold.

402
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,750
But, where's my guitar? Oh, there it is!

403
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,620
Well, then. I'll be off.

404
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,780
Wait. You have to take your money! Hold on a bit, okay?

405
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,840
Here. It's ₩ 1,000,000 (~$1,000), right?

406
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,990
Thank you. I'll be off then.

407
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,620
What? You're leaving already?

408
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,210
I have some urgent business to take care of.

409
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,270
What is it?

410
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,920
I need to make some money quickly.

411
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,740
How much?

412
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,640
Now... about 2,000,000 won ($2,000) more?

413
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,030
So, should I just give it to you?

414
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,030
Huh? Why would you, ma'am? That won't work.

415
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,910
How about you borrow it then?

416
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,830
You can pay me back later, right?

417
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,590
That's still...

418
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,970
But, why are you being so nice to me?

419
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,520
Why? What do you mean why?

420
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,610
Don't you know I was the president of your fan club?

421
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,790
If my singer is having trouble, I need to help.

422
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,560
I'm not a singer. I'm just a small-time entertainer who sings at others' birthday parties now.

423
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,720
What do you mean by that?

424
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,460
Woo Sik, you'll always be a star in my eyes.

425
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,730
I'll be a fan till I die. I'll always be a fan. So, cheer up!

426
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,460
Thank you.

427
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,310
No need to say thank you.

428
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,170
So, have a seat here.

429
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,870
I'll bring something delicious okay?

430
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,510
She'll be my fan till she dies...

431
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,210
Hearing that makes me feel happy.

432
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,420
That right. Think of your fans and cheer up!

433
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,760
Woo Sik, do you like sweet rice punch?

434
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,910
Goodness, I'm so sorry

435
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,540
 Okay! I'm almost there!

436
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,390
 If I wait a bit, I can eat it.

437
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,760
We're sorry, the chocolate we prepared for today is sold,

438
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,190
We're going to close for the day.

439
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,190
  Sold Out

440
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,850
  Closed

441
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm sorry. It's sticky, isn't it?

442
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,240
These are my husband's, so change into these.

443
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,640
Okay.

444
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,360
Gosh, what are you doing right now?

445
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,590
Let's just change out of this and leave.

446
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,130
Honey. When did you come?

447
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,250
Just now. By why are you so shocked?

448
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,750
Huh? I'm not shocked.

449
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,680
You said you were going to do archery.

450
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,230
Why are you back already?

451
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,630
Well, it must be because my forehead hurts.

452
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,560
The bow wasn't working for me today.

453
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,890
I shouldn't have just let him go.

454
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,870
You must be tired, so go in and take a nap.

455
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,330
Hold up.

456
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,160
But, I should still clean my bow.

457
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,520
Boss, I don't think the clothes fit.

458
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,360
Boss.

459
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,260
Why are you here? Aren't those my clothes?

460
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,490
Wait. Did you just take a shower?

461
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,770
No. It's just because I got sweet rice drink all over me.

462
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,720
So...

463
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,150
Exactly, it's really like that.

464
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,430
Shut up!

465
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,190
Do you really think I'll believe that?!

466
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,570
- It's a misunderstanding. 
 - Yeah, a misunderstanding.

467
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,680
What do you mean by its a misunderstanding?

468
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,640
I caught you red-handed!

469
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,240
I can't let this go this time.

470
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,460
- You, Come here. 
-  It's a misunderstanding.

471
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,190
Come here!

472
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,220
Okay! I'll tell you the truth.

473
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:52,000
Truthfully, he came looking for me out of nowhere.

474
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,130
What?

475
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,260
Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden?

476
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,530
It's true! I didn't like you, but you found me.

477
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,880
You begged me for some sweet rice drink, so I gave it to you.

478
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,390
You suddenly poured it all over yourself on purpose, didn't you?

479
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,170
It's not like that.

480
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,890
You little!

481
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,030
I bought it! I finally bought it!

482
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,240
Wait, wait, wait. I can't get caught eating this at home.

483
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,410
Oh well. I'll just eat it out here.

484
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,460
 Mister, can you throw the ball back?

485
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,160
Yeah...

486
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,940
Thank you.

487
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,040
  Gook Gi Bong's Violent Thunderbolt. Fire!

488
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,560
  Strike! It's a victory!

489
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,920
 This no-hitter makes Gook Gi Bong

490
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,480
 the champion of the World Series!

491
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,840
Gi Bong, what are you doing here?

492
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,490
I was wondering where you went to so early in the morning, but you went to get the chocolate box?

493
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,310
But... what's with that expression?

494
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,860
I saw them and it reminded me of the past.

495
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:28,280
I used to play like that when I was a kid. Back then, I never thought a day like this would come.

496
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,780
Noona, what do I do now?

497
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,180
How should I live?

498
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,560
I wish you I could teach them something.

499
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,660
Gi Bong. I saw this in some movie.

500
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:58,310
Life is like a box of chocolates.

501
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,060
  Chocolate

502
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,180
In the box, there's sweet chocolate, but there's also very bitter chocolate.

503
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:12,800
Baseball was just the bitter chocolate in your life.

504
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,060
It's the kind of chocolate that's so bitter it's hard to swallow.

505
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,290
But there is still other chocolate left in this box.

506
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,870
Baseball might be over for you, but your life isn't over yet. Don't you think?

507
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,720
Right?

508
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,370
So, if you just choose other chocolate, won't you find something else?

509
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,310
But the other chocolate is bitter too.

510
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,210
Even so, what can you do?

511
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,630
Then, you just have to try another piece of chocolate.

512
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,830
- But what if that's bitter too? 
 - You little...

513
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,870
Whatever then!

514
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,290
Gosh, I was trying to be serious.

515
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,780
I'm just joking.

516
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,290
So, there's still other chocolate left for me.

517
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,050
That's it?

518
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,720
Hey.

519
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,280
I can have one, right?

520
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,330
No! I had to go through so much to buy this.

521
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,990
I'm going to eat it all by myself.

522
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,120
Gosh.

523
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,130
How cheap.

524
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,440
But, wait. What's with you?

525
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,050
You said the chocolate didn't taste good. It's good, huh?

526
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,300
Right? It's delicious?

527
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,070
I'm right.

528
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,160
Give me a piece, you petty jerk.

529
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,910
No. I'm going to eat it all by myself.

530
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,050
I told you about it!

531
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,350
Steal it if you can!

532
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,040
I can!

533
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,700
How can you get this? You'll never!

534
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,930
♫   With that world  ♫

535
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,060
Oh my, Woo Sik. How are you here?

536
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,190
Why did you do that to me? Tell me.

537
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,460
Why did you do that to me?

538
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,380
You humiliated me.

539
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,780
What kind of bullcrap is that?

540
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,620
No, tell me the real reason.

541
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,030
I thought about it a lot, but I really don't know.

542
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,570
Did you really try to kill me?

543
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,530
Were you really going to kill me?

544
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,020
You told me that you would be on my side until you died!

545
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,580
Tell me. What were you doing?!

546
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,410
Then, what do I do?! If I hadn't done that,

547
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,730
then I might've been divorced!

548
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,480
So, that's why you put the blame on me?!

549
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
Is that why you came here?

550
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,560
What kind of man is so small-minded!

551
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,330
What? Small-minded?

552
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,330
- This old lady, seriously! 
- Old lady?!

553
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,060
I won't stay still about this!

554
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,390
Well, if you're not going to, what will you do?

555
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,590
What? Whistle?

556
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,890
Geez. Traitor!

557
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,180
Get him!

558
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,360
  Waikiki Guest House

559
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,280
  Next up. The biggest gang in the country, Yong Pal Gang has been caught by the police.

560
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,290
 The police announced that last night they arrested Kim, the leader of the Yong Pal Gang,

561
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:30,020
 as well as 100 members of his gang for group assault and extortion.

562
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,190
That bastard was finally caught!

563
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,260
Yeah. Woo Sik, you suffered so much running away.

564
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,890
Joon Ki, it was so scary and hard.

565
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,680
I know. I know how you feel.

566
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,900
Let's watch something else.

567
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,020
  Next up.

568
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,090
  Hello.

569
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,830
Huh? I just saw a really familiar face.

570
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,240
  This will make you cry because you're so touched.

571
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,500
What is that?

572
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,800
  We go find fascinating things!

573
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,020
  This is the popular segment of "6 o'clock My Hometown"! Oh, My!

574
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,810
  Wow, how can this be? Let's start!

575
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,290
  Should we go together? Let's go!

576
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,990
  Let's go! One more time! Go!

577
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,620
Hey Joon Ki, that's you, right?

578
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,230
What are you talking about? That's not me.

579
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,960
Hey, hey. Flip the channel!

580
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,230
Wait, wait! Hold on.

581
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,630
Hold on.

582
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,360
Wait, stop it!

583
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,010
No!!

584
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,470
  This is Lee Joon Ki!

585
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,250
  To find someone who can pee while standing,

586
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,710
 we came to Jeongeup in North Jeolla province.

587
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,370
  Gil Dong!

588
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,650
  Oh, here he is!

589
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,510
  Sit!

590
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,220
Gil Dong!

591
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,350

592
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,280
Gil Dong!

593
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,110
Look at his neck!

594
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,230
- Hey! 
 - Stop.

595
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,240
Don't laugh!

596
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,270
Don't laugh! Especially you!

597
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,290
Geez, you were pretty much dying a minute ago.

598
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,760
Sorry, sorry. What is this? You became a reporter?

599
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,590
What do I do, then? My credit card balance is overdue and I'm about to be in trouble.

600
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,030
But, still, what's with your outfit?

601
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,840
It's all part of a concept!

602
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,380
But, announcer Jo Sang Won is in charge of emceeing that, right?

603
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,350
How'd you know?

604
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,350
I'm such a big fan of his.

605
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,680
So, I was wondering if you could get me an autograph.

606
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,420
Autograph?

607
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,720
- Well, alright. 
 - Yay!

608
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,270
Joon Ki, what's it like being a reporter? Is it fun?

609
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,420
It's more fun than I thought.

610
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,950
I meet a lot of interesting people and eat a lot of delicious food.

611
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,220
I see. It seems fun.

612
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,880
  My Dear Friends

613
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,120
Do I look like a mantis?

614
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,770
Hey.

615
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,430
But, what's with you?

616
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,180
You came all the way here to do my makeup.

617
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,300
Just because.

618
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,070
But... When is Jo Sang Won coming?

619
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,960
Sang Won?

620
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,970
Sang Won uses a big waiting room and a bunch of makeup artists.

621
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,170
Wait. Did you come here to see Sang Won?

622
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,260
No!

623
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,030
Gosh, what do you mean? That's obviously the reason.

624
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,850
No! It's not!

625
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,130
Yeah, I was wondering why you came here.

626
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,480
Joon Ki!

627
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,890
Sunbae! Hello!

628
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,590
Have some donuts.

629
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,010
They were a gift from fans.

630
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,040
Thank you, Sunbae!

631
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,050
This is my friend.

632
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,890
She's a huge fan of yours.

633
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,960
What are you doing? Hurry and greet him.

634
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,850
Hello. I am Kim Jeong Eun.

635
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:32,840
Nice to meet you. Then I'll see you later.

636
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,450
Good luck.

637
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,130
I'll see you later!

638
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,030
Oh, I was so nervous. I thought my heart would drop!

639
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,820
Gosh, you're that happy?

640
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,030
Well, you should go and hit on him.

641
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,910
No, no. How could I?

642
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,870
Why can't you? Should I help you?

643
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,730
You?

644
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,450
You know who I am. I'm the god of dating, Lee Joon Ki!

645
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:00,190
If I put my mind to it, I could even get you two married within a week.

646
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,070
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

647
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,960
But, instead, keep doing my makeup.

648
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,750
How's that? Deal?

649
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,350
Deal.

650
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,120
I think this proposal for Yuri's Kitchen is good enough.

651
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,370
 About the Business, Chef Name: Cha Yoo Ri, Menu

652
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,990
But the most important thing is the funds.

653
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,090
Where do I get them from?

654
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,620
This is driving me nuts.

655
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,720
Hey, I'm here.

656
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,030
Gi Bong, where are you coming from?

657
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,380
Just... I went jogging because I didn't feel so great just lying around for a few days.

658
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,230
Wow, it's been a while. You weren't even eating and just lying around all the time.

659
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,510
Well, you told me that there are other chocolates left.

660
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,510
So, I'm going to start again.

661
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,760
Though I don't know what to do yet.

662
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,970
Then, should I help you out?

663
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,850
Really? That would be great.

664
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,490
From what I see, I don't think studying's for you.

665
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,460
How about modeling? You have a nice body.

666
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,090
- I have bowed legs. 
 - Really?

667
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,160
Then, what about personal training?

668
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,150
My shoulders hurt.

669
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,410
- How about cooking, like me? 
 - I can't even fry an egg.

670
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:10,120
Then...

671
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,690
Astronaut?

672
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,330
That seems okay.

673
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,730
But, I can't wear a helmet because it feels suffocating.

674
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,480
Gosh, what can you do? You can't do anything!

675
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,420
Yeah, that's true. I guess I'm good for nothing besides baseball.

676
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,560
I don't know why I'm like this.

677
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,060
No, no, no. I was just joking.

678
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,220
Let's think about it again.

679
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:38,100
How about... Were you good at anything before baseball?

680
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,170
Good at anything?

681
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,620
Oh, in elementary school, I won a prize for a poem.

682
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,830
What? A poem?

683
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,720
- You wrote a poem?  
 - Yeah!

684
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,330
Before I did baseball, being a poet was my dream.

685
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,730
Really?

686
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,220
Well, being a poet is fine. Try writing a poem, then.

687
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,590
A poem.

688
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,850
Hurry, hurry.

689
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,790
Welcome.

690
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,730
Hello.

691
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,160
What? Why'd you bring me to this gym?

692
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,690
I looked into Sang Won, and he always exercises here every night.

693
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,680
So, you should go and sign up.

694
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,950
Me? Why?

695
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:17,330
What do you mean why? Don't you know that saying that repeated coincidences become fate?

696
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:22,530
Think about it. The girl that he met in a makeup room at a broadcasting station coincidentally one day, he sees again at the gym.

697
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,010
What would he think?

698
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,600
"Wow, no way. I can't believe this. I'm getting goosebumps." Wouldn't he be like that?

699
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,460
I'm not sure.

700
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:35,010
Not sure? Hey. If you keep repeating coincidences like that, at one point,

701
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,930
he's going to be like, "Is this person my destiny? Is this fate?"

702
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,890
It's going to stay with him.

703
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,600
If you keep doing that, you'll be dating him,

704
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,770
getting couple rings with him, proposing, marrying, then having kids. That's how it is!

705
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,720
- Really? 
  - Yeah!

706
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,130
But isn't it really expensive here?

707
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,420
Is that the problem?

708
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,590
You said you wanted to do well with Sang Won. Whatever! Don't do it if you don't want to.

709
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,700
No, no. I'll do it.

710
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,090
How can a gym be so expensive?

711
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,350
I've used up all my living expenses for the month.

712
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,580
But, where's Sang Won?

713
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,330
Ah! There he is.

714
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,490
Oh, aren't you announcer Jo Sang Won?

715
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,560
Yes, that's me. Who are you?

716
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,500
I'm Joon Ki's friend, the one from the broadcasting station.

717
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,680
Kim Jeong Eun.

718
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,150
- Hello.  
- Oh my,

719
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,090
I wonder how we met coincidentally twice. Wow.

720
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,600
You work out here?

721
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,100
I haven't seen you before.

722
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,750
Well, the thing is...  since it's spring now,

723
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,530
to get some exercise,

724
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,070
I signed up today.

725
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,120
- You signed up today? Today is my last day.
 - What?

726
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,270
Work hard today.

727
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,050
Well..

728
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,450
Gosh, my money.

729
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,520
Die! Die Punk! Die!

730
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,040
Stop it already! Do you think I knew?

731
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,920
Oh, be quiet! What are you going to do about my money?

732
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,920
I can't even get a refund. What are you going to do about it?

733
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,040
Just stop it now.

734
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,070
She said stop it so stop it now!

735
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,620
Will he come to his senses with just that?

736
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,220
Righ— Huh?

737
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,990
You should end this in one go.

738
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,640
Huh?

739
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,880
- Joon Ki!
 - My goodness.

740
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,740
When will they grow up?

741
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,910
Right?

742
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,570
But, what's this.

743
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,450
Looks like Joon Ki's reporter script.

744
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,850
Wow,

745
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,850
so this is what a script looks like.

746
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,520
  Waikiki

747
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:58,680
Okay. Please let me know if there are any other gigs.

748
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,590
Bye.

749
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,150
You want another gig after what you went through?

750
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,530
I need the money that's why.

751
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,780
Why all of a sudden? What are you going to use it for?

752
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,250
There's something I have in mind.

753
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,500
Noona! Noona! Noona! Noona!

754
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,860
What is it now?

755
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,490
The thing is, I wrote a poem. Take a look, will you?

756
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,980
Poem? Why all of a sudden a poem?

757
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,630
Well, Gi Bong wants to try to be a poet.

758
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,500
So you're saying you wrote a poem, Gi Bong?

759
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,290
Yeah, want to hear it?

760
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,840
It's been a while since I wrote so don't make fun of me okay?

761
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,120
Alright.

762
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,780
Title: Is it nice?

763
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,820
Gook Gi Bong

764
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,430
Are you alright now? Wasn't it too hard?

765
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,970
How we ended.

766
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,290
It was just a farewell.

767
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,320
It was difficult for us.

768
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,940
Let me explain this part briefly. I quit baseball because of my injury, right?

769
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,090
I'm comparing that difficulty with a breakup.

770
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,650
It's good.

771
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,080
Keep going.

772
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,710
Okay.

773
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,580
From time to time, I hear that you're doing well.

774
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,550
You're already meeting someone good.

775
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,220
And you're doing well.

776
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,560
I didn't ask, but I was told anyway.

777
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,580
Right here, I'm talking to my baseball equipment.

778
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,470
I left it at the training ground, and apparently, it's doing fine.

779
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,640
But the thing is, the coach gave it to another player and somehow felt the need to tell me.

780
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,990
That's what it's about.

781
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,010
I see. It must have been painful.

782
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,420
To be honest, while writing this part,

783
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:52,090
I started missing my equipment so badly. My heart just...

784
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,350
Sorry, I'm crying again.

785
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,410
Let me go wash my face.

786
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,380
He's so big, but he can be quite emotional, right?

787
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,340
Doesn't it seem like that?

788
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,310
But Noona, doesn't it sound like you've heard it somewhere?

789
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,660
I feel that too.

790
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,300
Wait, aren't these lyrics to a song?

791
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,380
Doesn't it sound like Yoon Jong Shin's 'Like it'?

792
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,060
Huh? Right!

793
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,140
♫ Are you alright now? Wasn't it too hard? ♫

794
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,940
♫ The way we ended things ♫

795
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,490
What? It's the same.

796
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,060
So, wait? Is he trying to fool us into thinking he writes well with those lyrics?

797
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,530
It looks like that.

798
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,020
I knew it. It was just too good.

799
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,720
Even though it's like that, pretend you don't know.

800
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,590
He's finally trying to do something new.

801
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,220
There's no need to disappoint him, right?

802
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,280
Alright.

803
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,190
Okay, Unni.

804
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,760
Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun!

805
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,000
Jeong Eun!!!

806
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,020
Big News! Big News! Big News!

807
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,790
There's big news?

808
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:02,730
I did some more digging and found out Sang Won is active in a club these days.

809
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,870
And guess what?

810
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,830
Today is the day they meet up.

811
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,650
So?

812
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,160
What do you mean?

813
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,600
You'll join that club and make coincidences happen.

814
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,100
- Is it that coincidence nonsense again?
 - Hey. Hey.

815
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,630
The thing about coincidences

816
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,220
is that there have to be at least three of them to become fate.

817
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,860
It might sound silly, but it has never  not  worked before.

818
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,060
What kind of club is it anyway?

819
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,650
You said your name was Jeong Eun, right?

820
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,530
I never expected a woman to join our alp-horn club.

821
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:45,220
Have you always been interested in the traditional Swiss alp-horn?

822
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,250
It's surprising.

823
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,050
Most people have never even seen it.

824
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,490
 Why isn't Sang Won here?

825
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,290
 What's going on?

826
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,370
I'm sorry for being late.

827
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,580
Sang Won, how did we meet here again? Wow.

828
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,900
I've been in this club for a while now.

829
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,490
You two know each other?

830
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,630
Yeah, a bit I guess.

831
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,820
I see.

832
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,100
So it would be good if you teach Jeong Eun then!

833
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,600
Should I do that?

834
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,490
That's sounds good!

835
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,910
This is so hard.

836
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,360
It's not like that. You're so frustrating.

837
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,600
I'm sorry.

838
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,830
  What am I even doing here? I'm just getting scolded by him.

839
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,360
 Why is this so hard to blow?

840
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,000
Okay, let's do it one more time.

841
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,440
Jeong Eun, gather all your energy in your stomach

842
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,960
and blow like you're blowing out all the breath from your body. Try blowing like this.

843
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,120
Like that, okay? Let's go!

844
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,600
A little harder.

845
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,450
You're almost there. A little harder.

846
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:31,050
I was so humiliated in front of Sang Won.

847
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,770
Why would I fart in that kind of situation?

848
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,470
What are you doing here?

849
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,710
I'm just here.

850
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,080
Why do you look so down?

851
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,590
Are you like this because of what happened earlier?

852
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:53,620
Don't worry about it.

853
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,560
I farted all the time when I first started to learn.

854
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,020
And your fart sounded really cute.

855
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,430
Stop it, I'm already embarrassed to death here.

856
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:06,280
I'm sorry. I was just trying to comfort you.

857
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,350
Jeong Eun, don't you think we're meant to be?

858
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,220
Huh? What do you mean?

859
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:16,330
First, we meet at the broadcasting station, then the gym,

860
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,130
now even at the alp-horn club.

861
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:22,580
It's so surprising meeting you three times.

862
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:27,220
Jeong Eun, if you have time tomorrow, want to go for a drive with me?

863
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,040
Excuse me?

864
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,230
Where did you get this sausage from?

865
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,080
- It's tasty, right?
 - Yeah.

866
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,350
But where's Gi Bong?

867
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,770
Gi Bong is writing a poem again.

868
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,820
He fidgeted all night writing a poem, and I couldn't get any sleep.

869
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,630
He was even searching about poetry contests on the Internet.

870
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,410
What? Poetry contests?

871
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:51,070
Right?! So what about telling him the truth now?

872
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,050
I want to as well, but what if he's disappointed?

873
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,520
But, he'll be even more disappointed if you tell him later.

874
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,050
Okay. I'll talk to him later.

875
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,060
You have to.

876
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,490
Everyone!!

877
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,860
How do I look?

878
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,960
Wow.

879
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,190
Are you cosplaying as a girl today?

880
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,190
What? Do you want to die?

881
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,600
Jeong Eun, where are you going all dressed up so early in the morning?

882
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,090
I have a date with Sang Won today.

883
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,960
You're that happy?

884
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,060
You know this is all because of me, right?

885
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,360
Right, it's because of you.

886
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,620
Stop being so arrogant.

887
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,560
What's that huge smoking pipe for?

888
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,030
It's not a smoking pot. It's an alp-horn!

889
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,800
It's a traditional instrument from Switzerland.

890
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,130
Oh, so it's an instrument.

891
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,610
No wonder. It's a bit long for a smoking pipe.

892
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,310
But, where are you going for your date?

893
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,520
We're going to his villa in Gapyeong.

894
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,500
Villa?!

895
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,430
You just met, and you're already going on a trip? No way!

896
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,130
It's not a trip. I'll be back tonight.

897
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,420
Even if I go on a trip, who are you to say that I can or can't?!

898
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,300
Me? I'm your best friend.

899
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,740
Even I want to send you, but what should I say,

900
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,430
- it's a little worrying like letting a small fish out into the big ocean.

901
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,950
Mind your own business, okay?

902
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,100
I'll be back.

903
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,610
But I have to film...

904
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,480
What about my makeup? Hey!

905
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,170
I knew it. This is why they say you shouldn't be so generous.

906
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,110
Joon Ki, should I come instead?

907
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,840
It's my day off and I've always wanted to see a filming set.

908
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,430
Really? That's great for me!

909
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,030
 50 Year Old Traditional Kalguksu Restaurant

910
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,380
So this is how they film it, huh?

911
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,710
It's cool.

912
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,020
There are more things that are cool.

913
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,060
Let's practice this one more time.

914
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,180
Hello! The place I want to introduce today is

915
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,090
a famous kalguksu restaurant located in Boryeong, Chungnam...

916
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,350
What's up with my throat today?

917
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,790
Really?

918
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,940
I'll go buy some water. Wait a bit.

919
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,740
Water?

920
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,310
Thanks, Soo Yeon.

921
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,080
- Joon Ki. 
 - Yes, |Director?

922
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,940
Who's your friend? She's got a good image.

923
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,470
- Is she an actor? 
-  No, just a friend.

924
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,750
Really? Okay, but why did she come instead of Jeong Eun today?

925
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:19,230
Truthfully, things are going well with Sang Won and Jeong Eun.

926
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,610
They went on a date.

927
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:25,340
Really? But she should be careful with Sang Won.

928
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,560
- Why?
 - I've heard some nasty rumors about him.

929
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,690
He'll swoop in and take girls to his villa, saying he's showing them around, and ghost them once he's played around with them.

930
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:35,160
 I'm going to Sang Won's villa in Gapyeong.

931
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,020
What? He plays around with them? What do you mean?

932
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,800
Ugh, why isn't she picking up?!

933
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,140
What's happening?

934
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,150
I'm going crazy.

935
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,820
- Jeong Eun!
 - Joon Ki!

936
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,030
Where are you going?

937
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,120
Where are you going??

938
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,490
I have to tell Gi Bong.

939
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,100
But I can't say anything in case he's disappointed.

940
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,700
I'm going crazy.

941
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,970
Gi Bong, What are you doing there?

942
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,300
Noona, what's this song?

943
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,770
Song? What song?

944
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:22,330
♫  And you're fine.  ♫

945
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,440
♫  I didn't ask, but I was told anyway.  ♫

946
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,800
Gi Bong...

947
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,870
Did you hear this song?

948
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:33,240
Yeah. This song

949
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,980
♫  Good job~  ♫

950
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,630
♫  You couldn’t bear to overcome that emptiness  ♫

951
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,370
is really good, Noona.

952
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,700
What's the title?

953
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,700
Yoon Jong Shin's "Like it."

954
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,100
Oh, "Like it."

955
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,740
I'm hearing this song for the first time and it's really good.

956
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,800
But,

957
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,990
the lyrics seem very similar to my poem.

958
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,270
It's surprising.

959
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,250
What?

960
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,890
So, you're saying you're hearing this song for the first time?

961
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,300
Yeah,  why?

962
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,090
What? Nothing.

963
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:13,920
It's nothing.

964
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,900
But you know,

965
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,600
this song is really good.

966
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,290
I should download this song right now.

967
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,550

968
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:28,640
What? So that poem was really written by Gi Bong?

969
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,990
Joon Ki! Huh?

970
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,490
Where did Joon Ki go?

971
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,730
I don't know. He just left out of nowhere.

972
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,550
Huh? What?

973
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,650
The episode's going to air the day after tomorrow. We have to finish filming today!

974
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,050
Where will we find a reporter right this second?

975
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,280
Excuse me, you're Joon Ki's friend, right?

976
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,420
Yeah, but why?

977
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,130
Hello everyone! I'm Reporter Han Soo Yeon.

978
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,500
The most popular segment on "6 o'clock My Hometown". Oh my gosh.

979
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,670
How can something like this happen in this world, oh...?

980
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,330
I'll start now.

981
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,280
Let's go!

982
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,480
Cut! Okay, that was good.

983
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,990
She's good.

984
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,160
She's really good.

985
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,260
Even better than Joon Ki.

986
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,650
I did live performances all day,

987
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,270
and all I got was 30,000 won ($30).

988
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:37,160
When will I save up enough for Soo Yeon's academy fees?

989
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,230
Soo Yeon!

990
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,590
Woo Sik! Where are you coming from?

991
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,000
I just had something to take care of.

992
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,220
Why are you alone? Where's Joon Ki?

993
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,360
I don't know. He took off, saying he couldn't shoot today.

994
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,960
Everyone was so stressed out because of him.

995
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,290
Really? Did he get himself in trouble again?

996
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:00,210
Exactly. So, I had to do the reporting today, instead of Joon Ki.

997
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,040
Really?

998
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,160
The producer kept asking me, saying it was urgent, so I had no choice.

999
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,940
But the writer said I did a good job. She also said she'll help me get other gigs as a reporter.

1000
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,290
Really?

1001
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,600
It was more fun than I expected.

1002
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,500
So I'm thinking of giving it a shot as a reporter.

1003
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,040
Really?

1004
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,450
Hang on. Then you no longer need to go to the academy to prepare to become an announcer.

1005
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,950
This means I no longer have to sing in events.

1006
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,960
What do you mean? Academy for announcers?

1007
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,020
Oh, no, it's nothing.

1008
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:33,180
Anyway, that's really good! I hope you do well.

1009
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,430
Thank you.

1010
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:38,240
Since it's a good day, should we go eat sweet pancakes?

1011
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,030
Sweet pancakes? Let's!

1012
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,050
Let's go now.

1013
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,830
I want three okay?

1014
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,870
Okay.

1015
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,860
Shall we have a glass of wine while looking at the stars?

1016
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,620
You have to drive though. You shouldn't drink.

1017
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,440
We can just sleep here and go back tomorrow.

1018
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,090
Huh?

1019
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,180
Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun!

1020
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,160
Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun!

1021
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,230
Let go of me!

1022
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,700
How are you going to go now?

1023
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,200
I'll figure it out myself, so let go of my hand.

1024
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,740
Hey! Let go of that hand!

1025
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,790
Joon Ki!

1026
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,190
Jeong Eun, are you alright?

1027
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,600
Nothing happened?

1028
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,090
So how could you come someplace like this! Aren't you even scared?!

1029
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,130
You made me so worried!

1030
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,910
Lee Joon Ki, what do you think you're doing right now?

1031
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:37,060
Look who's talking. What is this about, Sunbae-nim? You’re pathetic.

1032
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,450
What?

1033
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,560
Jeong Eun, let's go.

1034
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,630
Gosh, I was just going to play around because I was bored.

1035
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,770
Who does she think she is? What a joke.

1036
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:58,180

1037
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,760
This won't do.

1038
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,400
Jeong Eun, hold on.

1039
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,860
- Sunbae. 
 - What now?

1040
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,290
I think I'll have to punch you.

1041
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:17,950
Are you crazy?

1042
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,360
Keep talking if you actually want to see me crazy.

1043
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,690
You really don't want to work in the broadcasting industry anymore, do you?

1044
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,420
One word from me and an idiot like you will be fired right away!

1045
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,690
Do whatever you want.

1046
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,890
I won't take those jobs even if they ask me, you jerk.

1060
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,520
 No way! Did I fall for Joon Ki?

1061
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,890
 I'm crazy. I'm going crazy.

1062
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,560
 Did I do something wrong to you?

1063
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,490
 I have to write my resume. Can I use your laptop?

1064
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:22,260
 Let's see.

1065
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,230
 "Never"? What does this mean?

1066
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:27,380
 I've never seen the owner. That's why I wrote it. Did I get it wrong?

1067
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:32,030
 Diction is fundamental for reporters. He said he can't work with someone whose diction is as bad as mine.

1068
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,090
 Joon Ki, do you have a reporter you know?

1069
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,230
 I do know one!

1070
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,260
 Hello.

1071
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,690
 Gosh, she keeps spitting on my face.

1072
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,080
 I can't complain because she is teaching me for free.

1073
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,460
 "Too!"

1074
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,530
 "Too!"

1075
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:47,090
