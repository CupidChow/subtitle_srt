1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,380
Who did you say it was?

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,070
What?

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,790
Hey, you scared me!

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,640
What's wrong? Who is it?

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,380
N-Noona is coming.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,960
What!

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,620
Your sister is coming?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,380
Is Yoo Ri really coming?

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,260
Yeah, yeah. Hurry and lock the front door!

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,420
- Hurry! 
 - Okay!

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,220
Hi.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,600
My screw up, have you been well?

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,940
You're still as screwed up as ever.

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,590
Oh, look at you, my big bear. Your head's gotten bigger. How much bigger is it going to get?

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,700
Soon enough, you'll be tall enough to see all of Seoul!

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,320
Oh, Jeong Eun! Long time no see!

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,240
You've become much more masculine.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,150
Oh, our...

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,440
I don't know you, right?

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,970
No.

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,910
Sorry. Sorry.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,670
My cute brother! Have you been well?

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,380
Enough. Why did you come?

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,140
Why do you think? I came to see you.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,450
I saw you on the show! Huam-dong Goat Man.

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,220
Be quiet. You saw me.

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,660
Just go now. I can't stand you acting like this any longer.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,090
Go already.

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,230
You're too much. How can you do this to me?

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,650
I did everything to raise you without Mom.

31
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,020
That cold, winter day when you were boiling with that feverish cold,

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,430
I carried you on my back and crossed over three mountains.

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,110
I crossed that icy creek in my bare feet and ran to the clinic. Did you know?

34
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,710
There was no mountain in our neighborhood.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,030
And we had a general hospital right next to our house!

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,870
Alright. Don't believe me if you don't want to.

37
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,020
There's nothing I can do.

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,260
If you tell me to go, I'll go.

39
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,090
Be well, everyone.

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,500
I'm going.

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,320
Sprinkle some salt.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,660
 Waikiki

43
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,050
Woo Sik, I'm going now.

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,440
Be careful not to catch a cold.

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,690
Make sure you eat all your meals.

46
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,500
- Be well, Woo Si—
- Bye.

47
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,680
Geez. He didn't fall for it.

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,930
He's gotten smarter since I last saw him.

49
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,150
Alright, Brother...

50
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,890
You're going to be like this? Okay.

51
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,840
Let's try it.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,580
  I Saw The Devil

53
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,190
- Is she gone?
 - Yeah.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,240
Weren't you too harsh on your sister? She was crying.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,940
That was all acting.

56
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,250
Everything she does, besides breathing, is a lie.

57
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,380
You think this is the first time I've suffered because she fooled me?

58
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,160
Yeah. She's bothered us so much ever since we were young.

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,700
I know. It makes my teeth rattle just thinking about it.

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,140
Right. She's a dangerous person.

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,560
Anyway, this is an emergency.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,690
Everyone, be on your toes. Don't ever accept her calls.

63
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,520
Don't talk to her. Don't even make eye contact with her.

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,230
If someone breaks these rules, you'll be kicked out. Okay?!

65
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,510
Okay. Of course.

66
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,470
- We got it. 
 - Ugh.

67
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,730
Be careful! Always remember.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,740
Why did she show up out of nowhere?

69
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,680
Was I too harsh?

70
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,240
Oh, whatever. She'll go to Dad if she has nowhere else to go.

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,350
It's weird.

72
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,880
Why did my heart race when she was just applying medicine for me?

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,880
No... Do I have heart disease?

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,110
No, they didn't say anything during my health check-up. How weird.

75
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,520
What are you talking to yourself about?

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,150
It's nothing.

77
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,950
What...

78
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,330
Hey, Joon Ki.

79
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,680
Let's say that a girl does something to you that really isn't a big deal.

80
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,690
But, your chest was thumping and pounding all of a sudden. Why is that?

81
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,490
- Your chest was pounding? 
 - Yeah.

82
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,890
Your chest?

83
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,620
But, since your nipples are here, then your chest must be here.

84
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,010
Do you want to die? Don't say pointless things. Just tell me why.

85
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,340
What do you mean? It's because you like her.

86
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,200
What? Because I like her?

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,520
Of course. If you didn't like her why would your heart race?

88
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,690
Why? Do you have someone you like?

89
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,460
What, no. It's not me, it's my friend.

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,290
Friend? You don't have any friends other than us because your personality is horrible.

91
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,460
I do! Who do you think I am?!

92
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,590
Look at that.

93
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,760
That's why you have no friends!

94
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,080
So cold. Geez. Why is it so chilly?

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,000
What is this?

96
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,350
Noona! What are you doing?

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,980
Are you not going home?

98
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,190
Hey, Gi Bong.

99
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,480
Honestly, the thing is I don't have anywhere to go.

100
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,490
What do you mean you don't have anywhere to go?

101
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,810
Well... My roommate took our deposit money and left. I got kicked out.

102
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,640
Oh, I see.

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,020
Oh, Woo Sik said I'm not supposed to talk to you.

104
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,480
I see.

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,530
Well, I've done so many bad things before. It makes sense.

106
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,420
But, Gi Bong, do you know that feeling?

107
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,410
It's like... You've been thrown away and are alone in the entire universe.

108
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,850
That feeling.

109
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,370
It's like when you're on a baseball team, and no matter how hard you throw the ball,

110
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,610
throw the ball, and the throw the ball again, no one notices you.

111
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,840
If someone at least said, "Gi Bong, Fighting! Gook Gi Bong, Fighting!"

112
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,390
If they at least said that, those words would give you strength and you could get back up.

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,780
But, no one is by your side. They just call you loser and useless.

114
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,290
People just point fingers at you.

115
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,040
You know that terrible feeling?

116
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,270
I know.

117
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,350
I know that better than anyone else.

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,180
It was really hard all this time, right?

119
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,920
Yes.

120
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,140
Now, I'll be rooting for you.

121
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,020
Stay strong, Gi Bong.

122
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,560
- Gook Gi Bong, Fighting! 
 - Noona.

123
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,210
If someone held my hand,

124
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:33,350
or even my pinky, I'd be able to get back up.

125
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,090
- I'll hold it. 
 - Gi Bong.

126
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,230
I'll be on your side, Noona.

127
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,120
Even if Woo Sik ignores you, I won't!

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,920
- Gi Bong! 
 - Noona!

129
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,680
That bad bastard!

130
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,520
So, I really like Soo Yeon?

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Geez, that doesn't make sense.

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,210
But why was my chest pounding?

133
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,090
I'm going crazy.

134
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,240
You're crazy! How could you not be if you're...

135
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,740
Hey, Cha Woo Sik, are you crazy?!

136
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,420
Yeah, I'm crazy. I'm sure of it.

137
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,060
Oh, I'm crazy.

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,180
Oh, what do I do?

139
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,850
Gosh!

140
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,560
Hurry up.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, my heart's racing. I was so scared that we were caught.

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,310
I know, right? But, what's wrong with my brother?

143
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,710
I don't know.

144
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,790
Anyway, you should sleep in the guest room today. We have no other empty rooms.

145
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,970
Really? Wow, you guys must be doing great business.

146
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,970
But who was that girl I saw for the first time earlier?

147
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,060
She's our high school friend. Han Soo Yeon.

148
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,320
Is that so?

149
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,900
But her name sounds familiar.

150
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,160
Han Soo Yeon...

151
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Oh! Isn't she Woo Sik's first love?

152
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,850
How did you know that?

153
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,770
Of course, I know. I read it all in Woo Sik's journals.

154
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,080
He had so many hearts by her picture in his journals.

155
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,270
Really? Wow, Woo Sik...

156
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,920
Wait. You read his journals?!

157
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,200
What? Hey! That's not important right now.

158
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,320
Right. I'm sorry.

159
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,130
But... Why is she here?

160
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,630
She rejected Woo Sik.

161
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,980
Oh, well, Soo Yeon had some special circumstances.

162
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,150
Anyway, you have to leave before Woo Sik wakes up tomorrow.

163
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,660
If I'm caught, I'm kicked out, too. You know?

164
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,450
I got it. Stop worrying!

165
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,260
It's warm. I finally feel like I can live.

166
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,970
Gi Bong, turn off the lights. The lights.

167
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,790
Yeah.

168
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,230
- Have a good rest. 
 - Alright. Goodnight.

169
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,020
You woke up now?

170
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,670
Yeah. Why are you up so early?

171
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,280
Oh, I have a part-time job. Do you want some bread?

172
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,120
No thanks.

173
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,220
  Do I still like her?

174
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,090
 No but why?

175
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,240
  Does that make sense?

176
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,270
Why are you staring at me like that? It's making me feel bad.

177
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,480
When did I..?

178
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,840
Am I looking at you if I'm looking in that direction? Do you think you're a princess or something?

179
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,490
Wh-What? You really...

180
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,660
Hey. Why do you keep getting annoyed at me?

181
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,120
When did I? When?!

182
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,650
Forget it.

183
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,120
That little... Look at her and her attitude!

184
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,620
Why does it have to be her?

185
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,180
Wait. Is it because I've been single for so long?

186
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,730
It's been so long since I've touched a girl's hand

187
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,700
that it makes sense for my chest to pound.

188
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,150
But, what if it isn't?

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,190
What? You want me to put this on you?

190
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,810
Is this why you woke me up?

191
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,590
It's urgent. Just put that on my scar.

192
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,820
No! You do it yourself! Why are you asking me?

193
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,900
Hey! Just do it once!

194
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,930
Can't you do this for a friend? Have some loyalty!

195
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,770
Alright, alright. Geez.

196
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,520
  What is this? Why  isn't my chest pounding?

197
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,690
  Oh. Is it because she didn't blow on it?

198
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,470
Jeong Eun, I'm sorry, but can you blow once on it?

199
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,320
What? Are you crazy? I don't want to!

200
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,820
Hey, this is important to me!

201
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,730
So, just blow on it once.

202
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,690
Blow on it! Just once!

203
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,530
Gosh, what's with all of these requests?

204
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,880
- Is that good enough? 
 -   What is this? My chest pounding

205
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,600
  seems to have been prevented by morning breath.

206
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,230
  But, Soo Yeon and Jeong Eun are both girls.

207
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,810
  Why isn't my chest pounding?

208
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,170
  No. They're not both the same girls.

209
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,350
  Jeong Eun is closer to a boy than a girl.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,600
  Now that I see it, her face looks just like Kim Dong Bae from when I was in the army.

211
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
  That's it! This is why my chest isn't pounding.

212
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,020
  My chest will definitely be pounding when another girl does it for me.

213
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,100
I need to find another girl. Another girl.

214
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,940
What the heck? What's with him?

215
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,690
Alright, let's go clean.

216
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,550
She's probably gone, right?

217
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,130
What are you doing there?

218
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,010
What?

219
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,880
You didn't leave yet? You said you'd leave before Woo Sik woke up!

220
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,100
Well, I was going to, but I'm not going to leave.

221
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,740
What?! Hey!

222
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
You said you'd be leaving!

223
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,050
I said that yesterday,

224
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,130
but I've had a change of heart. I'm sorry.

225
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,990
Wait. Noona, are you really going to be like this?

226
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,010
Alright, whatever. Do what you want.

227
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,550
I don't care if you get kicked out or not after Woo Sik catches you.

228
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,230
Oh, you will care.

229
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,150
  I'll hold your hand.

230
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,800
  I'll be on your side, Noona.

231
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,890
  Even if Woo Sik ignores you, I will never!

232
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,580
This. What is this? When did you–?

233
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,740
Gi Bong, we're on the same boat now.

234
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,490
So, you should convince Woo Sik to let me stay here. Got it?

235
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,820
Geez. How can a noona like you exist?!

236
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,710
Gi Bong, let's change the sheets.

237
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,650
Gi Bong?

238
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,370
Gi Bong! What is it? Who are you with right now?

239
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,370
T-That, well...

240
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,080
What is it? Who are you with?

241
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,610
What is this? What are you doing in this guesthouse?

242
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,380
Oh, yes, got it.

243
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,460
Alright, continue with what you're doing.

244
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,400
Ha!

245
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,950
- What did you do just now? 
 - What was I supposed to do?

246
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,080
But, still, you did that without my permission—

247
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,830
You're the one that said if we're caught, we'll both be kicked out!

248
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,600
Gosh, I'm going to go crazy because of you!

249
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,190
That's why if you don't want to go crazy any longer, you need to quickly convince Woo Sik. Got it?

250
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,350
Whatever!

251
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,490
That little cutie.

252
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,610
Hey, hey! Hey!

253
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,760
What happened just now? Who was that?

254
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,470
Well... It's a guest.

255
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,210
Hey, a guest?!

256
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,270
Then, you kissed a guest?

257
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,850
Guest? Who? Who? Who?

258
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,020
You don't have to know! Hey. Where's Woo Sik?

259
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,820
Why are you searching for Woo Sik? Who was that girl?

260
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,080
- Hey. 
 - Where did all the female guests go?

261
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,100
Woo Sik. Woo Sik!

262
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,140
- Are you not worried about your noona? 
 - What? Why are you bringing her up?

263
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,230
It's just because I'm worried!

264
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,830
She seemed to have no place to stay when we saw her. How about we just let her stay here?

265
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,690
What are you saying? Don't you know what kind of person she is?

266
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,400
She can never stay.

267
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,060
Hey, she's your biological sister. Are you not even worried?

268
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,150
I said no, so that's that! What's with you?

269
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,660
You rude little bastard. Forget it!

270
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,850
Where are you going? Who was it?

271
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,270
Why did he bring my sister up out of nowhere?

272
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,290
Oh, another girl.

273
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,630
  Oh? It's a girl.

274
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,340
  Yeah. If this girl applies the medicine, my chest will pound.

275
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,230
  I'm sure of it.

276
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,470
- Please do it. 
 - Alright.

277
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,090
  What? Why isn't my chest pounding?

278
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,770
  This girl is a girl, like Soo Yeon.

279
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,680
  Why isn't my chest pounding?

280
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,820
  No. They're not the same.

281
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,500
  This girl is Japanese and Soo  Yeon is Korean.

282
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,780
  Even though they're both girls, Japan is hundreds of kilometers away from Korea.

283
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,670
  They're psychologically different, too.

284
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,010
  We have a heartbreaking history between them, too.

285
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,770
  So, that's why there could be an invisible barrier between us.

286
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,130
  That's true. So, of course, my chest won't pound.

287
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,420
  If a Korean puts it on, my chest will pound for sure.

288
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,190
I need to find a Korean. A Korean!

289
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,430
No! No!

290
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,860
My first kiss. I saved it for so long.

291
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,350
My first kiss was stolen by that devil-like creature.

292
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,410
I have to wipe off that devil's traces!

293
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,550
Wipe it off!

294
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,560
What? Gi Bong was kissing a guest?

295
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,270
Yeah! He was!

296
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,840
He was in the hallway. It was a passionate kiss!

297
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,310
Oh, wow, that's amazing!

298
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,960
  Bunny   
  Gosh, this person is calling again.

299
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Why? Who is it?

300
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,330
It's a part-timer I work with.

301
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,730
But, they keep calling me and following me around. I'm so sick of it.

302
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,310
What? They're doing that to   you?

303
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,020
- Wow, that person has such an extreme taste in women. 
 - Do you want to die?

304
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,140
It's a joke! A joke! Joke.

305
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,690
- I told him I didn't like him. I don't know why he keeps it up. 
 - Why don't you like him?

306
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,740
Well, our personalities clash.

307
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,830
- And, he looks like a bunny. 
 - A bunny?

308
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,260
Yeah! He has long front teeth and huge ears.

309
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,510
And, he has a long mustache like bunnies.

310
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,790
How could such a person exist? Geez, you and your lies!

311
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:32,230
Why does appearance matter? As long as their heart is kind, it should be enough.

312
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,530
- What's that? I think it's Bunny. 
 - It's not me.

313
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,150
Then, what is it?

314
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,220
What's this? Isn't this Gi Bong's phone? It's Coach.

315
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,430
Yes, Coach? I'm Gi Bong's friend, Joon Ki.

316
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,730
Oh, Gi Bong? Yes, hold on, Coach.

317
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,590
My stomach. Ow, where is the bathroom again?

318
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,650
Gi Bong?

319
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,390
- Gi Bong? 
 - What do I do?

320
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,810
Give me a minute, Coach.

321
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,820
Hey, what are you doing?!

322
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,380
Gi Bong?

323
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,800
Gi Bong. Are you here?

324
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,050
Wh-What is it?

325
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,880
Take the phone. It's the coach. It's urgent.

326
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,100
Oh, well, I'm not able to accept the call right now.

327
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,230
What are you saying? It's the coach! Why are you...

328
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,400
Oh?

329
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,980
Four?!

330
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,670
Four legs?!

331
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,780
H-Hey. Gi Bong.

332
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,720
What are you doing inside there?

333
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Gi Bong. Ah!

334
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,560
Oh, yes, I got it.

335
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,530
Hi, Coach. Gi Bong can't come to the phone right now.

336
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,230
Yes, if you tell me, I'll deliver the message to him.

337
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,420
What are you doing right now? Are you crazy?

338
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,690
What would I do, then? I was almost caught by Joon Ki.

339
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,330
Why would you come in here, though? Hurry and leave!

340
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,800
Go!

341
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,120
This is driving me crazy.

342
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,950
So, convince Woo Sik quickly, okay?

343
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,500
Get out, I said!

344
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,790
Is that good?

345
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,150
  What the? Why isn't my chest pounding?

346
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,150
  This girl is a  girl just like Soo Yeon. She's Korean, too.

347
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,050
  Why isn't my chest pounding?

348
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,040
  Maybe

349
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,260
your hometown is...?

350
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,900
Jeju Island.

351
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,510
- Of course. 
 - You startled me.

352
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,620
  Of course. Their hometowns are different.

353
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,680
  This girl is from Jeju Island, but Soo Yeon is from Seoul.

354
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,440
  Even though they are both Koreans,

355
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,850
 Jeju is an island with a lot of wind, rocks, and women.

356
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,670
  Jeju has many clementines, too.

357
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,570
  A girl from Jeju who was raised eating a lot of clementines. Soo Yeon, a girl from Seoul who was raised smelling a lot of air pollution.

358
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,790
  Of course they won't be similar.

359
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,890
  That's true. That's why my chest isn't pounding.

360
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,110
  If I ask a girl from Seoul to do it, it'll work.

361
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,030
I need to find someone from Seoul. Seoul.

362
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,340
Geez!

363
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,700
Hey! Tell me! Who is that girl?

364
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,350
Stop it!

365
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,960
Oh, Woo Sik!

366
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,750
- What is it this time? 
 - Can't you just accept your sister?

367
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,540
Why do you keep bringing her up?!

368
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,370
She's your one and only sister! Just accept her!

369
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,790
Let me live, please!

370
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,680
Stop! I said no!

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,510
You have no blood or tears. You're a bad man!

372
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,840
Gosh!

373
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,570
Why does he keep bringing her up?

374
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,870
Woo Sik, I have amazing news.

375
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,440
Gi Bong was in the shower with—

376
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,540
I don't care! I'm busy.

377
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:14,470
I got my first kiss stolen by that devil-like woman.

378
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,270
I even showed her my naked body.

379
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,330
 Bear, I'm hungry.

380
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,700
I don't care if you starve to death.

381
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,020
Wow, we haven't eaten pizza in so long.

382
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,480
Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun, are you there?

383
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
What the heck? That's  his  voice!

384
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,510
"His"? Who? Oh, the bunny!

385
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,990
Tell him I'm not here, okay?

386
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,000
Hey! What are you saying?

387
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,630
What kind of man is he?

388
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,030
Is Jeong Eun here?

389
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,410
No. I haven't seen her.

390
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,500
Is that so? She hasn't been picking up. Where is she?

391
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,950
Jeong Eun!

392
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,630
Jeong Eun, hold on! Jeong Eun!

393
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,010
Jeong Eun, hold on!

394
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,340
Jeong Eun!

395
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,460
Jeong Eun, hold on!

396
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,650
Jeong Eun, hold on!

397
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,820
What are you doing? You didn't even knock.

398
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,590
I'm sorry. This isn't the time for that.

399
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,520
- Jeong Eun! 
 - What do I do?

400
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,890
Please just talk with me, Jeong Eun!

401
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,970
Hey, hey!

402
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,880
Gi Bong, if he comes in, tell him I'm not here.

403
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,170
No, tell him that I died. Okay?

404
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,540
What are you doing right now?

405
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,700

406
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,450
Why isn't Gi Bong picking up?

407
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,780
I'm so hungry.

408
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,350
How could a person look like a bunny?

409
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,620
That's so cool.

410
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,950
Gi Bong must be hungry, too. I should give him some pizza.

411
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,820
Who is it this time?

412
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,400
- Why are you here? 
 - I'm in huge trouble!

413
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,740
- Gi Bong! 
 - Oh, shoot.

414
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,810
Move! Move!

415
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,960
Are you crazy? Hey!

416
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,190
Gi Bong, you should have pizza. Wow, you have so many legs.

417
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,060
 Two, four, six.

418
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,940
Six legs?

419
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,240
SIX LEGS?

420
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,410
Hey! Gi Bong! Are you doing that here?

421
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,260
Joon Ki, it's not like that.

422
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,900
Oh, yes, I got it.

423
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,720
Gi Bong, I guess this isn't the time for you to eat pizza.

424
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,130
Fighting!

425
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,830
Joon Ki, it's not like that!

426
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,360
- Fighting! 
 - Hey!

427
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,620
Geez! Noona, what are you doing?!

428
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,860
Is Joon Ki gone?

429
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,690
Is the bunny gone?

430
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,990
- Unni! 
 - Jeong Eun!

431
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,360
  This is driving me nuts.

432
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,690
  It's harder than expected to find someone from Seoul.

433
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,790
Should we start our interview, then?

434
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,530
Let's see...

435
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,180
Your name is Han Soo Yeon?

436
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,440
Yes.

437
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,050
Oh, your address is Huam-dong.

438
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,470
Yes! I've been in Huam-dong ever since I was born.

439
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,850
Oh, I see. Your father is bankrupt?

440
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:14,020
Yes, my father was scammed and had to claim bankruptcy.

441
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,970
That's how my engagement was broken off as well.

442
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,350
I'm living with my friends from high school right now.

443
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,570
Excuse me.

444
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,070
  What is this? Why isn't my chest pounding?

445
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,530
  She's a girl like Soo Yeon, another Korean, born and raised in Seoul.

446
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,250
  Her engagement was broken because of her father's bankruptcy too.

447
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,860
  She's living with her high school friends. Her name is the same!

448
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,840
  Why isn't my chest pounding?

449
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,060
Geez!

450
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,660
What is this? So, I really do like Soo Yeon?

451
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,780
It's been ten years since I graduated high school.

452
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,760
I still have feelings for Soo Yeon?

453
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,850
Does that make sense?

454
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,650
No way. No, no.

455
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,720
Woo Sik!

456
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,130
Woo Sik, where are you coming from?

457
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,430
Hey. What's wrong?

458
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,310
Are you sick?

459
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,820
No way.

460
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,260
No! No, I said!

461
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,230
No!

462
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,710
What? What's with him?

463
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,470
 Please, please...

464
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,680
 God, our Gi Bong...

465
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,620
Are they still outside?

466
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,550
Yeah, they're right outside the door.

467
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:38,160
Anyway, you can't tell Woo Sik that you saw me.

468
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,910
Yes, Unni.

469
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,530
This is driving me nuts. Woo Sik will be here soon.

470
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,010
What are you going to do now?

471
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,460
Hey. First, you should get Joon Ki and that bunny-looking man away from here.

472
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,980
Gosh, alright.

473
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,560
You're still here?

474
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,390
Ah, well, Jeong Eun went inside this room, but she's not out yet.

475
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,430
No, Jeong Eun isn't in there.

476
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,800
No, I saw her go in there.

477
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,720
Oh, really?

478
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,630
If you're hungry, would you like some pizza? Do you want some carrots?

479
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,800
No! I hate carrots!

480
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,080
No! You look like you'd like carrots!

481
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,820
Gi Bong, what happened?

482
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,400
- What were you doing on the bed? 
 - It's not like that.

483
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,300
What do you mean? I saw it!

484
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,730
I saw those six legs. Two of those were yours.

485
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,630
Whose are those four legs?

486
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,420
I'll tell you later, so let's talk upstairs.

487
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,530
Really? You'll tell me everything? It better be in detail!

488
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,470
Gosh, okay!

489
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,090
Gosh, you scared me!

490
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,290
- You should come, too. 
 - Me? Why?

491
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,420
I'll tell you fun stories and I'll give you carrots. So, hurry!

492
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,150
I hate carrots!

493
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,630
Come! Come!

494
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,800
Unni, no one is here. Come out!

495
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,290
Noooo!

496
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,990
Why was my chest pounding again?

497
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,980
I guess I really do like Soo Yeon.

498
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,760
Oh, this is driving me nuts.

499
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,580
Oh, how did this come out by itself?

500
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,790
Oh, it wasn't this pen, though.

501
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,520
Oh, yeah, it's this one!

502
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,110
Wait.

503
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,710
Brother. Hi!

504
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,210
Leave this instant!

505
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:59,330
I can't take responsibility for your troubles anymore. Get out!

506
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,840
I won't cause any trouble.

507
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,260
I'll live quietly. Yeah? Woo Sik, please.

508
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,470
No! I won't take it anymore. Go, leave quickly.

509
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,400
Hey. You're being too harsh.

510
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,920
You allow that Soo Yeon or whatever, your first love, to stay here,

511
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
but why can't you allow your sister to stay?

512
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,610
You said she wronged you a long time ago, too.

513
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,750
So, you tried to curse on her and ripped her pictures!

514
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,280
What? How'd you know that?!

515
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,510
Why wouldn't I know? It was in your journals—

516
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,730
What?! You read my journals?

517
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,930
Oh, right. You like her, right?

518
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,430
Like her? Who said that?

519
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,020
- I heard everything you just said. 
 - You heard wrong!

520
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,700
What? Is that so?

521
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,840
  I guess I really do like Soo Yeon.

522
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,940
When did you...?

523
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,590
Hurry and delete it.

524
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,230
Why? I guess Soo Yeon can't find out about it?

525
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,840
 Is that so?

526
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,280
Thank you.

527
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,780
Brother, cola.

528
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,740
Okay.

529
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,570
- Pickles. 
 - Okay.

530
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,070
Here.

531
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,080
How yummy.

532
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,880
What's with you?

533
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,780
You said you'd never accept her this time.

534
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,160
Huh? Well, she seems to have reflected a lot on herself.

535
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,850
And, she's my one and only sister. I can't ignore her.

536
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,250
♫  I'm now even scared of tomorrow  ♫

537
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,230
What happened all of a sudden?

538
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,540
Hey, Gi Bong, that girl from earlier. I mean, those two girls.

539
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,430
What's with them? Who were they?

540
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,620
You don't need to know.

541
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,480
Girls?

542
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,120
Gi Bong had his first kiss with a girl he met for the first time,

543
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,610
and had a shower with her—

544
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,370
- So, that was Gi Bong's first kiss? 
 - Yeah!

545
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,930
Oh, I see!

546
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,770
Bastard!

547
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,600
♫   In that world   ♫

548
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,320
  Loko's Vacation - Audition   
 - Look, sir, do I have the face of a king?

549
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,330
What are you—

550
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,580
Seeing how you can't respond, my face must be ambiguous—

551
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,010
What are you—

552
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,060
Let's change the question.

553
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,590
Director, do I have the face of the main role or a supporting role?

554
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,710
Or...

555
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,270
the face of someone who won't pass at all?

556
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,360
Seeing your expression, I feel like I'll not pass.

557
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,940
Go on and tell me!

558
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,070
Do I have the face of the main role or the supporting role?

559
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,150
Why? Why does it have to be Han Soo Yeon?

560
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,150
I'm becoming more of a fool.

561
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,390
I'm crazy.

562
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,280
Woo Sik!

563
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,130
What's this?

564
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,440
Why are you two here?

565
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,060
You left your phone, so I came to give it to you. Here.

566
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,470
- Oh, thanks. 
 - Yep.

567
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,550
Oh, but why are you here, Soo Yeon?

568
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:44,410
Oh, Unni kept telling me to go with her.

569
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:48,490
Oh, I just wanted to show her where you work.

570
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,130
And, I was thinking about having tea here, too.

571
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,820
  You know what this means, right, Brother?

572
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,900
  What's wrong with you?

573
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,570
But, now that I look at it, you two look good together.

574
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,980
You're like a couple.

575
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,670
What are you saying?

576
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,610
Well, looking at it now, you two look great together. I can't believe it.

577
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,940
It's meant to be!

578
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,000
Noona, let's have a talk.

579
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,890
Hold on.

580
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,250
What are you trying to start?

581
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,810
Start? This is all for you.

582
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,110
All for me?

583
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,100
You said you like her,

584
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,150
so you should do well.

585
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,260
I'll set up the right atmosphere for you,

586
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,580
so you can just trust me.

587
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,210
- Just me. 
 - Are you crazy?

588
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,710
Did I ask you to set me up with her? I don't want to become more of a fool,

589
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,590
so just, please, don't do anything about it.

590
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,840
A fool? What's he saying?

591
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,660
  The Story Only I Didn't Know

592
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,830
What? Director Ho Bael Suk recommended me?

593
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,350
That's what I'm telling you.

594
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,480
Let's work well together.

595
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,140
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

596
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,220
I was feeling a bit depressed lately because I had been failing a lot of auditions.

597
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,330
So, thank you so much!

598
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,890
But, what kind of role is it?

599
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,640
Oh, you're the main character's—

600
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,850
The main character?

601
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,580
Stand-in.

602
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,690
Stand-in?

603
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,500
Our main character has a similar vibe

604
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,360
and appearance to yours, Joon Ki.

605
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,810
But, a stand-in is a bit...

606
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:39,310
If you help me out here, I'll give you an important role in my next project.

607
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,160
Really? Oh,

608
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,290
I'll work hard!

609
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,360
I'll do great!

610
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
Yes!

611
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,830
Oh, then, who is the main character?

612
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,260
Oh, he's here.

613
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,870
Y-Yoo Min!

614
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,350
Welcome.

615
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,130
Why'd you tell me to come? I was busy.

616
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,230
Who is this?

617
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,830
This is your stand-in.

618
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,680
Greet each other. Joon Ki, you know Yoo Min, right?

619
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Of course! Who wouldn't know Korea's top star, Yoo Min?

620
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,640
It's such an honor to meet you. I'm Lee Joon Ki.

621
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,330
Oh, well, I don't need to know your name.

622
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,650
Let's work well together.

623
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,060
Oh, okay.

624
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,550
Just drink that and leave. I have to work.

625
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,210
Alright, I got it.

626
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,220
Soo Yeon, I heard that you're Woo Sik's first love.

627
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,600
What? Oh, that's what I heard.

628
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,520
Oh, I see.

629
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,000
Then, is Woo Sik your first love, too?

630
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
What? No!

631
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,190
Why would mine be a loser like him?

632
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,820
Unni, I have another first love from high school.

633
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,900
He's super handsome, cool, and—

634
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,300
What's wrong with my brother?

635
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,920
He's the only person in our family that has an IQ over100.

636
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,360
He's been 15th in his class in elementary school, too. What's wrong with you?

637
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,290
- Noona. 
 - What?

638
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,380
Stop it. That's nothing to brag about.

639
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,760
Of course, it is. Fifteenth is pretty amazing.

640
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,270
Woo Sik!

641
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,360
Oh, yes, Boss?

642
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,630
This is a singer who's going to be performing starting today. Say hi.

643
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,690
Oh, hello.

644
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,260
- Hyung? 
 - Woo Sik!

645
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,130
Soo Yeon!

646
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,510
Oppa.

647
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,830
Wow, it's been so long.

648
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,300
It's the first time we've met since graduating high school.

649
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,840
Right? Have you been well?

650
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,160
I've been alright.

651
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,670
But, how did you end up living in the same house?

652
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,070
Huh?

653
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,140
Well, we have a bit of a situation.

654
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,410
Is that so?

655
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,950
Anyway, it's nice to see you guys. Let's have a glass.

656
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,590
We have no more beer.

657
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,660
I'll bring some more.

658
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,700
Alright, thanks.

659
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,120
But, you seem to have gotten prettier.

660
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,890
You've gotten cooler, too.

661
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,650
  High School Band Association, Opportunity Performance

662
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,870
♫  All day today I only think of you  ♫

663
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,980
♫  All day today I only think of you  ♫

664
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,120
♫  It always makes me smile  ♫

665
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,830
  It's Soo Yeon!

666
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,330
  Why is she here so early?

667
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,610
 I Love You

668
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,120
Oh, yes.

669
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,190
Oppa, are you going to be playing here from now on?

670
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,110
Of course.

671
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,220
Brother. Who's that man?

672
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,950
I was in a band with him in high school.

673
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:17,040
Really? Well, the atmosphere is a bit suspicious.

674
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,250
They have something between them, right?

675
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,400
Tell me. What's their relationship?

676
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,890
Soo Yeon's first love.

677
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,360
What? That's her first love?

678
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,980
So, you liked Soo Yeon, but she liked him?

679
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,630
I don't know.

680
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,660
  It's not like that?

681
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,460
Oh, my brother's so pitiful. What do I do?

682
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,370
Alright, it's a good day. Let's have a glass.

683
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,520
What kind of man is being annoying and crying?

684
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,490
It's me.

685
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,960
Oh, Oh Dae Sik.

686
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,490
For ten years, I cried and regretted everything.

687
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,490
Did you really have to do it? My sashimi restaurant.

688
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:19,480
My mom, too. Did you have to take all of them?

689
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,680
Did it make you feel better?!

690
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,990
Do you know where this is? Do you want to die?

691
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Okay! Done.

692
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,090
You can just do it like Joon Ki did.

693
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,750
Got it, Yoo Min?

694
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,390
Alright.

695
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,960
Okay, let's film.

696
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,560
Good work.

697
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,750
Excuse me.

698
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,080
Good work.

699
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,780
That rude bastard.

700
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,750
Good work.

701
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,790
Joon Ki, I'm sorry for making you stand-in during rehearsal too.

702
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,700
It's fine. Don't worry about me.

703
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,580
My sashimi restaurant, and my mom, too.

704
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,780
Did it make you feel better to take them away?

705
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,980
You bastards.

706
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,310
Do you know where this is? Do you want to die?

707
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,030
Hold on.

708
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,930
Cut!

709
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,310
What is it, Yoo Min?

710
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,570
Oh, I have to film an ad this week. The stand-in should film the action scene.

711
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:33,110
The stand-in? But, you should at least do this much–

712
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,730
Will you take responsibility if I get a scar on my face?

713
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,480
No, no. Alright.

714
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,840
Hey, Joon Ki!

715
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,560
- Get in here! 
 - Yes, yes.

716
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,370
Also, don't fall to the ground when you get hit.

717
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,520
You should fly back and hit that table– No, that's too small.

718
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,020
Yeah, that one. You should fall down on that table

719
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,090
and break it. That'd be good.

720
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,290
Oh, there's no need to go that far.

721
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,490
This is my first action movie. Did you not know?

722
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,980
We should film properly so that my image lives on.

723
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,580
And, you know that we got investments for this movie because of me, right?

724
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,840
Alright, well, we'll go with that.

725
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,940
Joon Ki, fly over and fall.

726
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,520
On that table.

727
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,450
Okay?

728
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,840
Oh, okay. I got it.

729
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,910
Alright. You can do it.

730
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,250
Alright, let's go again.

731
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,480
Again.

732
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,670
Do it properly to make it seem real. Don't mess up my image.

733
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,660
Yes, I understand. Yes.

734
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,790
Oh Dae Shik, you've gotten weaker.

735
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,650
You're already weak?

736
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,010
Did you really have to feed me medicine?

737
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,920
Does that make you feel better?!

738
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,160
You little...

739
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,650
Cry. Cry!

740
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,230
Hold on!

741
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,520
Cut! What is it?

742
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,720
Let's go with the stand-in here.

743
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,990
I can't bruise my knee.

744
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,360
It's almost summer. I can't wear shorts, then.

745
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,640
Alright.

746
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,580
Lee Joon Ki!

747
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,250
Get in here.

748
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,940
Yes, yes. I'll do it.

749
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,580
Did you really have to feed me

750
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:46,060
black bean paste noodles on my last path to make you feel better?

751
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,590
Black bean paste noodles.

752
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,610
Hold on.

753
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:52,350
Cut!

754
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,840
Director, let's go with the stand-in here.

755
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,170
I'm not good with chopsticks.

756
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,100
Alright. Lee Joon Ki.

757
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,800
Get in here.

758
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,660
Yes, yes.

759
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,470
Gosh, this smell of pain relief patch. Are we eating patches or rice?

760
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,390
How many patches did you use?!

761
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,410
I don't know. My body hurts everywhere.

762
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,170
Why would you get a role that doesn't show your face and you suffer so much?

763
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,750
The director said that if I do it, I'd get a role for his next project.

764
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,870
I have to do it.

765
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,960
Hello?

766
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,830
Yes. What?

767
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,350
Oh, yes, got it. I'm on my way.

768
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,580
What is it? Who?

769
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,980
It's Yoo Min. He wants me to go to his house right now.

770
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,080
I'll be going.

771
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,350
Eat slowly.

772
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,630
Bye!

773
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,470
Bye!

774
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,650
Things need to work out for Joon Ki. I feel so bad for him.

775
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,150
Gi Bong. You should get a job yourself.

776
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,160
From what I see, I feel worse for you.

777
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,940
What?

778
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,690
I'm better than you. You're living off of people younger than you.

779
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,280
What? Living off of?

780
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,680
Living off of? You!

781
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,380
Shut up! What are you doing when we're eating?

782
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:10,970
Gosh, you scared me.

783
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,500
- Is anyone here? 
 - Yes!

784
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,230
Who is it?

785
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,390
Seo Joon!

786
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,750
Gi Bong!

787
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,640
It's been so long.

788
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,440
- Who is it?
 - I heard you guys met.

789
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,490
He's an upperclassman from high school.

790
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,030
What's up?

791
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,900
Oh, it's just been so long since I saw you guys, so I visited.

792
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,290
Good doing. Come this way.

793
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,950
What is this? Why'd he come?

794
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,840
Maybe it's because of Soo Yeon.

795
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,120
How do I know?

796
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,320
Brother! Brother!

797
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,100
He'll be worried now.

798
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:04,580
Well, I can't help but interfere now.

799
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,540
What is it?

800
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,770
Where is he?

801
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,330
- Do you see him? 
  - No.

802
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,650
Yoo Min Oppa...

803
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,440
He ordered something!

804
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,140
What is this?

805
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,840
Sir, tell us!

806
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,520
No way!

807
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,490
Your black bean noodles.

808
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,060
Gosh, I called you so long ago. Why'd you come now?

809
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,290
I came as soon as I got your call, though.

810
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,060
But, why would you make me have a disguise?

811
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,530
None of your business. Just take off your clothes.

812
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,250
What?

813
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,730
What? You want me to act like you're here?

814
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,790
You saw all the fans and paparazzi out there.

815
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:55,030
I have something important to do today, so do me this favor.

816
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,120
Why? You don't want to?

817
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,440
I'm your stand-in, but doing this is a bit...

818
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,700
Alright. Quit, then.

819
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,130
I'll have the director find a new stand-in.

820
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,120
A new...?

821
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,430
No! No! I'll do it.

822
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,700
I'll do it, yes.

823
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,090
You should've said that earlier.

824
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:19,060
Don't stay locked up in the room. Sit on the sofa so it's less suspicious.

825
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,980
Good luck.

826
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,050
Wait.

827
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,040
This is too much.

828
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,390
It was called Huam HS Volcano. They were legends!

829
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,170
Oh, you were the leader of Woo Sik's band?

830
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,910
He's good at singing and he's handsome, too.

831
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:39,320
If you said Yoon Seo Joon from Huam HS Volcano, everyone knew.

832
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,430
Right, Soo Yeon?

833
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,620
Yeah.

834
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,160
A lot of my friends would follow him because he was handsome.

835
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,610
Well, this guy here's alright, too.

836
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,630
In terms of face, Woo Sik is pretty good.

837
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,560
What? Noona. What are you saying?

838
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,350
Well, from what I see, you're more handsome. What about it?

839
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,960
Woo Sik is average compared to Seo Joon.

840
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,950
Well, he's handsome in an old-fashioned way. Sorry.

841
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,800
But, Woo Sik? He's handsome in terms of today's standards.

842
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,880
Girls these days like boys with a face like Woo Sik.

843
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,820
No way.

844
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,810
Then, should we ask other people? Let's bet. ₩100,000 ($100), deal?

845
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,420
₩100,000? Okay. Deal.

846
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,060
- Deal! 
 - Noona, let's talk.

847
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,130
What's with you?

848
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,220
Noona, what are you doing? Why would you make that kind of bet?

849
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,860
Brother, this is all for you,

850
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,190
- so just stay still. 
 - What?

851
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,720
What kind of nonsense is that?

852
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,760
From what I see, that guy is still interested in Soo Yeon.

853
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,930
What if Soo Yeon likes him again?

854
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,120
Are you going to have her taken from you again?

855
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,710
What am I supposed to do, then?

856
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,620
So, you have to be clear that you're handsome too,

857
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,000
that your looks are better than Seo Joon's.

858
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,330
You have to show that you're better than him.

859
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,520
You have to make Soo Yeon realize these things.

860
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,980
That's why Soo Yeon will be more interested in you. Don't you think?

861
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,840
Is that so?

862
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,100
Of course.

863
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:01,220
What kind of girl doesn't like a handsome boy?

864
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,030
I am on the cuter side of the spectrum.

865
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,560
I do look a bit rich too.

866
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,980
Of course. You're my little brother, after all.

867
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:16,490
From what I see, you'll win at this for sure. So, just trust me.

868
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,790
Alright, Noona.

869
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,290
Alright, should we make a judgment now

870
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,580
on who is more handsome?

871
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,390
So, let's start the vote.

872
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,650
  You'll win at this for sure.

873
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,750
  Just trust me.

874
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:43,960
  Cha Woo Sik

875
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,700
Cha Woo Sik! Okay.

876
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,430
See?

877
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,930
I said Woo Sik was better.

878
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,360
Noona, stop it. You're embarrassing me.

879
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,160
There's no way.

880
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,930
Next!

881
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,230
Yoon Seo Joon.

882
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,660
It's a tie, neck-and-neck.

883
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,170
That's it.

884
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,360
  Cha Woo Sik 
 Yoon Seo Joon

885
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,120
  Cha Woo Sik I - 
 Yoon Seo Joon II

886
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,220
 Yoon Seo Joon.

887
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,000
 Yoon Seo Joon. Yoon Seo Joon.

888
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,670
 Yoon Seo Joon. Yoon Seo Joon.

889
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,820
 Yoon Seo Joon.

890
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,480
Fourteen to 1?

891
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,720
There's no way. Does this make sense?

892
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,480
See? What'd I say? This isn't even a game.

893
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,750
But, who's that one person who voted for Woo Sik?

894
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,560
Their standards are different from everyone else.

895
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,460
Was that you?

896
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,260
No, it wasn't. I didn't vote since I'm a judge.

897
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,260
- Who is it? 
 - Who voted for Woo Sik?

898
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,500
Mr. Cha? Mr. Cha?

899
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,720
No one?

900
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,100
But, it was written in red. Cha Woo Sik.

901
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,020
Cha Woo Sik.

902
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,130
Who's the person who had the same feelings as me?

903
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,600
What is this?

904
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,320
No way. Woo Sik, did you write it?

905
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,190
No! What do you take me for?

906
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,140
Cha Woo Sik!

907
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,000
So, you wrote your own name?

908
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,270
You're really the worst.

909
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:41,930
There's no way. It was unexpected.

910
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,630
I can't approve of this!

911
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,110
Give me the ₩100,000!

912
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,180
Look! What's wrong with this face?

913
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:52,970
He looks like Park Bo Gum! If you look from a certain way, he looks like Gong Yoo's twin.

914
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,040
Look, in this way.

915
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,490
This way. Right?

916
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,720
Can you please stop?!

917
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,330
- Brother! 
 - Geez!

918
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,750
Brother!

919
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:05,500
Hey! Take back what you wrote!

920
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,440
How long do I have to be like this?

921
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,130
Oh!

922
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,520
Hey, it's our show!

923
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,190

924
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,260
When did he film this?

925
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,520
What if I appear?

926
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,330
 We're meeting actor Yoo Min, who's all the rage these days.

927
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,760
Yoo Min, you picked up an action film this time. How is it?

928
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,600
Well, I am very lacking.

929
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,830
But, I just hope that I am not a burden to this show.

930
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,850
But, is acting not hard for an action show?

931
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,170
It's hard.

932
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:46,300
Yes, it's hard and tiring, but I am personally trying my best.

933
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,400
I could choose to use a stand-in, but that's rude to the fans.

934
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,190
- Oh, that's amazing!
 - It's no big deal.

935
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,720
That's something that should be obvious.

936
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,290
I'm a huge fan of yours, Yoo Min.

937
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,200
Thank you.

938
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,490
Yes, Sunbae?

939
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,060
Are you doing well?

940
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,060
Yes, yes.

941
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,030
What are you doing? Who are you talking to?

942
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,020
The person I told you about.

943
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,560
Oh, the person you placed at home? The scarecrow?

944
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,900
  What are you saying? When did I say that?

945
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,350
Scarecrow?

946
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,130
I'll be there soon, so keep it up.

947
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,700
Wait, wait.

948
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,960
What? Scarecrow?

949
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,690
Yoo Min, you're looking down on me, aren't you?

950
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,340
Thanks to you, Noona, I'll be eating so much!

951
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,770
Noona, I'll eat this well. Thanks!

952
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,490
Woo Sik, thanks for being ugly!

953
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,840
Shut up and eat.

954
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,820
I'm sorry, Noona.

955
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:56,330
It seems like the mood has soured because of me. Should I show you something funny?

956
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,840
What is it?

957
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,570
Alright.

958
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,180
Look carefully.

959
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,680
What is it?

960
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,890
- This tissue has nothing, right? 
 - Yeah.

961
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,530
With this tissue, I'll cover the glass.

962
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,340
Alright.

963
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,780
What do you think happened?

964
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,550
I think the coin disappeared.

965
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,920
Alright, look carefully.

966
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,840
Nothing happened at all.

967
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,870
Soo Yeon, give me your hand.

968
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,650
My hand?

969
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,190
Abracadabra.

970
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,500
Alright, your hand is going down.

971
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,640
Wow, awesome!

972
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,740
That's awesome! Wow!

973
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,180
It disappeared!

974
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,690
Look! Woo Sik! The glass disappeared!

975
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,780
You call that a talent?

976
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,740
In terms of talent, Woo Sik is the best.

977
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,800
What are you saying?

978
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,080
What? You have a talent, too.

979
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,870
It's more fascinating than that.

980
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,350
Woo Sik?

981
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,990
No way. What kind of talent would Woo Sik have?

982
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:18,800
- Are you looking down on Woo Sik right now? 
 - Yeah.

983
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,230
You want to bet? This time, we'll bet ₩200,000 ($200). Okay?

984
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,060
₩200,000, okay, sounds good!

985
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,320
Hold on, Noona. Let's have a talk.

986
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,580
Noona, why do you keep doing this?

987
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,890
You have to retaliate!

988
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,160
Didn't you see Soo Yeon like that magic trick?

989
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,490
So, what am I supposed to do?

990
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,990
What else? You need to prove that you have talents, too.

991
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,500
You need to show that your talents are way cooler

992
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,600
than Seo Joon's.

993
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,450
You have to show that properly.

994
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,830
But, a talent competition? How childish.

995
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,010
Childish?

996
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,760
Alright, don't do it.

997
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,690
I don't care if you get your love stolen from you like a fool,

998
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,200
so just do what you want.

999
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:05,720
I do have one talent.

1000
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,490
What?

1001
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,020
Stop it!

1002
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,260
Why?

1003
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,430
Don't you know? The mood was ruined.

1004
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,790
This isn't going to work. We'll have to make the winning move.

1005
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,160
The winning move?

1006
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,870
Don't do anything. I'll take care of it.

1007
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,020
Just trust in me.

1008
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,970
Alright, that was just practice. This is the real one.

1009
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,320
Cha Woo Sik, get in place!

1010
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,950
Everyone, be prepared to be startled.

1011
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,990
We're going!

1012
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,200
What are you doing right now?

1013
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,070
What? We have to do this much to win.

1014
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,870
Woo Sik,

1015
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,740
you're the winner now.

1016
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,270
What?

1017
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,190
Winning like this is so meaningless.

1018
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,690
What?

1019
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,830
I'm going crazy because of you!

1020
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:45,130
Woo Sik, where are you going? You won!

1021
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,070
You win!

1022
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,040
Win? The player left, so it's a forfeit.

1023
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,620
Alright, I won some money!

1024
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,780
Joon Ki?

1025
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,460
What is this place...

1026
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,000
Joon Ki!

1027
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,270
Gi Bong, you're here!

1028
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,710
Wow, so this is Yoo Min's house. What are you doing here?

1029
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,720
None of your business. But, is this what I told you to borrow?

1030
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,670
Yeah. Why'd you ask me to borrow this? And, why'd you want the signed bat?

1031
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,560
I need them.

1032
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,880
Alright, should we start?

1033
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,320
What do we do now?

1034
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,080
What else?

1035
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,210
We're going to have some fun.

1036
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:30,220
Fun? How?

1037
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,350
How? Like this.

1038
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,470
- Like this! 
 - Stop hitting me!

1039
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,160
You're dead today.

1040
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,490
Ow! Ow!

1041
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,410
Joon Ki, come down!

1042
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,720
What are they doing?

1043
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,680
What are they doing? Wow!

1044
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,940
What is that? Don't take pictures!

1045
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,650
  Top Star Yoo Min Has a secret, special hobby!

1046
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,800
  Who is the cat woman that appeared in Yoo Min's House? // Yoo Min's peculiar personal life revealed!

1047
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,590
  Yoo Min #1 on trending

1048
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,950
  Top Star Yoo Min Has a secret, special hobby!

1049
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,540
Wow, they're so fast. The articles are already up!

1050
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,770
Can we do this?

1051
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,360
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

1052
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,950
Oh, it's Yoo Min!

1053
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,920
- Superstar Yoo Min, what's up? 
 - Hey.

1054
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,820
What is this article? Just what did you do in my house?

1055
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,210
What? What did I do?

1056
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:22,490
Are you asking because you don't know? You better explain to them that it isn't me.

1057
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,480
Explain that you were my stand-in today!

1058
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,980
Stand-in?  No way.

1059
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:33,960
Aren't you a person who does everything himself and doesn't use a stand-in to not be rude to your fans?

1060
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,160
- What? 
 - Hey.

1061
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,380
You're rich, popular,

1062
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,450
and you even have a girlfriend. Why did you

1063
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:50,030
have to take everything from the side actors?

1064
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,780
Did it make you feel better?!

1065
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,460
- What did you say? 
  - Hey.

1066
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,350
Just wait a little bit.

1067
01:00:55,350 --> 01:01:01,360
I'm going to succeed and make you my stand-in. Got it?!

1068
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,420
There's not much time left, so just wait!

1069
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,790
I'm hanging up!

1070
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,480
Good going.

1071
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,290
Because of Noona, I did that in front of Soo Yeon.

1072
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,530
This is such a humiliation!

1073
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,250
What are you doing here?

1074
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,860
S-Soo Yeon.

1075
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,730
Why are you here?

1076
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,520
You weren't coming in, so I came looking for you. Why?

1077
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,350
Why'd you go overboard? How embarrassing.

1078
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,300
Yeah, it was embarrassing.

1079
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:52,760
Meeting your first love for the first time in ten years and doing that in front of everyone...

1080
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,460
must've been so embarrassing.

1081
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,630
What? First love? Who?

1082
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,600
I know.

1083
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,630
Seo Joon is your first love. That's why you'd always come to our rehearsal room.

1084
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:08,460
What are you saying? He isn't my first love.

1085
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,800
Yeah, right. I didn't even know and

1086
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,410
I wanted to play you your favorite song,

1087
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:20,410
so I'd practice guitar all night and end up with bloody fingers.

1088
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:25,520
But, whatever. I'm a fool for misunderstanding.

1089
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,600
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

1090
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,030
What?

1091
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,860
That wasn't a misunderstanding.

1092
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,070
Can't believe someone like you was my first love.

1093
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:46,690
What? What are you saying?

1094
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:51,450
My first love is you! Cha Woo Sik, you were my first love.

1095
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:56,760
You said I wasn't yesterday. You said it was someone else.

1096
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,450
Well, how could I just admit it with you right there in front of me?

1097
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:05,500
Do you remember the time we met in the music room?

1098
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,720
That wasn't a coincidence.

1099
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,680
  Live Forever!

1100
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,330
  Volcano

1101
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,960
  What are you doing here?

1102
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,900
  Oh, you startled me.

1103
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,590
  Oh, Soo Yeon.

1104
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,030
  Were you scared?

1105
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,420
  I was just passing by and I heard the guitar.

1106
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:57,960
Really?

1107
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,740
Then, what about what happened on the day of our performance?

1108
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,860
What do you mean?

1109
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:08,660
On the day of our performance, in the rehearsal room,

1110
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,960
you and Seo Joon kissed. I saw it.

1111
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,960
What? What are you saying? Kiss?

1112
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,060
It wasn't like that.

1113
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,770
  Soo Yeon.

1114
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:33,550
  It's not the time for the performance yet, why are you here so early?

1115
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,390
  Oh, just because. Where is Woo Sik?

1116
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,810
  I'm not sure. He'll come by soon.

1117
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,440
  Thanks.

1118
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,280
  Oh, wait, no.

1119
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,270
  What are you doing?

1120
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:57,610
  Soo Yeon, what's wrong?

1121
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,060
  Are you crazy?

1122
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,110
  Why would you do that out of nowhere?

1123
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,560
  Didn't you like me?

1124
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,590
  What did you say? No!

1125
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:09,100
  Give me the bouquet!

1126
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,230
  Cha Woo Sik, you fool.

1127
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,690
 To be honest, I like you.

1128
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:21,250
  I was waiting for your confession, but I'm confessing first.

1129
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,150
  Good luck on your performance today. Fighting!

1130
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,470
Is that true? You should've told me!

1131
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,870
How could I tell you? You didn't even talk to me after that day.

1132
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:39,350
You always avoided me and ignored my calls.

1133
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:48,640
Hold on. Then, all this time, did you get all annoyed with me and criticize me because of that?

1134
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,120
No, it's not like that.

1135
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,870
Yeah, even though you're a loser, you can't be that much of a loser.

1136
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:03,030
It's cold. Let's go in.

1137
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,400
You can go in first. I'll go in later.

1138
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,190
Alright. Hurry on in.

1139
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:18,220

1140
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:21,120
Darn!

1141
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,480
So, I was her first love?!

1142
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,470
So, I've been resenting Soo Yeon for ten years without knowing that!?

1143
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,230
Gosh, you fool! You fool!

1144
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,200
Geez!

1145
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:37,420
Ow!

1146
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:42,290
♫  Hold my hand, follow me, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1147
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:45,780
♫  It makes me happy every day  ♫

1148
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,930
♫  Let's go, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1149
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:52,850
♫  Let's love ye~~  ♫

1150
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:55,680
  Preview

1151
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,010
  Her first love was me!

1152
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,560
  Woo Sik, are you seeing someone lately?

1153
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,830
  Did you really meet her?

1154
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:04,430
  Like you said, I think Soo Yeon really does like me.

1155
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:05,320
  Sell my dream?

1156
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,500
  Nothing's worked out for me lately.

1157
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,740
  You're not going to use the bathroom until tomorrow?

1158
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,000
  There was an audition I wanted to do for a movie, and they told me to do it!

1159
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,590
  I'm going to buy my dream back. 
 "Dream Value"

1160
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:16,140
  Yeah!

1161
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,940
  Gi Bong, good luck today.

1162
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,130
 -  You, too. 
 - Don't be too startled.

1163
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,420
 He's superstitious, he has to do everything four times.

1164
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,090
  He's in the same team?

1165
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,080
  I need to finish it with this ball.

1166
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,790
  No matter what!

1167
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,490
  Let's go!

1168
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:35,730
♫  Let's go, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫
