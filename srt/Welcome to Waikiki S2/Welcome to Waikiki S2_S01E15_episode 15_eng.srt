1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,290
Come closer.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,220
What did I say about our relationship?

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,730
I am your male friend, abbreviated to "Ma'friend."

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,700
Yes, but, what do I do about the fact

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,020
that I see you as more than a male friend?

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,890
Pardon me?

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,610
Gong Gool,

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,570
Gong Gool.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,200
Stop, stop!

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,860
What is it, Director?

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,350
You ask because you don't know? Our project

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,700
is about a passionate love that cannot occur between a king and a clown,

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,190
but I don't see the love in either of your eyes!

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,500
Well, it's just a bit awkward.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,600
That's the problem. The actors don't have feelings of love.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,730
So, how could they touch the audience's heart? This is fake acting!

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,860
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,710
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,300
This won't do. You two stick by each other all day long, starting today!

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,030
No, just live together. Okay?!

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,910
Oh, yes.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,600
  Can I love you?

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,050
Oh, the sound is better now!

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,560
I'm here.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Oh, Joon Ki. The alphorn... Oh! Hello.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,650
Oh, yes. Long time, no see.

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,040
What's with the luggage?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,900
We have our reasons. I'll explain in detail later.

30
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,970
Sunbae, you should go into the room.

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,700
Okay, yes.

32
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,390
- But, Joon Ki, does Jeong Eun smoke? 
 - What?

33
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,800
Why is there a huge pipe?

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,370
That's not a huge pipe. It's something else.

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,160
Let's go.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Here it is.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,620
First,

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,580
you can unpack.

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,400
Okay, yes.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,020
Uh, Sunbae, do we really have to go this far?

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,100
The director said that we truly have to love each other

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,100
for the real acting to come out. Let's work really hard

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,950
and succeed in this performance. Okay?

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,100
Okay.

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,490
Let's give it a try.

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,830
Okay. I'll be changing.

47
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, yes. You can take your time.

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,820
Hold on, Joon Ki.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Yes?

50
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,340
But, lovers don't leave the room when they change. Right?

51
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,400
No.

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,520
Then, I'll stay here.

53
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,050
Okay.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,980
Hello, Writer.

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,340
Oh, Soo Yeon. You're not filming today. Why are you here?

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,750
The producer said he wanted to talk.

57
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,360
What are you doing?

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm in the middle of planning a new segment.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,140
A new segment?

60
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,690
Yeah, but, I can't think of anything. I'm going crazy.

61
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,560
My hair tie. Where is it? It was just here.

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,280
I lose it every day.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,470
I've lost about 100 hair ties in my own room.

64
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,250
Even if you search everywhere, they never show up.

65
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,400
Socks, too. There's always one missing of the pair.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,280
Right? It's not like anyone would steal just one sock.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,800
You get so curious about where the other pair is that it drives you nuts.

68
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,100
Writer, how about this kind of segment?

69
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,880
What segment?

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,270
Just like now,

71
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,500
we'll look into things that seem like no big deal, but we're curious about.

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,180
We'll test it and expose it with science. Is that too childish?

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,550
No, no, no. It's nice. I think that'd be fun.

74
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,730
Soo Yeon, how about we make this?

75
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,800
Really? I'll help, then.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,480
But, Joon Ki, do we have to watch TV like this?

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,350
If we want to form feelings of love, shouldn't we?

78
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,510
There's nothing we can do about it, then.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,830
But,

80
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,300
- why are they like that? 
 - They're practicing acting.

81
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,700
They need to stay together until they love each other or something.

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,290
Gosh, acting isn't for everyone.

83
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,620
Woo Sik, it's been so long since you've been home.

84
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,330
I've been so busy recording that I couldn't come in.

85
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,600
I need to wash up and go out again.

86
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
I told you to go home and rest. Why would you follow me here?

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,380
No one's home. It's boring.

88
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,770
Hey, you think this is a playground you come to when you're bored?

89
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,790
I bought the pizza, though.

90
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,060
Forget it.

91
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,300
- I'm going to take a shower. 
 - Okay.

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,520
Unni, I'm curious about something. Is my teacher dating anyone?

93
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,300
No, he isn't. He's never dated anyone. You didn't know?

94
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,620
He's never dated? But, he's so cool!

95
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,810
Well, Woo Sik has liked only one person this whole time.

96
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,900
It's his first love. That didn't work out for him.

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,810
Really? Who's his first love?

98
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,380
I'm here!

99
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,290
You're here?

100
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,290
What is Joon Ki doing?

101
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,350
It just gets frustrating if you know. Just act like you don't notice.

102
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,350
Hello, Unni.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,870
Hello.

104
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,020
Soo Yeon, do you want some pizza? Mi Na bought some.

105
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,420
No, there's something I have to do. Mi Na, have fun while you're here.

106
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,910
Alright.

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,460
What? Soo Yeon loves pizza. What's up with her?

108
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,500
Wait, Unni. Who is my teacher's first love?

109
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,680
- You just saw her. 
 - What?

110
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,900
Soo Yeon is his first love?

111
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,230
Gosh, this isn't even Mi Na's house. Why is she always here?

112
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,130
Why do I keep getting bothered about Mi Na?

113
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,630
No, no. Let's stop and write the pitch.

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,230
Sunbae.

115
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,230
So, should we sleep now?

116
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,940
Should we?

117
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,220
Goodnight.

118
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,410
But, Joon Ki, would real lovers

119
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,900
sleep away from each other like this?

120
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,100
Then, how...?

121
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,760
Should we try doing arm pillows?

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,060
What? Arm pillow?

123
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,850
I think we might get a lot closer if we do.

124
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,800
Then, well, we can try it.

125
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,550
Here.

126
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,430
Goodnight.

127
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,980
Yeah. You, too. Goodnight.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,170
Why is this so complicated? Does this fit?

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,340
Noona, you're up?

130
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,600
Yeah! You're up?

131
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,600
But, what is this?

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,750
Oh, this. My dressing table and its chair were old. So, I bought new ones.

133
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,620
Oh, really? Why did you buy a disassembled one?

134
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,900
It's way cheaper.

135
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,620
We're just barely getting by with the food truck. I have to save.

136
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,870
Wow, my girlfriend is so frugal.

137
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,700
No, no. But, assembling this isn't easy.

138
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,810
Really? If it's hard, should I do it?

139
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,240
- You? 
 - Yeah.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,900
But, this is a bit complicated.

141
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,400
Noona, even if I'm dumb, I'm good at stuff like this.

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,900
I'll assemble it quickly, so just trust me.

143
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,400
Really? Wow, my boyfriend's so cool.

144
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,740
This isn't anything much. Thirty minutes is enough for something like this.

145
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,770
Oh, that's cool. Here's the manual, then.

146
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,500
No, no. I don't need a manual for something this little.

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,510
Alright, let's start.

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,730
  This is so awkward. I'm going nuts.

149
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,220
  How much longer do I have to do this?

150
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,140
  Gosh, this is so uncomfortable. My neck hurts.

151
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,400
What is it?

152
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,540
My neck is cramping up. Can we stop this? I can't do this any longer, it's too uncomfortable.

153
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,450
Yes, yes.

154
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,900
Sunbae, I can't do this, either. How are we supposed to feel love for one another?

155
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,360
Is there no other good way?

156
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,900
Oh, how about this? Should we talk about each other's strengths and what we like about each other?

157
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,330
We might learn each other's charms.

158
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,590
That's a good idea.

159
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,860
- I'll start first. 
 - Okay.

160
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,930
Sunbae, your voice is really nice.

161
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,670
It feels warm and makes you trustworthy.

162
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,980
Oh, really? Thank you. Then, I'll try.

163
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,600
Yes, yes.

164
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,520
Joon Ki, your smile is so charming.

165
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,200
It's a smile that makes the person looking feel happier.

166
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,070
Really?

167
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,600
And, your eyes are so charming. The way that the ends of your eyes are slightly slanted upwards.

168
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,620
It's a bit sexy.

169
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,110
Oh, sexy? That's you!

170
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,600
Sunbae, you exercise a lot, so your chest is broad.

171
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,450
And, your lips. They're so sexy.

172
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,890
My lips aren't sexy. It's nothing compared to yours.

173
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,040
Your lips are the kind that's just asking for a kiss.

174
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,460
S-Soo Yeon. It's not like that.

175
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,690
I know what you're thinking, but it's a misunderstanding.

176
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,740
No, just continue.

177
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,630
I didn't hear anything.

178
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,680
It's a misunderstanding! Soo Yeon!

179
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,460
Soo Yeon!

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,050
So, the chair is finished.

181
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,030
Noona, how is it?

182
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,100
But, something is weird about it.

183
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,600
Weird about it? What?

184
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,550
The back of the chair is a bit strange.

185
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,830
Look, it's different from the manual.

186
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,180
That's true. But, it won't affect your use of it, right?

187
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,080
Is that so?

188
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,820
Oh, it's shaky.

189
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,900
Well, it kind of feels like a rocking chair. Isn't that nice?

190
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,670
As long as it doesn't break, that's okay, right?

191
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,650
Yeah, but still. I want to use what I bought properly.

192
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,490
Alright. I'll just do it again.

193
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,750
I have to unscrew everything and start from scratch.

194
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,630
Still, it's better to just assemble properly from the get-go.

195
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,810
Yeah, got it. I'll just do it again.

196
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,110
Even though it's such a bother.

197
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,220
I didn't want to say this, but did you know that you're fussy?

198
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,130
What?

199
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,790
It's nothing. Never mind.

200
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,920
So, it's better to just use the manual.

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't need to look at it.

202
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,530
Why, are you worried that I'll assemble it incorrectly again?

203
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,890
No, it's not that, but...

204
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,370
Noona, are you not busy? Why are you still here?

205
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,350
I'm sorry, but can you leave?

206
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,970
Since you're here, I can't focus. It's like I'm taking an exam.

207
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,020
Alright!

208
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,540
I'll just leave.

209
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,860
Gosh, what did I do wrong?

210
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,270
Why is it shaky?

211
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,250
Gosh, it's so hard.

212
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,660
He was the one who offered to do it first. What's with him?

213
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,750
I just need to smack...

214
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,750
No.

215
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,510
I'll hold it in.

216
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,970
I can't hurt my boyfriend's feelings.

217
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,650
Well, then.

218
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,790
Joon Ki. My body's so stiff. I'm going to go to the sauna for a bit.

219
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,150
- Yes, you can go. 
 - Okay.

220
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,230
Sunbae! Hold on.

221
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,720
What?

222
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,320
How about we go to the sauna together?

223
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,990
Why not? Men go to the sauna together, scrub each other's back, play in the water,

224
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,230
and they get closer!

225
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,820
That's true. Let's go together, then.

226
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,110
Sounds good! Let's go together.

227
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,810
Let's go!

228
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,170
  It's gotten more awkward.

229
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,940
 Why on earth did I have to step on that soap and fall onto his body?

230
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,930
  This is driving me crazy.

231
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,840
  I keep thinking of that, so I can't even look at him in the face.

232
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,750
Sunbae, we'll take what just happened to the grave.

233
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,300
Yeah. That's what I want, too.

234
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,830
I'm thirsty. Should we have something to drink?

235
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,720
Yeah.

236
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,480
This is the twentieth time I re-did the chair.

237
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,530
How come it keeps changing?

238
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,630
And, is this really a manual?

239
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,100
If they just sketched out what to do, how am I supposed to understand that?

240
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,520
And if the person has to assemble the furniture, why do we need furniture companies?

241
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,160
I can just go to the mountain and make it from the wood myself!

242
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,800
Wow, they're trying to steal our money like this.

243
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,550
This is driving me nuts.

244
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,260
Where did I mess up?

245
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,130
Gi Bong, have a drink.

246
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,780
No, it's okay. I don't want to.

247
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,890
It hasn't worked out yet?

248
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,860
Why? Are you in a rush?

249
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,710
Do you have to use it right away?

250
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,100
No, it's not that.

251
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,120
Then, can you just wait?

252
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,860
I'm working hard on assembling this for you.

253
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,380
How can someone be so ungrateful?

254
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,930
Hey. If you're having a hard time, I'll just do it myself.

255
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,770
Noona, I'm not being like this because it's hard to make.

256
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,010
I just feel as though you're lacking in manners and respect towards your boyfriend.

257
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,790
What?

258
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,560
Never mind. We'll officially start this talk after I finish this.

259
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,310
Gosh, what did I do wrong?

260
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,990
You drink it like that, too?

261
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,840
Yes. Yakult is delicious if you suck from the bottom.

262
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,340
I do that, too! I sometimes rip open the bottom of water bottles with my teeth.

263
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,960
I do that with beer, too. We have a lot in common.

264
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,330
How cool.

265
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,640
Sunbae, how about we have some ramen since we're hungry?

266
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,920
I'd love ramen.

267
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,370
What should we add to the ramen? Kimchi?

268
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,690
Hey, instead of that, do you have pork belly?

269
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,460
I put pork belly in my ramen.

270
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,890
I love putting pork belly in my ramen, too! I love it!

271
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,290
That's so cool!

272
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,660
Really.

273
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,790
Wait. What's this clap?

274
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,790
I always clap like this. Ever since preschool.

275
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,790
I've clapped like this since preschool, too!

276
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,100
I saw a hyung in Seal Class in my kindergarten clapping like this in preschool and followed it.

277
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,590
Which preschool did you go to?

278
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,360
One Hope Preschool in Hwagok-dong.

279
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,820
What? Me, too!

280
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,260
Really? Then, were you the hyung in the Seal Class?

281
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,210
I guess so!

282
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,560
Wow, that's so cool!

283
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,250
Ah, the smell of pork belly.

284
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,690
Sunbae! Is it not done yet?

285
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,590
It's almost done.

286
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,900
Alright. The ramen is coming out.

287
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,130
Joon Ki!

288
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,620
Joon Ki, are you okay? You're not hurt?

289
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,910
Yes, I'm okay.

290
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,100
Your hand, is it okay?

291
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,130
It stings, but it's okay.

292
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,360
What do we do about your hand?

293
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
I said it's okay.

294
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,490
Sunbae.

295
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,060
  Recording   
 ♫   If I could see your smile  ♫

296
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,290
Okay, let's end it here for today.

297
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,710
Good work today!

298
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,090
How was it?

299
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,470
It's improved a lot, but there are parts of the more detailed emotions that aren't really working.

300
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,560
Don't worry about it. You've improved a lot.

301
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,040
Yes, Teacher.

302
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,120
You should go in early. I'm going to go in and sleep today.

303
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,960
You should rest. You haven't slept in a few days.

304
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
But you were the one who wrote these lyrics, right?

305
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,250
Yeah. What about it?

306
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,990
The lyrics are so sad.

307
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,430
Did you write it thinking of Soo Yeon?

308
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,590
What? Why are you bringing her up all of a sudden?

309
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:23,260
I heard Soo Yeon was your first love.

310
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,720
If you have time to wonder about that, you should focus on maintaining your voice instead.

311
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,880
I'll be off.

312
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,060
Writing a pitch is harder than I thought.

313
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,100
I don't even have much time left. What a problem.

314
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,800
Soo Yeon?

315
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,990
Oh, you're here now? You're late.

316
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,010
Yeah, the recording just ended. But, what are you doing at this hour instead of sleeping?

317
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,130
I'm making a pitch for a new segment.

318
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,000
A new segment?

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,860
Well, we're looking into making a new segment about trivial things that people are curious about.

320
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,320
Really? Sounds fun.

321
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,220
Really?

322
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,450
But, I can't think of anything for examples.

323
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,700
Really? Should I help you? I have some things I'm curious about.

324
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,400
Like what?

325
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,190
- You know the Hulk, right? 
 - Yeah.

326
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,660
The Hulk has a small body, but you know how his body enlarges once he's mad?

327
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,300
Everything rips except for his pants.

328
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,630
It's weird, right? You're so curious, right?

329
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah! I'm curious, but

330
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,570
I don't think it follows the segment idea.

331
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,460
Really? Then, how about this?

332
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,860
You know how you place your earphones in your pocket or bag? It's normal when you place them in,

333
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,910
but they're always tangled when you take them out.

334
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,920
It's not like anyone tangled them. It's such a mystery!

335
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,060
That's true, I've been curious about that, too.

336
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,100
And, if you always sleep in, but ask someone to wake you up,

337
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,330
you always wake up naturally before that time!

338
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm curious about that too.

339
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,330
Me, too! Wow.

340
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,230
I couldn't think of anything by myself.

341
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,590
It got solved by talking to you.

342
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,330
Thanks, Woo Sik.

343
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,730
Oh, don't be.

344
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,350
You didn't sleep, so you must be tired. Just go and rest.

345
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,160
No, it's okay. I'm not tired at all.

346
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,230
I slept at the studio, so I'm wide awake now.

347
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,490
Let's see. What else is there?

348
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,270
Here.

  Guest House Waikiki

350
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:45,430
Gi Bong, it's so late now. How about sleeping and doing it tomorrow?

351
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,090
If you're tired, you can go sleep.

352
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm going to spend all night if I have to.

353
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,640
Alright, then. Got it.

354
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,100
Noona, I've been curious about something since earlier.

355
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,070
What is it?

356
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,960
Noona, did you really have to buy this?

357
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,750
What?

358
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,470
I mean, there's a lot of assembled furniture, so why did you have to buy this?

359
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,670
I'm just curious.

360
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,600
I told you earlier that I did it to save money.

361
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,830
So, how much did you save? ₩1,000,000? ($1,000)

362
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:27,730
No, not that much, but... It's better to buy things that are cheaper.

363
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:33,220
Alright. I'll assemble this until my eyes fall out or I get herniated discs,

364
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,730
so just sleep comfortably since you saved money.

365
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,300
It's so bright already.

366
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,600
Gi Bong!

367
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,690
Three.

368
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,990
You stayed up all night?

369
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm calculating, so don't speak to me.

370
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,950
What?

371
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,170
Okay.

372
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,140
But, Gi Bong, we need to get ready to go work at the food truck.

373
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to step out of this room until I finish this.

374
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,230
So, you can go by yourself today.

375
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,910
What? Hey,

376
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,970
you know I can't do that because I'm not good at driving.

377
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,310
You can just hire a driver and go.

378
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,630
What? Hey.

379
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,200
Why would I call a driver for a food truck business?

380
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,150
You told me you saved money by buying this. You can use that saved money on calling a driver.

381
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,830
Hey, you, really!

382
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,590
Hey, I have to focus.

383
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,760
Alright, alright. Got it.

384
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,180
I'll be going by myself, then.

385
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,050
Alright. Why are you still here?

386
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,040
If he wasn't my boyfriend, I would just...

387
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,970
Let's hold it in.

388
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,590
What's the phone number for the driver?

389
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,240
You scared me.

390
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,850
When did you wake up?

391
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,500
An hour earlier.

392
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,160
You should've woken me up. Your arm hurts, right?

393
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,790
No, it's fine. Your head is so light that

394
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,890
it didn't hurt me at all.

395
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:46,800
Oh, but, do you know you sleep like an angel?

396
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,250
You snore so cutely, too.

397
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,620
Oh, stop that. Why do you say that?

398
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,240
But, I feel like we've gotten closer. Right?

399
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,850
I know, right?

400
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,040
I slept so well because your arm pillow was so nice.

401
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,540
Oh, I slept well, too.

402
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,370
This was the sweetest night of sleep I've had in a while.

403
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,510
What a relief.

404
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,000
We should go wash up.

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
You're going?

406
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
I'll go, too, then.

407
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,870
Alright.

408
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,160
What kind of relationship did I say we had?

409
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,520
You said I was your male friend, abbreviated for Ma'friend.

410
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,840
But I see you as more than a male friend now.

411
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,340
What do I do?

412
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,270
Your Majesty.

413
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,300
Gong Gool. Gong Gool.

414
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
- Gong Gool. 
 - Your Majesty.

415
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,190
Gong Gool.

416
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,320
Gong Gool.

417
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,540
You know...

418
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,620
It does seem like they love each other,

419
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,720
but isn't it a bit much?

420
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,620
Yeah.

421
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,410
It's a bit burdensome.

422
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,660
Gosh, what happened within the span of a few days for them to be like that?

423
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,480
Tell them to stop living together.

424
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,630
And, don't ever keep them together.

425
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,930
Have them not talk to each other from now on. Okay?

426
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,960
Yes, I got it.

  Waikiki Guest House

428
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,060
Oh, I'm tired.

429
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,080
But, I can't believe I wasted money on a driver.

430
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,510
Anyway,

431
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,710
I wonder if Gi Bong's done assembling it.

432
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,970
Gi Bong!

433
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,860
What's wrong? Did something happen?

434
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,210
Noona. I can't do it.

435
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,640
- What? 
 - I can't do it any longer.

436
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,150
I assembled it a hundred times,

437
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,850
but the shape keeps changing.

438
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,260
And there are always parts left. I can't do it anymore.

439
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:07,320
I wanted to show you my cool side, so I tried so hard,

440
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,250
but I'm really sorry.

441
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,790
Why am I like this?

442
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,930
I'm dumb and I can't do anything properly.

443
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,150
I'm just so useless.

444
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,790
No, no. You assembled it so well!

445
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,730
I like this design more than the actual design. Really.

446
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,490
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

447
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,030
It's completely my style.

448
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,080
Wow, Gi Bong, you could be a furniture designer.

449
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,360
Yeah. I am a bit artistic.

450
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,400
Of course. You're my boyfriend.

451
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,650
I didn't know you'd like it. I worried for no reason.

452
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,650
Yeah, so, don't worry and rest. You didn't sleep.

453
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,770
Alright. I'm going to go rest now.

454
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,720
Noona, you should use that well.

455
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,080
And, here's a gift.

456
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,250
This kept getting left out.

457
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,240
I'll use it well!

458
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,650
How am I going to use this?

459
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:20,180
What is this? Should I just re-assemble it by myself?

460
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,360
Gosh, he'll get offended again.

461
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,420
I'll use this.

462
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,760
What do I do with this?

463
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,320
It's so uncomfortable!

464
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,550
What is this?

465
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,120
What? Where's the handle?

466
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
Oh, my.

467
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,920
The handle is inside.

468
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,380
It's so hard dating an immature boyfriend.

469
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,520
I wonder how the pitch went.

470
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,940
I want the producer to like it.

471
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,340
Writer, how did it go? What did the producer say?

472
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,250
Well, he said he likes it!

473
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,710
- Really? He really does? 
 - Yeah.

474
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,930
And, in a few days, he'll announce it to the chief!

475
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,130
So, as long as it passes that stage, it'll be an official segment?

476
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,330
Of course.

477
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,490
So, I made the name.

478
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,360
"Knowing It Is Pointless, But Things You're Still Curious About."

479
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,980
It's shorted to "Al-Sseul-Gwaen-Goom."

480
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,420
Oh, I love it. It's fun.

481
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,490
And, we'll put your name on the front.

482
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,040
Han Soo Yeon's "Al-Sseul-Gwaen-Goom."

483
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,310
What? You'll put my name in the segment?

484
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,440
Yeah! It's your idea, so of course.

485
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,530
And, if this works out, you'll have a fixed corner in your name!

486
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,450
So, let's work hard, yeah?

487
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,580
Yes, Writer.

488
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,960
Thank you.

489
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,820
So, if it works out, I'll have a corner in my name.

490
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,010
Gosh, how could this happen?

491
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,460
It's so great.

492
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,000
This is all thanks to Woo Sik's help.

493
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,540
Should I buy him some sweet pancakes?

494
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,090
  Yeah, Soo Yeon?

495
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,600
Oh, Woo Sik, it's me. Do you want some sweet pancakes?

496
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,370
  Sweet pancakes? Why? Do you want to?

497
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,500
  Do you want some? I'm in front of the sweet pancake store.

498
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,790
Really? I'm in front, too.

499
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,660
How many do you want?

500
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,290
Soo Yeon, how many do you want?

501
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,890
Five hundred.

502
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,930
What?

503
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,390
Five hundred! Buy me 500.

504
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,810
♫  All day today   ♫

505
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,090
Soo Yeon? Soo Yeon!

506
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,460
Oh, she hung up.

507
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,390
What's wrong?

508
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,680
Huh?

509
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,130
It's nothing.

510
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,330
Excuse me, how long does it take

511
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,680
to make 500 sweet pancakes?

512
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,860
♫  It's strange, when I look at you  ♫

513
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,930
♫  My heart melts silently  ♫

514
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,230
What is this?

515
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,700
Why am I mad at him?

516
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,470
Why?

517
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,700
♫  Delight, I've fallen in a sweet kind of love  ♫

518
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,510
What is it?

519
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,030
Sweet pancakes.

520
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,690
♫  All right   ♫

521
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,660
The store owner said she didn't have enough ingredients for 500 of them.

522
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,520
What do I do?

523
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,170
It's fine.

524
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,770
But, Woo Sik, I'm tired.

525
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,960
Oh, alright.

526
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,300
Rest up.

527
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,650
♫  Anytime, forever, it's you in my heart  ♫

528
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,470
What's wrong with me?

529
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,670
What's with me?

530
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,580
So hot.

531
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,420
Alright! Ramen is here.

532
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,590
Tada!

533
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,620
Oh, you made it well. You're the expert at ramen.

534
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,170
Yeah, right? Should we try it?

535
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,920
Lee Joon Ki, stop.

536
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,150
What? What's wrong?

537
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,230
You still have hemorrhoids. Why would you eat ramen?

538
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,370
Don't you know how bad spicy food is for hemorrhoids?

539
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,920
It's fine, it's fine.

540
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,780
They say you have to eat before you die. I'll eat what I want to.

541
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,910
You can't!

542
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,590
Just wait a bit longer. I'll make you chicken soup with ginseng and abalone.

543
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,480
What? Abalone? Why?

544
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,770
Is abalone good for hemorrhoids?

545
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:05,320
No, you start performing tomorrow, so I'm going to make sure you're in good shape.

546
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,830
Wait. Your first show is tomorrow?

547
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,510
Yeah.

548
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,330
I can't go tomorrow because of work with Yoo Ri.

549
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,720
Oh, I can't make it tomorrow because of recording.

550
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,940
Whatever, you cheap jerks! I wasn't even expecting you guys!

551
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,060
I guess only my best friend thinks of me.

552
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,700
You only call me your bestie in these situations, right?

553
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,020
Anyway, I'll go to your show tomorrow with my coworkers, so do well.

554
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,600
Don't worry. I'll reserve all the good spots,

555
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,890
so bring all of them.

556
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,860
  A King's Male Friend

557
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,410
Why am I so nervous?

558
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,830
This is driving me nuts.

559
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,390
Joon Ki!

560
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,770
Here.

561
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,370
Oh, you're here?

562
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,240
Thanks for the flowers.

563
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,790
Why do you look so lifeless?

564
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,590
Huh? Well, I'm so nervous.

565
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,160
It's my first time in so long, acting in front of an audience,

566
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,640
so I can't remember my lines. It's all chaotic.

567
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,000
Hey. What if I mess up the show?

568
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,860
What? Why are you getting scared? It's not like you.

569
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,690
Friend, just believe in yourself.

570
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,860
You're really good at acting. I acknowledge it!

571
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,310
To me, you're Song Kang Ho, Hwang Jung Min,

572
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,490
and Lee Byung Hyun. You know, right?

573
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,660
So, don't be scared. Just go out there and show off your acting.

574
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,460
Got it?

575
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,550
Alright.

576
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,330
Look at your response.

577
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,910
Can you do well?

578
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,900
Alright, I said!

579
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,220
I have to do my makeup again because of you! You!

580
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,570
You're more like yourself now.

581
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,250
Thanks. I got a little less nervous now.

582
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,410
Jeong Eun? You have to go now.

583
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,990
Alright, got it.

584
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,490
Who is that?

585
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,520
Oh, he's my coworker I'm filming with.

586
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,590
Good luck, okay? Fighting!

587
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,890
Yeah! I can do this.

588
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,090
Let's go!

589
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,950
I wish time stopped just like this.

590
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,910
Should we just flee far away? Let's go to the mountain and hide so no one can find us.

591
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,790
We can live together happily.

592
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,170
How is that?

593
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,810
I apologize, but I cannot do that, Your Majesty.

594
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,550
You can't? What do you mean?

595
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,110
I need to leave your side now.

596
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,190
Leave? To where?

597
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,160
To Seoul in 2019.

598
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,330
2019, you say? What are you saying?

599
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:21,030
To be honest, I am from Seoul from the Republic of Korea in 2019.

600
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,310
I'm a high schooler from a science class at Myeongseong High School.

601
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,220
I was making a time machine, but I made a mistake and ended up here.

602
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,310
What did you say? A time machine?

603
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,270
I cannot explain any further.

604
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,690
I must go now, Your Majesty.

605
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,060
It was an honor to be a king's

606
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,560
male friend, Your Majesty.

607
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,950
Then, goodbye, my male friend.

608
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,220
Gong Gool! Gong Gool!

609
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,680
Gong Gool!

610
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Gong Gool!

611
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,050
♫  Looking the stars   ♫

612
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,350
♫   Looking the stars in the sky  ♫

613
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,690
♫  Look at the sky filled with stars  ♫

614
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,960
♫  Like my heart from looking at you all day long  ♫

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,790
♫  It shines towards you  ♫

616

♫  Without any warning my heart (my heart)  ♫

620
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,540
I wonder if Joon Ki performed well.

621
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,200
I feel bad that I couldn't go.

622
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,780
I should finish the recording so I can leave.

623
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,130
Why is everyone so late?

624
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,430
Producer, hello.

625
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,360
You're late.

626
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,960
What's with your expression?

627
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,390
I had a drink after recording yesterday, so my stomach isn't so good.

628
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,880
Mi Na isn't here, right?

629
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,340
I'm going to lie on the sofa for a bit until she's here.

630
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,230
I feel like I might die.

631
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,320
Hello, Teacher.

632
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,300
What? What's with your voice?

633
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,380
Well, I have enteritis.

634
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,280
Enteritis? Why?

635
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,510
After recording, I went to the beach with my friends and ate some grilled clams.

636
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,200
I think that had something to do with it.

637
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,500
What? What kind of person are you?!

638
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,990
You're a singer, but you go to the beach and play around when you have a recording the next day?

639
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,100
Are you a professional?

640
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,030
A long time ago, before I recorded, I was scared my voice might not be the best,

641
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,940
so I wore a scarf around my neck even during the summer. Did you know?

642
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,230
If you're a professional, shouldn't you take care of yourself?

643
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm sorry, Teacher.

644
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,950
I don't want to hear it!

645
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,430
And, Hyeong Seok, same goes for you.

646
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,920
Does it make sense to drink before the recording?

647
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,220
You should at least not inflict damage on the work.

648
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,040
You all can't take care of yourselves.

649
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,190
No, it's fine. I am so disappointed!

651
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,770
Teacher!

652
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,690
  Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

653
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,800
  Can't you see? I'm cleaning.

654
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,690
  Buy me 500.

655
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,570
Why do I keep getting concerned about Woo Sik and Mi Na being together?

656
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,230
Do I actually like him?

657
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,570
Soo Yeon, did you find the photos?

658
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,540
Yes, Writer.

659
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,660
The chief is so picky.

660
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,800
We have to prepare it perfectly. We might have to stay up all night again.

661
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,820
That's okay, right?

662
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,780
Of course. Don't worry.

663
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,690
Let's start.

664
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,290
Yeah. I don't have time to be concerned about Woo Sik.

665
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,450
The most important thing to me right now is work.

666
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,990
Let's work and not focus on anything else.

667
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,170
So boring. So boring.

668
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,030
What is this? Why is no one here?

669
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,560
I'm so bored that I might die.

670
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,210
It's so late! Why isn't Jeong Eun here?

671
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,630
I'm here!

672
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,600
Why are you here now? You look so innocent, but you're not!

673
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,590
Were you with that boy this whole time?

674
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah.

675
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,440
But, Joon Ki, Min Joon asked me out!

676
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,960
What?

677
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,190
So, did you say yes?

678
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,860
I said I'd think about it.

679
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,930
But, I think I might.

680
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,060
What do you mean? You don't even know what he's like!

681
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,990
Why? Min Joon's a good person.

682
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,090
How do you know? You don't even have a good eye for men!

683
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:41,670
What? But, why does it concern you if I date him or not?

684
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,530
I'm worried that you might meet someone weird like Sang Woo again

685
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,470
and start crying and making a fuss like then. Why?

686
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:54,000
Is that so? What do I do?

687
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
Well, bring him over.

688
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,020
I'm going to see if he's worthy of dating or not.

689
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,390
Men understand men!

690
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,430
Really? Okay.

691
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,320
Agh!

692
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,530
What? What's wrong? Did something happen?

693
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,200
I got so mad in the studio.

694
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,890
Do we not have more ice?

695
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,830
Ice? It's in the fridge.

696
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,070
Okay.

697
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,130
Gosh, there really are no professionals!

698
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,060
Choose a quick date.

699
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,890
I'll look at him properly.

700
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,590
I'll be so strict. I don't have a good feeling.

701
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,800
  Waikiki Guest House

702
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,430
How could I, Your Majesty?

703
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,490
I'm here. You're there.

704
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,300
- Joon Ki. 
 - Yeah?

705
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,460
I'm taking off from the food truck today, so Noona and I are going to see your show.

706
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,890
What time is it at?

707
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,460
I don't have a show today.

708
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,490
Really? Then, when is it?

709
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,530
It's the day after tomorrow, so come with the others then. I'll save good spots.

710
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,290
Alright!

711
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,960
But, Woo Sik said he'd go record early in the morning. He's sleeping in?

712
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,200
Aren't you going to record?

713
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,430
Woo Sik! Wake up!

714
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,100
Woo Sik, what's wrong?

715
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,630
Are you sick?

716
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,360
Well, I've been cold since last night.

717
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,090
I have a fever, too.

718
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,890
Gosh, you wore short sleeves and ate a whole bucket of ice. You might have the flu.

719
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,090
Really?

720
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,300
This won't do. How about you take the day off?

721
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,030
No, the company told me to end recording quickly.

722
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,600
I think I'll be okay if I go to the doctor and get a shot.

723
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,320
Gosh, I might die.

724
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,570
I got a shot and took meds, but I feel worse now.

725
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,530
I might have to postpone the recording today.

726
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,250
You're here?

727
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,440
Why are you guys so early?

728
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,140
We are so sorry about yesterday. It was unprofessional.

729
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,270
We'll come to our senses and work hard.

730
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,630
I also went to the hospital yesterday and got an IV. I feel much better. I won't make that mistake again.

731
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,520
I'm so sorry.

732
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,410
Yeah. Okay.

733
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,920
We've prepared everything, so should we record right away?

734
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,310
R-Right away?   This is driving me nuts. I'm sick, so I don't think I can.

735
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,400
  But, I can't tell them I can't after what I said yesterday. What do I do?

736
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,540
Teacher, what's wrong? Are you sick?

737
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,130
You don't look so good.

738
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,180
No, no. I'm fine.

739
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,960
I'm totally fine.

740
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,250
Producer?

741
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,970
- That's my spot. 
 - What?

742
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,730
Oh, really? I just wanted to sit here once.

743
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,510
  Gosh, it's so cold. Why am I so cold?

744
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,960
But, why is it so hot?

745
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,390
It's because the equipment is heating up.

746
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,370
Should we turn on the AC?

747
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:34,290
The AC? Do we have to?

748
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,770
If I'm hot, my voice isn't so great.

749
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,190
Gosh, that won't do. The singer's condition matters most. Crank up the AC!

750
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,610
Okay!

751
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,680
  Gosh, this is driving me nuts. So cold. So cold.

752
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,910
Am I your man?

753
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,040
That won't work.

754
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,170
Hey, Joon Ki. Min Joon is here.

755
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,700
- Really? Okay. Gi Bong, let's go! 
 - What? Me, too?

756
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,270
Yeah. Jeong Eun's future depends on this. We have to.

757
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,960
- Let's go! 
 - I have to play this game.

758
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,030
Game? Just come! Quickly!

759
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,390
Thanks for inviting me to your house, Jung Eun.

760
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,380
It's nothing. My friends wanted to meet you.

761
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,120
Oh, really? I'm nervous.

762
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,950
Let's set aside all the corny conversations that happen in dramas.

763
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,820
Let's go to the main point.

764
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,950
So, I know your name. What is your family like?

765
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,650
I'm the second child. I have a brother and a sister.

766
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:47,020
The second? You're in the middle. Okay. How about your house?

767
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,820
You own? Full lease? Half lease? Rent? Monthly rent?

768
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,850
What? Why are you asking me?

769
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,720
I'm like an older brother and father to Jeong Eun.

770
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,120
I just asked so I can know more about the man she says she's going to date.

771
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,150
Why? There's something bad, isn't there?

772
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,330
- No, that's not it. 
 - Then, say it.

773
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,920
- Yes. I live with my parents.
 - Okay, at home.

774
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,550
What do you like so much about Jeong Eun?

775
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:19,260
Jeong Eun? She's so pretty and nice.

776
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,270
Pretty and nice? How funny!

777
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:33,920
Okay, your humor was great. You pass. You only pass that part.

778
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,790
How is he? He's okay, right?

779
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,090
Yeah. He's handsome and nice. He seems alright.

780
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,560
Hey, hey, hey. What's the point in being handsome and nice?

781
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,480
Men are competent! That's the most important part. Didn't you know?

782
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,950
Min Joon is the CEO of a game company. His sales last year were 10 billion won.

783
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,940
Ten billion won? You said he was a minor actor.

784
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,910
Oh, that's his dream, so he does that as a hobby when he has time.

785
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,180
- So, he's competent. Go date him! 
 - Should I?

786
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,860
Date him? No! Who cares if he's handsome, nice, or competent?

787
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:15,540
He has to be healthy. Don't you know that if you're not healthy you lose everything?

788
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:21,520
- Min Joon is a national gold medalist in the Iron Man Triathalon. 
 - Gold medalist?

789
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,660
So, he's pretty much perfect. Just date him! No matter what!

790
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,400
Geez, what do you mean?

791
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,730
Hey, it doesn't matter if a man is handsome, nice, competent, or healthy.

792
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,670
Then, what else?

793
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,830
- You need to give him drinks to see his true side. 
 - Drinks?

794
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:44,950
You need to meet a man who won't make mistakes even when he's drunk. That's how you won't have a hard time.

795
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,560
So?

796
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,960
I'll do it, so you can watch.

797
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,070
- Min Joon. Let's have a drink. 
 - What?

798
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,580
Let's drink. Drink. Why? You can't drink?

799
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,110
No, it's not like that.

800
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,270
Alright, let's go. Follow me!

801
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,020
Min Joon, what's wrong with him?

802
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,110
Well, he had a few glasses and he got so drunk.

803
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,060
What is your name?

804
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,950
Look at that!

805
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,940
Gosh, he's doing this again. Geez, he's the worst!

806
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,320
♫   Please open your heart up to me   ♫

807
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,960
Teacher, how was it this time?

808
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,470
What? What is it?

809
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,060
How was the song this time?

810
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,960
Teacher, what's wrong? Teacher?

811
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,130
- What did you say? 
 - Do you like the song?

812
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,590
Oh, I think it was the best by far.

813
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,020
  I don't remember at all. At all!

814
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,960
Really? What a relief.

815
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,660
  It's so cold. Gosh, that darn AC!

816
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,130
Teacher, why are you shivering so much?

817
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,390
What? Oh, the thing is,

818
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:38,170
I loved your singing so much that I'm shaking.

819
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:43,160
Teacher, your nose is runny, too. Do you have a cold?

820
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:50,230
Oh, this? Yeah, my nose is runny, but not from a cold.

821
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,190
Actually, when I focus on my work, I get a runny nose.

822
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,140
Oh, really?

823
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,630
Alright, I think the recording went well. Should we end here?

824
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,540
Already? I'm not satisfied with it yet though. I'll do it a bit longer.

825
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,070
- Must you really? 
 - Yes.

826
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,560
Today, I'm going to do my best until the end until I'm satisfied with myself.

827
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Oh, really? Wow, you're quite ambitious, aren't you?

828
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,230
It's because I'm your student. I'll go do it again.

829
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,490
  Gosh! I can't do this any longer. What do I do? I'm so cold.

830
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,360
Soo Yeon! Could you let me borrow your pink dress?

831
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,740
What? Why?

832
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,040
Min Joon told me he wanted to go to a nice restaurant with me.

833
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,730
Oh, really? It's in the closet, so you can take it.

834
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,300
Thank you!

835
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,220
But, Soo Yeon, you're still preparing for that presentation?

836
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,370
Today's the presentation, so there's no time left.

837
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,730
But still, you should rest a bit. What if you fall asleep during the presentation?

838
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:13,210
Is that so? Then, I'll take a nap for just 30 minutes.

839
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:21,150
Gosh, it feels great.

840
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,510
Oh, I need to set an alarm first.

841
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:32,890
♫   Please open your heart up to me   ♫

842
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,790
Teacher! How was it this time?

843
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,050
- Teacher! 
 - What? What?

844
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:50,520
I mean, I called for you, but you didn't respond.

845
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,480
Oh, I was thinking. Just thinking.

846
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,820
  No. I momentarily fainted.

847
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,530
- Teacher, your nose is running from both sides. 
 - What?

848
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,690
Oh, this? As I told you earlier, it's because I'm focused.

849
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,020
If I focus at my maximum, I get a runny nose from both sides.

850
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,340
Alright, let's rest for ten minutes before resuming.

851
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,690
Gosh, everyone looks so tired, so...

852
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,900
No, it's fine. Let's continue.

853
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,040
Hey, we should rest from time to time to do better.

854
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,450
Alright, I'll use the restroom. We can start again after.

855
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,670
But, Teacher, are you really okay? You look so unwell.

856
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,180
No, I'm completely fine!

857
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,010
What's wrong?

858
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,940
There! Who is that person?

859
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,240
What? Who?

860
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,580
Th-That person in black! You don't see him?

861
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,320
What? No, no one's there.

862
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,190
Is someone there?

863
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,960
Oh, my bad, then.

864
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,160
You're so strange today. Teacher, hold on.

865
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,320
It's so hot. You have a fever!

866
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,900
No, no. My body is normally quite hot. I'm fine!

867
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,890
No, you're not fine! You have a bad fever and a runny nose!

868
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:29,720
Teacher, you're sick, right?

869
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,610
Well, I have a

870
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,590
tiny, tiny feeling of a cold.

871
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:41,020
Of course. You kept wanting to end the recording early.

872
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,670
You told me that I'm not professional and I can't take care of myself.

873
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,320
You kept insisting that.

874
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,860
Mi Na. Professionals can get sick, too.

875
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,900
But, it depends on whether they can mentally handle the sickness—

876
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,480
He's there again! Again!

877
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,850
What? Who?

878
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,300
The grim reaper. Grim reaper!

879
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,260
Gosh, this won't do.

880
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,950
Teacher, you're sick, so let's end the recording today.

881
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:14,030
What? What are you saying? I'm a professional!

882
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,200
I can do it until the end!

883
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,900
Stop being so stubborn!

884
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,500
You've been seeing the grim reaper since earlier. How can you record?

885
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,520
Mi Na, should we have another go?

886
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,900
I'm sorry, but my enteritis is back at it again.

887
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,190
Can we stop the recording today?

888
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,060
Oh, really?

889
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,630
Uh,

890
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,480
Producer, what should we do?

891
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,680
What? Uh, well.

892
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,160
I'm sorry, Teacher.

893
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,270
I think I'm still lacking a professional mindset.

894
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,460
What? Hey, what are you doing?

895
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,800
Should we continue the recording, then?

896
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,940
Well, Mi Na, I'm sorry, but could you take me to the taxi?

897
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,260
I can't walk by myself.

898
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,450
Alright.

899
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,690
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow, then.

900
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,520
Goodbye!

901
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,280
Mi Na, let's go quickly! Someone keeps following me.

902
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,580
Gosh, I might die. What if I really die?

903
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,720
What was the thing following me earlier?

904
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,910
Twee twee!

905
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:33,010
Gosh, that scared me. Why's he sleeping here?

906
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,070
- What do I do? 
 - Soo Yeon!

907
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,490
What's the matter?

908
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,090
I had a presentation for the new segment, but I fell asleep and now I'm late.

909
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,270
I didn't even practice properly. I'm in huge trouble.

910
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,980
What?

911
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,360
I'll drive you.

912
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,350
You will?

913
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,800
But, you don't look so good.

914
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,170
No, I'm fine. It's fine.

915
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,490
Really?

916
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,510
I'm serious. You said you're late. Let's go quickly.

917
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:03,010
I'll drive you there, so practice on the way.

918
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,540
Okay, got it. Thanks.

919
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,980
Let's go.

920
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,390
♫  Again pumping pumping pumping  ♫

921
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:15,600
♫  Even if nothing turns out right I won't break down  ♫

922
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,280
Thank you, Woo Sik. I got here on time.

923
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,360
No, it's fine. Go in quickly.

924
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,090
Yeah, I'll hurry. Thank you!

925
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,200
Do well! Fighting, Soo Yeon!

926
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,220
♫   That world   ♫

927
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,920
Gosh, I made it just in time.

928
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:34,110
Oh, my head. I need to rest a bit.

929
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,870
Why am I so dizzy?

930
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,020
Excuse me! Are you okay?

931
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,680
Call 119 quickly!

932
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,690
119!

933
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,010
 Excuse me, come to your senses!

934
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,720
 - Excuse me! 
 - Are you okay?

935
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,320
  Waikiki Guest House

936
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,690
Ow, my insides.

937
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,350
I'm dying, ugh I'm dying.

938
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,610
You're awake now?

939
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,000
What? Why am I sleeping here?

940
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,030
You don't remember?

941
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,910
You said that you get Min Joon drunk, but you got drunk instead.

942
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:24,820
You kept spitting at the ground here and singing. It was a mess.

943
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,970
What? Really? Me?

944
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,360
Yeah! Why would you be so concerned about him?

945
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,590
Are you jealous that Jeong Eun is seeing another man?

946
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,950
What? Blegh!

947
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:43,070
What are you saying? I'm just worried that Jeong Eun will suffer after dating a bad man.

948
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,950
You're just speaking nonsense!

949
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,160
That little...

950
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,270
Gosh, what's with his attitude?

951
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,730
He's so ill-mannered.

952
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,580
Yes, hello?

953
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,010
Cha Woo Sik? Yes, he's my younger brother.

954
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,210
What? The hospital?

955
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:13,880
- Soo Yeon. A picture is missing here. 
 - What?

956
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,170
How did this happen?

957
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,080
Gosh, I saved it to my USB but forgot to transfer it.

958
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,310
I left my USB at home. What do I do?

959
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,370
Then, you can just contact your family and have them email it to you.

960
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:28,270
Yes, I'll do that. Give me a moment.

961
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,070
  Cha Woo Sik

962
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,870
Why isn't he picking up?

963
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,660
Then, let's call Yoo Ri.

964
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,710
 Hello?

965
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,510
Yes, Unni, it's me. Are you home?

966
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,490
No, I'm at the hospital.

967
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,190
The hospital? Why?

968
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,700
Woo Sik collapsed on the road, so I'm at the emergency room at Mirae Hospital right now.

969
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,990
What? Woo Sik?

970
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,820
He was fine just earlier!

971
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,060
What? Woo Sik was with you?

972
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,490
I don't know the details. I'll call you later.

973
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,630
Soo Yeon.

974
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,210
What's the matter? Did something happen?

975
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:27,590
Soo Yeon, where are you going? The chief is coming soon!

976
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,610
Soo Yeon!

977
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,120
Ow, my head.

978
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,880
Woo Sik, are you awake?

979
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,510
What? Noona?

980
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,000
Where am I?

981
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,480
Where else? It's the hospital.

982
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,820
The hospital? Why?

983
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,340
You collapsed in front of Soo Yeon's broadcasting station.

984
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,060
Why were you there?

985
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:00,270
Soo Yeon said she was late for her meeting, so I drove her there.

986
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,060
What?

987
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:06,260
Still, your fever was over 40º C! Why would you go there?

988
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,290
She said she was late for a really important presentation. What was I to do?

989
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,960
Gosh, do you know how scared I was because of you?

990
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,820
I'm sorry.

991
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,590
But, did Soo Yeon do well on her presentation?

992
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,650
Hey, is this the time to be worrying about Soo Yeon?

993
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,430
Gosh, you fool. Geez.

994
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,670
  Emergency Room

995
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:37,220
Noona. I think I'm fine now. Let's go.

996
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:37,980
It's so stuffy here.

997
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:41,450
First, let's listen to what the doctor has to say.

998
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,690
Gosh, it's so stuffy.

999
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:51,400

1000
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,470
Teacher.

1001
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,960
Oh, Mi Na. How did you get here?

1002
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,590
She called you, so I told her.

1003
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,130
Teacher, are you really okay?

1004
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:05,280
Huh? Yeah, of course. I'm fine now.

1005
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,110
What a relief. It's such a relief.

1006
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,730
Hey, what's wrong with you? Get off.

1007
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,940
No, I don't want to. Do you know how shocked I was?

1008
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,870
What? What's with you?

1009
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,500
Hey, I told you I'm fine.

1010
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,760
I was worried that something bad happened.

1011
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,500
I didn't even confess yet.

1012
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,390
What? Confess?

1013
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,990
I like you, Teacher.

1014
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,580
What?

1015
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:37,990
♫  In my love love love you, fall in love  ♫

1016
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:41,600
♫  love love you forever   ♫

1017
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,080
♫   love love is for with you  ♫

1018
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:52,290
♫  Forever by your side,  ♫

1019
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:55,990
♫   your warmth  ♫

1020
01:02:55,990 --> 01:03:00,280
♫  I'll embrace it,   ♫

1021
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,520
♫  I'll embrace it deep in my heart  ♫

1022
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,410
  Preview

1023
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,870
  Teacher, I'm here.

1024
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:08,910
  I'm a bit unusual, aren't I?

1025
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,140
  I really like my teacher so much.

1026
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,200
  Soo Yeon and I are just friends now.

1027
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,890
  The room is cleaned up. What a relief.

1028
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:15,850
  "Even Just A Minute."

1029
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,690
  Is this Woo Sik's song?

1030
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,400
  Joon Ki, where is Woo Sik?

1031
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,950
  He went out to record.

1032
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,310
  - Oppa? 
 - Who's this?

1033
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,470
  This is a new part-timer at the bakery.

1034
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,320
  Hold on, I'll be right back.

1035
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,030
  He wants to see me at the place we didn't meet at yesterday? Did Gi Bong cheat?

1036
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:30,360
  Hey, Gook Gi Bong! Who is this girl? Who?

1037
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,670
  Where are you going dressed like that?

1038
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,460
  -  I'm going on a date with Min Joon. 
 - Again?

1039
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,900
  You can date, too, then.

1040
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,700
  I'll count to three with my eyes closed. The person in front is my fated love.

1041
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,860
  One, two, three.

1042
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,990
  Gosh, you scared me! Why are you here?

1043
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,490
  - Soo Yeon 
 - Dad!

1044
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,140
  We're taking the afternoon plane tomorrow. Pack up.

1045
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,190
  Do I have to go?

1046
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,490
  Are you going to send Soo Yeon off like this?

1047
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,560
♫  Though I can't convey it with the words I love you  ♫
