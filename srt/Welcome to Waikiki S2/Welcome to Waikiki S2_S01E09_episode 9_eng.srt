1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,460
What are you doing? Aren't you getting out?

2
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,190
Oh yeah, I should do that.

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,640
You were really surprised, huh?

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,220
Don't worry about it and just sleep for today.

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,480
Okay.

6
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,190
Let's go inside.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,590
Let go of her!

8
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,420
Joon Ki?

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,000
Jeong Eun, are you alright? Did anything happen?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,380
Why do you worry me like that?

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,240
Let's go, Jeong Eun.

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240
Hey, Joon Ki. I heard you disappeared in the middle of the shoot. What happened?

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,190
Something came up.

14
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,200
What?

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,220
Why are you so curious? Mind your own business!

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,260
What are you going to do? The director was furious.

17
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,620
Well, I got a call from the writer. I was fired.

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,600
Didn't you do the shoot in my place today? She said you were so good, she wants to recommend you to other jobs.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,530
What? Oh, it somehow turned out that way. What about you now?

20
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,400
It's all right. It didn't suit me anyway.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,290
I think I'm more of an actor than a  reporter. Actor.

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,640
So don't worry about me and do well.

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,450
- Okay. Thanks, Joon Ki.
 - Sure.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,540
What was that sound?

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,850
Jeong Eun has been at it for a while, saying she's got a lot on mind.

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,600
What do you mean?

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,720
I can't believe it. Does this mean I've fallen for Joon Ki?

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,420
No. There is no way.

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,900
It can't be.

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,480
 All about my male friend

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,670
It doesn't make sense. Why would I?

32
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,490
Looking at him now, he's not that bad.

33
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,170
What is he working so hard on?

34
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,560
A phone call? Who could it be?

35
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,800
Is this Mr. Gook Ki Bong? This is Good Morning Bank.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,900
Your credit card has been hacked. No need to panic.

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,900
In order to prevent it, you need to immediately wire 50 dollars to your friend Lee Joon Ki's account.

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,980
He was prank calling?

39
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,630
Yes, all right. Goodbye.

40
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,130
He even wrote a script?

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,060
What an idiot.

42
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,260
I should have guessed.

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,940
Hello?

44
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,020
Is this Ms. Kim Jeong Eun? This is Good Morning Bank.

45
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,290
Your credit card has been... Hello? Hello...

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,080
I must be out of my mind. Hey, where are you going?

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,670
I just got a call from Good Morning Bank. My credit card has been hacked.

48
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,800
They said I need to wire 50 dollars to Joon Ki's account. So I'm on my way to the bank.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,020
Gi Bong, you don't have to go.

50
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,480
What? Why?

51
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,440
Just forget it. I got the phone call too and they said they were able to stop it.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,300
- Really?
- Yes.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,890
What a relief! I was so worried.

54
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,360
Are you naive or stupid?

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,400
Hey. Who are you calling stupid? I'm not stupid. Who does she think I am?

56
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,010
That was a good sleep.

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,450
What, are you just waking up now?

58
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,540
Yeah. I spent all night searching

59
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,500
how to get grants from the government for when I start Yuri's Kitchen.

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,690
Oh, I need to make a resume. Could you let me borrow your laptop?

61
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,590
A resume? For what?

62
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm going to get a job. A friend I know said he could get me a job at a car dealership.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,400
I need a resume and a self-introduction.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,020
A car dealership?

65
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,500
I've actually really liked cars for a long time

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,160
so I'm going to try working at a car dealership.

67
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,030
Oh, is that so? What about poems, though? You said you'd be a poet.

68
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,470
Well... I had a bad writer's block so I'm going to quit.

69
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,600
- Writer's block? 
 - Yeah.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,990
You probably don't know how painful it is.

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
He must really be crazy.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,480
Gosh, he's still making prank calls at that age?

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,020
Gosh, why would I like someone like him?!

74
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,500
  What's with him? Why's he cleaning when no one asked him to?

75
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,450
 Right. He can be a slacker, but he's quite responsible.

76
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,180
  Did he just steal money?

77
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,770
Nice!

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,500
  Is he regretting it?

79
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,260
  Maybe he has a conscience.

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,400
  What? Why's he wiping it with a wet wipe? No way...

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,940
I almost left my fingerprints on it. Nice!

82
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,230
Right, I'm the idiot for expecting anything.

83
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,490
You said it's your first time as a reporter.

84
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,200
Yes, it is.

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
What'd you do before that?

86
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,890
I used to do narration, model and worked in a cafe part-time.

87
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,300
What about other jobs, besides those part-time jobs?

88
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,030
I don't have any.

89
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,380
But... Even though I lack experience, I can do well as a reporter.

90
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,600
I always do my best once I start doing something.

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,800
I'm sorry, but I don't think we can work together.

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,930
What, why?

93
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,920
Is it because I lack experience compared to others?

94
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,500
Do you think it's because of that?

95
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,240
Then what is it? Can you please tell me?

96
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,740
It's not "yuh," it's "yo."

97
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,440
What?

98
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,600
It's not "yuh," it's "yo." That's the correct pronunciation.

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,050
What?

100
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,410
Do you still not understand?

101
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,910
Reporters are people who deliver accurate information in an accurate way to the viewers.

102
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,760
Proper pronunciation is fundamental.

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,210
Do you need another reason? You can leave now.

104
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,940
What, you failed? Why?

105
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,140
Pronunciation is fundamental for reporters

106
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,800
and he said he can't work with someone that doesn't even have the basics down, like me.

107
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,030
Oh, really? Don't be too disappointed. You can look into other places.

108
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,540
What do you mean other places? I haven't given up yet.

109
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,300
What? Then what are you going to do?

110
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm going to practice hard and go back. I'll show him that when I put my mind to it, I do it.

111
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,780
Wow, you're really determined.

112
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,500
If I give up on this too, I feel like I won't be able to do anything else.

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,590
So, I'm going to pass this time and succeed. I'll get my house back.

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,840
Then, I'll pay for all of my dad's debt.

115
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,300
Yeah. Good luck.

116
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,180
Thanks. But, Woo Sik.

117
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,460
I think I'll feel better if I have one more sweet pancake.

118
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,470
I'm here!

119
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:03,200
You're so loud! I was so surprised. What's with that megaphone?

120
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,810
Oh, this? I needed this, so I bought it!

121
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,040
  Did he buy the megaphone using the money he stole?

122
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,700
Gosh, what are you going to do this time?

123
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,200
Our counter was missing some money. That was you, wasn't it?

124
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,300
No! I've never been near the counter!

125
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,580
  What a lie.

126
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,070
We're here.

127
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,230
You're finally here!

128
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,200
Gosh, you scared me! What are you doing now, you punk?

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,670
Just leave him be. Who knows what he's thinking.

130
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,300
Oh, Joon Ki, do you know any reporters?

131
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,890
I need to practice pronunciation, but I don't know how.

132
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,750
Why are you practicing your pronunciation all of a sudden?

133
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,400
It's to be a reporter.

134
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,500
I do know a reporter that reports and teaches speech classes.

135
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,710
Really? Can you introduce me?

136
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,890
  Hey, You Too / Speech Classes

137
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,210
Hello.

138
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,620
Oh, who are you?

139
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,400
Joon Ki referred me to you.

140
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,760
Oh, Han Soo Yeon?

141
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,650
You came to fix your pronunciation, right?

142
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,300
Yes. My pronunciation isn't so good.

143
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Do not worry. I'm an expert in this area.

144
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,490
Well, shall we start?

145
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,810
Yes!

146
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,370
You can just repeat after me.

147
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,790
Put strength in your belly, then relax your shoulders.

148
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,580
Open your mouth as big as possible.

149
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,640
Great! Alright, be confident, okay?

150
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,320
Yes!

151
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,420
Look at the shape of my lips and follow carefully.

152
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,330
Ga, gya, guh,

153
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,950
gyuh, go, gyo,

154
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,950
goo, gyoo, geu, gi.

155
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,590
Ga, gya, guh,

156
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,300
gyuh, go, gyo,

157
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,610
goo, gyoo, geu, gi.

158
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,710
Great! Alright, we're moving onto the "d" sounds.

159
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,320
Da, dya, duh,

160
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,830
dyuh, do, dyo,

161
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,030
doo, dyoo, deu, di.

162
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,120
Wait. What's wrong?

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,660
Huh? Well...

164
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,090
Why do you keep blinking

165
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,760
in the middle of a serious class?

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,310
You must focus!

167
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,330
Yes. I'm sorry.

168
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,130
Alright.

169
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,260
Next is the "ch" sounds.

170
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,700
Look at the shape of my lips and follow carefully.

171
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,650
Cha, chyah, chuh, chyuh,

172
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,090
cho, chyo, choo, chyoo.

173
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,780
  Gosh, she's spitting so much.

174
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,650
Again, again. Why do you keep doing that?

175
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,270
Well...

176
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,320
 She's teaching me for free. I can't tell her that she's spitting on me.

177
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,170
My eyes are just a bit dry.

178
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,390
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,650
Cha, chya, chuh, chyuh,

180
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,840
- Cho. 
 - Cha, chya, choo,

181
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,330
- chyoo, cheu, chi. 
 - Onto the "k" sounds.

182
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,660
Ka, kya, kuh, kyuh, kyo, kyoh...

183
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,220
  Oh, the "k" sounds are okay.

184
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,190
Onto the "t" sounds.

185
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,820
Ta, tya, tuh, tyuh, toh,

186
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,780
tyo, too, tyu, teu, ti.

187
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,110
What are you doing? You're not repeating it.

188
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,730
What? Alright.

189
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,940
Ta, tya, tuh, tyuh, toh,

190
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,100
tyo, too, tyoo,

191
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,470
teu, ti.

192
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,720
What is the matter?

193
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,090
The rest of the pronunciation is okay, but your "too" pronunciation

194
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,180
is not so great.

195
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,870
Watch the shape of my lips well and follow along.

196
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,740
Too!

197
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,280
What are you doing instead of following along?

198
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,430
Yes.

199
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,630
- Too. 
 - No, no.

200
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,430
It's not that. It's "too"!

201
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,230
"Too."

202
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,940
It's not like that. Place your tongue against your front teeth and bounce off.

203
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,470
Too!

204
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,090
Too.

205
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,560
Stop wiping! You're going to scratch your face.

206
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,910
I feel like I still smell the saliva.

207
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,050
I was hit by at least one liter of saliva today.

208
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,170
That much?

209
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,990
I wasn't even hit by it. She was just spitting at me!

210
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,160
Especially when she was saying "too." I could see the spit flying towards me so clearly.

211
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,020
Gosh, so gross. I'm going to shower.

212
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,440
Noona, thanks for your laptop.

213
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,910
Did you make a good resume?

214
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,330
Yes. Tada.

215
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,600
- Can you look it over? 
 - Yeah.

216
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,120
Let's see. Name, Gook Gi Bong. Your phone number is correct.

217
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,530
Your birthday, current address, and family register...

218
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,620
None?

219
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,830
What do you mean, "none"?

220
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, I've never seen the CEO here, so I put that.

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,990
So... You've never seen the CEO before, so you put "none"?

222
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah. Is that not it?

223
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,630
Have I seen the CEO before?

224
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,250
- Maybe I should've written that I have seen them before. 
 - Hey!

225
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,070
This "bonjeok" is not "seen!"

226
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,980
What? What's the difference?

227
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,510
Well, so... Never mind.

228
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,830
Anyway, moving on.

229
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,480
Should we look at your self-introduction?

230
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
Hey, Gook Gi Bong! You used this as your self-introduction?

231
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,060
Why, what's wrong with it?

232
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,190
What'd he write?

233
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,190
I'll read it to you. Listen.

234
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,100
"Hello. I'm Gook Gi Bong."

235
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,280
"My hobby is writing poems. My talent is baseball."

236
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,130
"My hope was to go to the major leagues, but I have no hope now."

237
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,630
"And, my favorite side dish is sausage."

238
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,190
"The side dish I hate is spinach."

239
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,740
"Open parenthesis. Disgusting. Closed parenthesis."

240
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,830
"I will conclude my self-introduction here." How is that?

241
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,220
Hey! How could you write it like that?

242
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,130
What about it? It's self-introduction!

243
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,520
Hey, what you wrote is like what elementary schoolers use when they introduce themselves to their friends.

244
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,150
In self-introductions, you write about what you're good at.

245
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,270
You have to write about why you need to be picked.

246
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,230
If you saw that self-introduction, would you want to hire that person?

247
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,140
Oh, really? Well, I've never written something like this so how would I know?

248
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,920
So, should I rewrite it?

249
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,630
Of course, you need to.

250
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,210
How could you use this? Gosh, go rewrite it.

251
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,940
Gosh, I worked so hard on it.

252
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,980
  Waikiki Guest House

253
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,730
I'm here.

254
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,430
What is this? Where is everyone?

255
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,590
 But... Why does he keep carrying that megaphone around?

256
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,000
Gosh, why's he sleeping there again?

257
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,810
  What? Is he putting a blanket on him?

258
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,290
  Yeah, even if he's immature, he's warm.

259
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,330
  What? He fed him a fart?

260
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,500
Oh, the smell!

261
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,600
Ow! Who is this?!

262
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,290
Gas, gas! Joon Ki's Gas!

263
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,080
Gosh!

264
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,230
Geez! Stop it, you crazy man!

265
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,030
I'm sorry! I was just playing around.

266
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,240
Gosh, I didn't get to sleep all night from writing my self-introduction.

268
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,640
Alright, alright.

269
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,490
I'll go, so you can sleep. I'm sorry.

270
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,740
Geez.

271
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,370
  What? Why's he back?

272
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,590
  No way...

273
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,050
  What? What's wrong with him? No way.

274
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,710
I failed to control my strength.

275
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,490
I was right.

276
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,050
Why someone like him...

277
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,220
Now, we finished our basic pronunciation practice,

278
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,790
so we'll practice phrases.

279
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,960
"The porridge next door is black bean porridge."

280
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,160
"The porridge at the house behind is red bean porridge."

281
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,720
  Here she goes again.

282
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,750
Han Soo Yeon, stop blinking! Be focused! Focus!

283
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,400
If your eyes are so bad, go to the eye doctor!

284
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,700
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

285
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,900
  Alien Two

286
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,890
  Oh, why are there so many "too" sounds?!

287
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,130
This is really hard.

288
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,830
You need to follow the shape of my lips precisely. Got it?

289
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,530
Is the movie I saw yesterday Alien 2?

290
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,650
Is it Robocop 2?

291
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,660
Is it Terminator 2?

292
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,730
Or, is it Back To The Future 2?

293
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,360
Is the movie I saw yesterday Alien 2?

294
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,720
Is it Robocop 2?

295
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,660
Or, is it Back To The Future 2?

296
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,760
Your "too" sounds are still not that great.

297
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,850
Okay, just look at my lips.

298
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,050
Teacher. I'll just practice the "too" sounds by myself. Okay?

299
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,490
No, you can't. When you practice sounds,

300
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,050
you need to look at the shape of the lips to learn quickly.

301
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,260
Alright, from now on, I'll do it a bit closer,

302
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,690
so look properly.

303
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,450
Is the movie I saw yesterday Alien 2?

304
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,620
Is it Terminator 2?

305
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,700
Or is it Back To The Future 2?

306
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,120
Don't turn away.

307
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,390
Look at the shape of my lips properly!

308
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,390
I'll start again, so look properly.

309
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,680
Is the movie I saw yesterday Alien 2?

310
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,870
Is it Robocop 2?

311
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,660
Back To The Future 2?

312
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,770
Is Soo Yeon still in class?

313
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,490
I guess so. She seems to be really determined this time.

314
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,660
Wow, that's great.

315
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,370
I thought she was just a princess from a rich family.

316
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,290
Noona, Noona, Noona!

317
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,890
I rewrote my self-introduction. Can you look?

318
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,160
Really? Okay, let's take a look.

319
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,600
"Hello. I'm Gook Gi Bong."

320
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,390
"For all of my life, I lived as a fool who knew nothing but baseball."

321
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,460
"Besides baseball, there was nothing else I liked or was good at."

322
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,730
Oh, the beginning is nice!

323
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,960
Yeah!

324
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,260
"So, for a time, my  head was boring..."

325
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,360
Wait. My head was boring? What does that mean?

326
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,600
Don't you know that phrase? My head was boring.

327
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,020
- I was a boring and frustrating individual, to the point where my head was boring. 
  - Hey.

328
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,600
Is that "my head was boring?"

329
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,730
It's "stuffy"!

330
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,930
Oh, really? I didn't know.

331
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,600
I can just fix it!

332
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,030
Fine, let's move on.

333
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,990
"But, to me, there was something else I liked as much as baseball."

334
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,490
"Cars."

335
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,530
"But, people told me to do this and bow."

336
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,700
Wait, do this and bow? What's that?

337
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,860
Noona, don't you know that phrase?

338
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:24,560
- You tell people to do this and that. You just order them around. 
 - Hey.

339
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,690
That's not, "Do this and bow."

340
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,260
It's, "Do this and do that!"

341
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,370
No! It's, "Do this and bow!"

342
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,620
I definitely know this one!

343
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah, whatever. Let's move on for now.

344
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,220
"If you miss a talent like me and regret it afterward, it would be rocking the stable door after the horse is stolen."

345
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,470
"Rocking the stable door"? What do you mean?

346
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,190
It's a proverb. "To rock the stable door after the horse is stolen."

347
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,900
Even if you rock the stable door after the horse is stolen, you can't get the horse back.

348
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,690
It means that even after you're doomed, nothing will fix it!

349
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,400
What are you even saying?!

350
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,560
It's not "rocking the stable door". It's "locking the stable door".

351
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,670
Gosh, the amazing thing is that you make meanings out of all these spelling errors.

352
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,550
I don't think so. I'm pretty sure it's "rocking".

353
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,430
I've read that before in a book before.

354
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,250
Gosh, my blood pressure. Hey.

355
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,400
I'll fix it, so go into your room. Get lost!

356
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,720
What? Don't tell me to do this and bow!

357
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,870
I told you that's not it!

358
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,850
Hey, Woo Sik. Just get him out of my sight. Hurry!

359
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,460
Yeah, okay.

360
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,230
Let's go. Hurry.

361
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,560
It's not that big of a deal! Don't you know the saying "failure is the goodness of success"?

362
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,260
That little... You, come here!

363
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,330
Why?!

364
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,910
- Terminator 2!
 - Terminator 2!

365
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,970
- Back To The Future 2!
 - Back To The Future 2!

366
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,090
- Back To The Future 2!
 - Back To The Future 2!

367
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,080
- Ta, tya, tuh, tyuh.
 - Ta, tya, tuh, tyuh.

368
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,740
To, tyo, too, tyoo, teu, ti.

369
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,140
Ta, tya, tuh, tyuh, to, tyoh,

370
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,920
Too, tyu, teu, ti!

371
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,370
I'll take you to a really nice place for lunch.

372
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,630
Hold on.

373
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,830
You scared me! What's the matter?

374
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,400
They say that in today's society, many people make the mistake

375
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,960
of judging people by their first impression.

376
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,590
Apparently, there's a man who failed to see

377
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,600
a person's full potential by judging her too fast. Special Reports met that man.

378
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,740
What are you trying to do?

379
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm not done yet.

380
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,540
"The manager of the soy sauce store is Mr. Jang."

381
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,900
"The manager of the soybean paste store is Mr. Kang."

382
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,110
"The porridge next door is black bean porridge. The porridge at the hose in the back is red bean porridge."

383
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,840
Is the movie I saw yesterday Alien 2? Robocop 2? Terminator 2?

384
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,820
Or, was the movie I saw Back To The Future 2?!

385
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,440
How's that? Is my pronunciation still weird?

386
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,960
Do you still think I have no right to be a reporter?

387
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,830
Guys! Guys!

388
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,310
You're here? How'd it go?

389
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,960
I passed! I passed!

390
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,870
The chief of the broadcasting company wants to work with me.

391
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,760
Really?

392
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,670
Yeah, I'm going to work with them for a month. If I'm good enough, they'll have me as an official reporter.

393
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,210
Oh, wow, Han Soo Yeon, you finally did it!

394
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,890
I told you that I can do whatever I put my mind to.

395
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,330
Right. They say a face can move mountains.

396
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,250
Soo Yeon, you must feel so excited.

397
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,340
What? "A face can move mountains"?

398
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,520
Yes. If a person works hard enough, good things will happen

399
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,370
and he or she can achieve anything. You don't know that idiom?

400
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,650
It's "faith", not a “face".

401
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,490
Hey, Gook Gi Bong, stay right where you are.

402
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,420
What?

403
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,300
What's wrong with you?

404
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,530
It's okay to be wrong, you know?

405
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,870
Come here. Come here!

406
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,360
Don't make decisions you'll regret.

407
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
It would be rocking the stable doors after the horse is stolen.

408
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,310
I said that's not it! You're dead today.

409
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,580
Come here. Come here!

410
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,990
Come here!

411
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,140
If he doesn't know it, he should just not use them! He's so stubborn.

412
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,690
Yeah.

413
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,250
But, where's Joon Ki?

414
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,190
Yeah, right? He took that megaphone with him and left earlier.

415
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,610
But, what's he been doing lately?

416
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,290
Jeong Eun, don't you know?

417
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,500
I don't know! Why are you asking me about Joon Ki?

418
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,480
What? Why is she getting angry all of a sudden?

419
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,490
Why is he asking me about Joon Ki?

420
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,570
Gosh, I can't believe that loser makes my heart race.

421
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,110
I'm crazy. Crazy!

422
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,820
Why's he calling me?
   Crazy Joon Ki

423
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,830
What is it?

424
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,580
Oh, Jeong Eun. Come to the front of the store.

425
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,280
The front? Why?

426
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,350
You'll know when you come out. Hurry up!

427
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,790
Gosh, why's he calling for me so late at night?

428
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,380
What? What is it?

429
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,780
Just hold on.

430
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,450
What are you doing? Hurry!

431
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,760
Why's he here?

432
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,990
Just wait.

433
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,810
What are you doing? Hurry up.

434
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,500
Okay.

435
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,350
Jeong Eun. I'm sorry.

436
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,340
It was my mistake.

437
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,200
Is that good enough?

438
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,090
Good enough? Hey, you call that an apology?

439
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,350
Gosh, I can't even see any sincerity at all.

440
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,310
Well, if you're going to be like that, there's nothing I can do.

441
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,210
Neighbors! The famous announcer, Jo Jeong Woo, seduced my innocent friend...

442
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,150
I'm sorry, Jeong Eun. I lost my mind for a second.

443
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,390
This will never happen again! Please forgive me!

444
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,450
Whatever, just leave!

445
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,330
Thank you.

446
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
Is that good enough?

447
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,360
You're not going to protest anymore in front of the broadcasting company, right?

448
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
Okay.

449
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,320
But... I'm only letting it slide because my friend said it's okay.

450
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,470
If you do something like that to my innocent friend,

451
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,250
♫  Yesterday I got butterflies   ♫

452
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,820
no, to other girls, I'll go on the news and blabber about it. Not just the broadcasting company.

453
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,890
Got it?

454
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,290
I got it!

455
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,420
I'm going now, okay?

456
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,850
Jeong Eun, I'll be off.

457
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,460
♫  Don't run away, don't disappear  ♫

458
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,350
That was great.

459
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,790
Joon Ki, what happened?

460
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,020
Oh, well, you didn't get a proper apology from that man.

461
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,220
How was it? Do you feel better now?

462
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,630
Oh, and, if someone bothers you again, tell me.

463
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,590
I'll end whoever tries to bother my friend!

464
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,520
Got it?

465
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,830
It's done.

466
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,210
Let's go back inside, friend.

Hello viewers, I'm "Special Forces" Reporter, Han Soo Yeon.

472
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,180
Today, I'm here to meet the world-renowned conductor of

473
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,060
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Park Chul Hong, who has turned a new chapter in his life to be the owner of a sheep farm.

474
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,090
How was that?

475
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,060
Oh, it was great! She's good!

476
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,890
Yeah! You're like a real reporter!

477
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,470
Really?

478
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,100
I practiced all night because it's the first shoot. I'm so nervous.

479
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,530
Don't worry! You'll do great.

480
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,490
Thanks.

481
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,890
How do I look?

482
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,620
It doesn't look good. It looks like you stole your dad's suit.

483
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,590
Really? Maybe it's because I always wore a baseball uniform and I haven't worn this in a long time.

484
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,230
But, why are you wearing a suit?

485
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,560
- Oh, Gi Bong, it's your first day of work too, right? 
 - Yeah.

486
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,490
I finished my training yesterday and it's my first official day today.

487
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,850
Oh, wow, two people at our home have their first day of work today!

488
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,310
Guys, don't make mistakes. Do well.

489
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,080
Especially you, Gi Bong.

490
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,220
I got it.

491
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,220
Oh, I'm late. I'll be off!

492
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,090
Bye!

493
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,330
Gi Bong, let's go together!

494
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,040
My express bus is almost here.

495
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,770
Express bus? Where are you filming?

496
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,630
- Pyeongchang in Gangwon Province. 
 - Pyeongchang?

497
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,160
Should I take you there then?

498
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,990
You? You said you had an event today.

499
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,150
Huh? Oh, my event is near Pyeongchang, too.

500
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,530
It's on my way there, so I'll drop you off.

501
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,990
  Extreme Job

502
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,250
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

503
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,160
I told you to sleep instead of practicing.

504
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,530
What are you going to do? You barely slept last night.

505
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,550
It's alright. I'll be okay soon.

506
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,130
Gosh.

507
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,790
Anyway, thanks to you, I was able to come comfortably. Thanks.

508
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,880
Don't be thankful. I just dropped you off on my way to the event.

509
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,730
But, when does the filming end? I'll come to pick you up after my event.

510
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,890
Oh, no, you don't have to. It'll be hard on you. I'll go by myself.

511
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,390
No, no, it's nothing. It's close by!

512
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,620
Alright, then. I'll call you when I'm about to end later then.

513
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,450
- I'll see you later. 
 - Yeah, good luck!

514
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,950
- Fighting, Han Soo Yeon! 
 - Fighting!

515
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,750
♫  Even if I can't see it in front of me   ♫

516
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,120
♫    I'm going to keep butting heads with that world until the end  ♫

517
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Hyung? Me? Oh, I'm on my way to the event.

518
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,640
But there's a bit of traffic. Me? I'm close by!

519
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,060
I'll be there soon!

520
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,690
I'm late. I'm late!

521
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,100
  Ki Sung Motors

522
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,430
How is the mileage for this one?

523
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,680
The mileage? Oh, well, how much was it?

524
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,530
They say it's quite good.

525
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,890
So, how much does it go per liter?

526
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,440
Per liter? Hold on.

527
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,720
Gosh, how frustrating. Forget it.

528
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,740
Sir, wait! The mileage... 16...

529
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,280
No, no. 20, no 30!

530
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,690
Gi Bong! What are you doing right now?

531
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,860
You're a dealer, and you don't even know the mileage?

532
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,260
Do you know how many clients you lost today?

533
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,760
- I'm sorry. 
 - This won't do with an apology.

534
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,690
You need to sell a car today!

535
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,700
If you don't sell a car, don't come back tomorrow.

536
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,190
- What? 
 - Got it?

537
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,850
Oh, yes.

538
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,770
Gosh, where did you even come from?

539
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,620
Yes, Mr. Kim.

540
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,530
This is driving me nuts.

541
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,770
What have you been looking at since earlier?

542
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,660
This is a government website for Youth Business Support.

543
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,140
I was wondering if I could get support after setting up my business.

544
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,860
There's something called the Youth Business Support?

545
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,100
- Yeah, there is.  
 - I see.

546
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,000
Jeong Eun isn't even eating. What's she doing in her room?

547
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,720
Hold on.

548
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,450
Gosh! You scared me!

549
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,420
Do you think I'm a ghost or something?

550
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,520
Why'd you get scared? Just go eat.

551
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,730
Whatever! You can just eat it.

552
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,080
Why are you getting annoyed?!

553
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,110
When did I ever? You've got to be kidding me.

554
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,220
Hey!

555
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,490
This little... Gosh, what did I do wrong?!

556
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,950
Your existence itself is a mistake, but I'm sure you did something wrong.

557
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,030
No, I didn't.

558
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,020
Why would she be like that, then?

559
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,590
Anyway, I'm going to look for business support, so go and apologize.

560
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,770
I'm going!

561
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,770
Bye!

562
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,070
No. I didn't do anything wrong.

563
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,410
Jeong Eun.

564
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,420
What is it now?

565
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,730
Did I do something wrong to you?

566
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,310
It's not like that.

567
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,260
What's wrong then?

568
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,120
What is it? Just tell me.

569
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,760
Is it because I added soy sauce to your coke yesterday?

570
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,340
Huh? That was you?

571
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,250
It wasn't that?

572
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,640
Then it must be because I played ice hockey with your shoes today!

573
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,150
You did something like that?

574
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,120
That not it, either?

575
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,640
Ah, it must be this then!

576
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,960
I got it, aigoo.

577
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,210
Here, I'm giving it back.

578
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,490
Your wallet was in the kitchen, so I couldn't help it.

579
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,640
You stole my money?

580
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,760
Stole? I borrowed it.

581
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,410
I just didn't tell you.

582
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,980
I returned it, so we're good, right? Come on, don't be angry.

583
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,000
Whatever. Just leave.

584
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,800
I said leave!

585
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,860
This is too much!

586
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,310
I got it. I got it.

587
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,200
I took another one last time, too.

588
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,510
I'll give it back, okay?

589
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,560
Today, I'm with the New York Philharmonic...

590
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,820
Why is my voice so hoarse?

591
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,010
And I'm so sleepy.

592
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,660
Soo Yeon, are you ready?

593
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,860
Yes. I'm all ready.

594
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,600
You kept saying how well you could do in front of the chief.

595
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,110
Let's see you how good you are.

596
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,720
I'll try my best.

597
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,080
But where is Mr. Park? I want to do an interview before the shoot.

598
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,880
Really?

599
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,850
There. He's coming.

600
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,990
Hello, sir. I'm the interviewer Han Soo Yeon.

601
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,780
He... llo.

602
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,200
Coming ... all the way here...

603
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,710
must have... been hard.

604
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,260
 Huh? Why does he talk so slowly?

605
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,940
Let's do well in the interview today.

606
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,880
Yeah... let's...

607
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:49,220
But... it's been a while...

608
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:57,410
Since I've never done something like this..., I'm really nervous.

609
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,460
My eyes... might get wide...

610
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,660
and I might... speak too fast.

611
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:13,450
I'm in quite... a sensitive state...

612
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,440
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon!

613
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,040
Huh?

614
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,110
Soo Yeon, were you dozing off?

615
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,630
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,210
It's just that I was up all night practicing and I couldn't get any sleep.

617
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,290
Okay. Well, Sir, let's go film right now then.

618
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,090
Let's go.

619
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,300
I'm sorry.

620
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,260
Yeah...

621
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,820
I'm going crazy.

622
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,430
But he looks so sleepy and his voice makes it worse. He's practically a human sleeping pill!

623
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,110
No, Soo Yeon, come to your senses.

624
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,100
It's all used up.

625
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,260
  Lee Joon Ki

626
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,730
 But why does it have to be Lee Joon Ki?

627
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,030
  Do I like him?

628
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,110
  Me?

629
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,610
  Am I going crazy?

630
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,460
  No. No.

631
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,100
  No. No. No. No.

632
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,120
Jeong Eun, come out for a second.

633
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,010
Kim Jeong Eun!

634
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,830
Why is he calling again? It's so uncomfortable, ugh.

635
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,680
What is it?

636
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,060
A package came, over there.

637
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,040
A package?

638
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,460
Jeong Eun?!

639
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,150
Are you o-okay?

640
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,420
My back. My back!

641
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,670
So why did you run?

642
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,030
Can you move? Try to move.

643
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,650
I can't move.

644
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,280
Oh no. Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

645
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,990
What hospital? Just take me to my room.

646
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,560
Okay.

647
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,020
Come here. Aigoo.

648
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,230
My back...

649
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,800
Be gentle!

650
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,270
I am being gentle.

651
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,180
But, is it okay if you don't go to the hospital?

652
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,060
I'm fine. I can just put on a pain-relieving patch.

653
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,080
Where is it?

654
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,060
Over there, in the dressing table drawer...

655
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,110
  Lee Joon Ki. Do I like him? Me?

656
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,970
Am I going crazy?

657
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,790
In the dressing table drawer? I'll bring it to you.

658
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,010
No, no. I just remembered I used it up.

659
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,520
Can you go and buy a pain-relieving patch for me?

660
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,210
Sure. I'll be right back.

661
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,720
Okay.

662
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,590
I can't let Joon Ki see that.

663
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,240
I need to put it away now.

664
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,250
Gosh, my back...

665
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,350
Fine, I have no choice.

666
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,740
One, two, three!

667
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,650
Here it is!

668
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,220
What are you doing?

669
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,920
Oh, I-I'm...

670
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,680
Do you need anything? Shall I find it for you?

671
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,700
Don't come!

672
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,510
Why are you suddenly yelling at me?

673
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,000
When did I yell? I just crawled down because I was bored.

674
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,260
Joon Ki, can you lay me down on my bed?

675
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,780
Sure.

676
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,600
Come here. Watch your back.

677
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,710
Gosh, be gentle.

678
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,490
Alright.

679
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,620
Why did you even crawl down to the floor in the first place?

680
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,830
Shall I put this on you?

681
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,330
No, I'll do it myself. You can leave now.

682
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,290
- Go!
 - Call me if you need anything.

683
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,200
I was so close.

684
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,610
This is driving me nuts.

685
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,380
Why aren't there any customers?

686
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,810
I have to sell a car before the end of the day.

687
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,830
Hello, ma'am!

688
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,980
 Official Dealer Gook Gi Bong

689
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,050
I'm here to take a look at a car.

690
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,830
Oh, is that so? What kind of car are you looking for?

691
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,690
A compact car? A midsize sedan? A SUV?

692
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,990
Or an electric car? Please tell me what you're looking for.

693
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,650
There's actually a specific model I have in mind.

694
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,030
Oh, that car over there. Would I be able to do a test drive?

695
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,250
Of course, ma'am.

696
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,790
But, can we stop by at a grocery store on the way?

697
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,930
I have a few things to buy.

698
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,950
What? Well, that's...

699
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,540
Yes, of course. By all means.

700
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,650
My gosh, thank you very much.

701
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,910
You can put evrything on the table.

702
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,040
Okay, ma'am.

703
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,690
By the way, how would you like to do the contract?

704
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,910
Oh, well. I need some time to think.

705
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,150
Pardon me?

706
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,390
Well, I'll get going then.

707
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,750
I was just kidding. How could I not buy the car after all this?

708
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,750
Bring the contract.

709
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,460
Really? Thank you.

710
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,230
Thank you, ma'am!

711
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,460
I'm home.

712
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,190
Who's this guy?

713
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,010
Hello, sir. I'm a dealer from Kisung Motors, Gook Gi Bong.

714
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,640
- A dealer? What's going on? Are you really buying a car?
 - Yes.

715
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,550
I told you that you can't.

716
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,620
You're home all day. Why do you need a car?

717
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,270
Of course, I need one.

718
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,280
I have to pick up our kids and get groceries. I need it for many reasons.

719
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,410
I said you can't buy a car. End of discussion.

720
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,310
Look. We don't need a car, so please leave.

721
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,630
Sorry? Oh, okay.

722
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,310
- Gosh, what are you doing? If you leave now, I won't sign the contract. 
- What?

723
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,550
Honey, are you trying to pick a fight?

724
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,250
Follow me.

725
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,230
Goodness. Do you think that will scare me?

726
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,390
Wait, ma'am. Then what should I do?

727
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,080
Is she going to sign the contract or what?

728
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,880
  Sheep Farm

729
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,890
Sir, there is something I'm curious about.

730
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,640
You were a world renown conductor. What inspired you to start a sheep farm?

731
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,450
Just...

732
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,600
because... I love...

733
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,060
lamb skewers.

734
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,630
I see.

735
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,050
This must be the sheep pen.

736
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,360
The sheep are really pretty.

737
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:18,890
I always look after them with love.

738
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,970
That's probably why.

739
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,190
  No, you can't doze off.

740
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,460
  Get your head straight Han Soo Yeon

741
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,990
Right.

742
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,490
How many sheep do you have here?

743
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,650
I'm not sure.

744
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:44,350
I don't know the exact number,

745
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,130
Shall we try counting them?

746
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,710
One sheep.

747
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,230
Two sheep.

748
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,880
Three sheep.

749
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,460
Four sheep.

750
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,910
Five sheep.

751
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,030
Six sheep.

752
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,290
Seven Sheep.

753
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:22,970
- Soo Yeon, what are you doing? Did you just doze off again?
 - Eight sheep.

754
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,740
Nine sheep.

755
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

756
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,870
What's wrong with you?

757
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,390
I'm really sorry.

758
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,040
Soo Yeon, this is your last chance.

759
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,230
Okay?

760
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,770
Yes. I got it, producer.

761
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,360

762
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,600
Thirteen sheep.

763
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,670
Then, let's get a divorce.

764
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,660
Fine, let's do that. Let's get a divorce!

765
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,250
This is crazy.

766
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,590
I can't just leave. What should I do now?

767
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,490
Mom, I'm home.

768
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,870
Who are you?

769
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,060
I'm a man who sells cars. I stopped by because your mom wanted to buy a car.

770
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,590
Mom! Mom!

771
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,080
- What is it? 
- I have to do my homework.

772
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,120
- Can you help me with it? 
- What?

773
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,060
Your homework?

774
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,400
Excuse me. I'm sorry to ask this, but can you help him with his homework?

775
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,640
What? Me?

776
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,100
I can't sign the contract until I finish talking to my husband.

777
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,210
Do you not want to sell the car?

778
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,160
What? No, no.

779
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,680
I'll help him. Get back to your conversation, ma'am.

780
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,690
This is driving me nuts.

781
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,260
Kid, what's your homework?

782
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,470
- I have to make something using these straws.
 - Well...

783
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,870
What do you need to make with these?

784
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,490
Please make it like this.

785
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,660
You want me to make that with these straws?

786
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,130
It can't be anything else?

787
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,910
No, I don't want another one. Make this one!

788
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,460
Make it this one.

789
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,070
Make it!

790
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,190
Okay, Okay. I'll make it for you.

791
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,150
Really?

792
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,790
Almost there. Almost.

793
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:35,250
Is there anything to wash...

794
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,190
Why did you come down again?

795
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,180
I just wanted to look in the mirror.

796
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,990
Why would you look in the mirror if you're sick?

797
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,950
You're just ugly as usual.

798
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,280
Let's go back to bed.

799
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,930
Carefully.

800
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,040
Be gentle.

801
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,790
Alright.

802
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,320
One, two, three!

803
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,530
My back!

804
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,970
My butt!

805
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,860
How much do you weigh? What a rock.

806
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,450
- What?! 
- Never mind.

807
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,060
Ow.

808
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,490
I can't straighten my body.

809
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,830
Come here.

810
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,050
One, two.

811
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,030
 The note!

812
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,050
Jeong Eun, don't come down from here now, okay?

813
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,130
I got it, so just leave.

814
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,730
You're an enemy, not a friend.

815
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,780
 Huh? Why is the note there?

816
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,390
I'm going crazy really.

817
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,040
Sir, I want the turtle ship...

818
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,650
to belch fire.

819
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,860
Fire?

820
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,780
Sure, I'll do my best.

821
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,150
I'm here.

822
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,260
Huh? Who are you?

823
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,670
I'm a car salesman. I came because your mom wanted to buy a car.

824
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,620
Okay. But where's MD?

825
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,350
MD? What's that?

826
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,770
Mom and Dad. In short, MD.

827
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,860
 Is there anything you've done for me?

828
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,970
- What? They're fighting again?
  - What are you talking about?

829
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,130
Gosh, I can't believe this family. It's a total mess.

830
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,690
Totally TLR.

831
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,260
TLR?

832
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,290
This time life is ruined.

833
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,380
I was already having a bad day. Gosh, really!

834
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,860
- Where are you going? 
- I'm going to run away. Why?

835
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,830
You're going to run away? Why?

836
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,820
Why?

837
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,380
Okay, so you have a close friend,

838
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,810
but she went to the store with other friends and had ice cream with them behind your back?

839
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,020
Yeah. Isn't it completely ridiculous?

840
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,710
No, what's worse,

841
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,860
after the third period, they went to the restroom together, just the two of them, without telling me.

842
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,320
What's wrong with going to the restroom together?

843
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,290
Mister, don't you know how serious that is?

844
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,430
Is it something that serious?

845
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,060
Look at this. I knew it!

846
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,530
EDK, CM.

847
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:09,390
EDK, is Elders don't know. CM, is I can't talk to mister.

848
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,330
I'm going to run away.

849
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,490
I'm going to go.

850
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,450
- I'm sorry. 
 - Make it, Mister!!

851
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,090
Hold on a minute. Your sister says she's running away!

852
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,120
Let go of me!

853
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,050
Turtle ship! Turtle ship!

854
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,060
Let me go!

855
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,020
 Who would have thought he would start counting sheep?

856
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,900
 If I fall asleep again I might get fired.

857
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,870
 No matter what, I have to stay awake.

858
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,390
 For sure!

859
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,510
Okay, now we'll do the next interview.

860
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,820
Alright, cue!

861
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,740
Sir, you've raised 95 sheep.

862
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,000
Your sheep have especially shiny fur and look very healthy.

863
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,540
Is there a special method you have?

864
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,280
A special method?

865
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,090
There is one.

866
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,320
Really? What's that?

867
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:17,320
 Huh? The special method was playing the harp to the sheep?

868
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,240
 I'm going crazy.

869
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,360
 I'm getting sleepier listening to the harp.

870
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,840
 Okay, I have no choice.

871
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,990
I don't seem to age at all.

872
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,960
What are you doing right now?

873
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,980
Why did you come out when you're hurt?

874
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,260
I smelled ramen,

875
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,590
so I came out because I wanted to eat it.

876
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,230
Huh?

877
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,140
Even when you're in this situation you're thinking of ramen?

878
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,760
You're really something, aren't you?

879
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,850
Tell me the truth. Are you just pretending to be injured?

880
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,800
I'm not!

881
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,890
Ah, whatever. I'm going to go read my script.

882
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,430
 What should I do? Joon Ki can't see that note.

883
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,280
Joon Ki, hold up!

884
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,450
What's wrong now?

885
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,950
What's your opinion on reducing screen quotas?

886
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,970
What? Why are you asking me that?

887
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,740
We're actors, of course, we have to think about it.

888
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,830
Come sit here.

889
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,510
This is ridiculous. I can't believe her.

890
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,490
Tell me, what do you think about it?

891
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:27,400
Well, screen quotas are necessary to protect the Korean movie industry.

892
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,360
 Why am I living with a man who won't even let me buy a car?

893
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,520
 Then why don't you go back to your first love?

894
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,950
You shouldn't run away. Your parents will be so worried.

895
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,920
Mister, I want the turtle ship to have sharp horns.

896
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,360
Do it fast!

897
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,250
I got it! I'm making it sharp already!

898
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,720
I'm home.

899
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,510
Huh? Who is he? There's another one?

900
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,230
Huh? Soo Jin, who's he?

901
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,830
Car salesman.

902
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,060
Oh, you're a car salesman. But why is he here?

903
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,980
MWB. (Mom wants to buy a car.)

904
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:02,950
MRWB? (Mom really wants to buy a car?)

905
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,220
MDF. (Mom and Dad are fighting.)

906
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,060
Again?

907
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,200
Huh?

908
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,420
I need to talk to Mom and Dad about my university applications.

909
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,200
Whatever, I don't care about the university.

910
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,490
I won't go then.

911
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,100
Hey!

912
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,830
Why would you not go to university? If you can, you should go.

913
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,650
Tell me, what university do you want to go to?

914
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:29,170
This is the university I want to go to. But my grades are just above level three, so it won't be easy.

915
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,300
I see.

916
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,690
The thing is, I've always loved webtoons. I'd love to go to an art school.

917
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,430
If I prepare now, it's too late. What should I do?

918
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:40,960
Huh? I'm not sure,

919
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,620
Just choose something you like to do.

920
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:47,890
I'm asking because I'm not sure. Can't you just tell me?

921
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,190
Sorry.

922
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,230
  What am I even doing right now?

923
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:57,300
  But is she going to sign the contract or not?

924
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,230
Kids, hold up.

925
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,730
Okay, I won't buy it, then.

926
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,000
You're too much!

927
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,600
Why are you crying?

928
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,590
Truthfully, it's because I'm worried about you.

929
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,520
What if you get into an accident?

930
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,540
You know I can't live without you.

931
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,890
What? It was like that?

932
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,780
You should have said that then! Honey!

933
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,820
Mi Jeong!

934
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,740
Whoa. That surprised me.

935
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,790
Did something happen to Mom and Dad?

936
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,890
KDNK, KDNK. Everyone GRNS.

937
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,690
What's KDNK and GRNS?

938
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,800
'KDNK', Kids don't need to know.

939
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,200
'GRNS', Go to your room and sleep.

940
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,420
Go to your room and sleep! Go to your room and sleep!

941
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,990
Go to your room and sleep.

942
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,000
Quiet.

943
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,660
Go to your room and sleep.

944
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,200
My admission counseling!

945
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,160
Go to your room and sleep. Please go to your room and sleep.

946
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,500
That was hectic.

947
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,030
I see why they have so many kids.

948
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,400
What a surprise!

949
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,000
How was it?

950
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,540
Did you enjoy...

951
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,170
your food?

952
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,930
Yes. It was really good.

953
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:47,090
 No wonder they're married. They even talk the same way.

954
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,540
 I'm so sleepy.

955
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,280
How did you two meet?

956
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:59,710
I went... to her concert...

957
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:04,520
and fell in love...

958
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,460
with her...

959
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,950
singing.

960
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,020
Which song did she sing?

961
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:22,290
Should I...

962
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,590
sing it for you?

963
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,580
Now?

964
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,850
 What? Isn't this a lullaby?

965
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,790
 Why did it have to be this song?

966
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,900
 I'm sleepy.

967
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,570
 I'm so sleepy.

968
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,130
 This is driving me crazy.

969
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,260
 What do I do?

970
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,430
Today, we looked into the life of the world-renowned conductor, Park Chul Hong.

971
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,790
We hope they live happily as they are now.

972
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,000
This was Han Soo Yeon of "Report Special Force."

973
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,830
Cut! Okay.

974
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,780
We will wrap up filming here.

975
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,930
- Good job. 
- Good job.

976
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,070
Good job.

977
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,400
How does it feel to have finished your first shoot?

978
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,520
I'm sorry for making so many mistakes.

979
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,940
I feel really good that the first shoot is done, though.

980
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,630
- Do you?
 - Yes.

981
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,650
I feel like I could really fly.

982
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,570
Want to see?

983
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,080
What's happening?

984
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,130
Am I really flying?

985
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,550
No way.

986
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,980
Of course, it would be better if we do big projects,

987
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,790
like Marvel Cinematic Universe to take action against Hollywood.

988
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,710
But considering the film market in Korea,

989
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:11,160
the profits won't be as— Wait.

990
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,780
Why am I telling this to you?

991
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,330
Why? It's such a constructive and useful opinion.

992
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,980
Enough, enough!

993
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,060
I'm tired, I'm going to sleep now.

994
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,640
 What should I do? I can't just let him go like that.

995
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,920
Joon Ki, hold on.

996
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,100
What is it now?

997
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,500
Can you get me the doll up there?

998
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,150
I can't sleep without it.

999
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,900
That doesn't even suit you.

1000
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,960
Fine.

1001
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,560
Oh gosh!

1002
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,880
What, why are you touching my butt?

1003
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,450
What? The thing is...

1004
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,460
I know my butt looks good, but still.

1005
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,230
What's that in your hand?

1006
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,880
What?

1007
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,030
What are you doing?

1008
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,760
Why would you eat that?

1009
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,460
Give it to me.

1010
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,110
Give it to me.

1011
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,530
What is this?

1012
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,250
No, no, don't do it.

1013
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,550
Leave me alone! What is this?

1014
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:32,850
Jeong Eun, how could you...

1015
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:36,740
Listen. The thing is...

1016
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,160
"Lee Joon Ki, crazy fool"?

1017
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,090
What, what are you saying?

1018
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,190
Is swearing out loud not enough for you?

1019
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:50,580
Did you have to write it down on paper and stick it on my butt?!

1020
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,920
What do you mean, swear?

1021
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,290
Whatever!

1022
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,550
What is he talking about?

1023
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,020
What is this?
  Lee Joon Ki, crazy fool

1024
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,390
What? Jeong Eun cursed at you?

1025
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,730
That's what I'm saying.

1026
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:14,420
She wrote on paper, "Lee Joon Ki, crazy fool" and so on and stuck it to my butt!

1027
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,450
Exactly, you should stop bothering her.

1028
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,620
How angry would she have to be to do that?

1029
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,320
You think so?

1030
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,990
Look how late it is. Why aren't the others coming?

1031
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,480
You fell asleep during the interview?

1032
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,330
Yeah.

1033
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:57,350
But the director and the staff fell asleep too,

1034
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,640
so I was only scolded a little bit.

1035
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,220
That's a relief.

1036
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,820
Anyway, thanks for coming to get me.

1037
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,290
It's fine.

1038
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:08,590
I already told you. I was right around the corner.

1039
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,840
I'm still thankful.

1040
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,970
I was wondering how I could get home this late because filming ended so late.

1041
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,150
You saved me.

1042
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,830
I'll buy something yummy at the rest stop for you.

1043
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,610
What do you want to eat?

1044
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,420
Woo Sik?

1045
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,400
He fell asleep.

1046
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,780
Woo Sik, you have a call.

1047
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,190
Woo Sik?

1048
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,900
Hello.

1049
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,070
Yes, this is Woo Sik's phone.

1050
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,190
But he can't come to the phone right now.  What is the matter?

1051
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:02,190
 Woo Sik left his clothes at the event hall.

1052
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:07,260
 Please tell him I left it at the information desk at the first-floor lobby of Gangnam Wedding Hall.

1053
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,070
Yes.

1054
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:12,780
Wait. What do you mean, Gangnam Wedding Hall?

1055
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,020
Was the event held at Gangnam?

1056
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,430
 Yes, but why do you ask?

1057
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:24,330
It's nothing, I'll tell him.

1058
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,120
Yes.

 - I was chosen to play in "Challenge! Quiz King." 
- What?

1076
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,980
 The prize is ₩40 million (~$40K)?

1077
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,140
 - Why did it have to be this fool? 
- Pass!

 Gook Gi Bong, who passed all the questions,

 Don't forget to take this, Joon Ki.

1081
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,120
 How long has it been since I got a present?

1082

 What if I become a star?

 Don't you know kids all over the country watch our show?

 Shouldn't we throw a welcome party for Soo Yeon?

1088
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,720
 The main writer called me, so I should get going.

1089
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,660
 Soo Yeon, you're quite drunk.

1090
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,240
 Your pronunciation is bad.

1091
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,320
 You can't even spell,

1092
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,350
 and don't have good drinking manners.

1093

 Is there anything you can do?
