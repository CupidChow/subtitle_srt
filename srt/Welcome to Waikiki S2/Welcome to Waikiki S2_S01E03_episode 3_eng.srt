1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,520

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,810
Got rid of all the dirt. It's so clean!

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,970
Wow, no more seizure stickers

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,210
and no more hole in the ceiling. Wow, this place is worth living in!

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,670
Yeah. I thought we'd really be kicked out this time.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,860
It's all thanks to Soo Yeon.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,730
But, doesn't it feel weird living in the same house as your first love?

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,200
I couldn't even fall asleep!

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,440
Woo Sik, you get excited too, right?

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,920
Excited? No, I'm totally fine.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,410
What?

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,360
Stop lying.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,910
When Soo Yeon's mother-in-law was being rude to her, who was the one who ran out of Rebecca?

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,500
And, you were the one who suggested that we find her belongings! You!

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,220
Really? Woo Sik?

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,190
Yeah! Why, did you feel sorry for her?

17
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,110
Or because she's your first love, did past emotions just come right back to you?

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,290
- No, it's not like that. Stop saying nonsense. 
 - Guys.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,960
How do I look? I look like a successful career woman, right?

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
Oh, yeah, a bit. Why'd you dress up?

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
I'm going to get a job.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,970
I'm going to get my house back, pay back my dad's debt, and get my dad back.

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,100
Oh, that's cool of you. I thought you'd be crying and sobbing for a while.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,910
Right, Woo Sik?

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah, your intentions are great,

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,640
but getting employed isn't easy these days.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,670
Hey. Do you want to bet?

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,770
Whether or not I get employed within a week, Ten flicks on the forehead!

29
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,890
Alright. Sounds good!

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,510
Ow! Ow!

31
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,520
You really weren't kidding when you said you'd hit me!

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,050
A bet is a bet. See? I told you getting employed isn't easy.

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,280
Soo Yeon, don't worry too much. You can just get a part-time job.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
She got cut from all the part-time jobs too. What in the world did you do?

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
It was just my first time working a part-time job. What was I to do? It's hard and boring.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,020
That's why you shouldn't carelessly be finding jobs like that. You should look for jobs that suit you.

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,150
Is there anything you wanted to do? Any dreams?

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,730
I wanted to be an announcer once.  They look elegant and intelligent when they deliver the news.

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,530
Oh, should I become an announcer, then?

40
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,230
You can't even get a part-time job. How will you be an announcer?

41
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,080
Is there anything you're good at?

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,050
Good at?

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,370
I'm a bit good at dancing. I've been chosen at clubs before.

44
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,420
Never mind. Jeong Eun, is there any place you could get her a job at?

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,460
There's one thing that could suit her.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,920
Really? What is it?

47
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,030
You're telling me to do this?

48
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,320
Why? You wanted to deliver news like an announcer and also dance.

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,240
- So a narrating bear is the best. 
 - But still, this is a bit...

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,830
Guess you're not that desperate. You don't have to if you don't want to.

51
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,000
No, no! I'll do it. I will.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,710
Well, I'll be off. Work hard!

53
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,380
Take this.

54
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,590
Should we start?

55
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,470
Hello! These are new products from Bear Skin!

56
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,780
It'll solve all of your moisturizing, skin-lightening, and wrinkle problems in one go!

57
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,300
I'm supposed to do that?

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,880
Gosh, how embarrassing!

59
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,500
  Mysterious Animal Dictionary

60
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,030
Reserved guests...

61
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,750
There's not a single guest. It's been months like this.

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,330
Yeah.

63
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,830
How come we have no guests?

64
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,040
What's the reason?

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,690
Maybe it's because we don't promote. Other places host events and stuff.

66
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,830
Events? Oh, we can do those, then!

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,750
How does that sound? We could do a signing event for a famous actor.

68
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,630
A famous actor? Who?

69
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,660
Who else? Me!

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,740
I've risen to #1 on trending realtime search rankings before.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,060
And, my autograph is really cool. Want to see?

72
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:19,960
Lee... Joon...

73
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,760
Ki...

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,530
Give up! At that pace, do you think you could even do five people a day?

75
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,630
What kind of crazy person would come here for your autograph?

76
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,980
Whatever, then.

77
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,390
But for promotion, it'd be best to go on a TV show.

78
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,790
I'm here.

79
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,030
Oh, hey. Did you get Soo Yeon a part-time job?

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,350
I did, but, I don't know if she'll be good at it.

81
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,030
Gosh, I'm just worried what kind of trouble she's going to cause.

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,320
Oh, you're worried?

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,800
Why, are you so worried about your first love that you're going crazy?

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,230
I wonder why. Why is our Woo Sik so worried?

85
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,460
It's not like that, you crazy man! It's not!

86
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,900
You crazy man! It's not like that!

87
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,250
Anyway, that Lee Joon Ki has some serious talent at making people pissed off.

88
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,890
Why would I be worried about Soo Yeon?

89
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,870
And, what, first love? It's been more than ten years.

90
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,560
- Shower... 
 - Oh, my! 
 - You scared me!

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,190
What are you doing?

92
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,750
Sorry! I didn't know you were here!

93
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,420
Get out! Hurry up!

94
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,550
Why are you getting mad? Well, who cares? We're both men!

95
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,120
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed? Do you want me to scrub your back?

96
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,590
It's a miraculous cream.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,560
Please take it.

98
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,790
It's a miraculous cream.

99
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,330
- Hey, what's with your voice? Do it properly! 
 - Sorry.

100
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,050
Why, is it because you're embarrassed? Just quit, then!

101
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,090
No, no. I'll do well.

102
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,240
This is your last warning.

103
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,740
Yes.

104
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,860
I'm going crazy. Should I quit?

105
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,110
No, I can't. Cha Woo Sik will look down on me.

106
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,430
Gosh, but this is so embarrassing that I can't do it anymore! What do I do?

107
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,800
  A brown bear that has been taken care of  in a Korean zoo

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,830
   escaped its pen early this morning.

109
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,550
Oh, what the heck?

110
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,870
A bear?

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,100
Hello!

112
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,120
 One Brown Bear Escapes From Korean Zoo

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,890
Where is the beer?

114
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,790
Oh, ow! I can't.

115
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,530
Hey! You were being too mean!

116
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,090
That's why I told you to leave.

117
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,270
But, why would you throw soap at my head? What if it hit my eyes?

118
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,590
Hey! Are you really my friend?

119
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,020
Are you two fighting again? What's the matter?

120
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,210
He caused such a big deal because I went into the bathroom while he took a shower.

121
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,200
Gosh, he was making such a fuss.

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,850
While he was at school, he used to change into his gym clothes all by himself in the bathroom, too.

123
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,620
- Why, though? 
 - How do I know?

124
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,090
It's not as if looking at it will cause it to disappear.

125
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,220
Hey, what's with you?

126
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,720
Are you just not confident?

127
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,960
Cut the nonsense. Why would I not be confident?

128
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,820
The gynecologist, Doctor Choi Dal Bong,

129
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,700
after I was born, he saw my body. He was so shocked and full of shame.

130
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,520
He ended up quitting his job.

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,950
Stop fooling around! Hey, hey, let me see then, let me see!

132
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,090
- Let me see! 
 - What do you mean? No! Don't believe me then.

133
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,620
Hey, what are you saying?! Mine is— You know what, never mind.

134
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,250
Hey, Jeong Eun. I told you to think of ways to increase sales, but why are you watching TV?

135
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,170
I was thinking of ways, but I'm taking a break.

136
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,240
- Look at that! It's so cool. 
 - What?

137
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,490
  If I don't do this, it's so cold that I can't survive.

138
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,020
That woman gets so cold easily

139
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,780
that even though her heater is at 40ºC, she's so cold that she lives all wrapped up like that.

140
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,490
Even during the summer, it's so cold for her that she can't leave the house.

141
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,500
Wh-What? She gets so cold easily?

142
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,290
She goes on air for that?

143
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,330
Don't you know that TV show? It's one where strange and peculiar people are on.

144
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,900
Is that so?

145
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,790
Hey, let's go on that program! We can promote the place then!

146
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,370
Well, what's so strange about us for us to go on there?

147
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,450
We'll have to think about that now.

148
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,090
Hey! I can cry within ten seconds. Want to see?

149
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:38,040
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five.

150
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,030
You see it? Yeah, right?

151
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,430
I'm crying right now! Do you see it?

152
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,450
It's cool, but what about snot?

153
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,230
Snot? I can't make snot come out.

154
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,530
If I cry, the snot is just automatic.

155
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,710
Oh, I can make snot come out by itself. I can aim it and shoot!

156
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,900
That's so gross. How could that go on air?

157
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,330
Oh, don't you guys have anything?

158
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,410
Oh, I can do something.

159
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,440
Alright, look. Let me start.

160
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,690
  Flower by Kim Choon Soo

161
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,870
 Before I call your name 
  You don't pass by beause of a single movement

162
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,400
Wow, it's working! Wow! Yes! We're saved!

163
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,050
- Wow! Wow!
 - Isn't it cool?

164
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,660
I guess I'd say that typing with my feet is more comfy than my hands.

165
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,360
What's wrong?!

166
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,870
It's cramping. Ow! It hurts! Do something!

167
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,090
What? Hey, wait.

168
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,130
I can do it, but only for ten seconds.

169
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,400
Ten seconds?

170
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,350
Hey, this won't work. Ten seconds is nothing.

171
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,710
Well... I have something, too.

172
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,630
Wait, what did I just see?

173
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,800
How was that? Cool, right?

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,650
That's just boring, don't you think?

175
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,220
I'm sure I've seen people who are better than you on television.

176
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,330
Even though a lot of people can do this, no one can do it as beautifully as I can.

177
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,230
I'm just different. The sound I make sounds sorrowful.

178
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,310
Sorrowful, my foot!

179
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,910
No, not like this. Don't you have any other talents?

180
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,230
I'm here.

181
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,390
Oh, hey.

182
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,490
Oh, how cold!

183
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,150
It's so cold out! What's with your clothes?

184
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,580
Oh, wait. Your coffee even has ice.

185
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,920
I just get hot easily. I'm a hot man.

186
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,980
Yeah, please stay hot forever.

187
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,700
Gosh, I can't stand this anymore.

188
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,710
Wait.

189
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:50,000
Wait. The woman earlier said she got cold easily, right?

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,360
Yeah, why?

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,480
Hey, Gi Bong. Since you're a hot man, I guess you don't feel cold.

192
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,790
Well, yeah.

193
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,840
Is that so?

194
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,270
  Come In 
 Open

195
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,270
Is anyone here?

196
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,590
Yes, who is it?

197
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,890
Hello. I'm the producer, Lee Si Eon, of "How In The World Is That Possible?"

198
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,300
Oh, hello! Nice to meet you!

199
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,570
I'm Lee Joon Ki, who made the report.

200
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,170
Oh, I see. But, I heard that there's a man who doesn't ever get cold. Is that true?

201
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,660
Yes, it's my friend. He doesn't get cold. At all!

202
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,820
Never!

203
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh, I see. But, where is he now?

204
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,110
He's on the rooftop right now.

205
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,510
- The rooftop? 
 - Let's go.

206
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,960
Come in, come in.

207
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,580
Let's go.

208
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,220
Can we do this?

209
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,460
It doesn't feel good.

210
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,700
He's right there.

211
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,620
It's so cold but he's like that? With all those fans?

212
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,990
Yes, we tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen!

213
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,230
That bad bastard.

214
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,570
Gi Bong!

215
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,680
Yes? Why?

216
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,550
- Let's go. 
  - Gi Bong.

217
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,640
Gi Bong!

218
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,150
This is the producer from the broadcasting station.

219
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,360
I heard that you never feel cold. Is that true?

220
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,690
What?

221
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,660
Yes!

222
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,190
You seem cold, though. Your lips are quivering a bit, too.

223
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,470
No, no, no. He just has a magnesium deficiency.

224
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,590
Oh, I see.

225
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,990
You seem to have goosebumps.

226
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,730
No, no! He just has those goosebumps normally.

227
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,910
It's always been there. It's been an insecurity of his from when he was young.

228
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,290
Yes, insecurity.

229
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,070
No, I don't think so.

230
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,730
You seem a bit cold.

231
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,880
No, why do you keep saying that? Are you doubting us right now?

232
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,590
No, no! I'm so sorry.

233
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,030
These days, we just have so many false reports.

234
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,130
Gi Bong, the producer seems to be doubtful. Just show him.

235
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,380
Huh? Show him what?

236
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,950
What do you mean what? You're only wearing that shirt because your skin might burn! You normally don't wear shirts!

237
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,570
He doesn't believe you! So, just show him!

238
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,820
So that it's refreshing!

239
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,490
Alright. In case my skin burns since UV rays are strong.

240
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,230
Oh, will you be okay? It's so cold right now.

241
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,330
He's fine, he's fine! Sometimes, he walks around completely naked!

242
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,120
Oh, this is great!

243
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,440
Yeah!

244
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,550
Wow, this is great. Can you hold your coffee?

245
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,270
It's the new cream! Please take a sample!

246
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,260
Please take your samples!

247
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,020
Please come closer!

248
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,410
This is not something that happens every day!

249
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,970
Hey, you must really have adjusted to the job!

250
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,810
Oh, this is nothing.

251
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,590
I'm going to use the bathroom and wash off my sweat.

252
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,750
- Oh, okay. Go quickly! 
 - Alright!

253
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,370
  Up next. Regarding the brown bear that escaped from the Korean zoo today,

254
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,220
  it has been spotted near Namsan. The police and emergency officials have been dispatched

255
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,660
  as more than 100 officers are on the search for the bear.

256
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,090
Gosh, Namsan is so close from here.

257
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,180
That's such a big problem!

258
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,030
What is this? Why is it flickering? Gosh.

259
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,980
I'm dizzy enough!

260
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,270
It's so hot!

261
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,350
Gosh, let's get washed quickly.

262
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,730
What's that?

263
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,390
Is that the bear?

264
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,950
Gosh, I'm so cold.

265
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,420
- So, he's been like this all winter? 
 - Yes!

266
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,780
He kept saying he didn't need the tent,

267
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,860
but we barely brought this up here and convinced him to use it.

268
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,210
So, how does he eat?

269
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,810
Him? Well, he's so hot that he doesn't even eat rice.

270
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,560
All he does is eat ice cream for all his meals.

271
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,720
Just, ice cream?

272
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,460
Right, Gi Bong?

273
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,450
Yeah! Yeah!

274
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,900
Oh, I prepared it for you just in case you didn't believe it.

275
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,650
Alright, Gi Bong. Let's eat!

276
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,240
Thanks.

277
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,730
Hold on.

278
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,720
Oh, film this ice box.

279
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,160
Here, take it.

280
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
- Your spoon. 
 - Alright.

281
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,010
Wow, yes.

282
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,200
Looks delicious.

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,890
A whole bite.

284
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,490
Aw, your teeth will freeze!

285
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,770
Wow, this is so amazing.

286
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,680
Whenever he's in the mood, he likes it if you throw stuff like this at him.

287
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,910
Tsk, tsk.

288
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,860
Alright, I'm done.

289
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,650
Now, I have to go back.

290
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,440
Gosh, I don't feel so good.

291
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,270
Maybe I drank too much beer.

292
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,180
Over there! There!

293
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,050
- Are you the one who reported it? 
 - Yes, I did.

294
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,600
But, where is the bear?

295
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,590
It's there. In the bathroom.

296
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,830
The bathroom? Are you sure you saw it correctly?

297
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,760
No, I saw the bear with my own two eyes!

298
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,760
It was in there and digging around. It made a mess.

299
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,560
Really?

300
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,490
Men / Women

301
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,900
See? You heard the bear.

302
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,760
What is this? Is this true?

303
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,700
This is a problem. From what I hear,

304
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,710
the bear is very angry right now.

305
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,630
We need to handle this before it gets worse.

306
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,260
Let's go.

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,520
I feel way better now.

308
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,020
It's real! The bear's real!

309
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,220
But, bears can stand like that?

310
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,830
Of course. You have no idea how advanced the brown bear is.

311
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,370
So, this is the perfect chance. You should shoot the sedative.

312
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,110
Hurry up.

313
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,330
Oh, shoot.

314
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,520
He'll be eaten alive now.

315
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,790
I wonder if Soo Yeon's doing well. What if she was fired again?

316
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,260
No, why does it matter to me if she was or not?

317
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,450
Well, then.

318
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,890
Woo Sik, come look!

319
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,140
What is it?

320
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,760
How's this? It's cool, right? You've never seen someone eat ramen with their foot, right?

321
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,490
Isn't this more fascinating than what Gi Bong is doing? Don't you think?

322
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,120
Yeah, it's fascinating, in your head.

323
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,820
It just feels so unfair. How could Gi Bong beat this?

324
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,490
This is way better! Ow!

325
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,060
Cramps! My foot cramps!

326
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,810
Help me!

327
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,060
Why would you be greedy over that?

328
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,390
There's no one normal in this house!

329
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,230
- Put more force into it. 
 - Like this?

330
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,570
 In the largest amusement park in Seoul, a brown bear...

331
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,830
What? A brown bear?

332
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,890
A brown bear escaped from the zoo today. Everyone's been freaking out all day.

333
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,920
- Didn't you know? 
 - Oh, is that so?

334
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,530
  A woman was thought to be the bear and was shot with tranquilizers.

335
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,620
  Here's some footage from a citizen.

336
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,440
  Come to your senses, Miss!

337
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,950
She's completely knocked out.

338
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,620
What the heck? Isn't that Soo Yeon?

339
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,300
Hey, Soo Yeon! Are you okay?

340
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,670
Huh? Soo Yeon? Wake up!

341
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,370
Shut up! People are staring. I'm already embarrassed enough.

342
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,270
Are you okay? Really?

343
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,440
I am!

344
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,640
What happened? Why do you always cause trouble?

345
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,420
I'm sorry. But, why are you all annoyed? Since when have you cared about me?

346
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,340
Care? I don't!

347
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,550
I was worried I'd have to pay for you after you caused trouble.

348
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,150
Hey! Is that something you should be saying to an injured person?

349
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,660
Injured? You look normal.

350
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,670
Hurry and get up. Let's go home.

351
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,980
Hey, let's go together. Hey!

352
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,380
You want me to go in here?

353
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,300
If we don't do this nowadays, the viewers won't believe us. Right?

354
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,830
Oh, of course. Broadcasting isn't a joke. We must do this!

355
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,640
You can do this, right, Gi Bong? Right?

356
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,420
  I can't! I really can't do this!

357
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,800
  No! You can do it! You're a hot man!

358
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,900
Oh, and, it might look a bit boring if you just jump in there.

359
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,040
So, we're going to add a bit of ice. Just a bit.

360
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,720
Here? Ice?

361
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,820
Oh, ice is great. If you weren't going to, I was going to buy it myself!

362
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,860
You can do it, right, Gi Bong?

363
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,400
  No, I can't! Even if our situation is bad, going into ice water in this weather isn't a good idea!

364
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,080
  No, you can do it. So,

365
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,970
  just close your eyes and go in once. Yeah?

366
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,250
Alright, you can go in.

367
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,570
Oh, shoot.

368
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,920
  It's so cold! So cold! My toe's already frozen! I can't!

369
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,570
  That's just how you feel.

370
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,810
  You're almost there. Go in! Hurry!

371
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,930
Oh, are you cold right now?

372
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,710
I thought I heard a little moan.

373
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,700
He just loves it.

374
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,120
"I love it! I love it! Yeah! Yeah!"

375
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,640
- Oh, oh, I see. 
 - I love it! Love it! Woohoo!

376
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,750
Woohoo!

377
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,410
Alright, since you saw that he loves it, we're done, right?

378
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,980
No, hold on. Just one more thing. Could you go underwater?

379
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,840
You bastard!

380
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,890
How'd you know he loves to do that? Hold on.

381
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,130
Gi Bong! Show him! You've got a diving license, remember?

382
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,190
You can do it!

383
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,130
  No, I can't! I can't go underwater!

384
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,900
  Just do it once!

385
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,650
  They said we can go on air if you pass this.

386
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,030
  - Go in! 
 - I feel like I'm going to die right now.

387
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,890
  It's just how you feel! You're a hot man!

388
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,780
 You horrible bastard.

389
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,880
Wow, this is amazing!

390
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,580
He truly doesn't feel the cold! Let's set a date for this to go on air.

391
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,290
Alright, so, he's done, right?

392
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,540
Oh, yes, of course. You can tell him to get out now.

393
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,040
Oh, is that so? Gi Bong! He's done! Come out!

394
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,140
- So, when will this air? 
 - In around two weeks or so.

395
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,450
What are you doing, Gi Bong? Come out!

396
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,820
- Prepare it. 
 - Gi Bong!

397
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,900
Gi Bong! Gi Bong! Gi Bong!

398
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,520
Gi Bong!

399
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,490
Hey, let's go together.

400
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,640
- Let's go together! 
 - Come quickly.

401
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,770
Go slower!

402
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,050
How embarrassing. You should've brought clothes I could change into if you were going to come.

403
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,320
Gosh, you were even on the news. Embarrassed doesn't cover it.

404
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,820
What? I was on the news? What do you mean?

405
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,550
Oh, you still don't know.

406
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,100
Hey, look, look.

407
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,990
You're on the news, but you're also #1 on real-time search rankings.

408
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,110
The Tranquilizer Brown Bear Girl. It's you! Look.

409
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,980
What is this?! Gosh, I'm going to go crazy.

410
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,680
I shouldn't have taken that job. I'll never do it again!

411
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,090
What do you mean? Are you going to quit already?

412
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,240
Well, it's so hard and embarrassing that I can't take it anymore!

413
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,760
Hey, Han Soo Yeon, don't act like that anymore.

414
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,930
- What? 
 - You don't like it because it's hard, boring, and embarrassing.

415
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,790
What are you going to do, then?

416
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,010
You think you can help your dad like that?

417
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,100
Soo Yeon, you can't do whatever you want for the rest of your life.

418
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,110
You need to be patient and do what you don't want to do. Everyone does that.

419
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,210
Joon Ki, Gi Bong, Jeong Eun, and I all live like that.

420
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,330
And you need to live like that now too.

421
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,410
You need to find your way out by yourself. Did you know?

422
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,140
Alright, then. I can just do it!

423
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,250
Are you not hungry? There's a good sweet pancake place nearby.

424
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,010
Sweet pancake? I want to eat steak, though.

425
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,830
Never mind. Forget it.

426
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,710
No! No! I'll eat it.

427
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,340
Sweet pancakes. Buy me two!

428
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,690
- Two! 
 - Alright! Get off.

429
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,010
- Gi Bong, are you okay? 
 - What happened?

430
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,210
What's with Gi Bong?

431
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,820
- Ah, well... 
 - So why was he swimming in such cold weather?

432
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:12,280
- Well, Gi Bong is a hot man who never gets cold– 
 - Be quiet!

433
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,010
How could such a person exist?

434
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,830
- He could've died from hypothermia! 
 - I'm very sorry.

435
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,780
Let's go.

436
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,930
Joon Ki! I'm cold! I'm so cold!

437
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,740
I'll go later.

438
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,610
Gi Bong!

439
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,070
It was suspicious from the start.

440
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,930
Did you really want to go on air that much?

441
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,310
- I'm sorry. 
 - I knew this would happen.

442
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,390
I told you not to do it!

443
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,060
So humiliating.

444
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,770
What a waste of time. Let's go.

445
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,870
Hold on!

446
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,810
Producer, how's this? It's so cool, right?

447
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,050
If this goes on air, it'll take over Korea! Ow!

448
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,650
Oh, I got cramps! Ow!

449
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,650
Don't mind her. I'm sorry.

450
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,130
- My cramps!
 - Excuse me, but, where is the bathroom?

451
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,050
- The bathroom's in the back. 
 - Alright.

452
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,540
Thank you.

453
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,420
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought it was the bathroom.

454
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,870
- Wait. 
 - What are you doing? Please leave!

455
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,820
Wait! This...

456
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,780
What's wrong here?

457
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,400
Wh-What? Hurry and leave!

458
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,860
Why is this here? It's not supposed to be there, right?

459
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,680
Hold on! Hold on, Cha Woo Sik.

460
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,700
Can't you just appear on our show just once? This is a great topic!

461
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,860
I don't want to! Why are you being like this?

462
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,560
Woo Sik, is your thing really attached here?

463
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,050
It's really there. Really.

464
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,690
Oh, so that's why you made such a fuss when you were taking a shower.

465
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,430
Oh, does that make sense? Hey! Are you a goat or something?

466
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,170
Oh, we got the title! Huam-dong Goat Man!

467
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,930
This will be such a big deal! We have to do it!

468
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,560
No, I don't want to. I'll never do it!

469
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,920
Just appear on the show once! Are you not going to save our place?

470
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,660
Hey, this is my insecurity! I can't do it! Never! I don't want to!

471
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,170
Hey, Cha Woo Sik. You're so funny. You're so hypocritical.

472
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,360
- What are you saying?! 
 - You said you can't live only doing what you want.

473
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,230
You said that people have to be patient and do things you don't want to. You just said that!

474
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,010
Oh, geez.

475
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,850
Why are you being hypocritical?

476
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,760
  Waikiki Guest House

477
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,190
- Alright, it's here! 
    - In a guesthouse somewhere in Seoul, there is a man known as the "Huam-dong Goat Man."

478
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,130
That's our place! There!

479
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,860
  - We went to see for ourselves. 
 - Hello, this is the Waikiki Guest House.

480
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,200
 -  Hello! 
 - Oh, hello.

481
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,390
It's me! It's me! Me! Me!

482
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,490
You look handsome!

483
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,140
  - Please come in. 
 - Oh, yes.

484
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,840
  - There he is! 
 - Oh, him?

485
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,090
  Hello, are you the Huam-dong Goat Man?

486
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,870
  Oh, yes, hello.

487
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,050
  The Huam-dong Goat Man! Cha Woo Sik, 30!

488
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,900
  Is it really in a different place compared to others?

489
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,100
Yes!

490
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,830
  Yes, compared to others, it's located much lower.

491
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,720
  Oh, I see. Can we check?

492
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,200
- Yes! 
 -    It's embarrassing, but...

493
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,480
Hey, look at it!

494
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,070
  We went to the hospital to see if there were any problems associated with it

495
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,130
  along with the worried production staff.

496
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,590
  They took Woo Sik to the hospital, where he underwent several tests.

497
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,480
Oh, thank you!

498
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,340
  Is there a problem with Woo Sik's health?

499
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,920
  Within my 30 years of practice,

500
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,030
  it's my first time seeing something so low like this.

501
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,190
Oh, me too! It was my first time!

502
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,650
  It's pretty much in the same area as your belly button.

503
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,270
  It's even a unique case globally.

504
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,480
  But, the  scan showed that there are no problems to his health.

505
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,550
 Is there no way to bring it up?

506
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:35,060
  Well, there is a way to correct it.

507
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,590
  Woo Sik, are you going to get the corrective surgery?

508
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,560
  No.

509
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,110
  I like myself the way I am.

510
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,670
  I don't plan on getting surgery.

511
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,570
  Woo Sik refused the corrective surgery.

512
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,390
  He loves himself despite his insecurities.

513
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,460
  We hope you never change!

514
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,630
  Huam-dong Goat Man, fighting!

515
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,760
  Fighting!

516
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,570
Fighting! Wow!

517
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,410
Wow, wow, your chest...

518
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:14,070
Hey, thanks to you, our guest house succeeded for real!

519
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,800
Alright, alright. Just take a seat.

520
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,730
Now that we're like this, shouldn't we change up our guesthouse name?

521
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,440
How so?

522
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,160
How about it? Guesthouse Goat Baa.

523
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,110
Die! Hey!

524
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,990
Hey, Woo Sik!

525
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,800
You can't do this! Hey!

526
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,590
Where's the goat man?

527
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,360
Hello!

528
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,590
Hello!

529
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,190
Wow, we finally have guests after so long!

530
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,650
This is the power of television.

531
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,250
Wow, Huam-dong Goat Man is still #1 on real-time search rankings.

532
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,210
And, Tranquilizer Brown Bear Girl on trending at #2.

533
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,200
Wow, we're trending now.

534
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,380
Who knew that we'd be trending first and second?

535
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,460
Wow, things are finally working out for us.

536
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,500
Oh, we have a guest.

537
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,120
Hello!

538
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,790
- Reservation? 
 - Yes.

539
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,230
- Name? 
 - It's under Philip.

540
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,900
- Philip? 
 - Yes.

541
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,450
Hello.

542
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,400
Sorry, but where did they go?

543
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,290
Oh, wait a minute. Hey!

544
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,660
They came to see you! Hurry up!

545
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,630
Oh, Philip, go ahead.

546
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,300
Baa!

547
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,690
♫  Oh what in the world is happening to me  ♫

548
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,390
- Hi.
 - Hi.

549
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,220
Hi.

550
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,820
Hey.

551
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,800
Wow, you two are so reliable.

552
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,670
With you guys standing there, it looks like a general on your right and commander...

553
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,290
No, no, it's bear on your right and goat on your left.

554
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:48,940
Shut up.

555
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,460
Just hurry and take the picture.

556
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,260
Alright, alright.

557
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,960
But, you two look good together like this. Like a married couple.

558
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,650
- Are you crazy? 
 - I said shut up!

559
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,350
Alright!

560
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,550
Okay, we're going to take the picture.

561
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,010
Say kimchi! I mean...

562
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,130
- Say goat! 
 - Smile! Baa!

563
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,190
Goat.

564
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,130
  With Huam-dong Goat Man, Tranquilizer Brown Bear Girl

565
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,390
At our store, we never fail to give good prices and good service!

566
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:28,330
All 365 days, we're always working for our customers.

567
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,010
Come and get your many benefits today!

568
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,000
Please come get some!

569
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,010
Jeong Eun, it's so cold. Can't we rest a bit?

570
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,950
Should we? Let's go.

571
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,690
- It's so warm. 
 - It's great.

572
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,470
What are you two doing right now?

573
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,570
Oh, we were so cold that we were taking a short break.

574
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,790
Who let you guys do that? Am I paying you to take a break?

575
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,050
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

576
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,930
- What are you doing? Go work. 
 - Alright.

577
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,680
Don't fool around again.

578
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,330
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,920
He's so mean. We didn't even rest for a minute!

580
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,480
Let's go work before he gets mad again.

581
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,270
Alright.

582
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,330
The best prices in the country!

583
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,820
We give you plenty of products, as well!

584
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,490
Welcome!

585
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,690
But, it feels less cold than earlier, right?

586
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,960
Really?

587
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,320
Wow, my butt feels a bit warm.

588
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,670
But, doesn't it smell like something's burning?

589
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,740
Soo Yeon! Your tail's on fire!

590
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,350
- What? 
 - Fire!

591
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,890
Oh, what is this!

592
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,170
Hurry up! Hurry up!

593
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,270
  The World That They Live In

594
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,610
Mr. Goat, please.

595
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:54,130
Let's go! One, two!

596
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,510
Woohoo!

597
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,630
Thank you! Fighting, Mr. Goat!

598
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,820
Thank you.

599
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,830
Oh, Woo Sik, you're working so hard.

600
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,500
For how long do I have to keep this up?

601
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,320
We'll do it until your nipples come back to their normal spot!

602
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,180
Wow, this is crazy. Shouldn't we have a party? Pork belly party.

603
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,970
Look at you talking.

604
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,060
Do you know how much we still have to earn?

605
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,160
We'll just eat pork skin, then. It's cheap! It's tasty and good for your skin!

606
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,090
Pig skin has so much cholera, too.

607
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,130
Ch-Cholera?

608
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,650
Yeah. Don't you know Cholera? It's in makeup, too.

609
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,020
Joon Ki, you knew that pig skin has cholera, right?

610
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,370
It's collagen! Cholera is a disease!

611
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,830
No! I heard about it from the man at the pigskin restaurant nearby!

612
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,260
It's cholera!

613
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,620
Alright, I hope you eat a lot of cholera and get great skin.

614
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,590
We're here.

615
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,180
Oh, did you work hard?

616
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,670
It's cold out, right?

617
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,550
Don't even mention it.

618
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:55,290
Since I was standing and wearing short clothes all day, my whole body is frozen.

619
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,180
I thought I'd die from the cold, too.

620
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,760
I thought you'd quit your job, but, look at you working so hard!

621
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,040
You told me not to quit.

622
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,960
But, it's really hard to make money.

623
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,150
Gosh, it got all on me. How dirty of you.

624
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,010
Cover your mouth!

625
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,340
I'm sorry. Gosh, I haven't felt well since earlier.

626
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,240
- I must have gotten a cold. 
 - A cold?!

627
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,530
Go there! Go over there! Shoo!

628
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,980
No, a gas mask. The gas mask!

629
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,300
My gas mask!

630
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,700
I'm going to eat more.

631
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,630
Why do you look so unpleasant?

632
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,970
Oh, I did Jeong Eun's designated driver job yesterday.

633
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,390
- Designated driver? 
 - Yeah.

634
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,030
Gosh, I drove to Chungcheong province yesterday!

635
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,470
Chungcheong province? Wow.

636
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,490
Wow, look at you taking good care of your college friend.

637
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,620
Friend? No, she's a tumor. No, it's just karma!

638
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,070
Why do you hit me?

639
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,120
What? Tumor? Karma?

640
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,310
You little...

641
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,520
Don't hit me! If you hit me one more time, I'm suing you!

642
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,290
I'm only holding myself back since I'm not feeling well.

643
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,890
You're still not feeling well? You don't look too good.

644
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,220
I'm fine, but I'm worried about Soo Yeon. She had a fever all night.

645
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,770
Really? Don't you have to go to the hospital, then?

646
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,900
There is no time for that.

647
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,330
We have to work an event today, too.

648
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,990
You're going to go work in that state?

649
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,940
I have to. If I back out now, I'm not going to get any other shifts.

650
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,660
I'll go instead of you. You should go to the hospital.

651
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,730
You're going to do the promotional event?

652
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,630
Promotional event? Of course, I can do it.

653
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,960
I'm good at dancing! And I'm good at talking. You know me.

654
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,430
Yeah, but...

655
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,550
I can do it.

656
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,040
- Well, what about Soo Yeon? 
 -  What?

657
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,060
I'll do it for her.

658
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,110
What?

659
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,520
You will, Woo Sik? But, why?

660
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,640
I'm afraid that your medical bills will increase if you faint from being sick.

661
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,560
- Wow, look at you putting everyone through so much. 
 - Hey, hey!

662
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,120
Leave it. I'll do it even if I might faint.

663
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,310
No, just go to to the hospital. Let's go, Joon Ki.

664
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,460
Go to the hospital, okay?

665
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Hey, let's go together! I'm going to go to practice.

666
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
- Alright, bye.
 - Bye.

667
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,220
Hey, let's go together!

668
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,260
Will they be okay?

669
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,580
I wonder.

670
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,660
Kiddo, why are you throwing a ball at the tree?

671
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,290
What does that have to do with you, ahjussi?

672
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,260
Hey. Trees are living beings, too.

673
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,970
If you do this, the tree gets hurt.

674
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,100
What are you saying? You're annoying.

675
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
What?!

676
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,260
You little. You have no manners!

677
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,960
Are you crying right now?

678
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,430
I just hit you a little! Hey.

679
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,200
Don't cry, huh?

680
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,220
- Dad... 
 - Dad?

681
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,800
I'm sorry. Stop crying! Yeah?

682
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,470
- Dad! 
 - Geez.

683
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,800
I'm going crazy.

684
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,230
Hey, don't cry! I'm sorry!

685
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,020
So, you two will work in place of Jeong Eun and Soo Yeon?

686
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,360
Yes. They have a severe cold right now.

687
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,220
They could've let us know earlier.

688
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,850
We're already done assigning the tasks.

689
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,050
Just order us to do whatever! We can do anything.

690
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,680
But, for you two to do it, it's a bit...

691
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,140
Don't worry about it. Even if we might not look it, we're very determined.

692
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,660
We're good at whatever it is!

693
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,160
- Yeah! 
 - Yeah!

694
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,460
Yeah!

695
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,750
But.. what kind of work is it?

696
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,960
  "Two Wings"

697
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,900
  Twin Angels. "Two Wings"

698
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,730
  Five times the absorption. Charcoal ingredients included.

699
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,730
  Sanitary Pads

700
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,980
Woo Sik, I don't think this is right.

701
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,060
Right? We can't even back out of it now.

702
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
What do we do?

703
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,840
We just have to do it.

704
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,200
You know, men advertise for women's products these days.

705
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,390
Men can sell feminine hygiene products too, you know?

706
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,800
Yeah, but... We need to know about it to sell it.

707
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,010
They gave us the fact sheet earlier.

708
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,720
We can just follow it.

709
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,880
I've read this so many times,

710
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,780
and I don't know what it's talking about.

711
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,870
But... What are wings?

712
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,500
Wings?

713
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,480
Why are the wings here?

714
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,460
Hey, hey. It says it has the charcoal ingredients.

715
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:34,060
But, the product is white. If charcoal went into it, why is it white? Shouldn't it be black?

716
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,200
I really have no clue.

717
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,280
Whatever. I don't know what it's saying, but...

718
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,060
Let's start, shall we?

719
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,480
Alright, let's do it.

720
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,680
What's this? Why is everyone so early?

721
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,530
Why are they yelling?

722
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,920
Hyung, what's going on today?

723
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,640
Didn't you hear? Before the season starts,

724
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,840
there are rumors that some people are going to be removed from the team.

725
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,750
Removed?

726
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,390
So, that's why.

727
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,140
Everyone's going crazy over trying to look good to the coach.

728
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,790
So, you should be careful, too.

729
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,560
Don't make any mistakes with the coach.

730
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,490
Alright, got it.

731
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,560
Gosh, removed? That can't happen.

732
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,540
What do I do?

733
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,230
Gosh.

734
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,420
Darn.

735
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,920
Gook Gi Bong! Looking good!

736
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,320
You're doing great!

737
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,100
Thank you, Coach!

738
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,900
You're doing great!

739
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,460
Coach! Coach!

740
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,480
Oh, yes?

741
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,750
Coach, Dong Yeon is here.

742
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,500
Is that so?

743
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,060
Hyung! Who's Dong Yeon?

744
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,220
He's the coach's youngest son.

745
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,980
I'm telling you, he's completely head over heels for his son.

746
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,170
Oh, I see.

747
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,150
Dad... Dad...

748
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,060
Dad...

749
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,140
What's wrong?

750
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,500
Some ahjussi hit me!

751
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,350
What?

752
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:15,280
Which one of you hit my son?!

753
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,260
- You remember what that man looked like, right? 
 - Yeah!

754
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,230
This won't do. Which one of you bastards is it?

755
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,560
You're dead when I find you!

756
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,710
Let's go.

757
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,830
Which one of you is it?!

758
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,380
This is a huge problem. What do I do?

759
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,880
What do I do?

760
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,420
Hey, Dong Yeon, it's me. Don't worry.

761
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,580
I just have something to tell you. I'll let go of my hand,

762
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,720
so don't yell, okay?

763
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,430
Dad!

764
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,240
Hey, you said you wouldn't yell!

765
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,180
Can you just listen to me?

766
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,360
What is it?

767
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,160
Well...

768
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,360
It was my fault earlier. I'm really sorry, okay?

769
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,040
I'll sincerely apologize.

770
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,960
So, can you not tell Dad–

771
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,670
I mean, the coach?

772
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,590
Why should I?

773
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:21,790
If you tell the coach, I might be removed from the team. Removed!

774
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,750
So, can you let this slide just once?

775
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,150
Just once.

776
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,220
I got it. Instead, I have a favor to ask.

777
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,910
Favor?

778
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,580
You really only need the phone?

779
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,380
Can I download a game? My dad doesn't let me play games.

780
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,280
Yeah, of course. Yeah, just download it. You can buy whatever items you want, too.

781
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,760
So, don't tell the coach, okay?

782
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,460
That depends on you.

783
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,150
Alright, I'll do well.

784
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,260
I'll do really well.

785
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,420
So, I'm going to go practice.

786
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,620
Ahjussi, tell me if you think my dad's coming over here.

787
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,980
Alright?

788
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,360
Oh, okay. Just believe in me, Dong Yeon.

789
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,420
Dong Yeon, have a fun time playing games!

790
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,730
Tw-Twin Angels..

791
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,420
Ultra Flowe— It's new.

792
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,450
They said it's good since it has two wings.

793
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,380
It has charcoal ingredients.

794
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,730
This is new. It's on sale.

795
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,320
What are you doing right now?

796
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,390
Team Leader.

797
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,860
Are you going to make any sales today?

798
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,790
You two, do you know how competitive this position is?

799
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:38,830
I'm sorry.

800
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:43,500
Whatever. Whoever has the lower sales today, I'm going to switch out your position.

801
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,900
What do you mean? If I don't do well, Soo Yeon will be fired?

802
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,780
Of course.

803
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,760
What a relief for Jeong Eun.

804
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,570
- If you don't make any sales, Jeong Eun will be fired. 
 - What?

805
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,690
Do you understand?

806
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,690
Gosh, this is too much.

807
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,540
Right? It's not like we fought or anything.

808
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,790
  What a huge problem. Jeong Eun can't be fired because of me!

809
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:10,490
  This is a huge problem. Soo Yeon could be fired because of me!

810
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,600
Well, there's nothing we can do. We'll just try our best.

811
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,310
Yeah, we will.

812
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,660
Ultra Flower! Not me, but this!

813
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,380
Compared to other products, the absorption isn't even twice as good.

814
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,560
Three times? No!

815
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,280
Five  times! Take a look!

816
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,220
Excuse me, beautiful customers! This is a  new product, Twin Angels!

817
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,870
There are two wings!

818
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,060
It's not even one, but two!

819
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,470
You'll understand if you try it, but it's unnoticeable!

820
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,950
Alright, Ultra Flower

821
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,670
not only has five times the absorption,

822
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,390
but it has the natural charcoal ingredients!

823
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,120
It was given a grade of "Excellent" by German dermatologists!

824
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,900
And, it's 100% organic!

825
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,620
It takes responsibility of your safety!

826
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,410
Twin Angels not only has two wings,

827
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,070
but this product uses a natural, organic air cushion that

828
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,000
softly protects your skin without irritating it!

829
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,160
With colorless, odorless, and unbleached polymer absorption,

830
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,020
It protects your health!i

831
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,740
Please come over! It's Twin Angels!

832

I want this one, this one!

00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,410

855
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,610
Today, this angel will pay!

856
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,530
Pay for what?

857
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:01,670
You'll get these chewy, garlic sausages.

858
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,030
  Dandan Noodles

859
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:09,780
But you'll also get these traditional, Chinese dandan noodles, as well, which are worth ₩4,000! (~$4)

860
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,790
I can sit with you, right?

861
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,260
Oh, yeah.

862
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,700
Eat up, Dong Yeon.

863
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,020
You scared me. What's wrong?

864
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:38,590
Lower your voice. Is my dad looking here right now?

865
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,930
- No. 
 - I have a favor to ask of you.

866
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,630
Eat my kimchi.

867
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,050
- What? 
 - I hate kimchi.

868
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,340
And there's spinach, and even mung bean sprouts. I hate them all.

869
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,760
So, you want me to eat your kimchi and veggies?

870
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,820
My dad said he'll check later.

871
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,780
Do it. You don't want to?

872
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,070
Oh, no, no. I'll eat it.

873
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,720
What are you doing?

874
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,430
What did I do?

875
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:20,820
It's suspicious if you take all of it at once.

876
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,720
Take a little bit of kimchi for every spoonful of rice.

877
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,470
Okay?

878
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,790
Okay.

879
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:37,810
Is that enough?

880
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,670
Yeah. Good job.

881
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,310
I'll be off first.

882
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,450
Dad, I ate it all!

883
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,810
Wow, you're truly my son!

884
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,640
Go ahead.

885
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,430
  In ten minutes, I'll see you in the coach's office.

886
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,450
He's more of a punk than I thought.

887
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,640
This is driving me crazy.

888
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,510
Alright, you all have waited so long.

889
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,610

890

but you'll also get

892
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,670
chewy, garlic sausages.

893
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,660
And with Ultra Flower, you will get for your dinner table,

894
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,650
these salted,

895
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,060
Andong mackerel!

896
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,290
Is that all you're giving us?

897
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,880
That angel man over there is giving away better products.

898
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,180
Oh, is it better than the mackerel?

899
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,930
To everyone who buys from Twin Angels,

900
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,040

901
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,420
and 20-year-old red ginger essence.

902
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:54,010
You'll get one more!

903
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,290
I'd like it!

904
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,810
Oh, thank you, thank you.

905
00:51:58,810 --> 00:51:59,410
Can I have it?

906
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,650
Thank you. Thank you.

907
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,990
One more.

908
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,630
Come here.

909
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,020
Aren't you being too harsh?

910
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,930
- What? 
 - Don't you think we're going overboard?

911
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,910
Don't you know we're going to have to pay for all of this with our own money? At this rate, we'll both die.

912
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,650
- Who's the one who started it? 
  - Hey.

913
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,830
Why are you being like this?

914
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,380
Are you worried that Soo Yeon will be fired?

915
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,110
Or, do you like Soo Yeon?

916
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:26,930
No, it's not like that.

917
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,690
Then, why are you being like this?

918
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,070
Hey, Soo Yeon had to deal with bankruptcy and her engagement was broken.

919
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:35,050
She's trying her best to do whatever she can. She'll be so disappointed if she's fired again.

920
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,210
Do you not even pity her?

921
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,610
It's the same for Jeong Eun.

922
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,920
She paid for her tuition after working so hard, then graduated.

923
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,630
But nothing's working out for her now. She has to work three to four part-time jobs a day.

924
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,690
That's not enough, so she even does designate driving as a part-time job at night.

925
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,120
Do you not even pity her?

926
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,900
So, you should give up.

927
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,460
I can't do that.

928
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:00,110
Do you really have to do this? You want to see this to the end?

929
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,870
Okay, got it.

930
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,480
Do whatever you want.

931
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,710
Let's do it then.

932
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,030
What is it this time?

933
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,810
Go and solve this for me.

934
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,120
What is this?

935
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,850
"Elementary Arithmetic That Increases IQ"?

936
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,040
My dad said he'd check it later.

937
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,450
What's wrong? You don't want to do it?

938
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,790
No, I got it.

939
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,520
I'll solve it. I'll do it.

940
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,710
If you do this, I'll forget everything.

941
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,660
Alright. I got it.

942
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,070
But, this is really the last one, okay?

943
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,620
You just can't get a single problem wrong, okay?

944
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,440
My dad said that if I got a single problem wrong, I wouldn't be able to watch a week of "Knowing Brothers."

945
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,900
"Knowing Brothers"? That variety show?

946
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,020
Yes. My favorite show is "Knowing Brothers."

947
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,470
So, don't get a single problem wrong.

948
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,420
- Do you understand? 
 - Alright! I got it.

949
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,420
I'll solve it.

950
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:11,330
Just hang in there.

951
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,270
That little...

952
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,450
Gosh.

953
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,390
Geez!

954
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:26,480
1+6 is...

955
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,250
What am I doing right now?!

956
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,260
I'm being pushed around by an elementary school kid and solving math problems.

957
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,870
What am I doing?!

958
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,750
  Ahjussi, buy me cola.

959
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,950
  Meet me in ten minutes where we were earlier.

960
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,550
  Be careful, too.

961
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:02,650
This little... He dares to ask me to buy him a drink?

962
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,430
If I'm going to be removed, so be it.

963
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,950
I can't take this any longer.

964
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:14,990
Kim Dong Yeon, I will destroy you!

965
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:16,620
How do I get revenge?!

966
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,990
Oh,

967
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:22,100
that'll do.

968
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,900
Kim Dong Yeon, you won't be able to watch "Knowing Brothers" any longer.

969
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,260
Twin Angels!

970
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,860
If you buy it now, you'll get...

971
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,760
Wait, you're going to buy this? They said this has carcinogens.

972
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,660
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

973
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,010
I almost made a huge mistake!

974
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,810
- Let's go. 
 - Wait!

975
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,420
Carcinogens? Who said that?

976
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,030
The Ultra Flower man said so.

977
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,430
- What? 
 - Hello!

978
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,740
Everyone, put 'em up, put 'em up!

979
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,730
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

980
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,080
- Ultra Flower Applause! Get ready!
 - Yeah!

981
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,230
Start!

982
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,310
Lee Joon Ki, you told people that Twin Angels has carcinogens in them.

983
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,530
I'm not sure. I don't remember saying that.

984
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,320
Don't lie to me. That's what the other aunties told me.

985
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,730
You know that you were spreading false rumors, right? That could get you in trouble with the law.

986
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,450
Why would I lie about that? Even if I didn't say that,

987
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,620
Ultra Flower is a way better product than your brand.

988
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,940
- Isn't that so? 
 - Yes!

989
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,360
Hey, are you looking down on Twin Angels? You only have one wing.

990
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,620
Gosh, you and your wings! I'm so sick of it!

991
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,470
What are you going to do with your wings?

992
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,800
Are you going to fly? Will you become a  bird?

993
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,070
Your brand doesn't even have a fifth of the absorption that Ultra Flower does.

994
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,650
Hey, how do you know? Do you have evidence that Ultra Flower has better absorption than Twin Angels?

995
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,560
Whatever, forget it. It doesn't even make sense

996
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,100
to compare Ultra Flower to such a lowly brand like yours.

997
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,930
A lowly brand? Hey, are you finished speaking?

998
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,900
Oh? An angel is hitting me.

999
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,120
Did you just hit me?

1000
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,330
Yeah, I did. What will you do, Ultra Flower?

1001
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:04,990
You Twin Angels. You little...

1002
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:11,830
Excuse me! Excuse! The angel and the flower are fighting!

1003
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,200
You don't know anything. Mine has five times the absorption! Five times!

1004
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,300
Mine has two wings!

1005
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,510
You and your wings!

1006
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,830
Oh, hey.

1007
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,690
What a good fate he has.

1008
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,870
He orders me around and he's playing with the ball?

1009
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:44,930
But, you won't be able to see "Knowing Brothers" anymore.

1010
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,800
No more.

1011
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,080
Dong Yeon!

1012
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,920
I was so scared. I thought you were my dad.

1013
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,580
Oh, why are you getting so scared? Why can't the coach see?

1014
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,960
- My dad doesn't like it when I play baseball. 
 - But,

1015
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,300
- why? 
 - He doesn't want me to have a hard time doing sports like him.

1016
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,600
He tells me to just study hard.

1017
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,090
But, I like baseball the most in the world.

1018
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,980
But, you said you like "Knowing Brothers" the most.

1019
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,260
"Knowing Brothers" comes second to baseball.

1020
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,800
So, you're always practicing in secret?

1021
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,960
Yes. I want to be a pitcher like Park Chan Woo someday.

1022
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,170
I'll go to the Major League, too. Just watch and see!

1023
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,110
Why are you laughing?

1024
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,550
Just... You just remind me of someone.

1025
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,730
But, did you finish the problems? Hand it over.

1026
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,620
Oh, here.

1027
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,080
Wait.

1028
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,590
- What is it? 
 - Well..

1029
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,830
I forgot and I didn't check this over.

1030
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,930
I'll do it and give it to you. Practice some more.

1031
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,760
Take this cola, too.

1032
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,360
Alright. Please hurry.

1033
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,970
Got it. Keep practicing.

1034
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:09,460
Well, he's a colleague dreaming of Major League. I  can't do this to him.

1035
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,500
Kim Dong Yeon, I'm going to

1036
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:18,330
make you able to watch "Knowing Brothers."

1037
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:24,730
- So, you were pushed around by the coach's son and you ate his kimchi? 
 - Yeah.

1038
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,020
At first, I was so angry that I wanted to scold him, but that little kid

1039
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,060
was sweating so much and practicing baseball by himself.

1040
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:36,390
He was making a big deal about going to the Major League.

1041
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:39,600
He was just like me when I was a kid.

1042
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,400
So, I ate his kimchi and solved his math problems!

1043
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,550
You solved his math problems? You?

1044
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,170
What?

1045
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:55,390
You think I can't even do that?

1046
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:00,560
Hey, that was adding and subtracting math for elementary schoolers! You think I can't solve it?

1047
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,260
Zero? There's no way.

1048
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,490
Ahjussi even checked it over again for me.

1049
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:12,320
That ahjussi is such an idiot!

1050
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,290
He'll never be able to forget me his whole life.

1051
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:20,960
I'm his lifesaver. His lifesaver!

1052
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,760
But do you think the other boys are doing well at their job?

1053
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,420
It's not an easy job.

1054
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,590
I wonder.

1055
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,860
It's the team leader.

1056
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,160
Yes, Team Leader?

1057
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,730
What?

1058
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:40,060
Are you crazy? How could you fight there?!

1059
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,160
We both got fired because of you!

1060
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,770
What are you going to do now? What will you do?!

1061
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,120
Well...

1062
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,630
This bastard kept spreading rumors that Twin Angels had carcinogenic ingredients!

1063
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,720
Who was the one bribing customers with other items?

1064
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,860
You were the one who started saying the chewy, garlic sausages would come with it!

1065
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,930
You and your wings!

1066
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:59,190
Shut up! What are you saying?

1067
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,660
- What did you guys do? 
 - Hey.

1068
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,090
We did it all for you!

1069
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,970
We're fools for trusting you.

1070
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:12,130
Wow, there's nothing you can do properly.

1071
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,190
You fools.

1072
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,850
Fools?!

1073
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,590
She's being too harsh.

1074
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,530
See? This is why you're not supposed to help others.

1075
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:25,190
Right? We're never helping you again!

1076
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,030
I'm hungry.

1077
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,620
Joon Ki. Should we have ramen?

1078
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,060
Sounds good, but, Angel, you're cooking!

1079
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,240
Alright.

1080
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,120
Woo Sik, me, too.

1081
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,980
- Get lost. 
 - Just turn on the TV.

1082
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,940
Ow, it hurts.

1083
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,840
I was acting so pointlessly.

1084
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,990
Anyway, I'm never going to worry about Han Soo Yeon again.

1085
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,090
Hey, Cha Woo Sik!

1086
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,460
What is it?

1087
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,820
You still suffered a lot because of me today.

1088
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,870
But, you're not even a child. Why would you fight?

1089
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,900
What are you doing?

1090
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,260
Stay still.

1091
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:29,490
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

1092
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,740
♫  Oh what in the world is happening to me  ♫

1093
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,730
♫  There's never a quiet day  ♫

1094
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:43,740
♫  I'm now even scared of tomorrow  ♫

1095
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,620
♫  As if Murphy's Law was speaking to me  ♫

1096
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:53,990
♫  Why is it that everything I do turns out like this  ♫

1097
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:55,940
It's done.

1098
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,270
♫  Other people who see me say it's funny  ♫

1099
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,220
Hey, what's wrong?

1100
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,620
♫  But that's just the sound of them not understanding me  ♫

1101
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,140
- Cha Woo Sik! 
 - Huh? What?

1102
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,390
Why were you zoning out like that?

1103
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:10,020
When did I ever? When?!

1104
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,190
Gosh, how funny of you.

1105
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,610
Gosh, he gets mad even if I take care of him.

1106
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,000
Yes, hello?

1107
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,960
What? Who is this?

1108
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,890
What?

1109
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,600
You scared me!

1110
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,530
What's wrong?

1111
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,520
Who was it?

1112
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,320
N-Noona is coming.

1113
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,060
What?!

1114
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,840
Your n-noona?

1115
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,770
Is that so? Yoo Ri is?

1116
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:11,190

1117
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,780
  Waikiki

1118
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,460
♫  Hold my hand, follow me, Waikiki  ♫

1119
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:26,560
♫   Waikiki It makes me happy every day  ♫

1120
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,330
♫  Let's go, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1121
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,430
  Preview

1122
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:35,830
  Don't accept calls from my noona. Don't even talk to her. Don't even make eye contact, okay?!

1123
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,330
  Are you crazy? How could you?

1124
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:41,030
  You have to leave before Woo Sik wakes up, or I'll be kicked out!

1125
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,620
 I'm not going to leave. I've had a change of heart.

1126
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,760
  - You have six legs!? 
 - Just continue.

1127
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,400
  Do I really still like her?

1128
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,490
  Woo Sik, are you sick?!

1129
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,230
  No!

1130
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,630
  What kind of role is it?

1131
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,490
 The lead character's... stuntman.

1132
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,800
  Why would you suffer so much for a role where your face isn't shown?

1133
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,530
  I got your role.

1134
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,560
 But stuff like this...

1135
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,360
  Let's play around.

1136
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,960
♫   Waikiki Waikiki   ♫

1137
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,660
♫  It makes me happy every day  ♫
