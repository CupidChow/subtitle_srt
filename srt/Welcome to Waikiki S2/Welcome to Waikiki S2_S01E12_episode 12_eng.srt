1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,770
Jeong Eun. I'm almost finished, so call everyone. Use the new signal we decided on.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,180
Okay.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,270
- It's time for lunch.
 - It is. Hold on, what's today's menu?

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,080
Pu-pu-pu-pu.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,250
Stir-fried spicy pork. It's stir-fried spicy pork!

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,280
It is!

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,140
It really is stir-fried spicy pork. It's so comfortable with the alp-horn, isn't it?

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,130
- I know. Jeong Eun, you've become useful around here for a change.
 - What?

9
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,600
Do you want to die?

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,230
You're being violent again. You said you would live nicely from now on.

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,560
You brought this upon yourself, so just accept it.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,790
How did I bring it on myself?

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,840
You don't have to know. Eat up. You know today is cleaning day, right?

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,900
I have plans with my college club tonight, so I have to go.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,740
It's the super strength club of Huam University!

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,180
Really? Aren't you just lying because you don't want to clean today?

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,520
It's true. It's our first gathering since we graduated, so I have to go.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,600
I'm sure everybody probably changed a lot.

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,130
Wait. Why are you two coming in together?

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,760
We ran into each other on the way home.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,350
Really? You haven't eaten lunch, right? Have a seat.

22
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,400
No, we ate sweet pancakes on our way home, so we're not hungry.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,820
- Isn't it time for the show? 
- Yes. 
- I'll watch with you. Go and get changed.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,660
Okay.

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,070
Enjoy your meal then.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,340
What was that? Are you sure Woo Sik's heartbroken?

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,300
He's so cool about it.  That's the American Style.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,940
I'm relieved. Let's eat our meal.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm sure this is the place.

30
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,300
Joon Ki! Over here.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,980
Hang on.

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
Are you... Dong Cheol? You're Dong Cheol, right?

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,850
Yeah, it's me. Why are you so late?

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,660
I was stuck in traffic.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,000
Where is everyone else?

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,320
They're all running late too.

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,260
Aigoo, nothing has changed with everyone being tardy.

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,200
Here, have some chicken.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,760
Hey, Joon Ki. It's been so long! Long time no see.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,150
Right, you're Byeong Soo, aren't you?

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,550
No, I'm not.

42
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,200
Who are you?

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,350
You don't know me? We were eating ramen at our club practice room and started a fire.

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,900
- We set the place on fire and our eyebrows off!
 - Right!

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Our eyebrows! I remember now. But what was your name?

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,090
What? You don't remember my name? How could you be like this? This is so upsetting.

47
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,060
No, hold on. Hey, I'm sorry.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,930
What was his name?

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,400
I recognize their faces, but I can't remember their names.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,420
I felt so sorry to that guy. This is so awkward.

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,450
I better take off early.

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,300
You're Joon Ki, right?

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,620
 Who is this one? I can't even remember his face.

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,860
Don't you remember me? Hey, it's me!

55
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,610
 I don't know. I don't know, you punk!

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,660
 He'll be upset if I say I don't remember him.

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,820
Of course, I know. I remember perfectly.

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,900
How long has it been? How have you been doing?

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,070
I've been doing well. How about you?

60
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,150
Me too. By the way...

61
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,280
You've changed a lot. You've gotten a lot cooler.

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,900
Really? You too!

63
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,670
Hey, let's get back there for a drink.

64
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,530
- But something urgent came up, so I have to leave. 
- Really?

65
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,200
Then, let's have a drink next time. You know my number, right?

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,240
Yes, of course, I know your number.

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,660
Okay, great. I know your number too, so I'll contact you soon.

68
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,680
Okay. I'll get going then, friend.

69
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,150
 Who are you?

70
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,850
 What on earth is your name?

71
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,110
Did you have fun with your friends last night?

72
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,800
- Not at all. I couldn't even remember their names. I felt so sorry.
 - What?

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,000
It hasn't been long since you graduated. How could you forget the names of your friends?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,670
I told you to cut back on your drinking. That's memory gloss from alcoholism.

75
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,660
Gosh, seriously.

76
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,440
It's not memory gloss, it's memory loss. I'll be more careful.

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,850
Yeah, it's your fault.

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,650
Hello? Oh Hyung, what is it? Really? Okay, I'll be there soon.

79
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,710
I'm going out.

80
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,630
Where are you going?

81
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,210
Oh, a friend I know said he knows of a job opening.

82
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm leaving.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,480
- Goodbye! 
 - Bye!

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,940
I hope he gets a job soon. I'm worried.

85
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,590
Yeah.

86
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,370
Brother. What's in your hand?

87
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,100
It's coffee. I'm going to start making songs again. I'll need coffee for that.

88
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,390
Making songs?

89
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,780
I feel like I've been neglecting my work recently.

90
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,700
I'm going to start producing good songs now and make a comeback.

91
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,760
Good idea.

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,000
You know that once I start working, I'll become really sensitive to things, so don't come into my studio if you can help it.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,810
I'd like you to be quiet, too. Especially, you.

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,630
Alright.

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,600
I'll be going up.

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,420
Okay!

97
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,800
Fighting!

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,900
I guess he's going to start doing something now.

99
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,890
Yeah. I thought he'd have such a hard time for a while, but I'm glad.

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,250
Yeah. Let's forget Soo Yeon and produce a legendary song.

101
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,760
 Leader in Global Marketing

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,600
Global Network Marketing?

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,970
Wow, your company's pretty interesting. What did you want to talk about?

104
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,940
Oh, well. Gi Bong, you know, as we live,

105
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,560
do you know how much we've suffered from a distribution margin?

106
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,860
What's a distribution margin?

107
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,500
- What? You don't know what that means? 
 - No.

108
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,890
It's my first time hearing about it.

109
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,390
Oh, really? Of course, I guess you could not know. I was like that, too.

110
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,300
Well, let's say a factory makes a 10 cent object.

111
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,120
To get to you, the object goes through wholesale, retail,

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,410
and if you add advertising costs on top of that, the price gets pretty high.

113
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,400
So, in the end, you buy this 10 cent object for 30, 40, or even 50 cents.

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,290
All these steps make up the distribution margin.

115
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,730
But, what if you could reduce the distribution margin and buy products for cheaper?

116
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,990
That would be great.

117
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,700
Right? My company does that.

118
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,200
People call this illegal, how it's like a pyramid scheme, but

119
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,990
they're saying that because they're ignorant and don't know what they're talking about.

120
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,550
Hyung, you do such good things!

121
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,700
- So, do you want to try working here?  
 - What?

122
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,000
So, you'll get me a job?! But, what job is it?

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Our company runs on a membership system.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,600
It is divided into five levels, "Do," "Ge," "Geol," "Yut," and "Mo."

125
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,830
"Do," "Ge," "Geol," "Yut," and "Mo"? That's why the company is called Yutnoli.

126
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,770
Exactly! Look over here. As you can see, I'm on level "Yut."

127
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,900
And he's a "Geol."

128
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,510
Oh, I see. How is the salary?

129
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,410
Ah, well, we have no salary. You get paid based on commission.

130
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,450
Commission?

131
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,600
For example, you introduce our products to someone.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,470
If that person buys that product, the company gives you a commission.

133
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,630
So, you just introduce something and you get paid? Why?

134
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,700
We're thankful that you introduced a product so it could be sold.

135
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,320
You're paying because you're thankful? Why?

136
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,270
What? Well,

137
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,130
from the company's perspective, we profited thanks to you.

138
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
But, this isn't the end.

139
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,610
If the person you introduced our products to also introduces it to someone else,

140
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,000
a portion of those profits will come to you.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
But, that's someone I don't know.

142
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,830
I didn't do anything, but I get their money? Why?

143
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,410
What? Well, anyway,

144
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,900
thanks to you, it's true that the company profited.

145
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,120
But, it's not proper to take money from someone you don't even know and didn't do the work for.

146
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,750
What?

147
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,160
I'm not someone who doesn't know what's right and wrong.

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,700
Gosh, I can't do this kind of work.

149
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,520
Gosh, how long do I have to live, handing out my profiles like this?

150
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,780
Watch where you're going!

151
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,570
I'm sorry!

152
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,670
Oh? Joon Ki!

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,980
  Who's this? Oh, the bathroom yesterday!

154
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,830
- Why are you here? 
 - Huh?

155
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,660
Oh, I was giving my profile to the production company.

156
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,550
Profile? Are you an actor?

157
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,760
Well, I'm still doing minor roles, but yeah.

158
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,150
You should've told me sooner! I work here, at Gar Marvel Pictures!

159
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,710
- Really?  
 - Yeah!

160
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,200
If I'd known you were an actor, I would've helped you out.

161
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,340
Oh, wait. Let's not do this here. Let's go and have a drink.

162
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,760
We can talk about work too.

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,590
Oh, yeah! Yeah, friend!

164
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,820
The movie that my company is working on these days is Director Park Chan Wook's new film.

165
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,750
Director Park Chan Wook?

166
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,940
Yeah! I was on my way from meeting him earlier.

167
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,080
Do you want to meet him?

168
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,720
Yes! Of course! I'd be thankful!

169
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,090
Okay, alright. Then, I'll set up a time for you two.

170
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,590
Alright, let's drink first.

171
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,480
Yeah, friend!

172
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,580
  Gosh, I can't keep calling him my friend. I'm going nuts.

173
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,090
  I need to find his name and get his number so that I can get his help.

174
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,150
Can you give me your business card?

175
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,960
Business card? Hold on.

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,180
Business card. Huh?

177
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm all out. Hey.

178
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,770
But with our relationship, why do we need that?

179
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,700
Oh, yeah, that's true.

180
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,420
With our relationship...

181
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,020
  I don't know you! I don't know!

182
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,760
  I don't know your name!

183
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,490
  Should I just ask him outright? No.

184
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,570
  It'll be really bad if he gets upset over it.

185
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,780
  What do I do?

186
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,490
Hello? Yes, I called you about my appointment earlier.

187
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,670
Here is your appetizer.

188
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,700
Yes, yes. Tomorrow at 3 PM.

189
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,380
Oh, my name?

190
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,980
My name is Park–

191
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,500
Be quiet–

192
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,870
  Gosh, I didn't hear it! Why would you sneeze here?!

193
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,380
Oh, no, no. It's not that. It's Park–

194
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,110
Gosh!

195
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,490
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new plate.

196
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,650
Oh, yes, thank you.

197
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,450
  Geez!

198
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,210
Joon Ki, what are you doing?

199
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,310
What? Oh, I was checking to see if she got hurt.

200
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,310
Are you okay?

201
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,730
Yes, I am.

202
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,120
  It was the perfect chance to find out his name.

203
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,810
  No. I know his last name, though.

204
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,310
  He's Park. Park.

205
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,470
Friend,

206
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm going to use the bathroom.

207
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,030
Hello? Is it Jae Won? It's me, Joon Ki.

208
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,150
Do you anyone from our club who works at Gar Marvel Pictures?

209
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,080
You don't know, either?

210
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,590
Could you look into people with the last name Park among our former classmates?

211
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,860
Eat breakfast, done! Eat lunch, done! I opened the window and it was raining!

212
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,010
Three worms are sliding by!

213
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,510
How scary, a skull!

214
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,330
Wow, I drew it well! So well!

215
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,520
Great.

216
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,210
Wait. What am I doing right now?

217
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,820
Gosh, is it because I haven't made a song in so long? I can't focus.

218
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,690
Alright, let's focus.

219
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,760
It's bothering me.

220
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,320
Alright, it's all clean now.

221
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,300
Now I can focus.

222
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,780
Why is it so dirty?

223
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,550
Okay, all done.

224
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,250
Yeah, I can finally work on my song now.

225
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,030
Okay, let's start.

226
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,640
All done. It's really perfect now.

227
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,080
Okay, should I start making the song now?

228
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,490
Why are there so many ink clots in this pen?

229
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,560
I used to have a better pen before. What was the brand?

230
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,630
Pen with no ink clots.

231
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,880
I'm telling you, this has nothing to do with what's wrong and right!

232
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,690
What do you mean it doesn't?

233
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,140
I've done nothing, so it doesn't make sense to take profit from a stranger!

234
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,310
I, Gook Gi Bong, hasn't lived my life like that.

235
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,080
Are you okay?

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,350
What are you saying?

237
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,420
Hello. I'm Kim Cheol Min, and I'm a "Mo," the highest of all levels.

238
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,480
Hello.

239
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,840
From what I'm hearing, you seem to think that

240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,880
taking profit from someone you don't know isn't right.

241
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,850
Yes. Even though things in this world have gotten so heartless, it's not something I should do as a person.

242
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,200
Of course, you could think that way.

243
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,430
- Gi Bong, you said you did baseball, right? 
 - Yes.

244
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,090
Try to think about it this way. Let's say you're at the batter's box.

245
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,370
You hit an outfield fly and you're out.

246
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,700
But you tag up the third base runner,

247
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,380
and score a point.

248
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,320
That means, even if you're out, you scored a point for your team.

249
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,100
That's right.

250
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,130
Is that not right either?

251
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,140
What? No, that's fair play.

252
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,030
Of course. Bingo.

253
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,970
This is the same thing.

254
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,710
Gook Gi Bong, it's not that you didn't do anything.

255
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,840
 Your hard work and efforts that went into introducing the products to that first person.

256
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,220
 That is what you're being paid for.

257
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,170
Oh, I see. You could've explained that sooner.

258
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,260
I see you're at that top level for a reason.

259
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,300
Oh, thank you.

260
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,500
So, will you work with us?

261
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,820
Yes! I'll try it.

262
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,770
Bravo!

263
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,980
But, Gi Bong, when you join us, you'll start off at the lowest level.

264
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,800
It takes a long time to get to the top level like me.

265
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,260
But there is a way to start on the Geol  (third level)  level right away.

266
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,160
What is that?

267
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,480
A pre-payment.

268
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,590
Pre-payment?

269
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,530
If you make a pre-payment of $5,000,

270
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,580
you can start at the Geol level immediately.

271
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:10,030
What? But if I pay to go up the Geol level, wouldn't it be cheating?

272
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,520
That's the same thing as paying your way up.

273
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,850
That's cheating.

274
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,750
- What? 
 - New workers should work their way up from the bottom.

275
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,310
I'm not a person who cheats like that.

276
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,040
I can't work like this, then.

277
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,800
And, there are ten movies my company's making next year.

278
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,830
I'll get you auditions for all of those, so don't worry.

279
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,390
R-Really?

280
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,130
Oh, thank you, friend!

281
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,150
  I need to know his name.

282
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,290
Oh, right.

283
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,200
  There are so many Parks!

284
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,000
 This is driving me nuts.

285
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,100
  What's your name? What is your name?

286
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,560
Why are you staring at me like that?

287
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,620
Oh, it's nothing. It's just nice to see you in so long.

288
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,920
Wow, you're being so serious.

289
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,370
Yeah, Mom? I met Joon Ki for the first time in a while, so I'm drinking with him.

290
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,090
  What?

291
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,120
  His mom knows me?

292
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,130
  - Then, we must've been really close.   
 - You want me to bring him over?

293
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,280
  Why can't I remember?

294
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,140
Hey, Joon Ki. My mom wants you over. She wants you to have a drink.

295
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,790
Let's go!

296
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,320
- But, going over to your house is a bit... 
 - Hey.

297
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,790
Hey, my mom said she'll give you drinks! Are you going to be like this?

298
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,120
Hey, my mom liked you so much! Wow, I'm disappointed.

299
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,190
I'm so disappointed.

300
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,890
Alright, alright. Let's go, let's go. Yeah.

301
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,190
Really? Of course, you should.

302
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,520
Let's go, Joon Ki.

303
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,170
Alright, friend.

304
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,220
  Gosh, I can't even refuse to go because he'll get upset.

305
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,420
  No. I might remember his name when I see his mom.

306
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,820
Come in, come in.

307
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,420
Mom! I'm here.

308
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,400
Mom!

309
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,140
You're here?

310
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,360
You're Joon Ki?

311
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,350
Hello.

312
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:28,960
  I don't know. I don't know her either! At all!

313
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,110
It's been so long!

314
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,330
But, you've changed so much.

315
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,530
Is that so? Yes.

316
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,860
It's so good to see you.

317
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,040
You used to eat here so often in the past. You even slept here a few times.

318
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,680
- You remember? 
 - What?

319
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,560
Oh, yes, of course! Yes.

320
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,490
  What? I slept here?

321
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,690
Your dongsaeng (younger sibling) would've loved it if he saw Joon Ki.

322
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,560
Right? Right.

323
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,900
  His sibling knows me, too?

324
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,600
  Gosh, how close were we?

325
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,000
 I should really quit drinking.

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,710
You should take a seat. I'll prepare the drinks.

327
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,960
Thank you!

328
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,960
  This is driving me nuts.

329
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,960
Awesome! Wow, you can twirl pens like that?

330
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,450
But, why am I looking at this right now?

331
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,760
I was searching up pens without ink clots. How'd I get here?

332
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,600
Woo Sik, what's with you? Are you not going to work on the song?

333
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,800
Snap out of it. Let's focus.

334
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,090
Oh.

335
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,130
Woo Sik! Come eat chicken!

336
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,410
No, I'm not eating.

337
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,150
I forgot what it was!

338
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,110
Didn't I tell you not to come in my studio because I need to focus?

339
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,760
I had such a great idea, but I forgot it because of you!

340
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,180
But, you should have some chicken.

342
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,280
I won't! I won't! Leave.

343
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,380
Just leave!

344
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,200
Gosh, these people aren't helping me out at all.

345
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,620
Oh, my back.

346
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,360
I guess it's because I was sitting for so long.

347
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,480
I'll have to lie down a bit.

348
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,230
This isn't cheating!

349
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,200
If using your money to go up isn't cheating, what is it?

350
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,650
Because of your kind of thinking that money solves everything,

351
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,330
our society is in shambles right now!

352
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:57,010
I, Gook Gi Bong, am not someone who lives cheating like that.

353
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,720
Oh, my neck. My blood pressure.

354
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,820
Hello. Here.

355
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,140
Three "Mo"s, no less.

356
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,880
I'm a Three "Mo" member, Kang Nam Gil.

357
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,460
Hello.

358
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,020
I heard you've been arguing that making a pre-payment to start on the Geol level is cheating.

359
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,640
Yes. That's just the same thing as using money to get promoted.

360
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,510
That's cheating.

361
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,080
Yes, yes, well, of course, you might think that since it's your first time. I understand.

362
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,640
But, Gook Gi Bong, how about you think of it like this?

363
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,460
How?

364
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,350
Let's say there's a pitcher that made his debut along with you.

365
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,810
But, to save money, that pitcher

366
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,830
uses cheap, low-quality equipment.

367
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,900
But, you invested money in equipment,

368
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,670
got private lessons,

369
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,980
so your skills increased.

370
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,010
So, you're chosen as the starting pitcher of that team.

371
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,770
But, is that cheating?

372
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,490
Well, no, it isn't.

373
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,890
You invested that money.

374
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,730
Right, right? Of course.

375
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,910
Yes. That's the same thing as the pre-payment.

376
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,500
The hard efforts that you put into getting that money,

377
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,600
our company will acknowledge such hard work.

378
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,680
How is that cheating? Don't you think so?

379
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,400
Oh, I see. Oh, you should've explained it like that sooner.

380
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,450
Maybe it's because you're a Three "Mo" level member, I can understand what you're saying in one explanation.

381
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,140
Yes, well, will you make the pre-payment now?

382
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,630
It'll be $5,000.

383
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,140
But, I don't have that money. I checked my bank account yesterday, and I only have around $5.20.

384
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,090
Is that so? Well, you can just borrow it from someone. From your parents, or—

385
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,910
I'm old enough to not be borrowing money from them!

386
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,230
That's not right to do to my parents.

387
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,160
Then, you can ask your friends—

388
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,930
I don't ask for money from friends.

389
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,710
That's not right to do to my friends.

390
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, we have prepared a great loan program–

391
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,920
My mom told me to never take out loans.

392
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,450
If I were to disobey her, that's not right as a son.

393
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,030
Then, I could lend you some—

394
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,690
No, borrowing money from a person you met for the first time isn't right to do to that person.

395
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,410
I will just start at the lowest level.

396
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,780
I will slowly work my way up, with sincerity.

397
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,520
Do you have food here? I'm hungry.

398
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,580
Gosh.

399
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,190
Hyung, they don't give food here?

400
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,070
You and your being "right"!

401
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,440
What's wrong with you? You said you'd get me a job!

402
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,880
No, just leave! Leave!

403
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,720
I don't want to! I need a job!

404
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,090
And, all the buses stopped running, so I can't go.

405
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,800
Here, here, here. I'll give you the money for a taxi. Just go.

406
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,900
Here. Do right, and just go. Go!

407
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,340
Hyung! Hyung! Hyung!

408
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,770
Oh, Hyung! Hyung!

409
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,930
Hyung! Open up!

410
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,730
I'll really work hard! I'll start from the "Do" level, and work my way up to Three "Mo"!

411
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,130
Hyung, can you just open up? Hyung!

412
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:02,320
Back in the old days, we went to a theme park with my sibling.

413
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,910
While we were on a rollercoaster, my sibling threw up on you.

414
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,780
Do you remember?

415
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,990
Of course, yeah! I do!

416
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,780
  I don't remember. Not at all!

417
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,700
  How could this happen?

418
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,860
Mom, what's that?

419
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,430
You said Joon Ki's an actor. I want his autograph before he gets famous.

420
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,060
- Alright, yeah. 
 - Joon Ki.

421
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,960
Joon Ki, you can give me your autograph, right?

422
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,420
What? Yes! Yes. Autograph.

423
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,730
  To: Mother

424
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,380
Write my name, too.

425
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,770
What? Your name, too?

426
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,790
Yeah! Why?

427
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,750
Oh, no, it's fine.

428
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,620
  This is driving me nuts. What do I do?

429
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,950
What?

430
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,010
  Marathon Winner, Park Jong Oh?

431
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,220
  Hold on. There's no way his father could get first place in a marathon.

432
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,750
  Then, is that his name?

433
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,500
  What's that?

434
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,910
  Marathon Winner 2nd Place, Park Jong Woo?

435
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,720
  Oh, right. He has a sibling.

436
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,860
  Then, is it Park Jong Oh or Park Jong Woo? His name is one of those.

437
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,030
What are you hesitating for?

438
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,230
Do you not know my name or something?

439
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,230
No, no! How could I not know your name!

440
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,430
Jong!

441
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,820
Don't be ridiculous.

442
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,010
  Park Jong

443
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,440
  Woo? Oh?

444
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,220
 It's one of the two!

445
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,290
  Just guess. Trust the heavens with this.

446
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,990
 Abracadabra! 
  Park Jong Woo

447
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,760
What are you staring at? Sign it!

448
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,420
  I was right!

449
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,040
  Your name was Jong Woo!

450
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,560
  Nice to see you, Jong Woo!

451
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,100
  Wait. Did I ever have a Jong Woo among my friends?

452
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,730
  Ah, whatever, whatever.

453
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,570
Oh, yeah, Jong Woo.

454
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,160
I'll sign it, Jong Woo!

455
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
  Lee Joon Ki?

456
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,400
  Not Kang Joon Ki?

457
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,950
Ki...

458
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,960
  No. It's definitely Kang Joon Ki.

459
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,730
Jong Woo, how's this? My sign is cool, right?

460
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,790
But, Joon Ki, did you change your name or something?

461
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,690
Why would I? It's a precious name my parents gave me.

462
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,140
Really?

463
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,490
Well, what was our school name?

464
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,110
It must be because I'm drunk. I can't remember it.

465
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,530
What? How could you forget our school name?

466
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,040
It's Huam University!

467
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,970
  No. I'm from Myeongseom University.

468
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,090
  What? Who's this, then?

469
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,490
  How did this happen?

470
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,260
  Here, here!

471
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,130
  Oh, why are you so late?

472
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,160
  Sit, sit.

473
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,350
  I just saw Joon Ki.

474
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,140
  Joon Ki? He's here? Where?

475
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,500
  He left early because he's busy. He lost so much weight!

476
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,350
  He lost weight? Joon Ki did?

477
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,520
  That's weird. He was about the same last month.

478
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,300
  Hold on.

479
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,930
  A picture of him...

480
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,400
  See?

481
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,620
  Oh, that's true. He must've gone on a diet.

482
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,020
  Yeah.

483
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,630
  What? Then, this is someone I don't know?

484
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,570
  A person I don't know at all.

485
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,400
What are you staring at? My friend, Jong Woo?

486
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,890
Jong Woo, let's meet often, okay?

487
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,230
Oh, and, help me out, okay?

488
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,520
Jong Woo, Jong Woo, Jong Woo!

489
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,320
  I can't even ask him who he is now. What do I do?

490
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,140
Oh, it's so late. Don't you need to get going?

491
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,460
Go where? He should sleep over.

492
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,220
Joon Ki, got it?

493
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,560
Yes, Mother!

494
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,260
I'll sleep with you for the first time in a while!

495
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,620
That's great.

496
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,220
Jong Woo. Do you remember?

497
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,230
You know, when our club performed at the girls' university.

498
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,320
We hit our heads with  the wooden sticks and bled like crazy.

499
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,820
All the girls went crazy.

500
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,660
  I don't know. I don't even know where Huam University is.

501
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,600
  Of course, I wouldn't know the super strength club.

502
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,630
  Who are you?

503
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,570
It was so fun that time. Right, Jong Woo?

504
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,180
Of course.

505
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,600
Jong Woo. Let's be friends for the rest of our lives, yeah?

506
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,730
Jong Woo!

507
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,030
Jong Woo, Jong Woo, Park Jong Woo!

508
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,600
What? What is this?

509
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,500
What's that noise?

510
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,830
Did I fall asleep?

511
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,380
What time is it?

512
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,460
Four?

513
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
Four AM?

514
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,420
Damn it. How long did I sleep?

515
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,130
This is driving me nuts.

516
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,630
Gosh, I didn't even write a single note! I'm such a fool!

517
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,320
Now, I've got to really focus.

518
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,220
Focus!

519
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,240
I'm out of coffee.

520
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,230
Gosh, I can't work without coffee.

521
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:52,180
♫  Will you look at me for a moment  ♫

522
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,950
♫  My heart is just right beside you  ♫

523
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,780
♫  You can rest in my arms no need to say anything  ♫

524
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:12,160
♫  My embrace only for you  ♫

525
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,930
♫  Just one minute to me, Just a moment to me  ♫

526
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,620
♫  Lean on my shoulder  ♫

527
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,050
♫  Don't think about anything  ♫

528
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:34,420
♫  If it means you'll smile  ♫

529
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,880
  Waikiki Guest House

530
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,880
Your jaw will break. Why are you yawning so much?

531
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,060
I filmed all night, so I didn't sleep at all. I came in early in the morning.

532
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,740
What'd you film this time?

533
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,500
On Anmyeon Island, there's a baby octopus that can do Michael Jackson's moonwalk.

534
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,830
What? An octopus does the moonwalk?

535
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,770
Did it really?

536
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,370
Yes! It really did.

537
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,580
It used its suckers to walk backward. It was so cool.

538
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,350
But, a drunk customer accidentally dipped it in hot sauce and ate it.

539
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,350
The shoot was halted. It was a mess.

540
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:14,010
What? He dipped the octopus that could moonwalk in hot sauce and ate it?

541
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,670
Gosh, how could that happen?

542
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,250
I know.

543
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,150
So, we spent all night filming something else.

544
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,550
Gosh, being a reporter is harder than I thought.

545
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,120
You should've come sooner. It's getting cold. Hurry and eat.

546
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,540
But, where's Woo Sik?

547
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,060
He said he was going out to record the song he made.

548
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,590
Really? Oh, he must've finally finished it.

549
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,030
That's great.

550
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,780
Who have you been calling this early?

551
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,060
Oh, it's Jong Woo. He's a college friend who was in the same club as me.

552
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,140
He's not answering my calls. I even went to his company and he wouldn't see me.

553
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,500
Did I make a mistake?

554
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,570
He must be busy. Just eat up.

555
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,830
What's wrong with you?

556
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,660
My friend introduced me to a job that I really liked.

557
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,530
But, I was chased out before even starting it.

558
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,350
I wanted to do global marketing.

559
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,010
You should've done better.

560
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,250
But, Gi Bong, you should still eat a bite.

561
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,150
Alright.

562
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,740
Oh, you start the food truck business today, right?

563
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,470
Are you ready? Do you want me to help?

564
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,980
No, it's fine. I've already prepared everything.

565
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,670
Alright.

566
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:30,260
But, Gi Bong, there's something I want your help with.

567
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,040
What is it?

568
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,110
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

569
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,990
Gosh, I can't believe this.

570
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,070
How can a food truck owner not know how to drive?

571
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,220
I just haven't driven for a long time.

572
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,690
Can you help out until I get used to driving?

573
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,380
Alright.

574
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,880
- Hello! 
 - Hi!

575
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,450
- You're new? 
 - Yes!

576
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,350
Oh, we make steak and rice bowls next door.

577
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,330
Mine is a taco truck. Nice to meet you.

578
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,980
Nice to meet you!

579
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,450
Let's work well together.

580
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,000
Of course.

581
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,150
Yuri's Kitchen 31.

582
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,080
Oh, do you sell ice cream?

583
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,380
No! It's a spaghetti shop.

584
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,290
There are 31 items to choose from.

585
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,630
Oh, the concept is quite fresh.

586
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,120
- Right, right? 
 - Yes.

587
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,340
But this is my first time doing a food truck,

588
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,400
so I was wondering if you have any tips for good business?

589
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,620
Well, not really any tips.

590
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,880
It just has to taste good.

591
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,390
That's right. Cheap tricks won't bring in customers.

592
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,500
It's just the taste. You win with taste alone!

593
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,020
Come and try the charcoal steak rice bowl full of flavors!

594
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,420
The world-famous tacos have arrived!

595
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,500
Let's take a nap.

596
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
They sent me the pay.

597
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,150
Wow!

598
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,020
Is this my first paycheck ever?

599
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,230
What do I do?

600
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,700
Well, I should get a gift for my family.

601
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,800
What do I get, though?

602
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,950
Should I ask?

603
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,480
What happened to your room?

604
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,690
Woo Sik is working on the song. He made this mess.

605
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,420
He should've cleaned it up.

606
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,900
Alright, let's see what kind of amazing song he made.

607
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,380
Let's see. What's he thinking?

608
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,840
Look at those lyrics. It's making tears well up already.

609
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,300
He pretended like he was completely fine. What a lie.

610
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,950
What do you mean? What about it?

611
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,360
Look at it. This is all for Soo Yeon.

612
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,760
Oh, I see.

613
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,890
But, he seemed fine.

614
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,960
He's just pretending to be fine for Soo Yeon.

615
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,170
Did he like her that much?

616
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,120
You think it's as simple as that?

617
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,200
He's only ever like Soo Yeon since high school. All the way until now.

618
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,190
Really?

619
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,090
That's not all. Do you remember when he had his head shaved at the protest?

620
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,900
That was all so Soo Yeon wouldn't get fired from her part-time job.

621
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,850
And do you remember when he was almost killed at that gangster's event?

622
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,300
He did that he could pay for lessons for Soo Yeon.

623
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,850
Really? Woo Sik's such a romantic.

624
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,540
I want to meet a man like him.

625
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,380
In your dreams!

626
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,980
Wake up! Wake up!

627
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,250
Why would a cool guy like that go out with you?

628
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,690
Who would ever go out with someone,

629
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,400
a violent monster

630
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,920
like you, King Kong?

631
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,120
What? Monster?

632
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,180
Do you want to die?!

633
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,560
Come here. Come here.

634
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,460
Help!

635
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,760
Please save me, Tarzan! King Kong is killing me!

636
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,480
Soo Yeon, what are you doing there?

637
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,890
Oh, it's nothing.

638
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,330
I heard you went to record. You're back already?

639
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,390
Oh, I left something here.

640
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,860
Here.

641
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,690
What's this?

642
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,490
It's sweet pancakes!

643
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,830
I thought of you on the way here, so I bought some. You like them!

644
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,760
Thank you.

645
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,880
No need. It's nothing.

646
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,120
What was that? What's that noise?

647
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,550
Ow! Ow! Hey!

648
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,490
Hey! Hey!

649
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,570
Let me go! Let go!

650
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,010
What's this? Hey, what are you two doing?!

651
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,160
He keeps provoking me!

652
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,180
You put me in a headlock first!

653
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,470
Shut up! Hurry and clean this!

654
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,270
Oh, what's this?

655
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:35,230
Oh, this broke! This was my most treasured album!

656
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,830
Woo Sik, I'm sorry.

657
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,860
I'll buy you a new one.

658
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,390
This is a first edition! Do you know how hard it is to get this?!

659
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,570
What will you do now? What will you do?!

660
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:58,460
Woo Sik. Calm down first. Just relax. R-Relax.

661
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,230
Relax, my butt.

662
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,590
Come here. Come!

663
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,500
Come here!

664
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:23,860
  Woo Sik has only ever liked Soo Yeon since high school.

665
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,720
  Do you remember when he had his head shaved at the protest?

666
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,960
  That was so Soo Yeon wouldn't get fired from her part-time job.

667
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,160
 I came over because I heard our boss is going on a hunger strike.

668
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,530
  Why would you do it?

669
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,120
  Well...

670
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,060
  The boss forced you to, right?

671
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,940
  Should I call him out for it?

672
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,040
  Don't do it! Don't!

673
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,980
  He didn't force me to. I wanted to do it.

674
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,690
 And do you remember when he almost got killed at that gangster's event? He did that to pay for lessons for Soo Yeon.

675
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,890
 Then you won't have to go to an academy for announcers?

676
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,900
  What do you mean? Academy for announcers?

677
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,130
  What? No, it's nothing.

678
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,500
I see.

679
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,040
That's what he was doing.

680
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,970
I've only been receiving things from Woo Sik.

681
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,100
Is there anything I can do for him?

682
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,820
Soo Yeon, where's Woo Sik?

683
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,400
He left for the studio to record.

684
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,920
He did? That's a relief.

685
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,670
How long have we been hiding in there?

686
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,180
How could he do this to us just because we broke a record? He's got a horrible personality.

687
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,150
He said it was his favorite.

688
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,210
Wait a minute. Which album was it again?

689
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,610
- It was Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album or something. Why?
 - What?

690
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,870
It's nothing.

691
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:59,070
 Secondhand Market. 
Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album

692
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,660
♫  It always makes me smile  ♫

693
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,260
I found it! 
 Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album

694
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:13,970
♫  It's strange, when I look at you, my heart  ♫

695
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,780
♫  melts silently  ♫

696
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,390
Hello?

697
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,110
Yes. I'm interested in something you're selling on the Secondhand Market.

698
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,070
We're home.

699
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,970
Hey.

700
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,250
How was business today?

701
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,520
It was a failure. A complete failure.

702
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,590
Why? Didn't you have any customers?

703
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,140
Not even one.

704
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,660
The competition between food trucks was intense.

705
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,840
The others were spitting fire and rainbows to attract customers.

706
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,570
I couldn't tell if they were doing business or running a circus.

707
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,410
I don't think we can go on like this.

708
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,480
We need to come up with something. A shocking performance!

709
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,620
What would we be able to do?

710
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,680
We have no choice.

711
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,680
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!

712
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,940
What are you doing? Hurry up and start the show.

713
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,800
Do we have to do this? I'm scared.

714
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,290
What do you mean, you're scared? You were able to get one out of five tries.

715
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,440
That's not important. I failed the other four times!

716
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,590
Why do you think you'll fail? You might succeed this time.

717
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,490
Besides, if our business fails, your investment is out the window.

718
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,450
Got it?

719
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,140
So, hurry up.

720
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,240
Okay.

721
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,320
I'm scared.

722
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,490
What happened? Did you swallow it?

723
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,620
I'm sorry. I was feeling too nervous.

724
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,790
Try again!

725
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,120
What happened? You swallowed it again?

726
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
You're supposed to spit fire!

727
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,730
I-I'll try again.

728
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,170
Again, again!

729
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,380
Stop drinking it and spit fire instead!

730
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,630
You were supposed to spit fire. Why did you drink the whole bottle?

731
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,520
I was scared, what to do?

732
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,330
Forget it, then.

733
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,810
Let's try spitting rainbows instead.

734
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,850
Open your mouth.

735
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,100
Come on. Spit, hurry.

736
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,910
Spit!

737
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,110
You swallowed that too?!

738
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,930
I'm sorry. I just wanted to swallow my saliva, but I ended up swallowing that too.

739
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,840
Gosh, you idiot.

740
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,340
Throw it up. Hurry up!

741
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,350
It tastes good. Give me one more.

742
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,420
What are you saying?

743
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,720
You're driving me crazy!

744
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,720
♫ As long as I can see you smile ♫

745
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,750
♫ I can deal with any pain ♫

746
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:26,880
♫ Open your heart to me ♫

747
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,010
Hyung, what do you think?

748
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,430
This song is really good.

749
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,640
I love the lyrics. I think it could be a hit.

750
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,790
Really? Can you ask what your company thinks of this too?

751
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,780
Of course, you punk.

752
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,700
Can you sing it one more time?

753
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,980
Oh, okay.

754
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,970
It arrived early.

755
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,660
It's the right one.
 Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album

756
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,350
Why is such an old album so expensive?

757
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,370
Still, it'll make Woo Sik really happy.

758
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,260
What's this smell?

759
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,080
I think it's coming from here.

760
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,300
What could it be?

761
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,240
 Roasted Seaweed

762
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,420
Seaweed?

763
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,740
What are these?

764
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,680
Why did I get this instead of the record?

765
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,320
Hold on.

766
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,350
No way...

767
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,990
Kim, Kwang, Seok?

768
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,350
Fourth?

769
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,790
Darn it!

770
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,030
I got scammed!

771
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,950
What a con! I just lost my money.

772
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,550
There it is.

773
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,930
Hello?

774
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,230
I saw you're selling Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album on record.

775
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,460
Are you sure you have it?

776
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,040
Are you really sure?

777
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,320
I'd like to buy it.

778
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,670
But let's meet in person rather than use delivery.

779
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,950
In person.

780
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,420
Guys, we're home.

781
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,140
Guys.

782
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,930
We're here!

783
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,000
Try to walk.

784
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,800
Fire!

785
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,790
Ugh!

786
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,100
Wait a second. What happened to Gi Bong?

787
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,100
I don't know. I'm tired.

788
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,760
He reeks of alcohol. Did he get drunk?

789
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,450
I don't know. My business today was ruined because of him.

790
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,390
Gosh.

791
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,790
I've had almost no customers for the last few days. All I'm doing is losing my money.

792
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,220
What if I really go under?

793
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,530
He's such a fool.

794
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,480
Joon Ki, take him to his bed.

795
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,640
Okay.

796
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,360
Gi Bong, come to your senses.

797
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,760
Take off your backpack first.

798
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,960
Just a second. I want to throw up.

799
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,030
What?

800
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,360
No! Hold it in!

801
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,890
I can't.

802
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:19,460
No!

803
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,350
No! Omo!

804
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,920
What is this? What's up with his vomit?

805
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,950
He finally threw it up.

806
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,050
Why did it stop, though?

807
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,410
What to do?

808
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,490
What is this?

809
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,530
Gi Bong, what's this?

810
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,440
What? Purple?

811
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,090
Take it.

812
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,650
What is this? Yellow? This is amazing!

813
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,160
What is this? My goodness.

814
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,930
Gosh.

815
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,670
Red!

816
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,470
What's next, let's see.

817
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,440
 Waikiki Guest House

818
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,020
Excuse me. Is there a Han Soo Yeon here?

819
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,220
What? That's me.

820
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,880
Hello. You wanted to buy Kim Kwang Seok's fourth album from me.

821
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,760
Oh, hello.

822
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,620
Can I see it first?

823
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,020
Here.

824
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,920
Let me take a look.

825
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,970
It's the real thing this time.

826
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,850
Here you go.

827
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,210
Thank you.

828
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,840
Then, goodbye.

829
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,630
Bye.

830
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,830
I finally got my hands on it.

831
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,800
I love Kim Kwang Seok's songs too.

832
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,950
Should I give it a listen?

833
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,950
What's going on?

834
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,710
What is this?

835
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,930
 Monk Kim Kwang Seok's...

836
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,980
"Monk Kim Kwang Seok's Reading of 'Heart Sutra', Fourth Edition"?

837
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,660
Darn it.

838
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,170
That jerk!

839
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,300
Excuse me!

840
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:38,980
Excuse me!

841
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,140
Gi Bong, let's call it a day today.

842
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,860
Already?

843
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,440
We have no customers anyway. What's the point of just staying here.

844
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,010
Let's go home.

845
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,690
Let's stay a little longer.

846
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,850
We can do this!

847
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,380
Gi Bong, I'm sorry.

848
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,640
You spent your last salary for the food truck.

849
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,660
This is so embarrassing.

850
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,450
It's fine. It's because we haven't promoted yet.

851
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,540
We'll do well after a bit. Let's do this!

852
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,770
I think I underestimated the work.

853
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,500
I'm not even surprised.

854
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,630
How can someone like me run a business?

855
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,970
Noona, let's give it one more try.

856
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:37,400
You worked so hard for this. You can't just give up this way.

857
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,710
But there's nothing I can do.

858
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:46,220
Noona, let's forget about spitting fire or rainbows.

859
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,560
Instead of those cheap tricks, we'll succeed with your food.

860
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,770
Your spaghetti is really delicious.

861
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,190
It's the best spaghetti I've ever tasted in my life.

862
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,600
Really?

863
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,580
Of course. So cheer up.

864
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,240
We'll try again, okay?

865
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,260
Nice!

866
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,600
- Fighting!
 - Let's go!

867
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,940
Let's go!

868
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,640
Hello, we're Yuri's Kitchen 31.

869
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,340
There's fun in choosing from 31 different types of spaghetti.

870
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,990
Feel free to try some.

871
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,360
All our recipes were personally developed by our amazing chef.

872
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,720
Every dish is prepared on the spot. Yuri's Kitchen 3.

873
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,740
Please try it.

874
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,550
Woo Sik. Wake up.

875
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,480
Wake up.

876
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,660
Hyung.

877
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,060
I guess I fell asleep. What is it?

878
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:38,790
Who is she?

879
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,950
Introduce yourself. She's a team leader in our company.

880
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:46,240
Hello. I'm Kim Su Jin, Head of Strategy at Flower Records.

881
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,640
Oh hello.

882
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,980
What brings you here?

883
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,100
I listened to your song and I loved it.

884
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,940
I'd love to officially work with you.

885
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,210
What? Do you mean you want to produce my album?

886
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,020
No, that's not it.

887
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,990
We're debuting a new singer soon at our company.

888
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,300
I wanted her to sing your song.

889
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,250
What? What do you mean?

890
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,950
You want me to sell my song?

891
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,330
Yes. We'll compensate you very well for your song.

892
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,950
Forget it. I'm not selling my song.

893
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,030
Hyung, I'm leaving.

894
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,290
Hey, wait.

895
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,290
What's with you? Why are you leaving in the middle of the conversation?

896
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,450
I have nothing more to say. I didn't make that song to sell it.

897
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,890
I made it to sing it myself.

898
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:37,230
I know, you punk. I know how you feel.

899
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,830
But Woo Sik, think about it realistically.

900
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:45,490
There's not a single company that wants to produce your album.

901
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,460
You know that too.

902
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,210
This kind of opportunity doesn't come along easily.

903
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,020
And if this goes well and your song becomes famous, it's a good thing for you.

904
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,960
Then one day, you might be able to release your own album.

905
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,190
Still, this is...

906
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,600
Then are you going to let that song go to waste? Are you just going to sing it by yourself in your room?

907
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,840
Don't you want people to hear it?

908
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:11,670
Get ahold of reality, you punk. Stop being stubborn.

909
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:15,270
Try some of our food.

910
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,300
We're Yuri's Kitchen 31.

911
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,550
- Try some of our food.
 - Please try some.

912
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,420
This is really yummy. Try some of our...

913
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,930
We have some really delicious spaghetti.

914
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,200
Yuri's Kitchen 31! Please try some of our food.

915
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,060
Please...

916
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,890
Gi Bong.

917
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,480
Let's stop now.

918
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,920
What are you saying? We should keep on trying until the end.

919
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,470
We've tried enough.

920
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,320
So let's call it a day.

921
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,680
Noona. Noona!

922
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,430
What is this?

923
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,630
What's wrong with this tire?

924
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,970
I think it's flat.

925
00:54:54,590 --> 00:55:00,220
Seriously, why is everything going so wrong? It's too much.

926
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,190
You can just change the tire. I'll do it in no time, so you should get some rest.

927
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,870
Okay?

928
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,530
 Yuri's Kitchen 31

929
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,050
This is so hard.

930
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,160
Why am I sweating so much?

931
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,440
What's the matter?

932
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,190
What? Well... What's the tastiest menu here?

933
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,630
What?

934
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,080
Everything is tasty. We have a variety of dishes.

935
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,690
Take a look at the menu. Okay.

936
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,030
What are you doing? We have customers.

937
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,860
I wonder why they came so suddenly. It's strange.

938
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,150
There's a reason for everything.

939
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:14,660
Why? Why are you laughing? You're scaring me.

940
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,620
♫  Looking the stars Looking the stars in the sky  ♫

941
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,840
Here is your Almond Vongole.

942
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,980
♫  Like my heart   ♫

943
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,970
♫  from looking at you all day long  ♫
	♫  It shines towards you  ♫

944
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:30,940
♫  Looking the stars  ♫

945
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,850
This is so tiring.

946
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,310
Why does she keep making me switch tires?

947
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,780
Right, she told me to drink water regularly.

948
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,040
 Yuri's Kitchen 31

949
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,260
Enjoy your meal.

950
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,900
You made the right choice.

951
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,300
How much do you have in your mind for your song?

952
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,040
You can take care of that.

953
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,450
Instead, I'd like to be in charge of producing my song.

954
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,220
We'd like that as well.

955
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,700
By the way, who is the new singer who'll be singing my song?

956
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,170
- Team Leader I'm here.
 - Hello.

957
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,170
Come here and say hi. He's the songwriter who has decided to give you a song.

958
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,990
- Hello.
 - Hello.

959
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
Teacher.

960
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,050
Min Ah. You're the one who's going to sing my song?

961
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,390
You two know each other?

962
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:29,730
Yes. I took vocal lessons from him before.

963
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,880
Teacher, it's been so long.

964
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,970
I know. It's been a while.

965
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:39,260
Guys! We're home.

966
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,230
What is this? Why are you so happy today?

967
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,160
We had an amazing day today. We sold everything we prepared.

968
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,080
- Really?
 - Yes.

969
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,740
This is all because of our cute Gi Bong.

970
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,020
Why because of him?

971
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,310
Mind your own business. You don't have to know.

972
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,880
So? How much did you make today?

973
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,610
Well, excluding the original cost, cost of ingredients,

974
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,420
cost for the free tasting event, and cost for gas,

975
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,950
I have $1 left.

976
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:10,530
What? Just $1?

977
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:16,000
Still, this is our first income. At least, we didn't lose money.

978
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,200
Gi Bong, should we throw a party to congratulate our successful day?

979
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,340
A party? Shall we?

980
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,620
- Let's go!
 - Okay.

981
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,590
Yes! It's time to party!

982
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,910
What kind of party are they going to throw with $1?

983
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,150
I went to all the used record stores and finally found this.

984
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,170
I'm so tired.

985
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,730
Still, I bet Woo Sik will be so happy when he sees this.

986
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,650
Thank you. Drive safely.

987
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,760
- Woo Sik—
- Teacher!

988
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,340
Then, will we be able to see each other more often?

989
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,620
Don't get too excited. You know I'm a picky teacher, right?

990
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,800
Of course, I do. You always gave me a hard time back then too.

991
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,620
I didn't give you a hard time. It was my affection for my pupil.

992
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,160
It's late, so go on home.

993
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,820
Already?

994
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,450
Why don't we go and get a cup of coffee?

995
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,830
Why do you mean coffee at this time of night?

996
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:13,220
Why? It's not even nine yet. Let's go.

997
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,790
Gi Bong, I'm really

998
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:38,060
going to try my best for Yuri's Kitchen 31.

999
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:44,150
I'm going to open up a franchise later on and even open restaurants overseas.

1000
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,760
Sure. I wish you good luck.

1001
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:53,630
So from now on, you have to work hard switching tires from now on, okay?

1002
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,160
I got it.

1003
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,140
I'll devote everything I've got to switching tires.

1004
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,750
Gi Bong, thank you.

1005
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,860
This is all thanks to you.

1006
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,310
If it weren't for you, I would've given up already.

1007
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:18,900
I'm really grateful to you.

1008
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,830
Why are you being so cheesy?

1009
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:27,310
Anyway, I'll keep supporting you as much as I can.

1010
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:30,460
So let's do this properly until the end. Okay?

1011
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,260
You can do it!

1012
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,250
Okay.

1013
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,970
I always thought you were just an immature little kid.

1014
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:43,650
When did you grow up so much? You even know how to console me now.

1015
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,630
You've grown up so much, Gi Bong.

1016
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:53,410
Who are you calling a little kid? I'm at least 30 cm taller than you.

1017
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:58,600
Even so, you'll always be a little kid to me.

1018
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,590
You're so cute.

1019
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,230
Gosh, stop it!

1020
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,930
My head.

1021
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,600
Where am I?

1022
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,890
There's no way my room would be this clean...

1023
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,090
What is this?

1024
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,560
Be quiet.

1025
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:59,470
Gi Bong,  be quiet and let me sleep.

1026
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:11,520

1027
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,660
♫  Hold my hand, follow me, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1028
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,900
♫  It makes me happy every day  ♫

1029
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,640
♫  Let's go, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1030
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,660
  - Preview -

1031
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,700
 What is this? Why are you here?

1032
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,850
 No way.

1033
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:31,090
 Noona, this looks bad. Who is that?

1034
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,130
 What do we do now?

1035
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,460
 This is insane.

1036
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,620
 Does Gi Bong like me?

1037
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,990
 Does Noona like me?

1038
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:40,060
 It's a supporting role. But I have so many lines and I love the character!

1039
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,480
 Do you think that Joon Ki will be okay?

1040
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,200
 He said he won't do it if we don't cast Joon Ki.

1041
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,980
 Those who pull strings to get a role are a problem.

1042
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,040
 Please, sir...

1043
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,870
♫  Let's enjoy it together as if we're crazy  ♫

1044
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:54,090
♫  It really must be heaven  ♫
