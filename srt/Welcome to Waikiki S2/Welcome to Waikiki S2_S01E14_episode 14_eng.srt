1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,700

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,010
Hey, Lee Joon Ki, get up.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,400
Why have you been like this the last couple of days?

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,770
Get up.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,640
Are you really going to quit acting?

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,090
Gosh, what's with you?

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,280
Joon Ki, get up!

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,580
Hey, Lee Joon Ki!

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,500
Eat slowly. You'll have indigestion.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,720
I want to eat slowly, but it's almost time to go film.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,220
What are you filming today?

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,010
I'm going to Gyeonggi-do Paju. There's a turtle that's faster than a rabbit.

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,110
What? A turtle's faster than a rabbit?

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,290
Yeah. It can do 100 meters in 20 seconds.

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,670
Twenty seconds?

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,110
So, the turtle's faster than me?

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,650
Yeah. Its name is Usain Turtle.

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,200
Wow, that's so cool.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,800
 Teacher, did you enjoy your breakfast?

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,680
I'll see you later at the studio!

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,110
Why is she texting so early in the morning?

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,370
Who? Mi Na?

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,880
Oh, your student?

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,220
I heard you're her first love.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,920
- It's not like that. 
 - What do you mean it's not?

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,860
You're her first love! I heard she said it herself.

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,290
I'm done. I'm going to go meet Usain Turtle.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,000
- Bye! 
 - Bye!

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,490
Hey. Why'd you say such pointless things with Soo Yeon there?

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,110
What?

31
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,230
Aren't you just friends with Soo Yeon now?

32
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,910
Yeah, but... Forget it!

33
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,490
Gosh, you're getting annoyed with me for nothing.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,820
Jeong Eun, how is Joon Ki?

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm not sure. He's not saying anything.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,490
What happened to him to be like that?

37
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,030
Why's he saying he's quitting acting?

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,420
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,130
Seeing how he is, I don't think it was something small.

40
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,680
Let's leave him alone for now.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,220
When I was kicked off the team, it hurt more when people tried to talk to me.

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,120
It's better to be alone then.

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,630
But, what if he really does quit acting?

44
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,060
I need to find out why he's like that and bring him to his senses.

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,890
You're up?

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,800
Yeah. I slept in.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,460
- You're going to wash up?  
 - Yeah.

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,210
Today's our date. You know, right?

49
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,670
Yeah. I know.

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,750
But, if we realize it won't work out after the date,

51
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,040
- we'll go back to how things were beforehand. 
 - Of course.

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright. See you later.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,020
Alright, yeah.

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,650
How awkward. I thought I couldn't breathe.

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,580
But, I don't know if this is a good idea.

56
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,620
  That role was supposed to be mine.

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,630
  I passed the audition! How could you fire me all of a sudden?

58
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,100
 I've been doing minor roles for over ten years.

59
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,040
  This was my last chance, so I practiced with all I had.

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,710
  Please give me another chance. Please, I ask of you.

61
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,890
  Please.

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,290
Joon Ki, get up. I said get up!

63
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,370
Leave me be.

64
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,730
Get up!

65
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,370
Get up! Are you not going to?

66
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,100
What? What is it?

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,540
Why are you like this? Tell me.

68
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,300
I told you I don't want to.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,050
Hey. You said I was your best friend.

70
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,170
Shouldn't best friends not have secrets between each other?

71
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,910
Don't you think so?

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,650
Alright. I'll tell you all of my secrets, so you do the same, too.

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,090
I'll go first.

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,120
Do you remember the Romeo &amp; Juliet performance we did when we were at school?

75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,490
What about it?

76
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,420
On the day of the performance, the loud "baak" noise during our kiss scene?

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,940
I said that was the sound from the audience, right?

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,440
- That was actually the sound of my fart. 
 - I know.

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,610
You know? How?

80
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,190
Farts don't just make a noise.

81
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,320
Alright, whatever. If you're going to be like this, leave.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,280
Okay.

83
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,160
I wasn't going to tell you this, but...

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
I'm truly the only one in the world that knows this. But I'll tell you.

85
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,630
What is it?

86
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,750
A while ago, do you remember how

87
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,820
a big deal was made over the erotic film playing on the counter?

88
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,370
- I was actually the one watching it. 
 - I know.

89
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,610
- You know that, too? 
 - I saw when I was trying to look at the CCTV footage to find the culprit.

90
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,930
You watched it for three hours. You were so focused.

91
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,950
No! I wasn't focused.

92
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,490
It was my first time seeing one, so I was just curious.

93
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,390
Okay, whatever. Just go.

94
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,880
Hey, what's with you?

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,970
- Just leave! 
 - What's with you?

96
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,430
Leave!

97
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,440
Lee Joon Ki!

98
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,210
Joon Ki, are you going to keep this up?

99
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,410
You have to forget what I told you, okay?

100
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,960
Forget that I watched that erotic film! Okay?!

101
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,600
- You watched an erotic film?
 - What?

102
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,330
What'd you watch?

103
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,260
What was the title?

104
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,210
Gosh, to think that I'm going on a date with Noona.

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,700
I'm so nervous.

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,570
Gi Bong!

107
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,010
Oh, you're here?

108
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,790
I'm sorry for being late.

109
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,710
It's okay. I just got here.

110
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,470
  It's so awkward.

111
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,340
 This is so cringy!

112
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,670
So, what should we do?

113
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm not sure. How about we ride bikes near the Han River?

114
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,630
I wore a dress.

115
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,160
Then, let's just walk near the Han River.

116
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,280
I wore heels.

117
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,350
Let's ride the boats then.

118
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,520
I get seasick.

119
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,130
Then, let's go to an arcade.

120
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,730
I don't like games.

121
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,230
Gosh, how do you keep picking just the things I hate?

122
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,570
Well, you can choose, then. We'll do what you want to do.

123
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,830
Then, should we watch a movie?

124
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,230
There's a fun rom-com that premiered recently.

125
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,150
I don't like those because they're too cheesy.

126
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,550
Oh, really? Should we just talk at a cafe?

127
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,240
Cafe? It's too loud. I don't like it.

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,390
- How about shopping? 
 - I hate shopping the most.

129
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,580
Then, what do we do? You hate everything!

130
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,460
You keep giving options I hate. What do I do about it?

131
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,690
Alright, whatever.

132
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,880
Let's just go wherever.

133
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,650
We'll spend all night just standing here.

134
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,980
  Gosh, we don't suit each other at all.

135
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,450
  We don't suit each other from the start.

136
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,140
Jeong Eun, you like erotic films?

137
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,770
For how long?

138
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,120
That was the first time I watched it.

139
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,130
I just pressed a button and it started playing.

140
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,760
How strange.

141
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,950
How could you press something and have something like that just play?

142
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,270
Stop it.

143
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,770
Alright. It was a joke.

144
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,000
But, why'd you suddenly tell Joon Ki you liked erotic films?

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,520
Just because. I thought that he'd tell me if I told him my secrets first.

146
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,180
Gosh, would he tell you?

147
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,130
You need to have him tell you naturally after drinking.

148
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,790
Drinking?

149
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,540
What's with the beer? You can't even drink that much.

150
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,490
Just because. We should drink as best friends.

151
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,960
No, no. Why would we drink during the day?

152
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,890
Hey. Don't you know that true drinking is day drinking?

153
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,610
Let's just drink and come clean about stuff that's been bothering us. About everything.

154
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,670
Here, here. Let's drink.

155
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,330
Cheers!

156
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,230
So, we came out. What do we do?

157
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,130
I don't know. You choose.

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,530
Forget it.

159
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,670
Let's just go eat something. I'm hungry.

160
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,730
Alright.

161
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,250
- What do you want to eat? 
 - Anything.

162
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,020
Then, let's have blood sausage stew. There's a good place nearby.

163
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,930
What? Why would we have that on a first date?

164
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,070
Is there nothing else?

165
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,990
Then, ox blood soup?

166
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,430
No.

167
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,550
Then cabbage stew? Dried pollack stew?

168
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,920
Oh, why do you keep suggesting stews?

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,890
Do you only know stew restaurants?

170
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,030
Well if you don't like them, then you choose.

171
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,100
Then... Let's have spaghetti.

172
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,220
What? We have spaghetti all the time. You want to eat it again?

173
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,650
And, if you're paying for that, you can get two bowls of blood sausage stew.

174
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,330
How about sushi?

175
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,720
That's too expensive and it's small portions.

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,270
That's two servings of blood sausage stew, and you can add the head meat.

177
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,050
- Then, steak? 
 - That's even more expensive with even smaller portions.

178
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,780
With that, you can have two servings of blood sausage stew, the head meat, and the rest of the sausage.

179
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,190
Hey. Do you only think of blood sausage stew?

180
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,130
Never mind. Let's just go to the food court and order separately.

181
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,600
Alright, then!

182
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,920
  We don't suit each other. How can we not suit each other this much?

183
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,570
  We don't suit each other. At all!

184
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,610
Okay!

185
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:42,050
I was going to take this to the grave, but I'll tell you this since it's you.

186
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,960
You don't have to!

187
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,180
No! I'm going to spill it all.

188
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,540
Why? Because we're best friends.

189
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,870
Best friends don't keep secrets from each other.

190
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,940
Alright, what is it? Tell me.

191
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,230
Joon Ki, honestly, I'm an erotic film maniac.

192
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,460
I've liked them since I was young. I have them on external hard drives.

193
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,410
Eight terabytes.

194
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,450
I'll let you borrow them in the future,

195
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,020
because we're best friends.

196
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,150
- Forget it. 
 - Hey!

197
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,820
I have nothing else to say. I spilled it all,

198
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,690
so you can talk now.

199
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,780
What happened?

200
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,050
I don't want to tell you, I said.

201
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,680
Alright. I wasn't even going to admit this after I died and went to Heaven, either,

202
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,630
but I'll tell you.

203
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,840
Instead, if I say this, you have to tell me, too.

204
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,390
You know, I actually...

205
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,410
  Gosh, he even had the blood sausage stew at the food court.

206
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,800
  Has a ghost who didn't get to eat blood sausage stew before dying possessed him?

207
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,300
  She even ate spaghetti there.

208
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,190
 Blood sausage stew is so delicious and nutritious. Why wouldn't she eat it?

209
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,870
So, what should we do now?

210
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,640
I'm not sure. How about we go there?

211
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,820
Alright, alright. We'll at least do that.

212
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,050
If we're going to go, she doesn't have to get all annoyed!

213
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Noona! The enemies are there! Where are you shooting?

214
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,620
You told me to take care of this side!

215
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Yeah, but, here!

216
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,710
We lost because of you.

217
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,760
I told you I'm bad at games!

218
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,680
And, so what, you're bad, too!

219
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,810
I'm good by myself!

220
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,100
Alright, yeah, you're so great!

221
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,160
Move! I can't throw the ball because of you!

222
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,550
What are you saying? You're the one rushing!

223
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,170
Forget it, forget it. We have no time, so just throw them.

224
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,260
Alright.

225
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,020
Are you okay?

226
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,260
You did that on purpose, right?

227
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,110
No, I didn't!

228
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,280
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt? Let me see.

229
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,010
Oh, blood!

230
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,960
Why would you lift your head so suddenly?

231
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,760
Who told you to stand there like that?

232
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,070
I got a nosebleed!

233
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,280
I have one, too!

234
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Gosh.

235
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,260
  We can't even play games together.

236
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,590
  Look at this mess.

237
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,870
So, what will we do now?

238
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,190
I don't know.

239
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm a bit hungry, so should we get food?

240
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,150
Alright.

241
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,070
Here you go.

242
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,340
Why would you put ketchup on it? I don't eat hot dogs with ketchup.

243
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,090
What? Why would you eat a hot dog without ketchup?

244
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,700
Do you eat hot dogs for the ketchup flavor, then?

245
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,360
Yeah!

246
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,580
Gosh. We don't even suit each other in this.

247
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,240
Gook Gi Bong. How do you eat sweet and sour pork, then?

248
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,660
Do you pour the sauce or dip it?

249
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,290
I pour it.

250
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,430
I dip it.

251
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,580
Then, how about black bean paste noodles or spicy seafood noodle soup?

252
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,520
- Spicy seafood noodle soup. 
 - Black bean paste noodles.

253
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,630
Cold buckwheat noodles or spicy buckwheat noodles?

254
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,850
- Cold buckwheat. 
 - Spicy buckwheat.

255
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,880
Spicy marinade chicken or fried chicken?

256
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,660
- Fried. 
 - Spicy.

257
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,550
Fish-shaped bun. Head or tail?

258
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,090
- Tail. 
 - Head.

259
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,590
Never mind, then. Forget it.

260
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,660
You and  I really don't suit each other.

261
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,450
Yeah. I didn't think it'd be this bad.

262
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,950
So, what do we do now?

263
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,210
Just go home?

264
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,020
Yeah.

265
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,910
Where are you going?

266
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,230
- We have to go this way for a taxi... 
 - We have to go this way for a bus...

267
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,090
Ow, my head.

268
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,440
What? Why am I sleeping here?

269
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,650
Woo Sik, what happened?

270
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,350
Oh, our maniac is up now?

271
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,000
What? Maniac?

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,370
You said that you're an erotic film maniac.

273
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,520
You said you even have an 8-terabyte external hard drive full of them.

274
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,500
What? How did you know?

275
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
You told me yourself earlier.

276
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,340
You said that you've liked erotic films since you were young.

277
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,420
You said you're a member of a club for people who love erotic films.

278
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,500
What? I told you that, too?

279
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,530
Yeah. So your nickname now is 8-tera. Kim Jung 8-Tera.

280
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,770
I must be insane.

281
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,960
But, is what you said earlier true?

282
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,560
What is it? What did I say?

283
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,020
You don't remember? You said you liked Joon Ki.

284
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,020
What?! Wait.

285
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,060
  I wasn't even going to tell this if I died and went to Heaven, but I'll tell you.

286
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:25,300
  Instead, if I say this, you have to tell me, too.

287
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,290
You know, I actually

288
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,800
liked you.

289
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,590
Wh-Wh-What?

290
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,870
I used to like you.

291
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:58,880
I thought of you as my friend, but from some point, I saw you as a man.

292
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,030
But, you didn't even know.

293
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,510
You mean jerk.

294
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,880
You jerk!

295
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,850
Gosh, how could I say that?

296
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,930
Woo Sik, this is a secret. Okay?

297
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,340
It's too late.

298
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,140
You were crying and making such a fuss, even the lady who works at the restaurant out there came.

299
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,120
- The whole neighborhood knows. 
 - What?

300
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,280
This is driving me nuts.

301
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,040
  What a waste of time. I should've slept in.

302
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,020
  Gosh, I should've gone out to the food truck. Why did I go on a date?

303
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,770
It's a figure machine!

304
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,130
Yes, yes!

305
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,430
What are you doing?

306
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,930
Hold on. Let me try this.

307
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,280
I've collected all the figurines, except for the Panda Panda one.

308
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,120
Please, let me have it.

309
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,190
Panda Panda!

310
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,290
Gosh, you're not even a kid. How childish.

311
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,260
Let's go!

312
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,430
What? Why's it not coming out?

313
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,620
What are you doing? Why are you sticking your hand up there?

314
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,450
Sir, I put coins in, but it's not coming out. It took my coins.

315
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,250
What are you saying? It's never done that before.

316
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,590
You didn't use fake coins or something and pretend like it's stuck now, are you?

317
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,990
No, no.

318
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,830
Then, do you have proof that you put coins in there?

319
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,520
Do you have proof?

320
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,590
You don't, right? Just go, then.

321
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,850
I really did, though. I put the coins in.

322
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,220
Noona, let's just go.

323
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,040
Go where?

324
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
Sir, I saw him put the coins in.

325
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,950
So, give him back his money.

326
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,730
How could I believe you? Do you have proof?

327
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,690
I have a lot of proof.

328
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,410
We can just check the dash cams from the nearby cars.

329
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,470
So, how will you take responsibility when you get proof?

330
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,740
What? You little youngster,

331
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,330
you're talking back to me? How rude!

332
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,660
We just want to determine what's right and wrong. Why would you bring up age?

333
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,700
Are you saying that people need to go through unfair things if they're young?

334
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,540
What?

335
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,330
  How cool.

336
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,030
Then, I'll call the police and have them check the security footage and the dash cams nearby.

337
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,760
 She's so mature.

338
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,020
If there's evidence, we'll sue you for taking our money and for defamation.

339
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,040
  She's so straightforward.

340
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,290
We're going to ask for compensation for the psychological attack as well.

341
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,490
  How charming.

342
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,590
So, should I call the police or not?

343
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,260
Okay, got it.

344
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll give it to you! Gosh. I'll just give it to you.

345
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,990
He should've done that from the beginning.

346
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,720
Here.

347
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
♫  All day today I only think of you  ♫

348
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,220
Why do you always let people take advantage of you?

349
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,460
That's why people look down on you.

350
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,700
What are you doing? Let's just go home.

351
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,540
Alright. Let's go.

352
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,560
♫  It's strange, when I look at you  ♫

353
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,700
♫  My heart melts silently  ♫

354
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,090
♫  Delight, I've fallen in   ♫

355
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,860
♫  a sweet kind of love  ♫

356
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,440
♫  All right, I know your heart too  ♫

357
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,430
- What are you staring at? 
 - Huh?

358
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,600
It's nothing at all.

359
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,460
My scarf!

360
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,430
That was my favorite scarf.

361
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,330
Really? Hold on, then.

362
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,120
What are you doing right now?

363
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,790
It's your favorite scarf.

364
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,070
Noona!

365
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,940
  How cool.

366
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,360
  He's so meticulous.

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,850
  So thoughtful.

368
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,620
♫  All right, I know your heart too  ♫

369
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,770
  How charming.

370
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,870
♫  I just like it   ♫

371
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,270
Here you go.

372
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,110
Thanks.

373
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,160
But, you're all wet. What do we do?

374
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
It's okay. I can just wash them.

375
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go.

376
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,050
Joon Ki, are you sleeping?

377
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh, Joon Ki, you know what I said earlier?

378
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,520
I meant I used to in the past.

379
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,370
Now I don't so don't feel pressured.

380
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,340
Got it?

381
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,830
Got it, so just leave. I'm tired.

382
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,280
Hey, I told you all of my secrets. You're still not telling me?

383
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,960
I told you to leave me alone.

384
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,890
Alright, let's stop this.

385
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,550
Let's stop being best friends and everything.

386
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,460
You're not even my friend now. Got it?

387
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,840
Let go!

388
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,330
Do you have to know?

389
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,040
Yes. I have to know.

390
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,320
Don't I have to know to help you?

391
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,260
If I tell you, you're not going to bother me again, okay?

392
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,660
Alright, so just tell me.

393
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,340
That movie that I got, that audition...

394
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,240
Yeah? What about it?

395
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,290
That actually

396
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,420
was because Hyeon Seong used his influence to have the director pick me.

397
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,630
Really?

398
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,640
But, there's nothing you can do about it. You didn't know.

399
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,080
I knew.

400
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,710
I knew, but since everyone else lived like that,

401
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,270
I decided I could too.

402
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,030
I wanted the opportunity that badly, so I pretended not to know.

403
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,240
But someone came.

404
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,010
Who?

405
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,260
The original actor who got picked for that role.

406
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:59,030
He was crying and said it was so unfair. He was clinging and asking why he didn't get the role.

407
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,420
It was like I used to be.

408
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,630
I suffered so much after Hyeon Seong stole my role.

409
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,790
I was giving that man the same scar.

410
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:17,850
I know better than anyone how painful and unfair that is.

411
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,440
But still, you don't have to quit acting.

412
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,620
That was just a mistake.

413
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,590
A mistake?  I can't forgive myself for it.

414
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,050
A guy like me has no right to act.

415
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,320
Got it? So, leave now.

416
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,520
I'm tired.

417
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,410
  Then, is this how things are ending with Noona?

418
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,930
  But, Noona must think we don't suit each other at all.

419
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,270
  Is this it for me and Gi Bong?

420
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,800
  Gi Bong probably thinks we don't suit each other at all.

421
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,040
The breeze is nice, right?

422
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,750
Yeah.

423
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,800
I like walking in the night breeze.

424
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,650
Really? At least there's something we both like.

425
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,410
Yeah.

426
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,770
Oh, you know,

427
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,760
I only like nice breezes like this. I don't like the cold, strong wind.

428
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,280
What about you?

429
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,800
What? Well, I don't like that, either.

430
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,690
Really? Then, there's something else we both agree on.

431
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,990
How about hot things? I hate really hot, humid weather, like 40º C.

432
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,960
- What about you? 
 - Me, too.

433
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,600
Then, Gi Bong, I hate really cold weather that gets near  -30º C. What about you?

434
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,190
Wow! I hate cold weather too!

435
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,930
Well, Noona, do you get hungry, too, if you don't eat for two days?

436
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,080
Of course! You, too?

437
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,140
Wow, I got chills!

438
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,490
Wow, I thought you and I really didn't suit each other,

439
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,990
- but we have a lot of things in common. 
 - Yeah.

440
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:21,590
Noona. Should we see each other for a bit longer, then?

441
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,080
Maybe one more week.

442
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,040
Should we?

443
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,600
But will one week be enough?

444
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,250
Don't we need to date for about a month

445
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,260
for us to know if we suit each other or not?

446
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,390
Yeah, I suppose.

447
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,950
Then, today's the first day of our relationship?

448
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,750
I think so.

449
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,770
Then, we're dating now,

450
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,800
so can we hold hands?

451
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,990
I'm not sure. I think so.

452

  Guest House Waikiki

462
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,630
Did you sleep well, Noona?

463
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,210
Yeah. You, too?

464
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,110
Gosh, how could we run into each other now? I didn't even wash my face. How embarrassing.

465
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,420
You're still pretty.

466
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,400
Huh?

467
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,720
Noona, you're still pretty even if you don't wash your face.

468
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,400
What? You're being so cheesy.

469
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,460
You're pretty so I'm saying you're pretty. What about it?

470
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,130
Stop it, you're so crazy!

471
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,450
I'm crazy.

472
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,390
About you.

473
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,040
Stop it!

474
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,480
It was a joke. Stop hitting me!

475
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,640
Move!

476
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,530
What's with her?

477
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,410
I don't know. Why's she like that so early in the morning?

478
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,950
Hey, Joon Ki, wake up.

479
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,330
What again? You said you wouldn't bother me.

480
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,490
We have to somewhere to go. Get up!

481
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,160
Go where? I'm tired, so just leave.

482
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,890
Just get up!

483
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,090
Alright, just stay there.

484
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,710
Why are you being like this? Leave me be!

485
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,820
Follow me. Come.

486
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,390
 Sunlight Theater

487
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,020
Hurry up!

488
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,470
Gosh, what is this?

489
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,710
Just follow me.

490
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,220
What is it?

491
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,490
What?

492
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,620
Joon Ki.

493
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:18,390
Before you think about forgiving yourself, shouldn't you ask for forgiveness from him?

494
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,990
I think that's the right thing to do.

495
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,020
I'll be waiting outside.

496
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,560
Jeong Eun, hey.

497
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,390
Excuse me.

498
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,730
Who are you?

499
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,160
Hello. I'm Lee Joon Ki.

500
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,900
Yes, what is the matter?

501
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,910
Well, actually...

502
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,420
So, that's what happened.

503
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,300
I'm really sorry.

504
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,500
It's late, but I wanted to tell you honestly and ask for forgiveness.

505
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,320
It really does make me mad,

506
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,490
but I don't know if I have the right to forgive you.

507
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,860
What? What do you mean?

508
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:24,430
If something like that happened to me, would I have been able to refuse?

509
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,470
Honestly, I can't confidently say that I would have.

510
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,330
I'm still sorry. Please forgive me.

511
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,830
If you want forgiveness, I forgive you.

512
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:42,720
But, I can't forgive the fact that you'll quit acting over something like this.

513
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,560
What?

514
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,050
Joon Ki, we aren't people who act to become top stars.

515
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,020
We act because we like it and love it. Isn't that why we do it?

516
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:59,700
But, quitting acting over something like that is too harsh.

517
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,430
Or, do you not love acting as much as I do?

518
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,430
No, I love acting.

519
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,320
I really love acting.

520
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,570
Then, I'll forgive you. Instead, I have a request.

521
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,950
A request?

522
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,350
Joon Ki, how did it go?

523
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,550
I told him honestly, and he forgave me.

524
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,630
Really? That's a relief.

525
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,240
What will you do now? Are you going to quit acting?

526
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,730
I was going to quit, but the circumstances are a bit ambiguous now.

527
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,960
- What? 
 - He forgave me, but on the condition that I do a play with him.

528
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,570
There's going to be performances soon, but one of the actors backed out.

529
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,040
So? You're doing to do it?

530
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,110
I have no choice. He'll only forgive me that way.

531
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,410
So with the mindset of finding my roots, I'm going to go for it.

532
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,280
I feel like I'd forgotten about the mindset I had in the beginning.

533
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:08,720
I only sought after becoming a star. I feel like I forgot about the important things.

534
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,470
We had so much fun making the stages ourselves and acting without any audiences in school.

535
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,890
Just like that.

536
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm going to start again.

537
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,960
That's a good idea.

538
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,200
Thanks. It's all thanks to you.

539
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,050
It's great having a best friend to support you.

540
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,460
Right? So, do well.

541
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,040
Alright.

542
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,050
Let's go, friend. I'll buy us spicy rice cakes!

543
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,820
Alright!

544
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,160
Oh, right. I have something to ask you.

545
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,880
You know, what did you like about me?

546
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,920
What?

547
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,380
You said you liked me. What exactly did you like?!

548
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,310
It was a long time ago. Not now.

549
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,060
Then, did you get nervous and blush whenever you saw me?

550
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,140
- Stop it! 
 - Why?

551
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,260
Did you get embarrassed when you thought about it? Did your heart pound like this?

552
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,130
Come here. You're dead.

553
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,790
I want to know what it was!

554
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,060
Pound, pound!

555
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,330
Gong Goo Ri, what kind of person are you to me?

556
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,830
I am just a lowly entertainer.

557
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,970
No! You are my friend.

558
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,280
You are my male friend. So, that's "ma'friend" for short, right?

559
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,790
No, how could a person like me..?

560
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,080
None of that talk. Let's see your act.

561
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,920
Night Palace, east palace, Yihwa palace...

563
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,660
Hold on, Joon Ki.

564
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,940
What is it, Sunbae?

565
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,120
Your dance is a bit unnatural.

566
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,140
Well, I've had a personal situation, so I haven't been able to practice.

567
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,800
I apologize.

568
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,860
Oh, it's okay. We have a lot of time left until the performance, so you can take your time practicing.

569
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,450
Alright, let's end practice here. Should we go for a drink?

570
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,490
Drink?

571
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,830
But I quit drinking lately.

572
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,330
Really? Why?

573
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,970
Why?

574
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,560
To focus on acting.

575
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,190
Oh, well, that can't be helped. I'll see you tomorrow.

576
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,350
Al-alright, goodbye.

577
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,760
I can't hold out any longer.

578
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,770
What do I do?

579
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:46,420
  A Scar Deeper Than Love

580
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,920
Your hemorrhoids have resurfaced.

581
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,970
What did you do for it to end up like this?

582
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:03,930
Well,  things have been a bit difficult lately so I've been drinking quite a bit.

583
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,400
Doctor, is it that serious?

584
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,980
It's not just serious.

585
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,360
If you keep on like this, we'll have to put in an artificial anus.

586
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,630
Artificial anus?

587
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,500
Doctor, what do I do, then?

588
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,550
I'll prescribe ointment, so you shouldn't walk. Apply the ointment regularly.

589
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,480
You have to put your buttocks in warm water three times a day. Don't forget it.

590
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,780
Got it?

591
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,940
Yes, I got it.

592
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,440
I'll have some water.

593
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,210
She must be so tired.

594
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,590
What if she gets a cold?

595
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
- Woo Sik. 
 - Hey.

596
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,620
You're awake? I just came for water.

597
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,250
Got it.

598
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,020
But, how did this get on me?

599
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,440
I was worried that you'd get a cold.

600
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,260
Thanks.

601
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,960
Oh, it's nothing big.

602
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,930
If you're tired, just go sleep in your room. Why are you sleeping here?

603
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,490
I want to, but there's a lot to do in preparation for filming.

604
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,890
I'll have to drink a cup of coffee. This won't do.

605
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,000
Coffee? I'll make some. Just rest.

606
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,780
No, I can do it.

607
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,800
No, it's fine. I wanted to drink some too anyway.

608
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,790
Hold on.

609
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,090
- Be careful! 
- Yeah.

610
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,730
Gosh, so heavy.

611
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,180
I said I'd move it.

612
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,770
It's fine. It's hard on you if you carry everything.

613
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,180
You worked hard today, Gi Bong.

614
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,430
I did nothing. You worked harder trying to cook all day.

615
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,480
Look at you talking so nicely like that.

616
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Ah, whatever.

617
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,490
Hold on.

618
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,910
What is it?

619
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,620
You're sweating.

620
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,190
I have sweat here.

621
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,620
Here, too.

622
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,510
What are you doing?

623
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,700
What are you two doing?

624
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,450
So dirty. How can you sweat so much? You smell.

625
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,120
Just clean up all of this, okay?

626
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,320
Alright, Noona.

627
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,640
Gosh, why is she so mean when you're working so hard?

628
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,460
Gosh, Noona has such a terrible personality.

629
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,930
Gi Bong, don't work with her.

630
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,990
No, it's fine.

631
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,990
Gosh, you're so nice.

632
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,840
Ow!

633
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,420
I'm here.

634
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,300
You're here now? You're late.

635
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,590
Rehearsal ended late.

636
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,500
But, why do you look so unhappy?

637
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,860
Just, acting isn't going the way I want.

638
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,020
I'll be going in.

639
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,190
What the heck? He's still unhappy?

640
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,510
No.

641
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,850
Jeong Eun said he was fine now. That's weird.

642
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,340
My butt! My butt!

643
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,670
Let's just put the ointment on.

644
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,750
  Hemorrhoid Ointment

645
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,570
Wait.

646
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,660
Gosh, if it's back, they're going to tease me so much.

647
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,630
What do I do?

648
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,920
Let's lock the door first.

649
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,570
  Waikiki

650
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,380
  What? What's this noise?

651
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,700
  What? Is he crying?

652
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,760
  Why is he like that?

653
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,040
  It hurts.

654
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,350
  My butt hurts so much that I can't sleep.

655
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,330
  What if I really need an artificial anus?

656
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,200
  I can't.

657
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,940
What? Joon Ki woke up in the middle of the night and was crying?

658
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,980
Yeah, he was. He seemed so upset, so I didn't even talk to him.

659
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,370
No, Joon Ki's better now.

660
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,430
Did something else happen?

661
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,200
Maybe it's because of acting.

662
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,760
Joon Ki said yesterday that acting wasn't going well.

663
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,090
That's true.

664
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,500
Maybe he's going through a hard time because he's working hard but it's not turning out the way he wants.

665
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,550
Then, maybe he's depressed?

666
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,490
What? Depressed?

667
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,280
But, I don't think Joon Ki would have depression.

668
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,050
You don't know that. Depression can affect bright, cheerful people, too.

669
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,690
And it's a mental illness so people can't really tell just by looking.

670
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,730
Depression is such a scary thing. This is not good.

671
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,880
You're up now? Did you eat?

672
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,180
No, I don't want to eat.

673
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,630
I'm just going to have a glass of water.

674
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,780
What do we do? He doesn't even want to eat.

675
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,520
Maybe he really has depression.

676
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,020
Hello!

677
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,000
Why are you here so early?

678
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,660
Well, I was practicing the song, but there's a part of it that I'm having trouble with.

679
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,370
Can you help?

680
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,330
Yeah, sure. Follow me.

681
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,640
Gi Bong, don't you think Mi Na still likes Woo Sik?

682
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,530
What are you saying all of a sudden?

683
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,140
She keeps making excuses to come here.

684
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,230
And the way she looks at Woo Sik is a bit weird.

685
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,990
Don't you think so, Soo Yeon?

686
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,060
What? I don't know.

687
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,340
I don't really know. I'm going to go rest in my room.

688
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,990
Why's she like that all of a sudden?

689
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,920
How suspicious.

690
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
What about Soo Yeon?

691
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,050
It feels like Soo Yeon didn't feel so good right after Mi Na came.

692
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,300
Maybe she's concerned about Woo Sik being with Mi Na?

693
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,530
What are you saying?

694
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,720
Soo Yeon doesn't like Woo Sik. Why would she be concerned?

695
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,630
Is that so?

696
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,300
Gosh, how long do I have to only drink water like this?

697
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:23,730
But if I eat food, I'm scared that it'll hurt like hell when I do my business.

698
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,740
I'll just put the ointment on.

699
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,270
I need to close the curtains.

700
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,340
No one can see.

701
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,470
Why won't it work?

702
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,030
It's stuck here.

703
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,760
What do I do?

704
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,020
Gi Bong!

705
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,050
What's this noise?

706
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,260
It's Joon Ki's voice. Let's go.

707
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,660
Why is it locked?

708
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,460
Gi Bong! Save me!

709
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,670
Gi Bong, save me!

710
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,580
Joon Ki! What's wrong?

711
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,250
Lee Joon Ki, open up!

712
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,260
I...

713
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,550
This won't do. Gi Bong, just break in!

714
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,060
Okay!

715
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,820
Joon Ki!

716
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,540
Gosh!

717
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,960
Joon Ki, what were you doing? Are you nuts?

718
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,660
What?

719
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,360
You said you were okay! You said you'd come to your senses!

720
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,880
What is this? Huh?

721
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,090
What are you saying? It's not like that.

722
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,870
What do you mean? How could you do this?

723
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,860
Do what?

724
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,170
What are you thinking?!

725
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,130
Hey, I wasn't doing that. I was trying to close the curtains and it got caught around my neck.

726
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,940
But, why would you lock the door?

727
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:15,440
That, well, I had my reasons.

728
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,640
What reasons? Tell me.

729
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,550
Well, uh.

730
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,650
Why can't you say it? Why?

731
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,420
It's not like that!

732
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,760
What? Joon Ki? Really?

733
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,720
Yeah.

734
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,490
He was doing better, but I wonder why he did that.

735
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,730
What made him so sad and frustrated?

736
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:44,980
Still, Gi Bong said he won't let Joon Ki out of his sight.

737
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,260
Don't worry.

738
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,610
Excuse me. I want to make coffee for the teacher. Where is it?

739
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,000
Ah, coffee? I'll make it for you. Hold on.

740
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,370
Oh, no, I can do it.

741
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,340
You're still a guest. I can't have you do that.

742
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,400
We have citrus tea that's good for your throat. Would you like that?

743
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,760
Yes, thank you.

744
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,990
Hold on.

745
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,640
Why won't this open?

746
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,550
I think the jar is stuck.

747
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,920
Should I try?

748
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,190
No, it's okay.

749
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,890
Mi Na, I'm so sorry.

750
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,880
Soo Yeon!

751
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,960
The lid opened so suddenly.

752
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,110
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

753
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,500
It's fine. I'm fine.

754
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,540
You must've been startled. Are you okay?

755
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,880
You should hurry and ice it.

756
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,390
Yes.

757
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,570
I'm sorry!

758
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,980
How could I make such a mistake?

759
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,440
But was it really a mistake?

760
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,230
What are you saying?

761
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,790
I mean, it's just weird that the lid opened like that.

762
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:09,290
What? Then, you're saying I did it on purpose?

763
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,100
Why would I?

764
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,140
I don't know.

765
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,390
It was really a mistake.

766
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,150
Why would you say something like that?

767
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,580
I mean, it's just suspicious that it was a coincidence.

768
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,880
- Don't you think so? 
 - Shush.

769
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,530
What nonsense.

770
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:34,100
No, it's not. It's suspicious.

771
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,980
This is driving me nuts. I have to put on the ointment. Why is he sticking so close to me?

772
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:52,260
Why are you being like this? That was all a misunderstanding!

773
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,000
So, tell me the reason. I'll go if you do.

774
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,290
So, basically...

775
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,620
  Do I just tell him?

776
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,060
  He's going to tease me so much. It's obvious.

777
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,230
  I got teased so much last time I thought I'd die.

778
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,260
  Yeah. It's better to get an artificial anus.

779
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,500
  I'll never tell them. Never!

780
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,060
What is it? Tell me.

781
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,390
Forget it. Do whatever you want.

782
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,700
Aren't you working today?

783
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,620
Is that the problem?

784
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,850
We decided not to work today because of you. Don't worry about it.

785
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,700
This is driving me nuts.

786
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,300
- Where are you going? 
 - What will you do if you know?

787
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,130
Let's go together.

788
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,680
What are you doing?

789
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,060
What? Just go and do your business.

790
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,570
How can I do it when you're here?

791
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,300
We're friends. What about it? We've seen each other naked.

792
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,530
Just do your business comfortably.

793
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,580
- Do you really have to go this far? 
 - Yes.

794
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,520
I'm going to stick by your side all day. Keep that in mind.

795
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,920
This is driving me nuts.

796
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,020
Get out.

797
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,160
Where are you going? Let's go.

798
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,960
I wonder if Joon Ki's okay.

799
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,390
He has a reliable Gi Bong next to him. Don't worry.

800
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,730
That's why I'm worried. He's a bit dumb.

801
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,390
Is being dumb a crime? He's kind, though!

802
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:25,690
He's loyal and responsible. How smart are you to be making fun of him?

803
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,450
No, I didn't mean it like that. Why are you getting mad?

804
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:34,690
What? Mad? No, I wasn't.

805
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,120
But, what is that?

806
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,690
Oh, this? If your back and shoulders are stiff, it gets better if you stretch with this.

807
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,220
Oh, really? My back has been stiff lately.

808
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,920
Can I try that once?

809
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,430
Yeah! Here. Try it.

810
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,790
It's great!

811
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,650
Right, right? Put more strength into it.

812
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,090
- Pull it. 
 - Alright.

813
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,330
It feels great!

814
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,450
Unni, do you have a phone charger that--?

815
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,450
Mi Na! When did you get there? Are you okay?

816
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,020
Soo Yeon!

817
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,390
I let go of the band by accident.

818
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,840
But, still. With that timing?

819
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,280
It's really an accident. I mean it.

820
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,820
I'm so sorry, Mi Na.

821
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,640
It's fine. I'm okay.

822
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,050
Oh, what do I do?

823
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,600
Mi Na, follow me. I'll help you ice it.

824
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,950
No, it's okay.

825
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,670
I'm so sorry. Let's go.

826
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,700
What do I do? I'm so sorry.

827
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,510
Unni, it's still not suspicious?

828
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:52,670
How can she slap her not once, but twice?

829
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,770
No way.

831
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,760
  Gosh.

832
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,860
  He tied my feet.

833
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,770
  I can't even apply ointment or have a warm bath because of them.

834
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,230
  Gosh, what if I really need an artificial anus?

835
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,620
  He seems sound asleep. Should I free myself and go?

836
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,000
  But, why won't it untie?

837
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,430
  He tied it so tightly.

838
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,720
  Gosh!

839
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,020
I need to give my butt a warm bath quickly before they

840
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,170
wake up. I'll go back as if nothing happened.

841
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,060
Okay.

842
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,550
It's great. So nice.

843
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,290
It's perfect.

844
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,360
Let's hurry.

845
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,690
Where did he go?

846
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,150
Woo Sik, get up.

847
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,900
What? What happened?

848
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,300
Joon Ki disappeared.

849
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,350
What? Really?

850
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,280
This guy. No way. Let's go find him.

851
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,030
Alright.

852
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,490
What happened? Isn't that Joon Ki's voice?

853
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,760
I think so.

854
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,790
Joon Ki, what are you doing in there?

855
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:59,940
They should just go to sleep, why'd they wake up?

856
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,100
What are you doing in there?

857
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,430
I'm using the bathroom! Doing my business! What else?

858
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,940
Then what was that moaning? Why were you moaning?

859
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,660
Open the door! Or, we'll break the door and go in!

860
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,040
- It's not like that! 
 - What do you mean?

861
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,700
Gi Bong, this won't do. Just break it.

862
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,620
- Break it. 
 - No! NO!

863
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,010
No!

864
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,150
What are you doing?!

865
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,200
Why wouldn't you open the door?

866
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,150
What is this? Why are you standing when you said you were doing your business?

867
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,970
Oh, I finished. I was just about to leave.

868
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:38,620
Hold on. What's that? What is that water bowl?

869
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,340
Just... I was going to wash my face since I was in the bathroom.

870
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,900
Really? Why are you washing your face there and not in the sink?

871
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,250
Just because. My mom used to make me wash my face there when I was young.

872
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,150
Really? Keep washing then.

873
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,910
We'll watch.

874
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,700
Alright.

875
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,500
Why are you throwing away perfectly good water?

876
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,450
Just because it's cold now.

877
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,590
I want warm water.

878
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,380
How can you throw that away? What a waste. I'll use it.

879
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,440
I'm awake because of you. I'll wash my face now.

880
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,230
Do you really have to use this water? It's cold now.

881
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,190
It's okay. I like lukewarm water.

882
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,410
Let's wash my face.

883
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,230
Hold on! You can't use this water!

884
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,640
It's fine!

885
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,760
Hey, no! No! Stop! You can't use this water to wash your face!

886
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,500
What's wrong? What's wrong with this water?

887
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,410
What are you doing?

888
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,090
Hold on. I'm going to use it.

889
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,120
No! No! Stop!

890
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,660
It's nice.

891
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,320
What? Hemorrhoids?

892
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,130
So, it's not what we were thinking, but you locked the door

893
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:58,090
and closed the curtains, which caught on your neck, because you were putting ointment on?

894
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,690
No wonder. You kept farting so much. Of course, your butt wasn't okay.

895
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:08,990
- Hold on. That water earlier was what you used to bathe your butt, then? 
 - Yeah.

896
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,990
What are you saying?

897
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,060
So.

898
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,970
What? Then, that water touched Yoon Ki's butt?

899
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,660
You should've said so earlier!

900
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,430
So dirty! Ew!

901
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:33,400
I'm sorry. I thought you guys would tease me if you knew. I couldn't tell the truth.

902
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,290
This is a secret to the girls, okay?

903
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:41,300
Whatever! I have to go wash my hands.

904
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,460
I'm sorry.

905
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,860
- Woo Sik. 
 - Yeah?

906
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,700
- I have a request. 
 - Okay, what is it?

907
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,230
Can you put the ointment on me just once?

908
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,180
It's so hard.

911
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,100
Huh? Well... It was a misunderstanding.

912
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,980
Joon Ki's fine now. Don't worry.

913

Really? That's a relief.

914
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,700
What was wrong with him?

915
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,590
Huh? It wasn't anything much, so don't worry.

916
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,530
Gi Bong, we're done eating. Let's go to work.

Okay. You can go there first. I'll move the things.

918
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,520
No! I'll help you.

919
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,530
It's hard on you.

920
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,060
No! I'm strong.

921
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,430
I'm stronger.

No.

What are you two doing?

924
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,330
You're both so sweet to each other.

925
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:41,800
Yeah. You two have been suspicious since yesterday.

926
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,190
Hey, no!

927
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,290
Gook Gi Bong! Come out with the tubs, okay?

928
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,330
Yeah, got it.

929
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,090
Gosh.

930
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,730
We'll be off then.

931
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,590
Let's go.

932
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,730
Goodbye!

933
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:05,360
Something has changed between them.

00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,780
I know.

935
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,400
I don't see Woo Sik though.

Oh, really?

938
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,680
Why? Does it concern you?

939
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,380
No! Why do you keep saying that?

940
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,160
I was just asking.

941
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,950
I'm going to Joon Ki.

942
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:38,100
Why does she keep saying that?

943
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,620
Soo Yeon is a bit feistier than I thought.

944
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,840
I wonder if Joon Ki's really okay.

945
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,360
You scared me!

946
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,520
What? You scared me.

947
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,300
I'm sorry.

948
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,530
But, are those tears in your eyes?

949
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,920
Huh? No. I yawned.

950
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,150
Really? I think you need to eat now.

951
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,170
Do you want me to buy you porridge?

952
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,370
No, it's okay. I don't have an appetite.

953
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,330
What? He hasn't improved at all.

Today, in Yanggu of Gangwon Province, there's a cow that uses its tail as a brush to write calligraphy.

00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:37,390
Should we go meet Nu Rong, the best calligrapher among animals?

What is this smell?

959
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,830
Oh, right. I was cooking stew on the stove!

960
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,060
What do I do?

961
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,650
So hot.

962
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:02,010
It's all burned. What do I do about this smoke?

963
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,810
Oh, what do I do?

964
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,660
This is driving me nuts.

965
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,220
Mi Na, why are you there?

00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,130
What is this?

967
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,590
What happened? What's this smoke?

968
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,290
Yeah.

969
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,300
Mi Na, what's wrong?

970
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,690
Well, Unni slapped me again.

971
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:27,960
What? Soo Yeon slapped your cheek again?

972
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,620
What's going on, Soo Yeon?

973
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,070
No, no. I was trying to use my hand like a fan to get rid of the smoke.

974
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,350
But, Mi Na appeared out of nowhere...

975
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:40,670
So, you hit Mi Na at that moment?

976
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,550
Yeah.

977
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:47,300
I'm sorry, Mi Na. It was really an accident.

978
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:55,150
I'm serious, Jeong Eun! Really, Woo Sik!

979
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,320
It was really an accident.

980
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,670
My butt. Ow.

981
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:12,060
The performance is soon. I have to practice.

982
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,350
Let's wrap this around and practice.

983
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,830
Night palace, east palace...

984
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,500
What is this?

985
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,190
What? Gosh.

986
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,150
Why did it get caught? What?

987
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,990
How did it get caught?

988
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,560
Gosh, I need to get it off.

989
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,330
Joon Ki, I  bought some porridge...

990
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:56,030
Joon Ki! No!

991
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,890
Ow.

992
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,710
Joon Ki, I'm sorry. Does it hurt a lot?

993
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:17,260
How could it not hurt? I fell down right on the corner!

994
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,060
It's your fault! Ow! My butt!

995
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:23,060
No, I was just worried about you.

996
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,230
I thought you were going to die.

997
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,440
Why would I die? What?

998
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,930
Are you crying?

999
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,920
Don't cry! You get uglier when you cry!

1000
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,100
Shut up!

1001
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,520
Were you that worried about me?

1002
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,820
Yes, you jerk!

1003
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,100
It's nice that someone worries about me like that.

1004
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:53,650
Jeong Eun. If I need an artificial anus,

1005
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,160
you'll need to take responsibility for me all your life.

1006
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,330
- Got it? 
 - What?

1007
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,100
- Ow! Ow! 
 - I'm sorry.

1008
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,360
I really wasn't doing it on purpose.

1009
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,670
How unfair. Why would I hit her on purpose?

1010
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,610
So, they think I'm jealous because they think I like Woo Sik?

1011
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,420
No way.

1012
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:28,530
Here, you hold back your emotions here,

1013
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:31,500
then if you let it all out here it'll sound a lot better.

1014
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,400
Got it?

1015
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,550
I know that, but it won't work out like I want it to.

1016
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,670
- But, Teacher. 
 - What?

1017
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,830
Do you know that you look really cool when you're working?

1018
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,360
What? What are you saying?

1019
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,030
I'm always cool.

1020
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,890
Wow, you're still overconfident as always.

1021
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:52,200
Hey, it was a joke.

1022

What? Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

1027
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,400
Don't you see? I'm cleaning.

1028
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,730
I cleaned here earlier.

1029
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,670
What are you saying? It's so dusty.

1030
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,660
Cha Woo Sik, lift your legs.

♫  My unmoving heart, in one moment  ♫

Mi Na, you, too.

♫  Something I've never felt before  ♫

1034

This house is so full of dust.

1035

I can't live with it! Really!

1036

♫  It feels like I'm getting smaller  ♫

1037
