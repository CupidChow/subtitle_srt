1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,760
What's wrong, Director? Is there a problem?

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,910
It's just that you're dressed

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,800
- too neatly for beggars.
 - What?

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,730
But I tried dressing as poorly as I could.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,200
But it's still lacking something.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,920
Right, where's Beggar #3?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,650
Beggar #3?

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm here.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm sorry I'm late. It took some time finishing my makeup.

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,420
You did your own makeup?

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,100
Yes. Does it look weird?

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,010
No, not at all. You look like a real beggar.

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,100
What's with the baby carriage?

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,310
Oh, I noticed beggars push around baby carriages often.

15
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,200
They put wastepaper or scraps inside them. I found out while doing some research.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,700
You even did research?! Gosh, she is really impressive.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,110
What's wrong with you two? Shouldn't actors do at least this much?

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,940
- I'm sorry, sir.
 - Forget it!

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,400
Wow, I really like her.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
You're like a real beggar. How could you look so shabby?

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,820
You're a true beggar indeed. Gosh, I love it.

22
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,300
 Our Twisted Hero

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm singer Cha Woo Sik.

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
Woo Sik, drink this.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,530
I really liked your song.

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,660
Thank you. How's the job?

27
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,700
It's fun. Thank you for introducing me to this job.

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,860
No problem. It's nothing to be thankful about.

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,920
Soo Yeon, I'm sorry. But, can you go and clean up that table?

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,990
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,300
She replies so confidently.

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,630
I know. Our Soo Yeon always replies so refreshingly,

33
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,890
and she's so diligent, thorough and a perfectionist—

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,620
You said she's a perfectionist.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,610
I meant she wants to become a perfectionist.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
The weather's gotten a lot nicer.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,570
It must really be spring now, right?

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,280
Hm. It is.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,230
But why do you sound so discouraged? Why? Because you broke those cups earlier?

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,800
Besides that, I kept making mistakes all day long.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,080
Woo Sik, what is the matter with me?

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,400
I really wanted to do a good job this time.

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,430
It's okay. You can do better from tomorrow. Don't worry about it.

44
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,820
Okay, then

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,040
Hey, cheer up.

46
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,940
- Hey, it's sweet pancakes. Soo Yeon, do you want some?
 - Huh?

47
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,380
Sweet pancakes? I love sweet pancakes. Let's go, Woo Sik.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,510
- Hello.
 - Welcome.

49
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,300
Ma'am, we'll have two, please.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,580
Woo Sik, let's buy three. I'll have two.

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,100
Aigoo, your girlfriend must really like sweet pancakes.

52
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,260
Girlfriend? Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,200
Really? You look great together so I thought you were a couple.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,550
A couple? Ma'am, you're so silly.

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,020
How could you be so mistaken like that? I've changed my mind. Give me all the sweet pancakes you have here.

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,950
Hey,

57
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,030
how long have you been staring at photos of beggars?

58
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,300
I'm researching. I have to concentrate so don't disturb me.

59
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,790
Hey, everybody!

60
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,430
You're here?

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,070
Do you want to eat sweet pancakes?

62
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,340
What’s this? What're all those sweet pancakes for?

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,200
What's this? Is this all sweet pancakes?

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,240
Yes. The owner of the hotteok (sweet pancake) place was very kind. I felt grateful and bought everything.

65
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,400
Why are you so excited? Did something good happen to you?

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,300
It was his first day going to work with Soo Yeon.

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,680
No wonder you're so excited. Do you like Soo Yeon that much?

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Of course, I do. But how do you know that?

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,700
- Joon Ki told me all about it.
 - What?

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,180
Hey, I told you to keep it a secret.

71
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,100
Don't worry. I won't tell anybody.

72
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,730
Anyway, do you feel happy really happy to hang out with Soo Yeon all day long?

73
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,200
Yes, I'm happy. We go to work together and come home together. We ate sweet pancakes together. Oh, right.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,090
The lady selling sweet pancakes told us that we looked like a couple.

75
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,700
I was so embarrassed and blushed like crazy.

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,610
Director!

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,140
Good morning!

78
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,300
You're here early. What's up with you today?

79
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,020
After what you said yesterday, I put extra care into my outfit and makeup.

80
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,600
What do you think?

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,000
- You look much better. See, you look more like a real beggar now. 
- Thank you, sir.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,390
The beggar of beggars. Where is the queen of beggars, Jeong Eun?

83
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm right here.

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,240
What is that beggar?

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,960
Hello, director.

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,230
My goodness. This is why it's impossible not to like you.

87
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,200
I don't think we can just leave it as it is.

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,500
Do we have any lines that we can give to Jeong Eun?

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,110
Well, the only lines that the beggars have in today's scenes belong to Joon Ki.

90
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,720
Ah, yeah.

91
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,380
Give those lines to Jeong Eun.

92
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,470
What? Pardon?

93
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,600
There's no need for that, Director.

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,230
It's alright. I want to repay you with something. Just do as I say.

95
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,500
Jeong Eun, why don't we get a cup of coffee? Let's take a five-minute break. Let's take five, everyone!

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,540
I'm sorry, Joon Ki.

97
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,840
No, it's fine. Don't mind me. Go enjoy your coffee.

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,120
Then I'll see you later.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,500
So he thinks Jeong Eun looks more homeless than I do. Fine.

100
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,820
I shall show him what a real beggar looks like.

101
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,980
I shall show him what people can look like when they actually live on the streets.

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Huh?

103
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,310
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

104
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,530
Oh well...

105
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,700
I put food scraps down the drain, and it got all clogged.

106
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,900
Oh, I see.

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,940
You should've been careful.

108
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,820
Hey, Cha Woo Sik.

109
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,970
We need to talk.

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,890
Hey, I think I'll have to

111
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,120
let Soo Yeon go.

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,500
What? What do you mean you'll let her go? Are you saying you'll fire her?

113
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,330
That's right. It's only been two days, but she's already broken 7 glasses and 5 plates.

114
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,600
Today, she clogged the sink drain. Can't you see the place has been flooded?

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,790
Still, it's too harsh.

116
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,440
She'll feel so dejected if she gets fired again. Let it slide just once?

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,230
I don't care.

118
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,560
Hello? Yes, sir.

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,090
What? What did you say? Okay.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,970
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

121
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,080
Why? What was it about?

122
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,500
We've been protesting because of our rent. But other business owners in the plaza

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,120
are doing the 3-steps-and-1-bow thing to the building owner's place. I have bad knees. I'm so worried.

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,100
Really? Hyung, how about we do this?

125
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,530
Evil greedy landlords should go away!

126
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,880
Go away! Go away!

127
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,180
 We are against unreasonable rent increase!

128
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,080
 We'll fight no matter what.

129
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,930
 Gosh, this is killing me.

130
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,400
 How long will it take to get there?

131
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,640
 I have no choice. He promised he wouldn't fire Soo Yeon

132
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,800
 if I did this, so I have to do this until the end.

133
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,480
 Yes, let's go! 3-steps-and-1-bow, all the way to the landlord's house!

134
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,500
Evil greedy landlords should go away!

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,410
- Go away!
 - Go away!

136
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,400
Aigoo, it looks like they're protesting because of their rent.

137
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,020
How do they expect small business owners to make ends meet?

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,880
Look at that punk.

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,790
Where did he go?

140
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,120
Who are you? Why are you following me? Who sent you?

141
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Well, it's not like that.

142
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,270
Did you follow me to steal my stroller?

143
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,600
You can't take it, you punk! It's all I have!

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,500
Sir, let me explain. It's not that.

145
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,920
What? So, you're an actor and playing a beggar?

146
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,900
Yes, that's why I want to see how beggars live...

147
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,260
I mean, I'd like to experience how those living on the streets actually live.

148
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,810
It'll help me portray my role in a more realistic manner.

149
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,920
But why me?

150
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,300
I visited Seoul station, Yongsan Station and Yeongdeungpo Station,

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
and you were the most beggar-like out of all the beggars.

152
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,710
You little punk.

153
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,970
Sir, I'm just saying that you're very professional. That's all.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,590
Right, punk.

155
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,870
I always do my best whenever I do anything.

156
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,740
Sir, please teach me. I beg you.

157
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,470
I understand where you're coming from,

158
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,400
but I'm busy trying to survive. Go find someone else.

159
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,900
Sir! Sir!

160
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,320
Gosh, I'm exhausted. My legs hurt so much.

161
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,420
Oh, boy.

162
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,200
Gosh, my entire body aches.

163
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,750
We went all the way to his place like that. He didn't even open the door.

164
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,000
We should do something more intense. Do you have any good ideas?

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,620
How about we write to him a letter in blood?

166
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,230
In blood?

167
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,520
Yes.

168
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,800
A letter in blood.

169
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,280
That's a great idea.

170
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,880
We'll write in blood?

171
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you think that'll be enough? Shouldn't we at least go on a hunger strike?

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,170
Ah, that's another great idea. Then let's do both. We'll do both of them.

173
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,900
What? Both of them?

174
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,510
- Gosh, this is crazy
 - Sounds great. Let's do it.

175
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,800

176
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,730
Hey, Hyung. It's me, Woo Sik.

177
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,530
I finished the protest, but the other protesters want to write to him in blood now.

178
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,900
They'll also go on a hunger strike. What should I do?

179
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,100
I'll have to do it if they all are doing it. You do it.

180
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,420
What? Me? Hyung, it's not fair for me to do this much.

181
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,380
Oh, Soo Yeon. Did you break another plate?

182
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,660
I'm sorry, sir.

183
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,790
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

184
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,110
Hey, so what are you saying? You won't do it?

186
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,940
N-No.

187
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,800
Of course, I should do it for you.

188
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,750
So, go easy on Soo Yeon even if she makes mistakes.

189
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,090
All right. Thanks.

190
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,300
This is insane.

191
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,690
Okay, let's write the letter in blood first.

192
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,870
You from the cafe, you should write one too.

193
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,830
Fill up the whole thing.

194
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,370
Fill up this whole thing?

195
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,140
Finally, I'm done.

196
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,180
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

197
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,630
Gosh.

198
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,950
Woo Sik.

199
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,140
Soo Yeon, what are you doing here?

200
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,390
I heard you're on a hunger strike from the boss, so I came to check on you.

201
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,740
But why are you the one that's doing it?

202
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,400
What? Well...

203
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,670
The boss made you do this, right? Shall I go say something to him?

204
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,210
No, no. Don't say anything.

205
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,340
He didn't make me do this. I volunteered.

206
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,710
I've always been very interested in rent issues.

207
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,100
Really?

208
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,700
Yeah. So, don't worry about me

209
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,580
and get back to work. Don't get on his nerves again.

210
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,770
Okay, I got it. But, be careful.

211
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,520
Yeah, I will.

212
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,280
This is crazy.

213
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,900
Alright. We're all done with our letters,

214
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,110
so let's go on a hunger strike now!

215
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,990
Sir.

216
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,400
Gosh, you startled me. You? Again?

217
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,730
How many times did I tell you that I don't want to do it? Leave.

218
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,640
I can't. I won't budge a single step

219
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,100
until I get your permission.

220
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,570
Sure, whatever.

221
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,390
Sir. Sir! Sir...

222
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,710
I fell asleep.

223
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,050
Come in.

224
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,400
Sir?

225
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,520
I lost. Come on in.

226
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,220
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

227
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,400
Sir, wait...

228
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,240
Put this on first.

229
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,880
Wait.

230
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,800
You want me to put this on?

231
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,210
- Why? Is it too dirty for you? 
- Well...

232
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,660
You said you wanted to experience our lives. If you're not even ready for this,

233
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,970
you should go back.

234
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,800
No. I'll put it on. I'll put it on.

235
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,000
- It fits you perfectly. 
- Oh, yeah.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,050
You skipped dinner, right? You must be hungry.

237
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,530
Here. Eat this.

238
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,680
Oh, yes. Thank you.

239
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,570
It's covered in dirt.

240
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,890
Is it too dirty for you to eat?

241
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,700
No, but this...

242
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,250
There's something we say in our world. "Don't be afraid of eating food off the ground."

243
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,080
"Starvation is scarier."

244
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,880
- If you can't eat it, just go back. 
- No!

245
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,480
I'll eat it.

246
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,590
After eating, get some sleep.

247
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,090
We'll start tomorrow.

248
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,820
Oh, okay.

249
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,990
Goodnight, sir.

250
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,680
Okay. See you tomorrow. What?

251
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,240
When Cinderella doesn't get sleep, she becomes Mozerella?

252
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,830
That's hilarious.

253
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,320
Right?

254
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,530
Byeong Cheol, you should go to bed. It's getting late.

255
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,440
It's driving me crazy.

256
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,500
Because of his laughter? You said he was fine except for that.

257
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,270
It's true, but I can't get used to his laughter.

258
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,290
By the way, how is your forkball going?

259
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,450
Thanks to Byeong Cheol, it's getting a lot better.

260
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,500
That's good at least.

261
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,900
What have you been looking at since earlier, Noona?

262
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,470
I'm going to open a restaurant, remember? I'm doing some research for Yuri's kitchen interior design.

263
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,900
Yuri's Kitchen? Oh, that chicken place.

264
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,880
Chicken place?

265
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,610
Hey, it's Yuri's "Kitchen."

266
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,660
Yes, it's chicken. Chicken.

267
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,510
By the way, what does "Yuri's" mean?

268
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,050
Forget it. Why am I even talking to you?

269
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,820
 2nd Day of Hunger Strike

270
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,240
 Evil landlord, cancel the rent increase immediately!

271
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,520
Gosh, I'm hungry.  For how long do I have to do this?

272
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,600
Should I just quit? No. For Soo Yeon's sake,

273
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,840
I have to continue. Of course.

274
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,880
Let's go! I'll starve until they lower the rents!

275
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,340
I'm so hungry.

276
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,720
This place looks good. There are many people walking by and a lot of restaurants.

277
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,630
I'm sure there are many people with change. It's perfect.

278
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,720
Shall we start?

279
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,650
Yes, sir.

280
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,830
What are you

281
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,760
doing right now?

282
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,090
What?

283
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,200
This isn't what I'm supposed to do?

284
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,870
There's something we say in our world. "Instead of lowering your body,

285
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,040
stir up people's hearts."

286
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,840
The core of begging is stirring up people's hearts.

287
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,900
How do I do that?

288
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,810
Eye contact. In other words, your eyes should meet theirs.

289
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,490
And the key to eye contact is the way you look at them.

290
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:44,100
The kind of gaze that makes it look like you won't be able to survive unless they open up their wallets.

291
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,150
What kind of gaze is that?

292
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,620
Let me show you.

293
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,080
Yes, sir.

294
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,700
Can you see?

295
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,060
You can't find even a tiny bit of hope in my eyes. My eyes are completely empty.

296
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,850
Without your help, I'll fall to the ground at any moment.

297
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,480
The totally hopeless look.

298
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,660
Yes, I can see it.

299
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,600
Alright, give it a try.

300
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,510
Okay, sir.

301
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,930
That's not it. I can still see hope in your eyes.

302
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,210
Do you have some money in your pocket?

303
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,350
Yes, I do.

304
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,220
I knew it.

305
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,200
I can't believe this.

306
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,260
As long as you have money in your pocket, you have hope.

307
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,630
Now try again.

308
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,340
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,100
No! It's wrong again.

310
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,190
Is there anything you can do properly?

311
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,900
At your age, you still get only minor roles. You can't even act well, so you're learning how to beg from me.

312
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,660
If you can't even do as I say, how are you going to act?

313
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,400
You're even more pathetic than I am. Do you realize that?

314
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,150
Yes, that's the gaze.

315
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,250
I can't find any hope in your eyes.

316
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,070
Remember how you look right now. Okay?

317
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,120
Yes, sir.

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,470
Let's go to work then.

319
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,040
 2nd Day of Hunger Strike

320
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,270
 3rd Day of Hunger Strike

321
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,600
 Cancel Immediately!  
 No Rent Increase!

322
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,500
 4th Day of Hunger Strike

323
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,400
 No Rent Increase During Recession!

324
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,630
 5th Day of Hunger Strike

325
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,340
 Protect Tenants' Right To Live!

326
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,300
No. No.

327
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,300
You can't go there.

328
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,550
Don't cross that river.

329
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,860
It was a dream. I thought I was really dying.

330
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,180
Gosh, I'm hungry. What if I really starve to death?

331
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,300
Is there any food?

332
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,590
I feel like I’m dying here.

333
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,240
Sir! Sir!

334
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,220
Take this! It's bread!

335
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,550
The convenience store in front said it was past its expiration date and gave it to me.

336
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,880
It's only been three days since the expiration date.

337
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,410
Yeah. Good Job.

338
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,050
Huh, I had five pieces of bread earlier, what happened?

339
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,900
I must have dropped it somewhere on the way here.

340
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,200
Ah, where did it go?

341
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,080
Forget it. Stop, let’s just go to work.

342
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,290
Yes, sir.

343
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,970
What kind of beggar-like bastard picked it up?

344
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,740
I hope they get food poisoning!

345
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,070
Hmm mhmm

346
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,860
Thank you!

347
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,940
It's kind of late, let's start wrapping things up.

348
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,520
Yes, sir.

349
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,570
Let’s see how much we got.

350
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,500
OMG, you got so much!

351
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,800
It’s all thanks to your teaching, sir.

352
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,390
You are better than me now.

353
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,720
Of course not, sir.

354
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,650
Stop it from now on, okay?

355
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,410
Stop what? What do you mean?

356
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,080
I don't have anything left to teach you now.

357
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,130
Everyone will say you are beggar now.

358
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,490
You seem more like one than me.

359
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,650
So, stop this and return.

360
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,320
Sir.

361
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,580
If you don't forget the mindset you have now, you are Korea's best

362
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,550
No, the world’s best beggar.

363
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,500
Okay.

364
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,250
I will remember.

365
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,360
Thank you for everything until now.

366
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,300
Take my bow.

367
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,090
No, you're fine.

368
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,700
Today’s the last time I’ll see your face,

369
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,430
So,  I have a gift for you.

370
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,430
Huh? A gift?

371
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,690
Isn't that a fertilizer sack, Jeong Eun?

372
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,940
Yeah, it is!

373
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,040
Fertilizer sacks are the warmest out of all plastics.

374
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,540
Wow, you are the queen of all beggars.

375
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,910
No, you’re the god of beggars.

376
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,310
But, where’s Lee Joon Ki?

377
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,220
I can’t reach Joon Ki for the last few days either, so I don’t kn—

378
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,260
I’m here!

379
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,180
- Hello, Director. 
 - Hey.

380
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,520
What happened to you?

381
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,720
Something about you is completely different!

382
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,900
Really?

383
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,690
- I thought a real beggar came just now. 
 - Joon Ki!

384
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,540
You didn’t even come home, where were you?

385
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,340
I went to an acting class, no

386
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,280
I went to a class about life.

387
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,850
  Town Beggar Jo Dal Ho

388
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,700
In this scene, the beggars are begging.

389
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,150
Beggar #1 brings bread, and you all want to eat.

390
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,250
So fight hard.

391
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,200
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

392
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,660
Get ready.

393
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,520
Ready? Action!

394
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,480
I was a lawyer, how did I end up like this?

395
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,580
It doesn’t make sense! It doesn’t make sense!

396
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,650
What are you doing? Bow down and beg!

397
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,390
Ahh, ye..yes.

398
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:12,640
There's a saying in our world. "Don't bend your back, but stir up the heart."

399
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,740
  The heart!

400
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,130
  You have to meet people’s eyes. Meeting their eyes is important!

401
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,860
  The gaze!

402
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,610
Why is he not begging?

403
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,180
Leave him, leave him. It looks fine.

404
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,990
Look at his gaze!

405
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,410
I got some bread.

406
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,420
- Let’s eat this together. 
 - Yeah!

407
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,210
- Hold on. 
 - Bread!!!

408
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,120
I want to eat! My bread!

409
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,300
Hold on!

410
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,920
Let go!

411
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,180
Let go!

412
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,820
  There’s a saying in our world. “Don’t be scared of eating off the ground,

413
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,730
  because starvation is even scarier."

414
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,260
I said, let go of me!

415
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,730
Camera, zoom in on Joon Ki.

416
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,620
Okay! Cut!

417
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,380
Well done!! Good Job!!

418
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,010
Good Job!!

419
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,220
Lee Joon Ki’s acting was very good.

420
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,600
You' re very generous with your compliment.

421
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,340
No way.  But you didn't have to eat from the ground.

422
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,930
No! if you are hungry, you can eat anything from the ground, even dirt!

423
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,030
Isn’t that what a real beggar would do?

424
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,020
He’s a completely different person from a few days ago!

425
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,610
You should learn from him.

426
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,720
This is what a real actor is like!

427
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,300
Everyone! Clap for him!

428
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,330
No, no, no.

429
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,550
No, no.

430
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,290
Stop it, stop it.

431
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,500
Stop it! Oh.

432
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,330
  Hunger Strike Day 6

433
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,020
Chairman,  let’s stop this hunger strike already.

434
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,260
We’ll all die if we keep going.

435
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,820
The building owner doesn't care, what's the point of continuing?

436
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,530
I understand.

437
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,170
But we can't just step back.

438
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,770
Can we do something else, other than starving?

439
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,150
What about shaving our heads?

440
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,190
Shaving? That sounds good!

441
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,860
 Shaving?

442
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,500
  Shaving? Nonsense!

443
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,050
But realistically, I think it'll be difficult for all of us to shave our heads.

444
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,760
So let's have one person to represent.

445
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,220
Then, who? Is there anyone to volunteer?

446
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,720
No one wants to do it?

447
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,930
Then.. what do we do? Is there any fair way to decide?

448
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,230
Sir, leave it to me.

449
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,900
TWIN EVENT, Mr. Park? Do you have a good idea?

450
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,800
I was a recreation teacher before.

451
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,960
In times like this when you have to pick someone out of many, a timing game is the best.

452
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,380
Timing game? Oh!

453
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,760
That sounds good!

454
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,950
Okay, everyone, get up!

455
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,900
Come on, get up!

456
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,670
Everyone knows the timing game, right? The person who gets caught has to shave.

457
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,380
Alright, let's start when I say "start." Start! One!

458
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,490
Hey, how could you do that as soon as you start? Two!

459
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,800
  What? What is this?

460
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,680
Gosh, you people! You need to play fairly! Three!

461
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,410
- Four! 
 - Four!

462
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,630
They got caught!

463
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,920
This guy from the cafe and Ms. Kim from the beauty salon.

464
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,950
Why would you do it at the same time?!

465
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,470
Gosh, gosh. We need to choose between them now. What do we do?

466
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,130
Don't worry! We have the Tang Soo Yook game.

467
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,820
You know how to play the Tang Soo Yook game.

468
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,750
Right?

469
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,690
Okay, start!

470
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,890
- Tang. 
 - Soo.

471
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,740
- Yook! 
 - Tang.

472
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,480
- Soo. 
 - Yook.

473
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,220
-Tang! 
 - Tang.

474
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,890
Okay!

475
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,430
Alright, from now,

476
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,770
we will start our protest towards

477
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,950
the corrupt landowner with this shaving act!

478
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,870
Yes!

479
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,730
Shall we start?

480
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,660
W-Wait. Can I call someone for the last time?

481
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
Hello, Hyung. It’s me. The thing is,

482
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,090
they want me to shave my head.

483
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,060
What did you say? Hold up.

484
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,150
Firefighters, it's this way!

485
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,260
Hey, Soo Yeon started a fire in the kitchen!

486
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,100
The firefighters are here. It's a whole mess!

487
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,320
What did you say? Shaving?!

488
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,490
I'll do it.

489
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,610
I'll shave my head.

490
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,360
You can start.

491
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,360
From Sook Hee Beauty Salon on the third floor...

492
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,820
Ms. Kim will proceed with shaving.

493
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,690
  We oppose the rent increase!

494
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,460
Alright, I'll start right away.

495
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,450
Hold on!

496
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,360
What is it?

497
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,990
I'm the landlord's lawyer.

498
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,870
The landlord has said that he would end things regarding the rent increase!

499
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,230
So, please stop!

500
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,620
What? Oh, my.

501
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,180
Oh, my.

502
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,370
Are you serious?

503
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,680
Yes, I am!

504
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Everyone, the rent increase matter has been settled!

505
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,650
We won!

506
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,550
We won!

507
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,600
We won!

508
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,970
Geez, they should've told us a minute earlier.

509
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:02,190
Gosh, what is this?! What is this?

510
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,950
  Waikiki Guest House

511
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,140
Oh, look at you. You almost had your head shaved because of Soo Yeon.

512
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,660
What a lovesick fool.

513
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,460
- What a lovesick fool. 
 - Hey. Are you making fun of me?

514
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,040
I'm already going crazy.

515
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,500
Hey, Soo Yeon.

516
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,630
Oh, Woo Sik.

517
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,980
Are you okay?

518
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,030
Y-Yeah.

519
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,880
But, what's that?

520
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,960
Oh, this? I looked it up and they said that if you eat right after starving yourself, you'll get a stomachache.

521
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,800
So, I made some porridge. You want some?

522
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,680
What, porridge?

523
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,110
Thanks, Soo Yeon.

524
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:55,350
Don't be. This is the least I can do after you introduced me to the job.

525
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,340
Enjoy.

526
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,590
♫  I saw you, I saw my love  ♫

527
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,350
Hey, hey. 
♫  Yesterday I got butterflies seeing your vivid face  ♫

528
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,820
Look! Soo Yeon made porridge for me!

529
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,440
Wow, you were pretty much dying a minute ago. You're so happy now?

530
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,890
Yeah, I'm so happy.

531
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,400
I don't care about a bald spot. Even if my head was shaved, I wouldn't care.

532
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,350
Soo Yeon made porridge for me!

533
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,610
Oh, I couldn't dare to eat this precious meal. Should I eat it, though?

536
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,220
It's so bad! How can it taste so bad?

537
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,960
But, still, I love it.

538
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,490
♫  Baby How can I do do do woo~  ♫

539
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,480
Joon Ki, I learned so much from you today.

540
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,380
Learned what?

541
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,690
I also saw the bread falling on the ground,

542
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,200
but I didn't even think of picking it up and eating it.

543
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,620
Oh, that's nothing.

544
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,770
Jeong Eun. Real acting, you know,

545
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:07,330
it's not about acting to be someone. You have to become that person.

546
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,380
So, if you're going to act like a beggar,

547
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,220
you need to become a real beggar to act like one.

548
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,020
That's how it is.

549
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,060
This is the difference between a pro and an amateur.

550
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,960
Director, I don't think this is right.

551
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,100
What about it?

552
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,650
It's just so dirty. There's no beggar these days that would do this.

553
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,120
Our drama airs during mealtimes. People are going to complain about this.

554
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,420
Is that so? Well, yeah, it's a bit gross.

555
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,620
Just edit it out.

556
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,910
No. Just get rid of every scene he was in.

557
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,930
Alright.

558
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,230
  Delete

559
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,150
Acting doesn't work with just researching.

560
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,680
You have to find someone who actually lives like that.

561
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,500
You need to meet them, eat with them,  sleep with them, and live with them for you to act like a true beggar.

562
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,680
That's how it is.

563
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,920
- I see. 
- This is the

564
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,020
method. Method.

565
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,430
Got it?

566
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,870
- What did I say? 
 - Method.

567
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,890
Method.

568
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,560
How is it? Do you like the steak?

569
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,700
Yes, I do. It's good.

570
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,590
I'm sorry for not contacting you often.

571
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,070
These days, I've been so busy with training. I've also been busy preparing something else.

572
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,000
Preparing something?

573
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,190
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

574
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,040
Alright.

575
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,280
But... Is Gi Bong learning forkball, or whatever it is, well?

576
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,670
Well, I'm teaching it to him, but I'm not sure. He's quite stupid.

577
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,980
But still, please teach him well.

578
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,250
I got it.

579
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,220
You should eat before it gets cold.

580
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,700
Alright.

581
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,750
 Look how nice it is when he's not laughing.

582
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm sorry! I sneezed from the pepper.

583
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,760
  What? What the heck?

584
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,130
  What's this? What is this?

585
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,360
  Why's his sneeze like that?

586
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,040
This won't do. I'll have to drink water.

587
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,600
 What the heck? What's this?

588
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,460
  No way. Is he hiccuping?

589
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,990
  How can a person like this exist?

590
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,830
Gi Bong!

591
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,020
Coach!

592
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,930
It's so late. Why are you still here?

593
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,720
I just had a bit of practice left.

594
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,690
But... Wasn't that forkball just now?

595
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,640
Yes. Last time when you talked about how my playing style hasn't changed,

596
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,740
I've been practicing it for a while.

597
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,670
Oh, is that so? Well, you're pretty good at it.

598
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,980
Your angle is great, too.

599
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,820
But isn't it hard on the shoulder you injured?

600
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,790
No!

601
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,350
I'm perfectly fine.

602
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,780
Alright, well. I'll look at you try it. Go ahead and throw one!

603
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,680
Yes, Coach.

604
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,160
  The Last Victory

605
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,120
He hiccups like this, "Po koo, po koo?"

606
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,080
That's not the only thing. Do you know what his sneeze is like? "Meow meow"

607
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,730
It's like that! Anyway, I can't take it any longer.

608
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,130
I need to break up with him tomorrow.

609
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,350
What about Gi Bong, then? He won't teach him forkball if you break up with him.

610
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,880
Oh, yeah.

611
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,580
That's true.

612
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,190
Gosh, I'm going crazy because of this fool Gook Gi Bong!

613
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,420
- Amazing news!  Amazing news!  
 - What is it?

614
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,320
What happened to you? What's all the fuss?

615
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,950
I've got another first-string test tomorrow!

616
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,610
The coach saw me practicing and contacted the first string coach. He said he's coming to test me!

617
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,650
Really? Wow, that's great!

618
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,910
Wait, wait. Hey.

619
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,100
That means I don't have to date Byeong Cheol any longer. Right?

620
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,250
What? Oh, but, you really don't like him?

621
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,110
I don't know. I'm going to break up with him tomorrow.

622
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,760
Just know that.

623
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Huh, why? Noona!

624
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,820
Noo...Noona!

625
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,380
What am I going to say to Byeong Cheol?

626
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,930
Who are you? What are you doing right now?

627
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,260
You pervert!!!

628
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,270
When I went inside the room, the pervert was smelling my clothes.

629
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,290
I’m going crazy. Why all of a sudden a pervert?

630
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,320
When did he even come inside?

631
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,030
- I'm here. 
- You're here?

632
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,010
Huh? Why are the police here? Did something happen?

633
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,470
The thing is, a pervert came into the girls’ dormitory.

634
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,190
Pervert?!

635
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,170
So, did they catch the pervert?

636
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,510
No, he ran away.

637
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,590
Oh my.

638
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,650
Isn’t that a snake?

639
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,030
Yep! It is a snake.

640
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,510
It's my director friend's snake. He's going abroad for a location scout, so I offered to take care of it for a few days.

641
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,660
But still, how could you bring it here?

642
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,930
The director asked me to, so it’s not like I could say no.

643
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,860
Don't worry. Anne Hathaway Scarlett Johansson Megan Fox Junior is very gentle.

644
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,360
What? Anne Hathaway what?

645
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,590
The name! Its name is all of the director's favorite actors.

646
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,730
Oh, I see. Isn't the snake venomous though?

647
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,290
Venomous? Uh... it is! There's a little bit of venom.

648
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,130
Even if it bites you though, you won't die.

649
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,900
First the pervert, now this venomous snake, ugh.

650
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,000
Stop it punk! I said I’ll take care of it!

651
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,740
Anne Hathaway Scarlett Johansson Megan Fox Junior, do you want food?

652
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,530
Food time!

653
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,000
Food time!

654
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,290
It's five o'clock already.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,410
I should get moving for my training.

656
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,790
What are you going to do now?

657
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,060
I asked what are you going to do?! You said you'd take care of it well!!

658
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,380
Of course, I didn't know that it could open its cage and get out.

659
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,650
Gosh, I'll be in big trouble if the director finds out.

660
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,660
Is that the issue right now? What about the guests? What if they see it?!

661
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,760
Right, we're already dealing with a lot because of the pervert, if this snake thing comes out then we're in trouble.

662
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,400
This is serious. If word gets out, we'll have to shut down our business.

663
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,960
Come on, let’s go look for the snake!

664
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,290
Okay.

665
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,770
Gosh, you're such a troublemaker.

666
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,890
Anne Hathaway...

667
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,180
What are you all doing here so early? Is this a treasure hunt?

668
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,240
Noona, we’re in trouble. The snake Joon Ki brought disappeared.

669
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,190
What? How?

670
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,130
I also don’t know. Come help us find it!

671
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,760
Sorry. I have to meet Byeong Cheol, so I can't.

672
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,100
I told you, I’m breaking up with him today.

673
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,000
What? How is that important right now?

674
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,840
That is the most important thing for me right now.

675
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,920
So, good luck.

676
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,820
Noona! Noona!

677
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,900
Gosh, she is so self-centered.

678
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,360
Anne Hathaway Megan Fox.

679
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,620
Ah, whatever!

680
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,820
For now, just come in.

681
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,330
Listen Byeong Cheol, I said I have something to say.

682
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,540
We can talk slowly but first look at this.

683
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,930
Where is this?

684
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,090
This a restaurant I just acquired.

685
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,730
Huh? Why a restaurant all of a sudden?

686
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,590
I've always wanted to start a restaurant with my childhood friends. I've been preparing for it for a while now.

687
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,410
I'll be retiring soon, so I acquired it in preparation for that.

688
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,820
I see.

689
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,870
But, Byeong Cheol, the thing I had to say...

690
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:13,530
That said, I want you to run the kitchen here.

691
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,500
What??

692
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,260
Megan Fox Junior.

693
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,930
Where are you? Anne Hathaway Megan Fox...

694
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,560
Hel—

695
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,680
Found it!

696
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,750
Stay right there, punk!

697
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,860
I know for sure he came in here.

698
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,720
Where...?

699
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,960
So it went there, huh?

700
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,320
You are a troublemaker.

701
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,240
Stay right there okay?

702
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,480
I'll scold you.

703
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,170
Where did it go?

704
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,700
But, the pervert still hasn't been caught.

705
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,470
I'm still so scared thinking he might still be in here.

706
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,620
He'd be crazy to come here again.

707
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,200
Let's change and take a break.

708
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,060
Ahh, I'm tired.

709
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,130
What the..?!

710
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,300
  I'm going crazy. But if I go out, it's perfect for a misunderstanding...

711
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,410
Still, haven't found it?

712
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,660
Yeah, we can't find it no matter where we look.

713
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,310
But, how come we haven't seen Joon Ki since earlier?

714
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,140
Yeah... What if he left me out of something again?

715
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,700
That's probably true. Geez, that fool.

716
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,780
Hey, guys. I'm here.

717
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,470
What? Why are you so happy?

718
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:39,530
Well, Byeong Cheol asked me to be in charge of his restaurant's kitchen.

719
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,890
What? What are you saying?

720
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,380
I'm the main chef now.

721
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,010
I have my own kitchen now!

722
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,190
Really? Congrats, Unni.

723
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,440
- But, weren't you supposed to break up with him today? 
 - Huh?

724
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,740
Well, I thought about it and I thought that his weird laughter, sneeze, and hiccups

725
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,170
weren't that big of a deal.

726
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,240
It's unique. I like it.

727
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,780
Gosh, you were freaking out just this morning and saying you'd break up with him.

728
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,180
Gosh, I'm tired. Maybe I practiced too much.

729
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,820
Well, I have to do well on my test tomorrow.

730
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,130
Are you okay?

731
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,160
Move!

732
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,220
Who is he?

733
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,880
Pickpocket!

734
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Excuse me! Please get that pickpocket for me!

735
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,310
Pickpocket? Geez.

736
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,720
You're dead today.

737
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,500
  Waikiki Guest House

738
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,540
They need to catch all of the perverts and lock them up.

739
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:00,070
Lock them up? Those kinds of men need to have their manhood taken from them.

740
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,220
  This is driving me crazy.

741
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,020
  It'll be a huge mess if I'm caught.

742
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:09,240
Let's not talk about perverts anymore. I'm hungry. Should we get some cup ramen?

743
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,640
Should we?

744
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,020
  Okay. This is my chance.

745
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,550
Let's go.

746
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,560
  I need to leave quickly. Quickly!

747
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,190
What is it now?!

748
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,290
How could you leave your wallet when we're going to buy ramen?

749
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,220
I'm sorry.

750
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,300
What? What are you?

751
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,270
Where's my wallet?

752
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,690
Hurry and look.

753
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,640
Who are you?

754
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,080
I'm the guesthouse owner. Why? Who are you?

755
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,720
Are you the pervert?

756
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,960
Shush. You're the pervert, right?

757
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,490
- Stay still! If we're caught, we're both dead. 
 - What?

758
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,360
Why would I die? You're the pervert,

759
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,730
and I'm here to find a snake.

760
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,530
A snake?

761
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,220
Would those girls believe that? If I'm caught, I'll tell them you're my accomplice.

762
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,970
Accomplice?

763
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,280
Gosh, you're so thick-skinned.

764
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,040
Let's go and see.

765
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,360
You're dead today.

766
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,910
Shush.

767
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,840
Where is it?

768
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,780
Oh, I found it. Should we go now?

769
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,000
Go. Go.

770
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,510
I'm too lazy to leave. Let's just talk here.

771
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,390
Let's talk all night.

772
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,650
Alright, then.

773
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,660
All night?

774
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,200
Hey, where do you want to go?

775
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,900
What other nice places are there?

776
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,460
I'm going crazy.

777
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,650
Ugh.

778
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,700
  Surf California

779
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,440
You scared me.

780
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,010
Hey, Gook Gi Bong. Your test is tomorrow. What are you doing here not sleeping?

781
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,690
The thing is... I'm so nervous I can't sleep.

782
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:01,020
Noona, will I be able to do well? I won't fail again, right?

783
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,290
- I'm a bit scared now that the test is right around the corner. 
 - Hey.

784
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,460
Why is a grown man like you getting scared?

785
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,380
You've worked so hard until now. I can guarantee

786
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,760
that you're going to make it to first string this time.

787
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,350
Trust me.

788
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,560
Thank you.

789
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,100
But, you didn't break up with Byeong Cheol?

790
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,200
I heard you're in charge of his restaurant's kitchen.

791
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,010
Oh? That...

792
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,160
Forget it. Anyway, congratulations on becoming a chef.

793
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,770
Thank you.

794
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,960
I'm more thankful. I was able to get this test because of you.

795
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,220
At least you know, so you should be good to me.

796
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,560
Alright.

797
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,730
Oh and once I'm on the first string and earn a lot of money,

798
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,930
- I'll set up a restaurant for you. 
 - Really?

799
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,020
You promise?

800
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,860
Of course. This grown man Gook Gi Bong doesn't go back on his word.

801
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,290
That chicken place or Yui's Kitchen or whatever, can't cost that much.

802
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,110
Trust me, trust me.

803
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,730
Instead, give me free chicken for the rest of my life.

804
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,050
Right, thank you.

805
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,060
Anyway, Gook Gi Bong fighting!

806
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,930
Chef Cha, fighting to you, too!

807
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,430
Cheer up.

808
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,400
Thank you, Noona.

809
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,520
Oh, it hurts.

810
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,410
You pervert.

811
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,660
Ah, I'm hungry.

812
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,260
Oh, rip it! Rip it!

813
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,190
Really?

814
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,160
- Do you want some? 
 - Yeah, a bit.

815
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,890
I'm so hungry.

816
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,110
No way. I'm eating it all by myself.

817
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,780
It's fine. Whatever. I won't eat that dirty thing.

818
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,870
I won't eat it.

819
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,700
No.

820
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,590
What is it?

821
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,890
Gosh, look at you all mopey.

822
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,120
Here.

823
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,290
Gosh, you're so bad.

824
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,990
Thanks.

825
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,870
Don't think that I'll let you slide for giving me this.

826
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,420
Yeah, yeah. Just eat it.

827
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,320
Alright.

828
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,680
Oh what, this is delicious. Where did you buy it?

829
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,830
This? You get off exit 3 at Itaewon Station, then walk around 100 meters.

830
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,420
When you go into the alleyway on the left, you'll see a shop called "All the Snacks in the World."

831
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,400
It's sold there.

832
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,730
And, besides that place...

833
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,990
Gook Gi Bong, good luck on your test. You're dead if you fail this time.

834
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,360
Alright.

835
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,390
I'll be off.

836
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,390
Hey, Gook Gi Bong! Take this!

837
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,120
- What's this? 
 - What else?

838
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,490
It's a special energy drink I made early in the morning.

839
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,390
Here, take it.

840
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,870
Gosh, a pitcher can't even catch that?

841
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,360
It was just a mistake.

842
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:25,760
What's wrong?

843
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,380
Oh? It's nothing.

844
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,670
Then I'll be going.

845
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,090
Good luck.

846
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,420
- I hope you pass! 
 - Thanks.

847
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,860
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

848
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,930
He has to pass.

849
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,550
But, what is Joon Ki doing, not coming home all night?

850
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,490
Oh? It's already bright!

851
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,290
- Yeah. But, it was nice listening to music and talking all night. 
 - Ow.

852
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,440
It was so nice.

853
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,820
Yeah, it was.

854
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,700
What should we listen to now?

855
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,530
Why do they talk so much?

856
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,280
I know, right?

857
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,010
Has a ghost that could never talk possessed them or something?

858
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,700
It wasn't this.

859
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,720
Wow. It's obviously Kim Bum Soo's "Day."

860
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,790
- Right?
 - No.

861
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,920
It's that song. Jeon In Kwon's "Don't Worry, Dear."

862
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
No. It's Kim Bum Soo's "Day."

863
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,720
No. It's Jeon In Kwon's song.

864
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,620
Alright. Want to bet?

865
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,130
The loser gets flicked.

866
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,120
- How's that? Deal? 
 - Deal!

867
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,490
I remembered! It's Jeon In Kwon's "Don't Worry, Dear."

868
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,360
Oh, right, right!

869
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,330
Okay! I was right!

870
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,920
Alright, come on.

871
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,800
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

872
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,880
Can you just be gentle?

873
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,560
No, no. I'm going to do it hard.

874
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,700
Let's go.

875
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,040
What? Why'd you do it so gently?

876
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,400
You gave me some chocolate earlier.

877
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,130
Thank you.

878
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,460
No worries!

879
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,190
  Gook Gi Bong

880
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:27,610
This is the player that you thought long and hard about last time.

881
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,140
Oh, yes, I see.

882
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,920
What was that just now?

883
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,900
Um... huh... that...

884
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,790
He must've just been nervous.

885
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,980
Gi Bong! Come to your senses!

886
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,660
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

887
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,170
What is this?

888
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,760
What's wrong with you?!

889
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,470
Sorry coach, hold on.

890
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,450
Hey, what's wrong with you? What's with your shoulder?

891
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,190
Did you get hurt?

892
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,300
What? No, that didn't happen.

893
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,850
Are you really okay?

894
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,720
I'm okay.

895
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,160
I'm fine. Let's do it again.

896
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,160
Alright.

897
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,090
What's wrong?

898
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,770
You're not okay! Get back up!

899
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,920
Let's go to the hospital! Go!

900
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,830
No, coach, I'm okay.

901
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,630
I can do it! I can really do it!

902
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,260
I can really do it!!

903
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,820
Are you hurt somewhere?

904
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,750
No, No, it's okay.

905
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,300
Okay? What do you mean?!

906
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,720
You're sweating!

907
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,780
Gosh.

908
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,440
- I have to pee really bad. 
 - What?

909
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,660
But, don't worry.

910
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,220
I can just hold it in. I hold it in well.

911
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,730
This won't do. Just hold it in a little.

912
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,460
What? What are you going to do?

913
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,450
I can't watch you suffer any longer!

914
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,170
So, just hang in there.

915
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:04,990
Whoa, what was that?

916
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,320
It sounds strange.

917
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,270
It's probably nothing.

918
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,830
Here...

919
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,990
Thank you.

920
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,220
But, why would you put yourself in danger like that?

921
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,550
You said it was urgent!

922
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,290
Gosh, I can't with you!

923
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,650

924
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,600
  - Pervert! 
 - Ah!!!!

925
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,260
Why did you do it?

926
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,660
Why were you bitten instead of me?

927
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,640
You went easy on me with the flick.

928
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,860
What? You did that because of something like that?

929
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,670
And, you said you're an actor. An actor's face is their life.

930
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:55,950
Is this a time for you to be thinking about me, you fool?!

931
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,850
And what about your lips?

932
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,630
It's making me so upset.

933
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,350
It's fine. I can just get treated in prison.

934
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,660
Anyway, thanks.

935
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,760
But... What you did is something you should've never done.

936
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,290
You can't be forgiven.

937
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:19,120
Pay for your crimes and don't ever do something like this again.

938
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,620
You can promise me that much right?

939
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,550
Policemen, I think I'm done speaking.

940
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,530
Let's go.

941
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,030
I'll go visit you!

942
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:48,910
Contact me when you're out, okay?!

943
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:52,310
What are you doing? Did you get close with that pervert jerk or something?

944
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,230
What? Jerk?

945
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,950
He's the most loyal person I've ever met.

946
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,030
What do you know?!

947
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,790
He's gone crazy. He's gone completely crazy.

948
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,280
Gi Bong, you're back?

949
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,170
How'd your test go... Hey, what's wrong with your arm?

950
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,080
It got hurt.

951
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,620
What? You got hurt? Where?

952
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,960
But.. then... Your test?

953
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,290
Sorry, but I'm a bit tired so I'll go up first.

954
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,990
If your shoulder is hurt, you should be resting at home. Why'd you even come?

955
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,140
I came because the coach said to come.

956
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,690
Oh, okay.

957
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,500
Hey, I went through so much trouble to teach you forkball, but how could you end up like this?

958
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,930
I just wasted my time. How pathetic.

959
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,800
Gi Bong!

960
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,700
Yes, Coach?

961
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:27,320
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

962
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,360
♫  Oh what in the world is happening to me  ♫

963
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,660
I've been cleaning all day, I'm so exhausted.

964
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,280
♫  There's never a quiet day  ♫

965
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,260
But is this really my kitchen?
 ♫  There's never a quiet day  ♫

966
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,990
♫  I'm now even scared of tomorrow  ♫

967
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,190
-  I  love it. 
♫  I'm now even scared of tomorrow  ♫

968
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,610
Yoo Ri?

969
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,130
Oh, Byeong Cheol!

970
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:47,760
I'm late, right? Practice ended later than expected.

971
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,770
It's so clean. Did you do all of this yourself?

972
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,970
Yes.

973
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,620
But what happened to Gi Bong?

974
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,520
Did the results not come out yet?

975
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,190
It looks like you haven't heard the news yet.

976
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,440
Gi Bong was kicked out today.

977
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,480
Kicked out?

978
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,740
The test results came out and his previous injury has returned.

979
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,160
How could a professional not even take care of his body?

980
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,210
He dug his own grave. How stupid.

981
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:25,470
He has no choice. It will take years of physical therapy to recover, and even if that goes well,

982
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,030
there's no guarantee he'll fully recover.

983
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,810
But, there's no way the team will wait for that long.

984
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:31,780
He's too ambitious for his own good.

985
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,200
First string? That fool should really know his place.

986
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,650
What did you just say?

987
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,570
- Huh? 
 - Calling him a fool, I mean.

988
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,660
What do you know?

989
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,130
Who are you to say such things to Gi Bong?

990
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:50,330
Do you even know how hard he's been working until now?

991
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:53,510
He never missed a single day for the whole year,

992
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,950
and went to train at five in the morning.

993
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:00,040
A kid like that might never play baseball again, and you say things like that?

994
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,200
Are you really a sunbae, you jerk?

995
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,100
Don't call me again. Got it?

996
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,990
Kicked out? What do you mean?

997
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,250
I'm sorry.

998
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:32,810
It's the team's decision, and there's nothing I can do about it.

999
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,640
Please give me one more chance.

1000
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,960
If I get physical therapy, I can pitch again.

1001
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,430
I can do very well, Coach.

1002
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:44,170
I'm begging you, Coach.

1003
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,030
Please?

1004
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,790
I am sorry, I am very sorry.

1005
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,680
What are you doing here?

1006
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,480
I'm just here.

1007
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,200
Right.

1008
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,630
But are you okay?

1009
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:32,730
Huh? About what?

1010
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,960
I heard...

1011
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,410
-that you were kicked out.
 - Ah, that.

1012
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,260
Oh, that?

1013
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,420
So you heard?

1014
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:49,620
It couldn't be helped. Physical therapy is hard and it takes a lot of time.

1015
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,700
This is better.

1016
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:57,310
I've been playing baseball for so long now it's boring, so it's okay if I stop here.

1017
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:59,720
Really?

1018
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,240
What?

1019
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,450
Of course. I really am fine.

1020
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,760
Don't worry.

1021
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:19,520
Gook Gi Bong. Look at me.

1022
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,130
Hm, what is it?

1023
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,750
Ah... What are you doing?!

1024
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:31,830
If you want to cry, cry. Don't be an idiot and hold back.

1025
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:53,440
Noona... What should I do?

1026
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,530
I can't play baseball anymore.

1027
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,560
I can't play baseball ever again.

1028
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,580
How will I live now?

1029
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,270
What am I going to do?

1030
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:17,490
What am I going to do now?

1031
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:31,740

1032
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,920
♫  Hold my hand, follow me, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1033
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,760
♫  Hold my hand, follow me, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1034
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,080
♫  It makes me happy every day  ♫

1035
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,670
♫  Let's go, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1036
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,890
♫  I'll draw our dreams one at a time  ♫ 
   -Preview-

1037
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,890
 I'll make Gi Bong feel better. So just trust me.

1038
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,020
 How can just this chocolate make him feel better?

1039
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,920
 Do you think he's a complete idiot or what?

1040
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,850
 I miss it. I really miss it.

1041
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,580
 The chocolate, where did you buy it?

1042
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,940
 Tell me the name, now!

1043
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,810
 What will I be doing here?

1044
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,490
 It's our boss' wife's birthday today.

1045
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,500
 Hyung-nim! I brought the singer.

1046
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,660
 Are you Woo Sik?

1047
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:07,960
 Mi Young Noona?

1048
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,700
 If she looks for me, tell her I'm not here. Tell her  I immigrated to another country, okay?

1049
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,070
 It's hosted by the anchor, Jo Sang Hwa, right? I'm a big fan of his.

1050
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,070
 Then why don't you try hitting on him?

1051
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,550
 If you have time tomorrow Jeong Eun, shall we go for a drive?

1052
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,940
 You should be careful.

1053
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:24,860
 - He takes girls to his villa and ghosts them after having fun with them just once.
  - Darn it!

1054
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,750
 Kim Jeong Eun!

1055
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,870
♫  Let's go, Waikiki Waikiki  ♫

1056
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:32,280
♫  Let's love ye~~  ♫
