1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh,

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,890
that's our yearbook! Wow, it's been so long.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,500
Wow, it's making me so nostalgic.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,700
It's me. Oh, my skin was so great and pretty back then.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,780
Ah, right.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,000
By the way, didn't you have someone you liked, Soo Yeon?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,360
Huh?

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,190
Of course, I did! Truthfully,

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,730
Woo Sik was my first love.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,800
Wait what? Why?

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,530
He was just nice. He wouldn't get mad and would just smile like a fool, no matter what anybody said.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,700
Woo Sik was nice? That prickly, picky boy?

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,240
He seems changed a bit now, but he was really nice back then.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,990
Maybe it's because I'm mean, but I like nice boys.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,500
This is a secret okay?

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,480
Okay, but we should clean this up fast before Woo Sik starts nagging.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright. Oh, we're done with the first floor, so let's go upstairs.

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,440
Oh, so that's what it's like?

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,800
What? Where is everyone?

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,970
- This! I bought this a few days ago! Who's the person who broke this after using it?! 
 - Brother! Shh!

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,440
What "Shh"? Ahh, so it was you Noona,

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,400
right? Right?

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,220
Be quiet.

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,860
What?!

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,190
What are you doing?!

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,740
Brother, I just heard Soo Yeon and Jeong Eun talking.

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,880
Soo Yeon's ideal type is a nice man.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,700
A nice man?

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,990
Yeah. She liked you before because you were nice.

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,600
Because you never got mad and just smiled all the time.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,100
Oh, really? So what do you want me to do?

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,920
You're so frustrating. I said Soo Yeon's ideal type is a nice man.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,170
Does it matter if you make such a big fuss about who broke this broomstick?

34
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,000
It doesn't.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,500
So, what do think you need to do now?

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
So, should I just not find the culprit?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,250
Oh, should I just buy a new broomstick?

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,930
You're so stupid.

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,940
Why'd you hit me!?!

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,250
So you made all of this? Why all of a sudden?

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,100
Just because. You all worked so hard these days so I prepared this.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,060
Oh, you did?

43
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,550
Oh, our Woo Sik is so nice. Right, Soo Yeon?

44
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,000
Huh? Y-Yeah.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,220
It wasn't even much, though. Go on, eat.

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,510
Gi Bong, can you pass me the water?

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,250
- Oh! It's so cold! 
 - I'm sorry, Woo Sik!

48
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,010
You really!

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,890
It's okay. I was already hot from cooking.

50
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,500
But, this is cold and great. Just eat up.

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,560
- Oh, but, still. I'm sorry. I'll clean this for you. 
 - It's fine.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,300
- Oh! Oh! It's so hot! 
 - Woo Sik!

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,850
Hey, hey! I'm so sorry!

54
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,160
You bastard!

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,900
It's okay! Hot on cold, that's great.

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,580
Oh, it's fine. Just eat up.

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,820
Everyone spills soup once a while.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
  Filming In Progress

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,790
Hello.

60
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,600
- Hello. 
- Hello.

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,710
Hello, I'm Lee Joon Ki!

62
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,930
Hello! Hello.

63
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,800
Oh, the smell of a filming site!

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,870
Geez, how could you hold back the urge for so long?!

65
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,780
But Joon Ki, will I be able to do well?

66
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,100
It's fine, it's fine. Just relax and do as you practiced.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,370
What's your name?

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,580
Park Yi Dong, so it's you, huh?

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,780
In the name of God, we order that you leave this man's body right away!

70
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,660
 Amen

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,340
Hyeong Cheol!

72
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,130
Are you alright? You must be so shocked.

73
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,250
- Huh? 
- Cut!

74
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,200
Jeong Eun, what are you doing right now?

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,320
Your acting is so fake. You have to put more tension into it.

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,450
Sorry.

77
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,200
Okay, let's do it again.

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,100
Ahem.

79
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Ready? Action!

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,370
What's your name?

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,990
Park Yi Dong, so it was you, huh?

82
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,020
In the name of God, we order that you leave this man's body right away!

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,260
Hyeong Cheol!

84
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,850
Are you alright? You must be so shocked.

85
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,710
Huh?

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,680
Cut! Again!

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,890
Hyeong Cheol!

88
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,660
You're alright? You're shocked, right?

89
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,900
Cut. Again!

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,020
Are you alright? You must be so shocked?

91
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,700
What did you say?

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,320
CUT!

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,710
What's taking her so long?? Ah, it hurts.

94
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,790
Gosh, I spit so much that my mouth is dry now.

95
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,790
Joon Ki.

96
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,300
Hyung, how was my acting today? What did the director say?

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,850
I don't know! What was up with your friend? You said she was good!

98
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,140
Oh, it's just her first time acting in so long. She's just nervous. She'll be okay!

99
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,600
It's too late. The director is changing actors.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,700
What? You're saying Jeong Eun is fired?

101
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,580
What are you saying, Hyung? How can you do that?

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,300
Whatever. It's your friend, so you tell her.

103
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,190
Hyung! Hyung! Hyung!

104
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,840
Gosh, what is this? It's driving me crazy.

105
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,800
Joon Ki, did you wait a lot?

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, no.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,750
I made a lot of mistakes today, right? It's been a while so I wasn't good.

108
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,800
Jeong Eun, you know...

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,900
But still, I was really happy today.

110
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,340
Joon Ki, thanks so much! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have started acting again.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,930
Because I'm so thankful, I'll do really, really well, okay?

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
Okay, okay.

113
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,220
But didn't you have something to say just now?

114
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,090
No, it was nothing. Let's just go.

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,110
Oh, it's so hot. Gosh, even though I applied medicine!

116
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,250
Anyway, Gi Bong is not careful at all!

117
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,600
Still, you endured it well.

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,430
I was so afraid that you'd get mad again.

119
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,430
Anyway, you mustn't get mad in front of Soo Yeon, okay??

120
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,900
About that, it's not easy,

121
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,520
It's really hard, so I don't think I can do it anymore.

122
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,250
I'm back.

123
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,570
You're here? Was work hard? Are you hungry?

124
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,500
No, I have no appetite.

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,540
Did something happen?

126
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,060
I was working, but I was scolded so much for not singing well.

127
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,200
So, learn from Woo Sik. He's a vocal trainer, you know!

128
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,920
Really??

129
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,240
Woo Sik, teach me how to sing. Okay?

130
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,070
Okay, sure.

131
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,200
Thanks so much, Woo Sik. I'm going to change real quick.

132
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,860
Noona! What are you doing all of a sudden??

133
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,300
Why? This is your chance! You'll be in a room alone with her.

134
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,930
You can teach her how to sing and talk to her.

135
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,470
Then, you'll kiss her, marry, and have children. That's how it all works.

136
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,670
Does that make sense? You're talking nonsense.

Woo Sik, I'm here!

141
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,290
Oh, you're here?

142
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,700
Woo Sik, what should I start with?

143
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,230
Sing whatever song you like.

144
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,990
I like IU's songs. My tone is similar to hers.

145
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,620
Wow, I'm looking forward to it.

146
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,500
I'll start, then.

♫ This night, ♫

148
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,270
♫  That day ♫

149
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,000
♫ I'll send ♫

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,170
♫  fireflies to you ♫

151
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,550
♫  I am saying ♫

152
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,200
♫  that I love you ♫

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,370
How was it?

154
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,570
Woo Sik, I asked how was it?

155
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,650
Oh... that...

156
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,380
It's good, but... You're a little off-key and a bit off-beat.

157
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,920
Your vocal range is a bit limited, and you ran out of breath a little as well.

158
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,700
Well, that's about it.

159
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,280
Oh, yeah?

160
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,730
I see.

161
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,660
It's fine! We can just fix it.

162
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,760
Let's start line by line.

163
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,740
♫ This night, on that day, ♫

164
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,140
♫ I'll send fireflies to you ♫

165
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,770
- Got it? 
- I see, that's how you do it.

166
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,790
Hearing you sing it, I definitely get it now.

167
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,790
- Okay, so should we start again? 
- Okay.

168
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,030
♫ This night, on that– ♫

169
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,550
Stop! It's the same as before. I thought you said you understood?

170
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,910
Why? I sang the way you taught me.

171
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,430
But, why are you getting mad?

172
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,400
Huh? No, no!

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm not getting mad.

174
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,750
So, Soo Yeon, let's start with one measure at a time.

175
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,920
♫- This night ♫ 
♫ - This night ♫

176
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,800
♫ - On that day ♫ 
 ♫ - On that day ♫

177
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,530
Yeah, so combine those.

178
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,270
♫ This night ♫

179
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,930
♫ on that day, ♫

180
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,780
♫ I send fireflies ♫

181
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,500
♫ to you ♫

182
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,190
Stop it, Han Soo Yeon! Are you playing around right now?

183
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,790
Is singing a joke to you?! I couldn't sing like that if I tried!

184
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,020
And, what? Your tone is similar to IU's?

185
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,820
What a joke!

186
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,740
Oh, you! Oh, you!

187
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,450
Woo Sik!

188
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,340
Woo Sik, what's wrong?

189
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,730
Why are you looking at me like that?

190
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,320
Oh, no. I was admiring it.

191
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,760
Your song was very touching.

192
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,480
Really?

193
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,930
So, should I start again from the top?

194
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,160
♫ This night ♫

195
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,590
♫ On that day ♫

196
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,840
♫ I send fireflies ♫

197
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,580
♫ to you ♫

198
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,500
Oh, you're done with the lesson?

199
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,660
- How was it? Was it fun? 
 - It was, Unni.

200
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,300
Woo Sik taught me so kindly, so I think I got so much better.

201
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,620
Teacher, see you tomorrow!

202
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,340
The atmosphere seems good.

203
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,120
Brother, but, why's your expression like that?

204
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,820
Don't ask. It's my first time seeing someone that tone deaf.

205
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,630
Tone deaf?

206
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,790
- Soo Yeon? 
- Yeah.

207
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,230
She was basically insulting the song.

208
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,040
But, you know what's more shocking?

209
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,210
She doesn't know that she's tone deaf.

210
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:51,730
Once Soo Yeon starts singing, a ball of anger starts rising up in my chest.

211
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,590
I really almost hated her.

212
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,470
Really?

213
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,510
Just how bad is she for you to feel that way?

214
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,960
Just endure it. You can never get angry!

215
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,910
- Got it? 
 - Yeah, Okay.

216
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,740
  Waikiki Guest House

217
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,500
Are you okay? You were surprised, right?

218
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,080
Are you okay? You were surprised, right?

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,380
Which of the 3 sound best?

220
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,110
Um...

221
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,290
It's good. All of them were good.

222
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,950
Really? Oh, I practiced all night. I guess I'm getting the hang of it again.

223
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,910
Oh, I want to go film right away!

224
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,090
Jeong Eun, I have something to tell you.

225
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,540
Something to say? What is it?

226
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,710
Oh, well... The thing with filming movies is...

227
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,350
- Hold on. 
 - Alright.

228
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,260
Hello? Dad?

229
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,920
Filming? Of course, I did well!

230
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,360
Don't worry, I won't disappoint you this time, Dad.

231
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,620
Why are you crying again?

232
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,530
Okay.

233
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,520
Once the film is released, I'll invite you to the premiere, Dad!

234
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,170
Bye.

235
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,110
Wh-Why? Why? Why are you crying? Why?

236
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,210
My dad's so happy.

237
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,870
It's making me cry.

238
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,000
Wait, didn't you have something to say?

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,790
You... no, no...

240
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,040
No, it was nothing.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,570
Oh, I'm going to wash my face.

242
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,790
I'm going crazy.

243
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,510
Why are you like that? Did something happen?

244
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,650
Gi Bong, truthfully...

245
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,920
What? Jeong Eun was fired?

246
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,140
Yeah.

247
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,980
I can't say anything because Jeung Eun will be disappointed. What do I do?

248
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,810
Don't tell her then.

249
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,100
- What do I do about the next shoot? She'll know! 
 - You'll have to tell her, then.

250
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,050
Hey, she's finally determined and started acting again.

251
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,630
What do I do if she quits?

252
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,230
So, just don't tell her.

253
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,160
Hey, you idiot!

254
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm the crazy one for listening to this idiot.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,420
Just die! Die!

256
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,910
♫ Just like the letters on sand ♫

257
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,070
♫ where waves touch ♫

258
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,540
♫ I worry that you will ♫

259
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,360
♫ disappear somewhere far away ♫

260
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,150
Stop! Stop! Please stop!

261
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,280
Why, is it weird somewhere?

262
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,630
No, it's not that.

263
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,470
Just, this song doesn't seem to suit you.

264
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,190
It's such a hard song, too.

265
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,520
So, can you just choose a slightly easier, different song?

266
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,980
Oh, a different song?

267
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,430
Then, how's IU's Good Day?

268
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,350
What? Good Day? The song with the three high notes?

269
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,630
Yes. More than anything, I'm pretty confident about my high notes.

270
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,420
Want to hear it?

271
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,050
Aigoo, one, two.

272
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:08,440
♫ I'm in my dream ♫

273
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,640
♫  What a good day ♫

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,360
How was it?

275
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,210
Oh, it was great.

276
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,760
It was great, but for the three high notes, I think your vocal range

277
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,120
might be just a tiny bit lacking.

278
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,860
It's just a tiny feeling that I have.

279
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,150
So, then, I'll expand my vocal range as much as I can and sing it again.

280
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,050
- Aigoo.  
 - Aigoo.

281
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,090
One, two.

282
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:46,720
♫ I'm in my dream  ♫

283
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,320
Stop it! Stop, Han Soo Yeon!

284
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,970
Is that three high notes? When the note is the same but your hand moves up, are those three different pitches?!

285
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,150
If that works, I could do 30 high notes!

286
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,790
Want to see?

287
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:03,110
♫ I'm in my dream ♫

288
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,770
Saw that? Is that 30 high notes to you?

289
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,180
You call that 30 high notes?!

290
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,040
Do your ears have a problem?

291
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,470
Don't you think they have a problem?!

292
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,070
Woo Sik, how were my three high notes?

293
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,480
Oh. Oh, it was great.

294
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,070
I was so surprised, that's all.

295
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,610
Right? I'll sing from the start.

296

300
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,760
Doctor, why is my Woo Sik sick like this?

301
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,840
He has an emotional disorder from repressed anger.

302
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,040
It's something that middle-aged women suffer from after being agonized for years by their drunkard husbands.

303
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,760
How could this happen to such a young fellow?

304
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,350
This won't do.

305
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,160
Stop teaching her, okay?

306
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,480
No, I have to continue.

307
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,810
It's an opportunity to get closer to Soo Yeon.

308
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,780
Doctor, can you just prescribe me the strongest medicine?

309
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,000
Joon Ki, you said you're filming today, right?

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,940
Yeah.

311
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,950
- Did you tell Jeong Eun? 
 - No.

312
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,110
You still haven't? What are you going to do?

313
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,140
Joon Ki, did you sleep well?

314
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,610
What day is today? Filming day!

315
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,980
Just wait a bit. I'm going to get my stuff and come out.

316
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,560
Look at that? Look at that?? She likes it!

317
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,570
She loves it so much. How could I tell her?

318
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,630
This is driving me nuts.

319
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,370
Hey, is there no other good way out of this?

320
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,960
Just tell her the movie got shut down.

321
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,220
What?

322
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,370
But, what about me? I have to go film!

323
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,310
You can just tell her you're going to get some air.

324
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,280
What? Air?

325
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,740
Wow, you're such a genius! You're not an idiot, you're so smart!

326
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,510
Genius!

327
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,070
- Jeong Eun! 
 - What? I was just going to leave.

328
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,440
The thing is... What do we do?

329
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,060
I just got a call from the producers. They said the movie got shut down.

330
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,750
What? What do you mean?

331
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,080
The investors withdrew all of a sudden and the production's been suspended.

332
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,390
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

333
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,730
Gosh, I never thought this would happen.

334
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,110
Don't be too sad.

335
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,180
You'll get another good chance soon.

336
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,130
You and me both.

337
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,920
Get some rest, okay?

338
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,220
Did you tell her? What'd she say?

339
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,510
She was super disappointed.

340
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,570
It's bothering me.

341
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,460
Hey. Still, it's better to say that the movie got shut down

342
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,440
than to tell her she was fired for not acting well. It's less hurtful.

343
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,610
Yeah, but I feel so bad for her.

344
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,000
Jeong Eun, wh-wh-why are you out?

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,870
Headed somewhere?

346
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,230
I'm going to get some air.

347
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,950
Air? Where are you going all of a sudden?

348
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm going to the filming site.

349
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,640
What? The filming site?

350
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,440
Why go there?

351
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,310
I practiced all night the last few days, so

352
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,030
I'm just disappointed it's over.

353
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,410
Disappointed? Why would you go there?

354
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,880
You'll just feel sad.

355
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,950
And no one's going to be there!

356
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,210
I know.

357
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,540
Still, I want to see the filming site to get some closure.

358
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,150
I'll be back.

359
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,250
Huh? Jeong Eun. Jeong Eun!

360
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,530
Gi Bong, what do I do now?

361
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,320
You shouldn't have told her.

362
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,590
What? You fool! Dummy!

363
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,470
I was the crazy one listening to this idiot, ugh!

364
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,050
  Waikiki Enjoy Today

365
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,900
Jeong Eun, Jeong Eun! Wait a second!

366
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,450
Wait.

367
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,030
Why do you have to go there?

368
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,620
If you go, you'll feel hurt. Does it make sense to go?

369
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,390
I know.

370
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,850
But what do I do when I have these regrets and feel upset?

371
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,060
I know.

372
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,470
I know. I know that you're upset! Of course, I know.

373
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,650
But don't go to the filming site.

374
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,150
- Joon Ki 
 - Yeah, what?

375
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,560
Should we go for a drink?

376
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,980
No, it's so bright out! Why would we have to drink?

377
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,540
Why drink?

378
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,020
And, you always fall asleep after drinking.

379
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,610
Then... I'll just go to the filming

380
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,960
site after all.

381
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
The filming site? Hey!

382
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,520
Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun!

383
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,130
Gosh, Joon Ki.

384
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,560
Jeong Eun!

385
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,310
Okay, let's go. Let's go get drinks.

386
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,360
You said let's not drink because I always fall asleep if I drink.

387
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,310
That's why we should drink!

388
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,160
Sometimes it's not bad to drink and fall asleep.

389
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,090
Let's go and drink!

390
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,470
- Eat up. 
 - Thank you!

391
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,650
  Alright, she falls asleep after drinking. I'll have her drink quickly.

392
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,760
  I'll go to the filming site afterward.

393
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,170
Jeong Eun. Here.

394
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,620
There you go.

395
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,460
Alright, drink that in one go. Have a good sleep, then forget it all.

396
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,140
- Got it? 
-  Yeah.

397
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,680
- Wait, you're not drinking? 
 - Ah,

398
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,080
That's because my insides don't feel so good. It's okay, you drink.

399
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,060
Then forget it. What's the point if there's no one to drink with me?

400
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,400
I just want to go to the filming site.

401
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,210
Film... Filming? No, no, no.

402
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,220
Let's. Let's drink together.

403
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,160
Sit.

404
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,560
Don't be like this.

405
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,830
Here, here. Cheers.

406
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,000
Here, here. Have more.

407
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,100
More, more.

408
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,570
Again? Why are we drinking so quickly?

409
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,380
Drinking is more fun if you drink fast.

410
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,250
Here, just have it.

411
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,290
Cheers!

412
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,360
Be careful.

413
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,350
What medicine is this? Are you sick?

414
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,550
You don't need to know.

415
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,500
I'm back.

416
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,940
You're here?

417
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,240
It's alright. It's alright.

418
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,280
Why do you have so little energy?

419
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,440
I got scolded so much for not singing well at the event.

420
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,890
My boss told me to not touch the mic again.

421
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,920
Woo Sik, I want to stop learning singing.

422
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,020
Huh? Why?

423
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,660
I just want to look into official vocal lessons.

424
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,330
What? Vocal lessons?

425
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,520
Yeah.

426
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,300
I think it'd be better to learn from a more experienced teacher.

427
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:34,070
What? Are you saying that I didn't teach you properly because I lack the skills?

428
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,790
I'm not trying to say that, but I think it was partially your fault.

429
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
What?

430
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,470
Now that we're talking about it, I didn't like your lesson style.

431
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,930
You didn't have proper equipment or books. We did the same thing every time.

432
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,100
And, you should tell me properly and scold me if there's a problem.

433
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,130
But, you tell me I'm good all the time. How am I supposed to get better?

434
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,530
You're so nice that you have no charisma.

435
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,980
Stop! Stop! Hey, Han Soo Yeon!

436
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,510
Are you done?! I'm the problem, you say?!

437
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,120
You tell me that you're not improving because I'm not teaching you properly?

438
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,150
Hey, even if Freddie Mercury came back to life,

439
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,890
he couldn't fix you! You're completely tone deaf!

440
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,100
While I was teaching you, I got an emotional disorder from repressed anger.

441
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,560
I even got herbal medicine prescribed to me. Did you know that?!

442
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,080
But what did you say? How could you blabber such nonsense?

443
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,410
This... This mouth is the problem.

444
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,790
Your mouth is just so...!

445
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,460
Cha Woo Sik! What do you think you're doing right now!?

446
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,650
What?

447
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,080
Woo Sik, are you crazy? What are you doing?

448
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,770
Why? Isn't this just my imagination?

449
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,440
Imagination? This? You crazy bastard!

450
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,350
What? This has to be my imagination.

451
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,190
Then...

452
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,910
Oh, Soo Yeon!

453
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,360
Alright. I'm sorry for being tone deaf. I'm so sorry!

454
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,970
Oh, well...

455
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,020
I really thought this was my imagination. It has been for this whole time!

456
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,800
So... I thought it was my imagination again.

457
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,350
Oh, so you kept swearing at me internally this whole time?

458
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,450
What? No, no. Well...

459
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,600
Whatever!

460
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,110
Don't talk to me from now on, you jerk!

461
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,890
Soo Yeon! I'm sorry!

462
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,820
Soo Yeon! I really thought it was my imagination!

463
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,630
  Gosh, why isn't she falling asleep today?

464
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,780
  It's almost filming time for me. This is driving me crazy.

465
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,780
  Nothing I can do. I'll just have to send her to bed.

466
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,390
Hey, hey. Take it.

467
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,180
Isn't this a bit overboard?

468
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,000
Drink it!

469
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,590
Let's go. Let's drink it!

470
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,840
Alright. Let's go!

471
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,680
Okay! She's asleep!

472
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,460
My phone, my phone.

473
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,720
Gi Bong?

474
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,620
I'm at the Twin's Bar.

475
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,630
Jeong Eun fell asleep.

476
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:47,750
I need to film, so you come and take her.

477
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,360
Okay. Okay. Thanks.

478
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,810
Joon Ki, where are you going?

479
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,610
I'm not going anywhere.

480
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,730
Where would I go?

481
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,170
Come back, we have to have another drink.

482
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,820
Let's go.

483
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,050
Let's have one more!

484
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,350
She's really asleep.

485
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,030
Are you okay??

486
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,030
Ahjumma, shh.

487
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,930
My friend is coming to pick her up,

488
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,190
so don't wake her up!

489
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,000
I need to go. I need to go to film.

490
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,580
Is everything ready?

491
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,780
Hello.

492
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,730
Joon Ki, your gaze looks so good today.

493
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,020
Thank you.

494
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,920
Even your voice is like a ghost.

495
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,280
Alright, let's film right away.

496
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,350
Yes, sir.

497
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,000
Yes, sir.

498
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,100
Ready? Action!

499
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,560
What is your name?

500
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,030
Park Yi Dong.

501
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,300
Park Yi Dong.

502
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,500
It was you all this time. By the name of God,

503
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,990
Come out of this man's body right now!

504
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,780
- Hyeong Cheol! 
 - Are you okay?

505
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,090
You were so scared, right?

506
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,480
This won't do.

507
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,780
Maria, the Holy Water!

508
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,170
Yes, Father.

509
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,860
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

510
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,420
be gone, Satan!

511
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,360
Cut!

512
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,170
Wow!

513
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,490
Good job.

514
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,480
During my 30 years of being a director, I've never seen such great possession acting.

515
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,280
Thank you!

516
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,570
Lee Joon Ki, you definitely have the main role on my next project!

517
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,310
Me?

518
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,180
Oh, thank you!

519
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,690
Then... Can I see the acting you did just now again?

520
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,970
Again? Of course!

521
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,970
I'll show it to you.

522
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,400
Let's lie down.

523
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,200
Ahhh!

524
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,370
Gi Bong!

525
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,420
Ahjumma? What happened?

526
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,830
You told me to come.

527
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,650
Me? No, I never said that.

528
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,050
Wait a bit, okay?

529
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,990
I need to do it. I need to act.

530
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,610
Ahjumma, how long has he been like this?

531
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,470
He fainted as he tried to leave earlier, and that's how he's been.

532
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,190
Park Yi Dong!!

533
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,510
That scared me.

534
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,770
What's he doing?

535
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,770
Are you okay? You were scared, right?

536
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,080
Are you okay? You were scared, right?

537
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,840
What's with her?

538
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,980
Gosh, they're the embarrassment of the neighborhood.

539
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,190
Are you okay? You were scared, right?

540
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,850
Are you okay? You were scared, right?

541
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,250
Hey.

542
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,060
How long will you be like that? Why'd you drink so much?

543
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,650
Jeong Eun kept saying she'd go to the filming site. What was I supposed to do?

544
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,580
I'm just glad Jeong Eun didn't get hurt.

545
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,090
You care about her too much.

546
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,270
Did you apologize to Soo Yeon?

547
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,730
No, I didn't. She's not even talking to me. How could I?

548
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,490
Why did you humiliate her so much? Singing terribly isn't such a crime.

549
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,340
Do you hate her that much? Why do you always criticize her?

550
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,420
When did I ever?

551
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,880
You did it every day!

552
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,980
He didn't like how she moved in from the beginning, too!

553
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,620
Yeah, right? She's already having a hard time because of her dad's bankruptcy. You shouldn't be like that.

554
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,120
When did I ever?

555
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,190
I'm here.

556
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,140
Oh, Soo Yeon. Hi.

557
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,340
Hurry.

558
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,700
Soo Yeon. I'm sorry about yesterday. Don't be mad anymore, okay?

559
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,010
Whatever. I'm exhausted. I'm going in.

560
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,420
I said I'm sorry. Just let it go!

561
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,040
It's not because of you!

562
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,900
Then, what is it? What's wrong? Tell me.

563
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,940
Tell me!

564
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,800
I was fired from my job!

565
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,130
So, I'm so sad! Why are you getting angry with me, you jerk!

566
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,160
What...

567
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,270
You little...

568
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,990
Hey, are you a human or the devil?!

569
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,600
You bastard!

570
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,460
You're such a bad person!

571
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,150
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

572
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,380
  Boyfriend

573
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,360
- Good work today, Gi Bong. 
 - You, too.

574
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,350
Gi Bong.

575
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,320
You were so disappointed after failing the first-string test, right?

576
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,250
- No. 
 - Yeah, right.

577
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,990
Honestly, the first-string coach was thinking about you a lot until the very end.

578
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,200
He said your ball power is good, but your pitches are too simple.

579
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,840
If you add a forkball or something like that, it'll be perfect.

580
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,000
Forkball?

581
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,730
What's for lunch?

582
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,290
Excuse me. You made Soo Yeon cry like that yesterday, and you can still think of food?

583
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,500
Anyway, you better apologize to her again properly. Got it, you devil?!

584
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,020
I got it!

585
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,120
I'll be off.

586
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,880
- Where are you going? 
 - None of your business.

587
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,560
What are you doing, Noona?

588
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,260
I've had enough fun. I have to start working again.

589
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,490
You're going to work? You're going to do hotel kitchen work again?

590
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,330
Am I crazy? Why would I do that again?

591
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,550
No matter how hard I try, if I didn't study abroad, I'm just looked down on and humiliated.

592
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm going to start my own restaurant. I already made a name.

593
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,120
Yuri's Kitchen. What a killer name, right?

594
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,150
Do you have the money for a restaurant?

595
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,860
No. I'm going to start saving up.

596
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,690
Along with the deposit and everything else, it'll be ₩50,000,000 (~$50,000).

597
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,120
₩50,000,000? How much do you have right now?

598
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,140
₩3,800. ($3.80)

599
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,830
Now I only need ₩49,996,200 (~$49,996.20) more!

600
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh, of course.

601
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,740
So, Brother. If you have some remaining money, invest in me. Yeah?

602
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,300
Look at you saying nonsense. I'll never do that.

603
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,020
Really?

604
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,600
Where do I get money from?

605
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,440
Is there no young, rich fool out there?

606
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,760
Whose phone is that?

607
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,630
I think it's Gi Bong's.

608
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,090
Really?

609
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,160
Then, I'll have to hand it over to him.

610
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,880
You want me to teach you forkball?

611
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,480
Yes. Sunbae, you're the best at the forkball in the entire country.

612
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,940
Well, that's true, but... Hey!

613
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,800
Not everybody can do it.

614
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,580
Sunbae, please don't sneer at me.

615
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm not sneering at you. It's just so ridiculous.

616
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,870
There you go again! Stop sneering. Just teach me forkball!

617
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,160
- No, no. 
 - Sunbae!

618
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,290
- No! No! 
 - Gook Gi Bong!

619
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,260
Noona!

620
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,490
Noona, why are you here?

621
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,910
Oh, you left your phone at home. So, I came to give it to you. Here.

622
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,720
Oh, really? Thanks.

623
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,940
No need.

624
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,930
I'll have to take ₩22,000 for my efforts. It includes taxes.

625
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,390
- For your efforts? Taxes? 
 - Hey.

626
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,340
Even if you buy a piece of candy from a store, you're taxed for it. Hurry and pay up.

627
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,380
How funny. Just take it back then.

628
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,370
What? You're going to be like this? You'll regret it.

629
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,100
Regret it? What are you going to do?

630
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,310
The guys don't know that I was your first kiss.

631
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,020
Should I expose it to them?

632
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,760
If you want, I can just put it on your team's homepage, too.

633
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,580
No, no! Noona! I'll give it to you.

634
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,960
Instead, keep it a secret.

635
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,800
You should've done so sooner.

636
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,590
Okay! Now there’s ₩49,974,200 (~$49,974.20) left to get.

637
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,490
Thank you.

638
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,270
She's crazy.

639
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,080
Who was that?

640
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,570
Huh? Oh, she's just a close friend's older sister.

641
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,880
Oh, really?

642
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,740
What? A blind date? No thanks. I have no time for that.

643
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,660
Don't be like that. Just go on the blind date!

644
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,180
Byeong Cheol Sunbae said that he'd teach me forkball if you go.

645
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,380
I have to learn it to be moved up to first string!

646
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,800
Oh, I don't know. I have no time. If I want to open Yuri's Kitchen, I need money.

647
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,370
Money? Then, I'll give you ₩50,000 (~50).

648
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,720
Who do you see me as?

649
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,220
₩100,000. I'll exclude the taxes.

650
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,020
Oh, okay. You're doing it, okay? I'm going to set up the date.

651
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,620
Alright.

652
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,340
Now there’s ₩49,874,200 (~$49,874.20) left!

653
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,090
Look at you earning money so well.

654
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,830
What?

655
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,610
I'm here.

656
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,020
Where is Soo Yeon?

657
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,030
I don't know. She's been stuck in her room all day. She hasn't eaten.

658
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,830
What's with the cake?

659
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,400
It's not yours, so mind your own business.

660
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,350
Soo Yeon, what are you doing?

661
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,770
I... Here.

662
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,720
I bought cheesecake for you. It's the one you like.

663
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,030
Thanks, but I don't have an appetite.

664
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,080
Cheer up.

665
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,710
Why are you being like this after being cut from a part-time job?

666
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,960
Just...  I feel pathetic.

667
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,790
Pathetic, you say?

668
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:13,130
I can't even do household chores properly, and I always get fired from making mistakes at a part-time job.

669
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,570
I can't do anything properly.

670
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:22,620
Joon Ki. I thought I was really well off,

671
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,300
but I feel like I've become such a fool.

672
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,660
How did I end up like this?

673
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,030
I feel like such a fool now. I'm going crazy.

674
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,300
I don't even have Dad here, so I feel lonely and it's hard on me.

675
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,290
What are you going to do? Soo Yeon seemed really hurt.

676
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,390
Yeah.

677
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,770
Do you think there's a way to make her feel better?

678
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,580
I thought about it hard. I have a good idea.

679
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,850
A good idea? What is it?

680
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,220
I'll have to be Soo Yeon's boyfriend!

681
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,800
What? B-Boyfriend?

682
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,560
What are you saying? How could you come to that conclusion?

683
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,760
Think about it.

684
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,940
She needs a trustworthy boyfriend like me, who is also considerate like her father,

685
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,480
in order for Soo Yeon to suffer less and be less lonely. Don't you think so?

686
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,460
So since Soo Yeon's having a hard time, you'll be her boyfriend?

687
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,670
Yes.

688
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,620
Isn't that a way to show respect to my first love?

689
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,690
Does that make sense?

690
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,580
But do you like Soo Yeon?

691
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,850
No. But, I'll start liking her again now.

692
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,300
What? No! No! Never!

693
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,810
Why? Who are you to say that?

694
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,090
Why do you care if I like her or not?

695
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,330
Well... Um.

696
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,120
- You're too good for her. 
 - Huh?

697
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,010
You're so handsome with a great personality and you're loyal.

698
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,060
Your body's nice, too.

699
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,430
Wh-What?

700
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:58,610
And, on top of that, you're so sexy. Why would you waste that all on someone like Soo Yeon?

701
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,520
Don't you think so, Gi Bong?

702
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,630
I don't know if Joon Ki's the one that's too good for the other.

703
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,060
I don't know, either.

704
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,490
But I feel as if you'll make her more uncomfortable by doing something unnecessary like that.

705
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,510
Is that so?

706
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,760
Well, just forget it, then.

707
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,740
Yeah. Good thinking.

708
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,830
Alright.

709
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,560
Don't worry.

710
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,540
I'll make sure you learn forkball or whatever it is.

711
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,710
I'm hanging up.

712
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,440
Gosh, that annoying little...

713
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,210
Who the hell is it?

714
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,380
- Yu Ri, here! 
 - Oh, my!

715
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,000
Hello!

716
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,140
  He's handsome.

717
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,340
  He's tall. He's totally my ideal type!

718
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,710
So, your hobby is volunteering.

719
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:52,570
When I see people having a hard time, I'm the kind of person that just can't stand by.

720
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,990
Oh, I see.

721
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,830
But... I heard from Gi Bong that you're a chef?

722
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:04,170
Yes. Cooking makes me the happiest in the world.

723
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,990
Then... What kind of food do you cook?

724
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,630
Korean food? Western food? Japanese food? Chinese food?

725
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,630
Or... Choi Min Sik? 
   (T/N: Choi Min Sik is an actor (oldboy). In Korean, food/cuisine (umsik) sounds similar to “minsik.”

726
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,340
  What... Why does he laugh like that?

727
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,190
I was joking. Was it not funny?

728
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:34,850
I thought of that and I laughed all night. Thinking about it now makes me laugh!

729
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,040
  What the heck? What's that laughter?

730
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,400
...Min Sik...

731
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,290
  Why? What's wrong with him?

732
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,970
  I can't do this!

733
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,070
Gook Gi Bong!

734
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,190
Oh, you're here, Noona? Sunbae said how much he likes you—

735
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,670
Shut up. Are you crazy?

736
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,720
Why? You don't like him?

737
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,840
Of course not!

738
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,870
What kind of man laughs like that?

739
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,330
I can't even mimic it!

740
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,040
It's because of that? His laugh is a bit unique.

741
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,130
Anyway, I can't meet him anymore.

742
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,290
- Got it? 
 - What?

743
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,080
Noona! Please, I'm begging you.

744
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,920
I need to learn forkball!

745
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,160
I need to go up to first string this time! Please?

746
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,010
You're making me feel sorry for you!

747
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,330
Alright. Then, compensate me for my mental state as well and pay ₩50,000 (~$50) more,

748
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,540
or else I can't do it. Not even if I die!

749
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,630
Alright, I'll give it to you.

750
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,120
Thanks, Noona.

751
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,160
Whatever. Just get off of me.

752
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,730
You're not even a dongsaeng. You're an enemy!

753
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,310
Thanks, Noona! Thanks!

754
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,820
How was your date?

755
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,870
- Why's she like that? 
 - No reason.

756
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,110
Where's Joon Ki?

757
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,430
Joon Ki? Oh, he's on a date with Soo Yeon.

758
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,810
What? Date? Joon Ki and Soo Yeon?

759
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,290
Yeah. He said how he can't ignore Soo Yeon's loneliness or whatever,

760
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,280
so he went out to confess to her.

761
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,330
What? Confess? This little...

762
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,970
Where is he? Where are they?!

763
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,110
Cheers.

764
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,600
It's good. Thanks, Joon Ki.

765
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,080
Oh, no problem.

766
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,480
Oh, how is it? Do you feel better?

767
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,800
Yeah. Thanks to you.

768
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,540
What a relief.

769
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,460
Tell me if you want to do anything else. I can do it all for you!

770
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,290
Anything else?

771
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,900
Oh, I've been feeling stuffy lately. I wanted to see the ocean.

772
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,870
Let's go see the ocean!

773
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,890
Oh, no! I just threw it out there.

774
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,150
Oh, really? Really?

775
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,920
Yeah.

776
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,590
You're a bit weird today.

777
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,420
Why are you being so nice to me? Did you do something wrong?

778
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,680
What? No, no. I didn't do anything wrong.

779
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,750
Well, actually, I had something to tell you.

780
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,370
Something to tell me? What is it?

781
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:01,350
Well... Soo Yeon.

782
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,670
I...

783
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,150
Joon Ki!

784
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,190
Gosh, what the heck?

785
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,180
That scared me.

786
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,380
Woo Sik, why are you here?

787
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,500
Oh, you told me to officially apologize to Soo Yeon.

788
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,430
Yeah, I did.

789
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,600
Soo Yeon, I'm sorry for getting angry with you while teaching you how to sing.

790
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,910
And, I'm sorry for getting mad at you over you getting fired.

791
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,250
I'm being sincere.

792
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,170
Oh, okay.

793
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,780
Yeah, she got it. Go now.

794
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,570
- I'm not done. 
 - What?

795
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,000
- Soo Yeon? 
 - Yeah?

796
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,650
I'm sorry.

797
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,660
I'm sorry.

798
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,030
I'm sorry.

799
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,700
I'm sorry.

800
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,790
- I'm sorry. 
 - Huh?

801
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,980
Enough. That's good enough. Just go.

802
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,400
I'm sorry.

803
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,220
I'm sorry.

804
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm sorry.

805
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,390
I'm sorry.

806
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,210
What'd you say?

807
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,150
I'm sorry.

808
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,900
I'm saying I'm sorry.

809
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,350
Hey, Cha Woo Sik. What were you doing?

810
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,460
Why'd you try to apologize in 50 languages?

811
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,000
I couldn't confess to her because of you!

812
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,730
You told me to officially apologize, so I did it sincerely.

813
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,450
Does that make sense?

814
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,330
I'm so suspicious of you.

815
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,460
You were so against it when I said I'd try to be with Soo Yeon.

816
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,550
And, you chased after us today at the wine bar.

817
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,790
Do you like Soo Yeon?

818
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,810
- What? 
 - Hey!

819
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,360
Does that make sense? Don't you know Woo Sik really doesn't like Soo Yeon?

820
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,470
Yeah. I guess that wouldn't make sense.

821
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,190
Anyway, why are you being like that? What's your reason?

822
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,660
What reason? I just went to apologize to her.

823
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,400
Move.

824
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,120
How suspicious.

825
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,240
There's something here.

826
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,790
It's so weird no matter how much I think of it.

827
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,450
There's something going on with Woo Sik.

828
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,320
What? Joon Ki tried to confess to Soo Yeon?

829
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,170
But, why?

830
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,750
I don't know. What do I do now, Noona?

831
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,250
What else would you do?

832
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,620
Confess to Joon Ki about how you feel.

833
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,750
What?

834
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,720
But... Would Joon Ki understand my feelings?

835
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,870
Love is love. It's not a crime.

836
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,410
Yeah, but... I'm afraid that it'll make our friendship so awkward.

837
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,220
Are you going to give up, then?

838
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,620
How long will you keep this a secret?

839
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:36,060
Joon Ki will find out at one point. It'll be more awkward if he finds out later on.

840
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,800
So, just confess the truth to Joon Ki.

841
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,650
Tell him you had feelings first.

842
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:47,320
From high school until now, it's all been love.

843
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,570
From now on, tell him you'll keep on loving.

844
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,900
L-Love?

845
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,460
What's wrong with you? Did you see a ghost or something?

846
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,360
Gi Bong. This whole time, Woo Sik...

847
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,200
Woo Sik... has liked me.

848
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,250
- What? 
 - It's been love from high school until now.

849
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,890
He's going to keep on loving me.

850
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,050
What are you saying?

851
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:30,540
I heard Woo Sik and Yu Ri talking with my own two ears!

852
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,590
You must've heard wrong. Does that make sense?

853
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,350
I thought it didn't make sense, either.

854
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,960
But I think it makes sense now that I think about it.

855
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,560
Do you remember what Woo Sik said yesterday?

856
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,350
  You're too good for her.

857
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:47,650
  You're handsome, with a great personality and you're loyal.

858
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,380
  Your body is great, too.

859
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,890
  And, on top of that, you're sexy, too.

860
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,690
  You're too good for Soo Yeon, why'd you go out with someone like her?

861
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:01,590
That, well, it was a bit weird, but... No way!

862
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,550
Then, how can you explain how he interfered when I said I was going to confess to Soo Yeon at the wine bar?

863
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,580
Do you think he came because of Soo Yeon?

864
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,730
That doesn't make sense, either. He hates Soo Yeon.

865
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:15,830
Exactly! He came because of me!

866
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,750
Because he loves me!

867
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,060
L-Love?

868
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,810
And, that's why he hated the fact that Soo Yeon moved in.

869
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,930
That's why he's been criticizing her all this time.

870
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,990
Because he didn't want to lose me to Soo Yeon.

871
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,270
How's that? Doesn't that fit perfectly?

872
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,930
That's true. What will you do, Joon Ki?

873
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,730
Joon Ki, I have something to tell you.

874
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,970
No. Don't tell me.

875
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,020
Don't say a word.

876
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,890
Why are you like this?

877
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,290
Don't say anything, I said! I have nothing to speak to you about.

878
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,800
I have nothing to say to you!

879
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,130
What? What's with him?

880
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,000
I don't know either.

881
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,130
Yu Ri, how is this? It's a great vibe, right?

882
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,300
Yes.

883
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,530
But... I requested a window seat. Why'd you choose the corner?

884
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:17,700
  It’s all because of you! It’s because even though you’re a person, you laugh like a donkey.

885
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:24,260
Just because. I like the corner seats a lot.

886
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,330
Oh, I see.

887
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,600
Alright. You should choose something first.

888
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,930
Yes.

889
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,110
The mushroom pasta is good here.

890
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,520
Oh, and, Yu Ri, do you know what the most inappropriate vegetable is?

891
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,480
What?

892
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,490
What?

893
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,450
Mushroom!

894
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,880
  Here he goes again.

895
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,890
So do you know when the expiration date is for salt?

896
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,190
Mineral salt!

897
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,360
Mineral salt! Ha!

898
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,040
Byeong Cheol!

899
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,070
You startled me! What's wrong, Yoo Ri?

900
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,480
I'm sorry for saying this, but

901
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,990
can you please stop laughing?

902
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,070
My laughter is a bit unique, right?

903
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,040
But it's been like that since I was born. I can't really fix it.

904
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,290
I'm sorry.

905
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:35,820
No, it's fine. I think it'd be great if you just laughed a tiny bit less.

906
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,850
Then, I'll try to hold back my laughter in front of you, Yu Ri.

907
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,070
Thank you.

908
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,640
Who is it?

909
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,410
Yeah. Before I run into Woo Sik again, I'll just grab my clothes.

910
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,240
Just my clothes.

911
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,000
You scared me!

912
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,690
Woo Sik?

913
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,740
Why'd you get so scared?

914
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,960
Joon Ki. I have to tell you something. Let's go somewhere quiet and have a drink, yeah?

915
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,330
A drink? No!

916
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,440
I quit drinking!

917
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,230
Really? Should we have coffee, then?

918
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,880
Coffee? No!

919
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,160
I quit coffee!

920
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,130
You quit coffee, too? Then, let's just talk here.

921
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,880
Talk? Leave it!

922
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,050
I quit talking.

923
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,180
What are you talking about? This is really important.

924
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,960
I told you I quit talking.

925
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,810
Don't come. Don't come near me!

926
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,990
- It will only take a second. What's wrong with you? 
- Don't come.

927
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,960
Don't talk to me.

928
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,780
What are you doing right now, you punk?

929
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,940
What? I'm doing this because of you.

930
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,260
Woo Sik, what has gotten into you? Why are you doing this to me?

931
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,170
I'm just your good friend. That's all.

932
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,920
What? What are you saying right now?

933
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,940
I know it all, you punk!

934
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,460
You love me!

935
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,930
What? What are you saying?

936
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:12,440
What? So, the person you like is not me but Soo Yeon?

937
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,930
Be quiet. It just turned out that way somehow.

938
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,460
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

939
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,440
It's fine! As long as it's not me, it's fine!

940
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,460
I don't care as long as it isn't me, Woo Sik!

941
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,020
What is wrong with you?

942
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,920
- Hey, you need to keep it a secret. 
 - Okay, I will.

943
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,520
From now on, I'll keep pushing you and Soo Yeon together.

944
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,760
Do not worry at all.

945
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,410
How was the food? Did you enjoy it?

946
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,270
Yes,  it was good.

947
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,420
I like the atmosphere very much.

948
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,910
That's a relief.

949
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,970
Tomorrow, let's watch a movie. I'll reserve our tickets.

950
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,630
Okay.

951
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,100
  It's great now that he isn't laughing.

952
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,110
 He is handsome, he is well-mannered.

953
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,780
Then, should we go now?

954
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,300
Yes.

955
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,100
Byeong Cheol.

956
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:14,950
Dad! Mom! Kyeong Woon!

957
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,430
It's nice to meet you.

958
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,820
You are so much more beautiful than what I heard from Byeong Cheol.

959
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,070
Thank you.

960
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,260
But does my brother treat you well?

961
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,420
All he does is exercise, so he doesn't have dating skills.

962
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,080
What are you saying? I treat her like a princess.

963
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,090
- Right? 
 - What?

964
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,490
Yes.

965
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:44,690
Anyway, I hope you two date for a long time.

966
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:48,770
Do you know what you call a bean in English?

967
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,420
What?

968
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,760
I'm not sure.

969
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,340
Won Bin.

970
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,110
Won Bin?

971
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,220
  What? What the heck?

972
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,590
  Why is he like that?

973
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,820
  I can't believe this. They laugh the same!

974
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,680
What the heck? Why is it Won Bin?

975
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,880
Mom, geez. One in English is pronounced, "Won," and bean is pronounced "Bin."

976
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,270
So, one bean is Won Bin.

977
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:26,450
Oh, that's why it's Won Bin.

978
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,570
Don't laugh like that!

979
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,220
I'm going to start laughing, too!

980
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:39,060
  What kind of family is this?

981
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,100
  We're hiring!

982
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,180
  I'm really sorry.

983
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,740
  You have no experience, so I don't think it'll work out.

984
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,050
Woo Sik!

985
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,990
Soo Yeon, get in.

986
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,630
What? Why?

987
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,790
We have to go somewhere. Get in! It's urgent.

988
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,890
Go where?

989
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,090
Gosh, for just ₩100,000 (~$100).

990
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,440
Even if he gave me ₩10,000,000 (~$10,000), I couldn't date him.

991
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,380
I'm going to tell Gi Bong and break up right away.

992

00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,040
Yoo Ri, why were you not picking up the phone?

998
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,860
Did I make a mistake today?

999
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,020
What?

1000
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,560
No, you didn't make a mistake.

1001
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,360
I'll see you tomorrow at the movies.

Hey, Gook Gi Bong. If you don't make it onto first string,

1009
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,520
I'm going to die! Got it?

1010
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,780
You little...

1011
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,900
Gosh!

00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,240
That psycho! Ow.

00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,180
Gosh!

1015
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,960
I'm here.

1016
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,480
You're here? How'd the audition go? Well?

1017
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,210
Well, I tried my best.

1018
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,130
But, Lee Joon Ki, what happened to you?

1019
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,060
- With what? 
 - I met the assistant director coincidentally

1020
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,850
and he said our movie wasn't shut down.

1021
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,440
About that...

1022
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,320
I heard I was fired because of bad acting. Why would you lie?

1023
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,670
Well, I was afraid you'd be hurt.

1024
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:32,270
I was worried that you'd give up again.

1025
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:36,090
Why would I give up? I won't ever give up!

1026
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:40,190
You should have gone to the filming site. Why'd you not go because of me?

1027
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,940
It's fine, it's fine.

1028
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,550
If we die, we die together. If we live, we live together.

1029
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,940
Thank you.

1030
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,000
Hey, I'm hungry too. Give me a bite of ramen.

1031
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,760
No, go make your own!

1032
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,000
You said we'd die together and live together!

1033
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,440
Ramen is excluded from that, so get lost! What are you saying?!

1034
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,950
Just give me a bite!

1035
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,620
What is this? What?

1036
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,760
Give me some!

1037
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,200
Wow, I haven't seen the ocean in so long.

1038
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,560
I love it.

1039
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,570
Is the place you wanted to come to?

1040
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,820
Yeah. I suddenly wanted to see the ocean.

1041
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,820
I didn't want to see it alone.

1042
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:23,200
Really? I also wanted to see the ocean because it was stuffy these days.

1043
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,600
Really?

1044
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,520
Oh, what a great coincidence. I can't believe it.

1045
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,490
Anyway, thanks to you, I saw the ocean. Thanks.

1046
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,060
Don't mention it.

1047
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,830
Soo Yeon. Do you know what the word "fool" is a shortened version of?

1048
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:43,190
Ocean Treasure?

1049
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,030
Oh, you know! Wow.

1050
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,780
Han Soo Yeon, I thought you were a fool, but you aren't.

1051
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,290
What are you saying all of a sudden?

1052
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,810
You said that

1053
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,850
you've been feeling like you're a fool now.

1054
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,060
But, from what I see, you're not a fool.

1055
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:01,950
Who cares if you can't do household chores or if you get fired from making mistakes?

1056
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,050
It's your first time doing it all.

1057
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:09,800
That's not being a fool. It's trial and error.

1058
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,840
Soo Yeon. Without trial and error,

1059
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,190
there's no one in this world who's good at anything from the start.

1060
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,960
So, cheer up.

1061
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,960
Even though your father isn't here, we're next to you.

1062
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,890
Hey, you have five people on your side. What is there to be afraid of?

1063
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:35,220
So, whenever you're stressed or burnt out, feel free to lean on us.

1064
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,820
Don't keep it all bottled up inside.

1065
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:41,730
You're right. Thank you.

1066
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,270
Shall we go now?

1067
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,000
Let's go.

1068
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,940
Where is it?

1069
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,520
What?

1070
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,250
The car key is gone. I had it in my pocket.

1071
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,680
What?

1072
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,850
Gosh, I must've dropped it when we were walking. What should we do?

1073
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,420
Hey, why are you even asking? Hurry and find it!

1074
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,360
Okay, I'll look for it.

1075
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,810
- This is crazy.
 - Gosh, what an idiot.

1076
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:13,200
What? Did you just call me an idiot? Are you done, you dimwit?

1077
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,880
What? "Dimwit"?

1078
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,260
Yes, I'm done. You stupid blockhead.

1079
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,560
What? "Stupid Blockhead"? I'm a stupid blockhead, not just a blockhead?

1080
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,170
Yes, you stupid blockhead.

1081
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,300
Gosh, you're so childish.

1082

Hurry up and find it!

 How long have you been staring at homeless people's photos?

1091
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,390
 I'm researching.

1092
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:49,770
 So you're an actor,

1093
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:51,100
 and you'll be playing a homeless man?

1094
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,770
 I'd like to experience how the homeless live.

1095

 I'll be re-evaluated tomorrow for the first string.

 So I don't have to see Byeong Cheol anymore?

1097
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,660
 Byeong Cheol, I have something to tell you...

1098
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,400
 - You should run the kitchen here?
 - What?

1099
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,630
 This time, I'll be sure to join first string.

1100

 Gi Bong, you're confident, right?

1101
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,560
 He's too ambitious for his own good.

1102
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,490
 First string? That fool should really know his place.

1103
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:13,220
 What do you even know? How could you call yourself his sunbae, you jerk?
