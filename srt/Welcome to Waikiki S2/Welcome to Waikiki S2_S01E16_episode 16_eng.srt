1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,050
I like you, Teacher.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,510
What?

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,120
I like you.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,970
What are you saying all of a sudden?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,310
I'll be outside.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,600
Oh, Soo Yeon! When did you get here?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,690
What? I just came.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,270
Oh, Soo Yeon. How'd you get here?

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,870
I was on the phone with Unni, and I heard you collapsed. What happened?

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,420
His fever was so bad from the cold that he collapsed.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,750
Really?

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,390
You should've told me. Because of me, you...

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,190
Hey, it's not because of you. So, don't worry about it.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,860
But how was it at work?

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,370
Ah, well...

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,800
Soo Yeon. I'm fine, so go quickly.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,020
You said it was such an important presentation. Hurry up and go.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,990
Alright.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,030
♫  In my love love love you, fall in love  ♫

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,860
♫  love love you forever   ♫

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,980
♫   love love is for with you  ♫

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,490
♫  Forever by your side,   ♫

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,070
♫   your warmth  ♫

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,030
♫  I'll embrace it,  ♫

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,050
- Yes, Writer? 
 - Soo Yeon, what happened?

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up. What happened with the presentation?

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,490
I did it by myself. But, our proposal

28
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,560
made it! The Chief wants to make it an official segment!

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,750
Oh, really?

30
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,750
What's with the response? I thought you'd be so happy.

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,720
It's nothing. I'm glad.

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,590
Well, we have a lot to do, so come to the office quickly, okay?

33
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,530
Yes, Writer.

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,270
♫  Even if I squeeze my eyes shut tight  ♫

35
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,730
 Goodbye, Waikiki  ♫  It glimmers in front of my eyes  ♫

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,830
Is Woo Sik okay?

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,990
Ow, my insides. They hurt.

38
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,860
Gosh, why is Min Joon so good at drinking? Anyway, I don't like him.

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,960
I really don't like him. He's not my style.

40
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,770
- Here, drink this. 
- What is it?

41
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,700
It's honey water. You went on and on about how you have to get a guy drunk to know him.

42
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,860
But you got drunk first and were carried in. What an admirable sight it was.

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,250
Hey, it was because I wasn't in good condition.

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,840
Still, look at you talking back. Go on and drink it.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,890
Thanks. Hey, but, you're dating Min Joon now?

46
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah. We're going to date comfortably.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Comfortably? Hey, be careful. You don't know a person's true self—

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,950
Shush.

49
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,940
You always have to be careful.

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,860
- We're here. 
 - Woo Sik, are you okay?

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,060
Yeah. I rested up and had an IV, so I'm okay now.

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,630
Go in.

53
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,170
Woo Sik's expression really doesn't look good.

54
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,630
Is Woo Sik still really sick?

55
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,030
Yeah that too, but there was something that made him quite taken back earlier.

56
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,120
- What is it? 
 - Mi Na confessed to Woo Sik.

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,530
- Confessed? So Mi Na likes Woo Sik? 
 - Yeah.

58
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,910
See? I told you something was up. So, what happened?

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,960
I also don't know.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,670
Woo Sik's not feeling well, so I couldn't ask.

61
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,800
Careful of the stairs.

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,460
Is it not heavy?

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,550
It's so nice out.

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,700
I wish we could have a  lot of guests today and sell all of this. Right, Noona?

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm going. Fighting today, Gi Bong!

66
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,630
Oppa!

67
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,040
Why did you come here?

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,600
I was so thankful that you moved the flower pots last time for me, so I brought some bread for you.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,910
You didn't have to.

70
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,930
Thank you. I'll eat it well.

71
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,240
I told you to drop formalities. I'm way younger than you.

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,670
Still, it's not right to just drop formalities even if you're a lot younger.

73
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,230
Then, drop formalities next time I come here. I'll be off!

74
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,390
Who?

75
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,300
Oh, she's a new part-timer at the bakery.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,290
But, you helped her move the flower pots?

77
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,230
I went to buy bread, but I felt bad because she kept struggling, so I just helped her.

78
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,330
Let's have this for snacks later. Let's go!

79
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,930
Yeah.

80
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,640

81
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,580
Hey, you woke up early!

82
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,850
Yeah. But are you feeling okay?

83
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,380
I'm totally normal now, as you can see.

84
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,410
Oh, and how did your presentation go?

85
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,840
The proposal passed.

86
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,260
Really? That's great. Congratulations, Soo Yeon!

87
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,680
Thanks. It's all thanks to you.

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,850
I didn't do anything. But, this calls for a celebration party.

89
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,780
I can't do it today because of recording. How about the weekend? Let's have a party!

90
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,910
Alright.

91
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,170
Teacher, I came.

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,550
What is it so early in the morning?

93
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,720
I wanted to help you feel better since it seems like your body has gotten weaker.

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,030
I'll prepare this really quickly, so please wait a bit.

95
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,870
Why are you being like this?

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,530
- Excuse me, Mi Na— 
 - Just a second.

97
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,690
I confessed to you after hesitating for many years. How about you just think about it for around three days

98
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,670
before responding to me?

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,040
Still—

100
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,410
You should just go and wash your hands. Hurry up!

101
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,330
Alright. Alright.

102
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,860
I'm a bit unusual, right?

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,260
What? Ah, no.

104
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,760
Well, I really like my teacher so, so much.

105
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,820
I met him during my second year of high school. I fell in love at first sight.

106
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,650
But, I was so young, so I didn't have it in me to confess.

107
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,100
I mustered up the courage this time and confessed.

108
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,200
So please help me too, Unni. Please?

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Ah, yeah.

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Thank you, Unni.

111
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,260
Then, you can hang out before going. I have to get to work.

112
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,960
Yeah, Unni.

113
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,800
Be careful.

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,660
Be careful.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Noona, you worked hard.

116
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,380
My boyfriend also worked hard.

117
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,990
What are you doing? What if they see us?

118
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,880
Don't you know that I'm dead if Woo Sik catches us?

119
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,470
Gosh, you're such a scaredy-cat.

120
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,930
There's nothing bad about being careful.

121
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,250
What's wrong? Whose text is it?

122
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,140
It's nothing. I have to go out for a bit.

123
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,150
- At this hour? Where? 
 - I just want some air.

124
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,870
I'll be going.

125
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,590
We were outside all day. Why's he getting air?

126
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,500
- Oh, right. What will you do? 
  - About what?

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,480
Mi Na confessed to you. Will you accept it?

128
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,430
Accept it? Why? She's just my student.

129
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,530
What about it? She's an adult now. Why does that matter?

130
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,920
Wait. Is this because of Soo Yeon?

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,010
No, it's not. I'll take care of it by myself, so you can mind your own business.

132
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,760
Gosh, what's with your attitude?!

133
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,720
Oh, Kim Jeong Eun!

134
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,410
What? Where are you going dressed like that?

135
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,390
I'm going on a date with Min Joon. Why?

136
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,850
Again? You met him last night. You're going out again?

137
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,950
Min Joon said that even if he's with me, he still misses me.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,500
So cheesy. Gosh, people still say that kind of stuff these days?

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,160
Why? It's romantic and nice.

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,890
I think Min Joon and I are meant to be. It's fate.

141
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,730
Fate? Yeah, right.

142
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,060
Hey. Keep thinking that, and you might die.

143
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,750
Be careful. Always be careful of men.

144
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,490
Hey, among all the men near me, you're the most dangerous.

145
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,380
I'll be off!

146
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,510
Hey! Don't follow him to some villa again! And wear your seatbelt in the car!

147
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,030
Stop it! Is Jeong Eun a kid? You're not even jealous. How childish.

148
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,300
Jealous? No, I'm just so bored.

149
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,280
Since she's going on a date, there's no one to tease.

150
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,460
What? So, Jeong Eun can't date because you're bored?

151
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,960
Then, you can date, then! Just play with a girlfriend.

152
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,690
I guess I have to. Yeah.

153
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,050
I haven't dated these days.

154
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,530
Okay. Then, I'm going to find my fated woman today.

155
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,750
Okay. It's here. This is where I'll meet my fated love.

156
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,190
Wait. Gosh. How do I do that?

157
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,320
Oh, yeah. I'll close my eyes and count to three.

158
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,290
Then, the girl in front of me is my fated love.

159
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,820
Yeah, it sounds good. Let's go.

160
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,090
One, two, three...

161
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,910
I found her.

162
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,500
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

163
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,730
I think you're my fated love. Will you date me?

164
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,430
What?

165
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,500
- Darling! 
 - Yeah, Darling?

166
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,240
Darling, what is it? What happened?

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,820
This person wants to date me.

168
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,310
What? Are you for real?

169
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,930
Hello. Will you date me?

170
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,330
Your lips are so pretty.

171
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,960
I think he's crazy. Let's just go, Darling.

172
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,750
Wait.

173
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,330
Gosh, that would've been a huge problem.

174
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,090
Let's do it again. Again, again.

175
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:15,120
One, two, three...

176
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,550
Destiny.

177
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,330
Excuse me. I think you're my fated love. Will you date me?

178
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,200
Oh, really? I thought it was fate, too.

179
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,020
Really?

180
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,130
Yes. Do you know Taoism?

181
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,280
- Taoism? 
 - Your face is full of misfortune.

182
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,500
Let's go over there and talk.

183
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,100
W-Wait. I don't want to know! Hey! Why are you so strong?

184
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,090
GI Bong, let's go work. What? He's not here.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,340
He should make his bed.

186
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,900
This is Gi Bong's phone.

187
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,710
What? "Let's meet where we met up yesterday."

188
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,400
Who's "Shine"? Is it...?

189
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,790
Is it the part-timer from yesterday?

190
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,290
That felt nice. Oh, Noona, what are you doing?

191
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh, there was so much dust on your phone.

192
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,380
Well, we have to get ready for work, so come quickly.

193
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,360
Yes, I got it.

194
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,960
What? Then... Gi Bong cheated?

195
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey, no way.

196
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,800
What happened for you to call for me all of a sudden?

197
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,390
Well, I listened to the recorded song.

198
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,900
I think the song you produced doesn't really suit Mi Na.

199
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,100
So, even though it's a shame, we decided not to put that song in the album.

200
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,370
Well, it can't be helped.

201
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,200
So, well, I was wondering if you wanted to release that song as a single.

202
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,350
What? What do you mean?

203
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,020
From what I feel, your version was way better.

204
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,260
  Mi Na agreed, too. The company and I already discussed it.

205
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,640
What do you think about it, Woo Sik?

206
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,770
Gosh, she almost dragged me away.

207
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,250
This time, it's really the last time. The last.

208
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,300
Now, even if it's a man in front of me, I'll take him as my fated love.

209
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,730
Alright, good. Let's do it.

210
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,500
One.

211
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,400
Two. Please. Three!

212
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,970
Gosh, you scared me!

213
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Hey, Jeong Eun? Why are you here?

214
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,300
I was on my way home after saying goodbye to Min Joon. And I saw something so familiar.

215
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,150
But, why would you just appear right now, of all times?

216
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,040
What are you saying?

217
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,920
I don't know! Gosh, nothing's working out.

218
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,630
Why's he getting mad?

219
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,450
Hey! Lee Joon Ki!

220
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,390
♫  It always   ♫

221
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,220
♫   makes me smile  ♫

222
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,500
♫  It's strange,   ♫

223
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm home.

224
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,020
- Oh, you came early.
 - Yeah.

225
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,800
Soo Yeon. Something happened that I want you to congratulate me on.

226
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,470
Really? What is it?

227
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,610
Well, I'm going to release an album.

228
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,990
Really?

229
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,400
The company wants me to sing the song I made last time.

230
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,950
They want to release it as a single.

231
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,770
Congratulations, Woo Sik. That's great, really!

232
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,690
- Teacher! 
 - What?

233
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,820
Mi Na.

234
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,500
I heard the news, too! I can't just let this great day pass by.

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,130
Let's party together. Party!

236
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,610
Okay, let's do it!

237
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,360
Teacher, if your album becomes a hit, you'll let me feature in a song later, alright?

238
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,810
Yeah, I got it.

239
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,300
But, I'm a  bit sorry.

240
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,700
What are you sorry about? Your voice fit the song way more.

241
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,170
Don't worry about it. Let's just have our drinks.

242
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,640
Right, thank you.

243
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,330
Cheers.

244
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,070
Gosh, no more beer. Where's the beer?

245
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,200
Hey, Soo Yeon. You seem really drunk, you should stop drinking.

246
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,360
No, no. I'm fine.

247
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,110
It's okay. It's okay.

248
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,350
I came.

249
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,130
You came?

250
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,300
Oh, what's with those flowers? Did your boyfriend give them to you?

251
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,560
No. I got them for you. I heard you're releasing an album. Congrats!

252
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,980
Thank you.

253
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,400
But what's wrong with Soo Yeon?

254
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,150
She drank beer quickly. She's drunk now.

255
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,530
Jeong Eun, could you take Soo Yeon to her room and put her to bed?

256
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,380
Alright. Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon!

257
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,280
Jeong Eun, you're here? We should have one more glass, then.

258
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,150
No, you're really drunk. Why drink more? Let's go in.

259
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,760
No, I'm fine. I can drink more.

260
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,500
Let's go back, let's go back.

261
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,060
- The beer... 
 - Let's go.

262
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,610
Careful, careful.

263
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:13,400
I am fine though. I can drink more alcohol.

264
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,220
You're so drunk. Why drink more? Just sleep.

265
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,910
Hold on.

266
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,950
Why did you get up again?

267
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:25,200
I have something to say to Woo Sik. I really have to tell him.

268
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Then, you should sleep and tell him tomorrow.

269
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,600
I can't. I have to do it now.

270
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,900
If I don't tell him now, I won't be able to tell him.

271
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,760
No, just do it tomorrow.

272
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,430
No.

273
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,220
I have to now. I'll do it now.

274
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,080
What's wrong?

275
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,600
Let go! I have to tell something to Woo Sik.

276
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,590
No, you're so drunk. Just do it tomorrow.

277
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,390
No! I need to do it now, Jeong Eun.

278
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,380
You're so drunk. Just do it tomorrow.

279
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,890
No! I have to!

280
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,000
You drank a lot, you drank too much. Just do it tomorrow.

281
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,270
  Why did Jeong Eun appear right then and there?

282
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,870
  Then, is my fated love Jeong Eun?

283
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,410
  No, that can't be.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,740
♫   What can I do   ♫

285
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,600
♫   to see your smile again?   ♫

286
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,500
This is what I recorded last time. How does it sound?

287
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,850
Hey, Joon Ki. Hey!

288
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,260
Yeah, what?

289
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,330
I asked how my song is. You didn't listen, did you?!

290
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,200
No, I did. It's great.

291
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,970
Hey, this is the best among all the songs you made.

292
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,890
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

293
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,300
Yeah, it's true. Hey, now that I listened to it, I liked the lyrics.

294
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,120
You made this while thinking of Soo Yeon, right?

295
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,460
I can tell by your expression that it's true.

296
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,050
Do you still like Soo Yeon?

297
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,800
It's not that.

298
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,880
Me and Soo Yeon are friends. Friends.

299
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,700
Really?

300
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah, that's true. So, don't say that in front of Soo Yeon. It'll make her uncomfortable.

301
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,070
Alright, man.

302
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm glad you settled everything. You went through so much because of her.

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,790
Noona, you worked hard today.

304
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,110
Yeah. You too.

305
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,820
You must be tired. Let's clean up and rest.

306
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,710
What is it? Whose text is it?

307
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,090
It's nothing. Noona, I'll go somewhere quickly, so you can go in first and rest.

308
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,100
I'll clean up everything once I get back.

309
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,880
Where are you going again?

310
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,410
I'm going to get some air. I'll be off.

311
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,420
What? Is it that part-timer again?

312
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,000
Gook Gi Bong, you bad guy. You're dead today.

313
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,350
Gosh, where did Gook Gi Bong disappear to? I searched the whole neighborhood.

314
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,910
Gosh, just wait until I catch him.

315
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,140
Gi Bong, this bad guy.

316
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,010
Hey, Gook Gi Bong!

317
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,500
Noona. Noona, why are you here?

318
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,130
Who is this woman? I asked who that woman is.

319
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,260
It's not a woman, what are you saying?

320
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't fool around. It's that part-timer!

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,480
Who are you? Who?

322
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,730
You're the baseball coach. Hello.

323
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,300
Yeah, hello.

324
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,750
Gosh, I can't believe you. You followed me here because you thought I was cheating on you?

325
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,690
Well, you kept disappearing at night.

326
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,030
But, this is weird. I saw a text from "Shine."

327
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,200
This is because of that? That "Shine" person is the coach.

328
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,360
What? The coach is "Shine?" Why?

329
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,400
What? Gook Gi Bong!

330
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,370
You saved me as "Shine" on your phone?

331
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,050
I'm sorry. That's your nickname.

332
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,500
But, why are you meeting him at this hour?

333
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,300
Well, the coach asked me if I wanted to be a hitter.

334
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,000
A hitter? So, you can start baseball again?

335
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,260
Yeah!

336
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,550
He's a pitcher, but I heard he was a fourth hitter until high school.

337
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,400
His skills kept getting ignored. It was such a waste.

338
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,130
I'm trying to convince him to start again, but he refuses. He's so stubborn!

339
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,190
Well, I said I don't want to play baseball anymore. Please don't find me anymore.

340
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,900
Let's go.

341
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,190
Hey, Gook Gi Bong! Gi Bong!

342
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,150
I'll wash all of the cooking utensils

343
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,810
so you can sleep first. Okay?

344
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,260
Okay.

345
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,360
But, Gi Bong...

346
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,790
You. Are you really not going to do baseball again?

347
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,360
What?

348
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,680
I just want to work on the food truck.

349
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,890
We'll work hard and have a franchise. We agreed to branch out abroad, too!

350
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,540
That's a lie.

351
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,630
I know that you smile like a fool like that when you lie.

352
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,330
You want to play baseball, right?

353
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,230
Why? Are you afraid you'll make a mistake again?

354
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,860
Wow, my boyfriend is such a scaredy cat.

355
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,610
If I say let's break up,  I bet you won't even hang onto me.

356
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,120
You'll be scared that you'll be rejected again.

357
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,290
No, that's not it.

358
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,580
Yeah, right. Even though you have the chance to play baseball again,

359
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,270
you're too scared to try.

360
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,660
Gosh, do I have to keep dating this kind of man?

361
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,220
Changing to a hitter isn't as easy as you think it is.

362
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,160
Is that so?

363
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,640
Well, just quit, then.

364
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,590
And let's break up.

365
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,990
What?

366
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,240
What are you suddenly saying?

367
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,450
I don't need a scared boyfriend.

368
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,100
Thanks for everything.

369
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,150
Noona, what's wrong? No! You can't. I won't break up with you.

370
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,050
Then...

371
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,740
Play baseball again.

372
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,620
I'll do whatever I can to support you.

373
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,520
Rather than a scared boyfriend,

374
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,750
I want a boyfriend to chase after his dreams, even if they may be scary.

375
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,820
I think that's more admirable.

376
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,890
Gi Bong. Don't be scared.

377
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,310
I'm by your side.

378
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,770
As I always say, just trust me.

379
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,030
Just me. Yeah?

380
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,400
Thank you, Noona. Thank you so much.

381
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,440
But, why are you so cool?

382
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,410
Am I?

383
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,570
You're so cool that I can't even hold myself back.

384
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,250
Anyway, I can't.

385
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,440
What?

386
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,460
♫  Looking the stars  ♫

387
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,050
♫  Looking the stars in the sky  ♫ 
 ♫  Look at the sky filled with stars  ♫

388
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,390
♫  Like my heart from looking at you all day long  ♫

389
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,140
♫  It shines towards you  ♫

390
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,830
  Waikiki Guest House

391
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,180
What? You're going to play baseball again?

392
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,060
Yeah. I'm going to transfer to being a hitter.

393
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,030
It won't be easy.

394
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,760
That's why your face is so bright. Does thinking about baseball make you so happy?

395
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,970
Yeah. I like it. I like it a lot.

396
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,750
Yeah, now that you started again, you should try your best and get to the main team–

397
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,060
No, the major leagues!

398
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,640
Thank you. I'll try hard.

399
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,100
But why are you not eating, Noona?

400
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,420
I don't know. I haven't felt that great this morning.

401
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,730
I feel a fever coming on and some chills. Maybe I'm getting sick.

402
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,780
Really? Then, let's quickly go to the hospital.

403
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,800
No, I'll have some medicine and it will get better.

404
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,220
What are you saying? Colds are so severe lately.

405
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,320
Get ready. Let's go to the hospital. Hurry.

406
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,780
- I'm fine though. 
 - Careful.

407
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,130
Can you walk?

408
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,450
Why is he going so overboard?

409
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,760
Yeah, right?

410
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,660
But, these days, aren't those two suspicious? Did they fall for each other while working together?

411
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,930
What? Gi Bong and our Noona? Are you crazy?

412
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,360
Why are you saying such a terrible thing?!

413
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,550
I was just joking.

414
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,660
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

415
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,430
Is there something you need?

416
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,540
The thing is, my wallet disappeared from my room.

417
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,280
What?

418
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,990
It was there before I went to sleep, but in the morning, it was gone.

419
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,550
Really? What do we do?

420
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,860
When was the last time you saw your wallet?

421
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,460
It was around 11 PM.

422
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,730
Okay, then we'll take a look after that.

423
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,550
It's Gi Bong and Noona.

424
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,590
What? What are they talking about for so long at that hour?

425
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,290
What? Why are they holding hands?

426
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,400
What? What? What's this bastard doing with my sister?

427
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
I think they're kissing.

428
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,080
K-Kiss?

429
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,310
Hey, we're going to the hospital.

430
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,910
Why?

431
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,030
What is it?

432
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,260
You. You. You...

433
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,770
How could you?

434
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,980
What are you saying? What is it?

435
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,850
Gi Bong. Explain how this happened.

436
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,530
Explain to me what happened!

437
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,770
Woo Sik, be calm.

438
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,610
Enough. Just tell me.

439
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,130
Tell me quickly!

440
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,790
Brother. Calm down.

441
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,850
I got it. I'll tell you honestly.

442
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,060
Gi Bong and I are dating.

443
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,100
So, we kissed. What about it? We can't do that?

444
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,450
What did you say? So, you two are really dating?

445
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,990
I'm sorry for not telling you.

446
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,920
Hit me if you want to. I'll get hit as much as you want.

447
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,090
Still, I won't ever give up Noona, so just keep that in mind.

448
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,600
Alright, hit me until you're not mad anymore!

449
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,590
You can't. You can't.

450
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,130
Brother.

451
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,090
Thank you, Gi Bong!

452
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,490
Thank you so much.

453
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,090
What?

454
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,250
Thank you? Are you giving us your approval?

455
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,690
Of course.

456
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,690
I'm so thankful that you're dating someone like my noona.

457
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,560
What?

458
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,290
I was so frustrated and asked myself how much longer I would have to deal with her.

459
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,260
But, you're getting rid of my worries now.

460
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,780
Thank you, friend.

461
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,040
What did you say?

462
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,220
Brother! You're being too mean.

463
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,890
Too mean? Why?

464
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,910
Such a nice, innocent guy like Gi Bong is dating you.

465
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,760
I'm so thankful that I feel like bowing on my knees. Hold on.

466
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,230
It's okay.

467
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,220
Hey, Brother! Are you done?

468
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,580
Noona!

469
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,300
Gi Bong.

470
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,360
Noona, did you come back to your senses now?

471
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,730
Yeah, but what happened to me?

472
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,850
I don't know yet. Woo Sik went in to get the results.

473
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,720
- What did you say?
 - She's pregnant.

474
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,520
Cha Yoo Ri is pregnant.

475
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,360
Pregnant?

476
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,810
So, there's a baby in her?

477
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,400
Yes.

478
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:03,630
Still, we can date comfortably now that Woo Sik approved.

479
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,030
Yeah.

480
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,690
I thought Woo Sik would kill me when he found out.

481
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,390
If we knew he was going to react like that, we should have told him sooner.

482
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,250
I was so worried.

483
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,680
You're here? What did the doctor say?

484
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,210
Since when did you guys start dating?

485
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,140
What? Why are you suddenly...

486
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,560
Just answer what I'm asking.

487
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,500
What's wrong, you're scary.

488
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,630
You can laugh in this situation, you bastard?!

489
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,850
What's wrong, Woo Sik?

490
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,460
You ask me because you don't know?!

491
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,250
How could you? To my Noona?

492
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,180
Brother!

493
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,120
Die.

494
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,370
Woo Sik, what's wrong?

495
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,450
Blood...

496
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,920
Hey, Woo Sik!

497
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,810
No! No!

498
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,300
Ow!

499
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,730
Brother-in-law!

500
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,490
Brother-In-law? Brother-In-law?

501
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,090
Gi Bong.

502
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,590
Joon Ki!

503
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,110
Here you are.

504
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,210
Here. It's done.

505
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,900
Thank you.

506
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,840
Safe travels!

507
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,000
Can't you shorten your autograph? Even the people watching get tired.

508
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,830
I did make it shorter, though.

509
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,020
Really? But, still, you should try to make it shorter.

510
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,060
I'll think about it.

511
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,880
Excuse me. Lee Joon Ki. Could we have a talk?

512
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,420
Would you like an autograph?

513
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,930
N-No. Not an autograph.

514
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,270
Then, what is it?

515
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,310
- I'm a movie director, Park In Na. 
 - Oh, yes, I see.

516
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:19,010
I'll be directing a new movie soon, but I wanted to work with you.

517
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,150
What? With me?

518
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,720
Yes. It's a small independent film.

519
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,990
You match perfectly with the image of the main character I have in mind.

520
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,860
I love your acting, too.

521
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,900
The main character?

522
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,060
Gook Gi Bong, what will you do now?

523
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,000
What will you do about my noona?

524
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,990
Why aren't you saying anything? Why?

525
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,450
Brother. Stop it. Calm down.

526
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,710
What? Do you think I can calm down?

527
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,550
Hey, Cha Woo Sik! You're being too noisy. Shut your mouth.

528
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,530
Gi Bong, get up.

529
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,760
This isn't your fault.

530
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,670
I don't want to pressure you,

531
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,790
so don't worry about it. Got it?

532
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,600
Noona.

533
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,690
What?

534
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,860
Wait a minute.

535
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,110
What? What's with him?

536
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,980
I don't know.

537
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,720
Noona. Marry me.

538
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,420
What?

539
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm dumb and immature. I have no future.

540
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,690
There's nothing I know how to do, but I'll make you happy for the rest of your life.

541
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,420
I can do that really well.

542
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Gi Bong.

543
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,310
This is the ring I got when I won a Bonghwa match.

544
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,500
This is all I can do for now, but I'll work hard

545
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,480
and I'll put pretty rings on all ten fingers.

546
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,710
Cha Yoo Ri, let's get married.

547
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,890
♫  Yesterday in my dreams last night  ♫

548
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,230
♫  I saw you, I saw my love  ♫

549
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,490
♫  Yesterday I got butterflies seeing your vivid face  ♫

550
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,390
Gi Bong.

551
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,960
♫  It felt like you slipped through my fingers   ♫

552
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,730
So, you're going to marry me?

553
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,890
♫   Don't run away   ♫

554
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,510
Yeah.

555
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,260
Thanks, Noona.

556
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,280
I'll make you happy.

557
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,250
♫  Some day with shining starlight  ♫

558
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,800
♫  I want to love you like last night's dream  ♫

559
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,680
♫  When I think of you   ♫

560
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,020
♫   my heart breaks  ♫

561
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,560
Gi Bong and Yoo Ri are getting married?

562
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,460
I can't believe it.

563
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,050
Awesome news!

564
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,760
Joon Ki, I have awesome news, too.

565
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,430
What? Awesome news?

566
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,420
You, too?

567
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,260
Hey. Gi Bong and Yoo Ri are dating.

568
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,230
- What? 
 - That's not all.

569
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,490
Yoo Ri is pregnant with Gi Bong's child.

570
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,480
What did you say?!

571
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,260
That's not all. Gi Bong and Yoo Ri are getting married!

572
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,560
What did you say?! Is that true?

573
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,750
Yeah! Gi Bong even proposed to her earlier!

574
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,860
Prop–?

575
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,100
How could this happen so suddenly?

576
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,480
I know, right?

577
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,870
But, what happened to you?

578
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,320
Huh?

579
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,480
Oh, well, I don't want to say it.

580
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,890
It's nothing compared to Gi Bong's news, so I won't say anything.

581
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,430
What is it? Tell me.

582
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,120
Well, actually, I got cast for a new movie as the main character.

583
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,830
The main role? Really?

584
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:25,230
Yeah! It's a small independent movie, but...

585
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,700
Hey, that's so great! Congrats!

586
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,530
Is that it? You should treat me for some drinks!

587
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,920
Drinks? But, I'm going on a date.

588
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,530
What?

589
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,780
Your best friend got cast for the main role in a movie for the first time ever, but you're going to go on a date instead of celebrating?

590
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,260
What can I do? I already made the plans.

591
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,010
We'll drink once I come back. Okay?

592
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,050
Do you have to go? You can date later.

593
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,400
I'll come early. Let go.

594
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Just hang out with me. Yeah?

595
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,090
Let's hang out today. I want you to.

596
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,730
But, Min Joon said he's coming to the front.

597
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,260
Gosh, whatever. Just go! So cheap.

598
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,550
You're not even my best friend, okay?

599
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,250
You're not even a kid. What's with the attitude?

600
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,310
I'll be going.

601
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,960
You're really going?

602
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,460
Alright. So, he's more important than me, her friend of ten years?

603
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,920
How cheap of her. Geez.

604
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,330
What are you doing by yourself?

605
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,860
What? You said you were going on a date. Why are you here?

606
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,300
I canceled it.

607
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,360
Huh? Why?

608
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,060
I had a feeling you'd be like this by yourself.

609
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,430
If I get dumped, you'll take responsibility for me.

610
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,100
Got it?

611
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,400
Alright. It's not like there's much to take responsibility for.

612
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,030
You're being serious, right? Don't take your words back.

613
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,750
♫  What the heck, what is this  ♫

614
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,600
♫  Oh what in the world is happening to me  ♫

615
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,520
- Let's drink. 
 - Yeah.

616
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,300
♫  I'm always jumping jumping jumping  ♫

617
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,740
♫  Again pumping pumping pumping  ♫

618
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,800
♫  Even if nothing turns out right I won't break down  ♫

619
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,330
♫   In that world  ♫

620
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,040
What's this? Why are you two drinking?

621
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,890
It's a congratulatory drink.

622
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,980
Congratulatory drink?

623
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,080
Joon Ki was cast in the main role of a movie today.

624
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,450
Really?

625
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,580
Congratulations, Joon Ki!

626
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,260
Thanks. Oh, Soo Yeon, you want some?

627
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,870
No, it's okay. I have a lot to do. You can drink.

628
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,080
And Joon Ki, can you give me the spare battery you borrowed the other day?

629
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,750
I have to use it tomorrow.

630
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,490
It's on my desk. I'll get it for you.

631
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,670
No, no, I'll get it.

632
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,120
  Even Just A Minute

633
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,470
"Even Just A Minute?"

634
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,390
Is this Woo Sik's self-produced song?

635
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,830
♫   What are you thinking of  ♫

636
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,120
  Woo Sik liked Soo Yeon that much?

637
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,250
  Woo Sik's only liked Soo Yeon up until now, ever since high school.

638
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,530
  Should I practice this song and play it to you later?

639
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,100
  Really? You promised, okay?

640
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,180
♫   I'm thinking all day   ♫

641
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,550
  Feel better. We're by your side.

642
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:08,160
  So, if you're going through a lot and you're tired, just lean on us.

643
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,550
♫   My heart  ♫

644
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,880
♫   is right next to yours  ♫

645
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,090
  I said it was okay, so why are you like this? What is it to you?

646
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,240
  It's because I like you!

647
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,760
  I keep getting worried about you! That's why!

648
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,260
♫  My embrace only for you  ♫

649
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:42,590
♫  Just one minute to me. Just a moment to me, in my arms,  ♫

650
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,090
♫  Will you feel my love  ♫

651
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,200
  Of course, she's my friend.

652
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,360
  Soo Yeon, don't worry about me. I'm really okay.

653
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,130
♫  I can deal with all kinds of pain  ♫

654
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,630
You didn't find it?

655
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,230
It's here in the drawer.

656
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,630
What? Are you crying?

657
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,990
Joon Ki, where's Woo Sik?

658
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,730
He went out to record earlier.

659
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,270
The battery.

660
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,300
♫  It glimmers in front of my eyes  ♫

661
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,530
♫  Your face wakes my heart  ♫

662
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,450
♫  Even if I hold it in all day long  ♫

663
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,690
What are you doing?

664
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,870
Why can't it be me?

665
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,740
What don't you like about me?

666
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,240
I told you it's not like that.

667
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,600
Then, what is it? What's the reason?

668
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,060
I actually like someone else.

669
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,510
Who is it?

670
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,590
Is it Soo Yeon?

671
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,680
Yeah.

672
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,870
For me, it's always been Soo Yeon, and it'll only be Soo Yeon.

673
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,300
I'm sorry.

674
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,790
Soo Yeon!

675
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,350
Woo Sik.

676
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,020
Where were you at this hour?

677
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,430
I just had to go somewhere.

678
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,210
Oh, really?

679
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,070
But, why do you look so down? Did something happen?

680
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,810
No, it's nothing.

681
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,570
Oh, that's a relief.

682
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,140
Let's go in quickly.

683
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,100
Soo Yeon!

684
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:26,520
Dad!

685
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,130
Soo Yeon!

686
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,590
Dad!

687
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,100
Do you know how worried I was?

688
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,650
I'm sorry, Soo Yeon.

689
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,550
I'm so sorry, Soo Yeon.

690
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,830
Thank you for caring for Soo Yeon this whole time.

691
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,890
I don't know how to thank you.

692
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,070
It's nothing. It was fine.

693
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,500
Still, I can't just leave it at this.

694
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,810
This. This is just a small gift of my sincerity. Please take it.

695
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:15,500
No, no, it's okay. Please don't do this.

696
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,140
I have to do this to feel at ease.

697
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,210
Please just take it.

698
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,350
You didn't have to. You didn't.

699
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,930
Oh, it's an ice cream cake coupon.

700
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,980
Well, I still haven't recovered completely,

701
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,180
so I couldn't prepare a big gift.

702
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,620
But, I heard it's really good.

703
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,040
You should eat it.

704
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,770
Yes, thank you.

705
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,550
Soo Yeon, go pack your things.

706
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,420
Pack?

707
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,950
Everything that I'd been scammed for is settled now.

708
00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:00,950
I've barely recovered, and I'm going to start a small business in America with a friend.

709
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,890
Really?

710
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:08,060
So, you should come and study what you want. Let's be together.

711
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,010
We have to take the afternoon plane tomorrow, so go and pack.

712
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,300
I've booked a hotel.

713
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,380
Right now?

714
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,050
You can't cause more trouble for your friends.

715
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,350
No, we're fine. You can stay here.

716
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,860
I do not wish to be a burden any longer.

717
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,580
No, not a burden.

718
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,620
If you just leave like this, we won't feel good about it.

719
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,100
Please just stay here before you leave.

720
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,220
You suffered a lot, right?

721
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,620
No, my friends helped me, so it was okay.

722
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,080
That's a relief.

723
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,480
But Dad, do I have to go?

724
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,650
What are you saying?

725
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,260
Well... I still have my job right now.

726
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,990
- Job?  
 - Yeah.

727
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,780
I'm a reporter right now.

728
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,200
Soo Yeon. You don't have to work now.

729
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,050
No, it's something that I want to do.

730
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,940
If you truly want to do it, you can do it in America, too.

731
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,650
Still...

732
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,470
Then, you're going to be apart from me again?

733
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,160
No, that's not it—

734
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,470
Then, listen to me.

735
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:22,050
I won't leave you alone again.

736
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,360
But, is Soo Yeon really going?

737
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,000
I didn't know she'd leave so quickly.

738
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,170
Oh, and, what happened with Mi Na? Are you going to accept her feelings?

739
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,200
No. I rejected her.

740
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,390
What? Why?

741
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:47,010
Tell me honestly. You still like Soo Yeon, right?

742
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,510
It's true.

743
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,460
What will you do now? Are you going to send Soo Yeon off like this?

744
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,830
It can't be helped.

745
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,080
She went through so much here. If she goes to America, she can study what she wants.

746
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,800
Her dad will be by her side, too.

747
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,840
It's good for Soo Yeon.

748
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,090
But, still, sending her off like this—

749
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,250
It's okay. It's not a big deal for me

750
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,950
as long as Soo Yeon is happy.

751
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,710
So, don't say anything to her.

752
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,360
If you say something to her, I'll get really mad.

753
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,170
Got it?

754
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,580
Soo Yeon! What are you doing here?

755
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,550
I couldn't fall asleep. Why are you here, not sleeping?

756
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,250
I couldn't fall asleep, either.

757
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,340
Is your father sleeping?

758
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,020
Yeah.

759
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,170
Tonight is your last night here.

760
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,580
It feels like just yesterday when we met again. Time flies.

761
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,260
Right?

762
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,140
Yeah, right?

763
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,650
Thank you, Woo Sik, for everything until now.

764
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,470
What are you saying? I didn't do anything for you.

765
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:29,650
No, that's not true. Since the beginning,

766
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,530
I've only had things to thank you for.

767
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,820
Thankful for what?

768
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,490
We're friends.

769
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,640
Yeah.

770
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,290
We're friends.

771
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:58,050
♫  Even if I squeeze my eyes shut tight  ♫

772
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,630
Soo Yeon, you have to get up early tomorrow. You should go to sleep.

773
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:05,890
Yeah. You can go first. I'll go in a bit.

774
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,720
Yeah.

775
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,220
Wait, Woo Sik.

776
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,880
Yeah? What?

777
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,960
It's nothing. Never mind.

790
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:25,040
Thanks for everything, guys.

791
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,020
I won't ever forget this.

792
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,340
Hey, why are you acting like we won't see each other ever again, in this day and age?

793
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,900
Yeah. Let's not cry or anything or make a sad farewell.

794
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,470
It's not like us. None of you cry, okay?

795
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,600
Yeah, got it.

796
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,900
Rebecca, this is my last time seeing you.

797
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,000
What would've happened if I hadn't gotten

798
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,840
into Rebecca's trunk the day of the wedding?

799
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,040
What do you mean? You wouldn't have suffered since you wouldn't have met us.

800
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,230
No. I think it was such good luck that I hid here.

801
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,890
I feel like that's the best thing I've done in my life.

802
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,670
Farewells are supposed to be short, yet powerful.

803
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,420
Your dad is waiting, so you should go.

804
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,090
Yes. I'll be going.

805
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,830
Woo Sik, I'll be going.

806
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,320
Send me your album once it comes out.

807
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,020
Yeah. I will.

808
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,860
Goodbye.

809
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,120
Then, I'll be going.

810
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,690

812

815
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:06,730

816
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:11,680
 Thank you to our English editors: Joysprite (chief), and kristensgem.

817

818

 Thank you to our page designer: eviluni.

819
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,690
It's so empty without Soo Yeon, right?

820
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,290
Yeah, how can this house change so much after one person is gone?

821
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,610
I wonder if Soo Yeon's at the airport now.

822
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:32,450
She probably is. It's not even an hour until she's supposed to take off.

823
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,330
Woo Sik. You're okay, right?

824
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:40,520
Huh? Yeah, I am!

825
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,120
I'm really okay! Don't worry.

826
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,660
Teacher.

827
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,500
Mi Na, what brings you here?

828
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,150
I was heartbroken, but you didn't even comfort me with drinks,

829
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:51,700
so I came here to ask you to treat me to some drinks.

830
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,140
What?

831
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,560
What's with the atmosphere?

832
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,030
Well, Soo Yeon left.

833
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,280
Left? To where?

834
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,310
She went with her dad to America.

835
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:09,050
What? But, you just let her go?

836
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:12,590
You said you still like her!

837
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,700
But, those are just my one-sided feelings.

838
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,750
What? Then, you still didn't know?

839
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,610
What?

840
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,400
You didn't know that Soo Yeon likes you?

841
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,690
What? Soo Yeon likes me? What are you saying?

842
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:30,010
You're so clueless. How could you not know?

843
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,520
Hey, how could you know something that I don't?

844
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,650
Why wouldn't I? When you went to the emergency room,

845
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,860
she even ran there herself. Isn't it clear?

846
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,150
She looked more shocked than me.

847
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,190
I knew just by looking.

848
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,650
Yeah, well, she was just shocked that I fainted.

849
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,660
Hold on, hold on.

850
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,080
So, that's why Soo Yeon was crying that day.

851
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,150
Crying? What?

852
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:55,620
Yesterday, Soo Yeon was crying as she listened to your song.

853
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:00,700
Then, she said she had something to tell you and ran out like crazy. That's why!

854
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,740
What? Hey, why would you tell me that now?!

855
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,080
I thought she was going to talk to you to praise your song.

856
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,350
But, how could she go without confessing to you? That's weird.

857
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,710
Hey, we have no time for this.

858
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,200
Go call Soo Yeon quickly.

859
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,060
Got it.

860
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,710
It says her phone is shut off. What do I do?

861
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,620
There's still time left until her flight leaves, so go to the airport quickly.

862
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,170
Yeah, got it. I'll be going.

863
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,460
Hey, hey, wait. Take this.

864
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,390
What's this? You want me to take Rebecca?

865
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,080
Of course. Trust in Rebecca, man!

866
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,010
Hurry and go. Go and get her.

867
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,830
Alright. I'll be off.

868
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,700
What is this? Why's this speed only at 20 kph?

869
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,260
How can there be a car like this?

870
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,860
Rebecca, come to your senses!

871
00:55:55,860 --> 00:56:00,160
And, stop playing this song! Please!

872
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,840
What?

873
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,370
What the heck? No!

874
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,990
No!

875
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,020
No, Rebecca!

876
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,990
No!

877
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,680
No, Rebecca!

878
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,010
No!

879
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,980
No!

880
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,920
How could this happen?

881
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,270
In the movies, the character always makes it to the airport on time. I didn't even get close to the airport.

882
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,860
What is this!

883
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,580
Gosh, anyway, I'm the crazy one for taking Rebecca.

884
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,510
  Sweet pancakes? I love sweet pancakes! Let's go.

885
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,120
  Could we get two sweet pancakes?

886
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,830
  Woo Sik, order three! I want two! Two.

887
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,360
  Oh, your girlfriend likes sweet pancakes!

888
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,270
  Can't you just buy me two sweet pancakes?

889
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,830
  I think I'll cheer up more if I have one more sweet pancakes.

890
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,420
♫  What can I do to see your smile  ♫

891
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,040
♫  I think about it all day  ♫

892
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,590
Hello.

893
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,660
Can I get one sweet pancake?

894
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,950
Give me a moment.

895
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,770
- Here you go. 
 - Yes.

896
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,870
Thank you.

897
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:51,110
♫  My heart is just right beside you  ♫

898
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:58,160
♫  You can rest in my arms no need to say anything  ♫

899
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,950
♫  My embrace only for you  ♫

900
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,560
♫  Just one minute to me  ♫

901
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:14,970
♫  Just a moment to me, lean on my shoulder  ♫

902
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,450
Can I get one sweet pancake, too?

903
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,300
Yes.

904
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,490
Soo Yeon! What happened?

905
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,230
It just turned out like this.

906
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,220
Here you are.

907
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,470
- Thank you. 
  - Sure.

908
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:38,530
Why are you eating sweet pancakes here? And why didn't you take your phone with you?

909
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,930
Do you know how many hours I waited at the airport for you?

910
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,420
No, Rebecca just broke down, so...

911
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,790
But, you waited for me?

912
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:50,910
Why?

913
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,510
I heard you still like me?

914
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:58,120
What? How'd you know?

915
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,230
Well, there was something I left behind before I got on the plane.

916
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,070
So, I called the guesthouse again, and I heard from the others.

917
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,900
So, you came back because of me?

918
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,860
No.

919
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,740
I thought about it, and I have my own segment with my name.

920
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,550
It'd be such a shame to leave. It felt irresponsible.

921
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:26,200
And, if I leave for America, I wouldn't be able to eat this yummy sweet pancake.

922
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,330
Ah, I  see.

923
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:33,830
And, what made me decide to stay was the fact that the person I like is here.

924
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:36,680
Person, you like?

925
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,540
Yeah. I

926
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:49,920
like our guesthouse family so much!

927
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,130
Oh, really?

928
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:02,860
There is a person I especially like, though.

929
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,600
Who?

930
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:13,200
I don't know. Who could it be?

931
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,630
Woo Sik, hold this for a second.

932
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,410
Alright.

933
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:43,750

   3 Years Later

942
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,730
How is it?

943
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,230
It's clean and the interior is great, right?

944
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:28,450
And, this neighborhood is great, so everyone who owns this place leaves really successfully.

945
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,160
Really?

946
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,850
Of course! Look there.

947
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,570
It's Shi Ba Woo Sik, a famous singer.

948
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:36,430
Then, an actor who got an award from a film festival.

949
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,220
A homerun baseball player!

950
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,460
The popular reporter!

951
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,110
A famous restaurant franchise CEO,

952
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,360
and the scene stealer, the popular

953
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,300
actress and CF model!

954
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,820
Everyone's been so successful.

955
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,500
Is that so? But I've never seen them before.

956
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,270
It's because they're all working overseas these days.

957
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:59,530
Everyone recognizes them overseas. I guess you didn't know?

958
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:02,830
So, will you sign the contract?

959
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,550
I'm not sure. I'll think about it a bit longer.

960
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,630
No, no. What is there to think about?

961
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:12,380
If you sign the contract, I'll give you the big pipe as a gift.

962
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,710
What? I don't need it.

963
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:18,360
I'll think about it a few more days and let you know. I'll be off.

964
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,440
Hey, there's no other pipe longer than that!

965
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,820
Do you know how long that is?! It's the longest in the world!

966
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,360
What happened?

967
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,500
He said he'll think about it for a few days.

968
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,390
Does he think he's some sort of billionaire?

969
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:49,660
I told you this wouldn't work.

970
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,060
Why would you tell those nonsensical lies?

971
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:57,370
Are you guys fools? Your album only sold 20 copies.

972
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,540
What? A famous artist? Geez.

973
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,970
That's more than the number of viewers for your movie!

974
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,590
You had the main role of a movie that only 17 people watched!

975
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:08,240
No! Five of those were us. Two of those were Joon Ki's parents.

976
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,320
Then, it's ten people!

977
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,170
Whatever. I had more than the number of members in your baseball class!

978
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,300
You only had three people!

979
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,580
No! One person left yesterday, so now it's two.

980
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,440
Oh, is that so? What a thing to brag about.

981
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,010
Yeah! Is this a time to be looking down on us?!

982
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,240
Hey, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

983
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,670
Still, we've doubled the number compared to last month.

984
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:35,830
But, you guys are making such a fuss in front of Se Cheong.

985
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,500
You guys really just!

986
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,460
Unni, why are you getting mad at Woo Sik?

987
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,270
Gi Bong came for my Joon Ki first.

988
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,390
You're being too much.

989
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:46,620
Do you guys really want to fight like this as couples?

990
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,910
Shut up!

991
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,890
I'm going insane.

992
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:55,320
What kind of crime did I commit in my past life to always be stuck with these kinds of tenants?

993
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,160
Boss, maybe you committed a huge crime in your past life.

994
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,900
Maybe you betrayed your country.

995
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,430
That makes sense.

996
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:07,110
So, Boss, how about you cut our rent a bit to pay for your crimes?

997
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,130
It'd be better if you didn't collect rent.

998
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,600
That's great. Nice!

999
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,580
You guys keep doing this.

1000
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:18,330
You guys are all dead today.

1001
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,200
You!

1002
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,130
Boss!

1003
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,530
Boss!

1004
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:28,600
