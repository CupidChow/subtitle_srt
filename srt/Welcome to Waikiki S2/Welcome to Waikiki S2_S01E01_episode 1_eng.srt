1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,960

2
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,310
Let's go!

3
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,040
Cut! Okay!

4
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,320
Wow, the action was great. Good work!

5
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,850
Thank you!

6
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,970
Alright, we're done so let's move on to the main character's scene!

7
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,400
Okay!

8
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,900
Good work, good work.

9
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,510
Geez!

10
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,110
Wow, saying "good work" doesn't change anything for the better.

11
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,540
How did I become like this?

12
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,700
- Blegh! 
 - Joon Ki, your phone. It's been ringing since earlier.

13
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,470
Thank you.

14
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,780
Hello?

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,750
What?

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,540
Darn!

17
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,850
Please clap along.

18
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,280
  Housewives  Singing Lesson with Shiba Woo Sik

19
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,190
What? I'm busy. I'm in the middle of a class.

20
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,440
What? Darn!

21
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,490
  K B Kook

22
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,530
  Yes, there is only one more ball left.

23
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,380
 Player Gook Gi Bong, who has yet to let a ball be hit or run for all nine innings,

24
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,670
  everything is hanging on him.

25
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,400
 It's three balls and two strikes right now.

26
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,390
 Gook Gi Bong needs to be really careful about throwing into the outfield right now.

27
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,750
 It's because Player Sato is probably aiming for the outfield right now.

28
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,040
  Yes, this is a very nerve-wracking moment.

29
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,090
 Player Gook Gi Bong is headed for the countdown!

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,610
 And...

31
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,730
  Strike! He succeeded!

32
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,010
  That was great. What a great win!

33
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,100
 Thank you, Sato!

34
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,190
  Everyone, player Gook Gi Bong led the team to a win!

35
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,690
  That was great, Player Gook Gi Bong!

36
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,710
Hurry and get up!

37
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,320
Hey! Gook Gi Bong!

38
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,380
Oh, I won! So cold!

39
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,230
If it wasn't enough that you're passed out,

40
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,240
but you're even dreaming?

41
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,490
Do you want to rot in this state forever?!

42
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,290
Sorry, Coach, but I've got a call.

43
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,890
Hurry and just take it.

44
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,110
Hello? What is it? I'm in the middle of training.

45
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,480
What?! Darn!

46
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,520
What? Why are you running?

47
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,220
Where are you going?

48
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,540
  Guest House Waikiki

49
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,730
  Waikiki

50
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,690
How is it? The interior is clean and great.

51
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,840
- It's good, right? 
 - Yes.

52
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,270
And on top of that, the location is great so it gets a lot of business!

53
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,710
You can use all of it as it is.

54
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,110
- It's nice, right? 
 - Yes.

55
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,370
Think about it well.

56
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,090
This is going to drive me crazy. Why aren't they here?

57
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,970
Everyone that comes here has become successful!

58
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,290
We've had movie directors, reporters, mall owners, and even a pâtissière .

59
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,590
They're all successful!

60
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,740
Boss!

61
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,760
Who is this?

62
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
- Who are they? 
 - Oh, only these people are weird.

63
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,020
I'm serious.

64
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,170
I'm going to give it a bit more thought, and I'll let you know. Goodbye.

65
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,670
No, you should look a bit more closely! There's more to see!

66
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,940
- If you just--!
 - No, no!

67
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,890
Geez. What are you guys doing?

68
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,060
Boss, how could you put this up for sale without even discussing it with us?

69
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,580
You could pay your rent first. Do you know how behind you are?

70
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,510
Rent? Could you give us a week? We'll figure it out.

71
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,830
One week? Do you know how many months it's been that you've been saying that?

72
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,320
I think it's been about four months and two weeks.

73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,390
Alright. I'll give you one last chance.

74
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,010
Exactly one more week. Pay up all of your late rent.

75
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,550
Look at the state of you all. Are you guys a traffic light or what?

76
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,500
Thank you! Goodbye!

77
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,800
What's the point of this guesthouse?

78
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,290
Look who's talking.

79
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,470
- Hey, Red Light. Stop. Red Light!
 - Don't touch me!

80
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,810
Hey!  I called you so long ago. Why are you coming now?

81
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,520
Hey, I ran over as soon as I got the call. Can't you tell by the fact that I'm still in my wig and costume?

82
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,170
Gosh, I even brought this all the way here.

83
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,090
This is driving me nuts. How are we going to get all that money in a week?

84
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,060
I know, right?

85
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,500
Hey, do you have some money?

86
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,950
If I had money, do you think I'd be living off of you here?

87
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah, you don't have money. Never mind.

88
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,590
But, why do you look like this today?

89
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,780
That's what I'm saying. From Newsroom's Song Jun Seok to this...

90
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,350
Hey, look at me. A famous actor like me

91
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,580
is only doing these kinds of side roles. Does that make sense?

92
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,680
- Are you even that famous? You still haven't come to your senses. 
 - Shut up.

93
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,970
That's why you get dumped by girls.

94
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,270
Hey! I told you not to talk about Chewbacca— I mean, Seo Jin.

95
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,750
And, I wasn't dumped. We agreed to break up. Did I not tell you?

96
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,810
Alright, alright. I'm just going to go shower.

97
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,670
Suddenly a shower? You're really the worst.

98
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,650
Hey, wh-why are you dancing?

99
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,510
You stuck your tongue out? Don't shower, the water bill will be high!

100
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,730
Shut up! This is all because of you, so you take responsibility.

101
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,750
Why? Why is it my responsibility?

102
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,730
You're the CEO.

103
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,730
We're just investors.

104
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,760
You said we'd get tons of money if we invested. You said we'd be earning piles of money if we remodeled!

105
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,390
See the thing is with the global economic state and the whole gueshouse—

106
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,760
Be quiet! I'm the fool for trusting you and investing.

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,140
I'm the CEO only in moments like this.

108
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,410
Hey, hey. Look at that.

109
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,680
  People have gathered to watch the meteor shower.

110
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,950
So, what? What about it?

111
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,130
Just that a lot of people are there.

112
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,320
But who's Yoo Seong Woo?   (T/N: Phrase for meteor shower in Korean)

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,960
What kind of person is he that there's that much fuss? A singer?

114
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,310
- An actor? 
 - Hey, are you kidding me?

115
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,570
Oh, a soccer player?

116
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,050
Wow.

117
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,700
Wow.

118
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,360
Wow, I'm the one that's crazy for trusting you guys and living here.

119
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,750
It's all my fault! It's my fault!

120
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,770
So who's Yoo Seong Woo?

121
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,780
I feel like something good will happen.

122
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,160
Are we in a situation to be relaxing and watching the meteor shower?

123
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,720
Hey. This is the biggest meteor shower in history! We have to watch it.

124
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,210
You never know. If we make a wish on a star, money might fall right from the sky.

125
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,650
It's going to fall apart. Give up.

126
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,250
Why are you so negative all the time?

127
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,490
Then, what? We might be on the streets in a week. Is this a time to be positive?

128
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,820
That's why it's positive!

129
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,500
Woo Sik, listen to me.

130
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,380
Hey, Beanpole. Look.

131
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,340
Look at each other.

132
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,720
- This is the absolute worst, you know? 
 - So?

133
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,660
That's why I'm saying we've hit rock bottom.

134
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,640
Then, all that's left is for us to go up!

135
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,310
Do you think things could get worse from here?

136
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,220
This is the most positive situation there could be! Right?

137
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,320
Do you think that makes sense, you crazy bastard?

138
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,390
Yes!

139
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,840
Just die! It's a waste of oxygen for you to breathe. Just die!

140
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,630
- Hey, hey! Stop! 
 - Die!

141
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,560
Oh, hey! It started!

142
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,740
There! There!

143
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,100
Wow. So, that's a meteor shower. How amazing.

144
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,360
Right? Wow.

145
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,810
Hey, hey. Look at it.

146
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,090
Oh, hey look. That's so big, right?

147
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,270
- Right? It looks as if it's falling above our heads. 
 - Yeah.

148
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,880
- Right, Woo Sik? 
 - Whatever.

149
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,440
- But, isn't that getting a bit too close? 
 - Not sure.

150
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,360
Hey, it really might end up falling on our heads.

151
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,940
  Grand Opening

152
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,990
  A hundred million stars falling from the sky.

153
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,950
Hey, oh my gosh.

154
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,430
Hey. Where are you?

155
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,400
Did a meteor really fall?

156
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,030
On our guesthouse?

157
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,160
I think so.

158
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,120
So that's a meteorite!

159
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Right?

160
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,230
This is so cool! How amazing.

161
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,560
That's so cool, right? Isn't it? It's a meteorite!

162
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,160
You said nothing could get worse.

163
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,120
You said all that was left was for us to go up! That we had hit rock bottom!

164
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,430
I mean, it's true that we hit rock bottom, but I didn't think we'd go through the bottom.

165
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,590
Shut up! Oh, look at that.

166
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,700
There's a hole on the ceiling, too.

167
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,440
If the landlady knows about this, we won't be kicked out. We'll be sued! Do you know that?

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,940
Hey! Is it our fault that the meteorite went through the floor?

169
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,470
- It's gravity's fault! 
 - Do you think she'll believe us?

170
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,690
Last time, when it hailed so much that our windows broke,

171
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,480
she blamed it all on us!

172
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,520
That was hail, but this is a meteorite in our guesthouse! It's a meteorite!

173
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,720
What do we do?

174
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,370
Gosh, now a meteorite has fallen on us.

175
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,470
Why isn't anything working out for us?

176
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,550
Oh, hey, hey!

177
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,950
Hey, are you okay?

178
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,880
Hey, what do we do? Hey!

179
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,970
What a genius! A true genius!

180
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,500
Are you able to eat that right now?

181
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,180
- Yeah, it's yummy. 
 - Yummy?

182
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,940
Hey, what if the boss catches us?

183
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,070
Gosh, stop whining!

184
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,170
I'll figure it out myself.

185
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,300
- What will you do? 
 - Just watch from afar, Sir.

186
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,840
You need to use your head.

187
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,820
Oh, I think this hole has gotten larger since last night.

188
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,720
See! It's done! It's done!

189
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,940
Wow, the TV's so huge!

190
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,010
Tada!

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
- What's this? 
 - Hey.

192
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,100
We should sell anything to get every single cent we can, even if it's valuable to us.

193
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,970
Let's see. Where was it? Oh, here!

194
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,150
- What's that? 
 - You know Randy Johnson, right?

195
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,000
The major league's legendary pitcher.

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,880
This is a glove with Randy Johnson's signature.

197
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,370
- If we sell this, we should be able to make some money.  
 - Really?

198
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,620
  Gook Gi Bong, please be happy. I wish for your family's happiness. From, Randy Johnson. ^^

199
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,450
This is Randy Johnson's signature?

200
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,390
So, Randy Johnson wrote clearly in Korean and knows the phrase "I wish for your family's happiness?"

201
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,500
Well, he must've learned Korean.

202
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,200
Hey! Does that make sense?

203
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,030
It's fake! Fake!

204
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,420
No, it's not! I asked my senior for a favor and paid him ₩1,000,000 ($1K)!

205
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,350
And, look! What about this signed bat?

206
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,870
 Gook Gi Bong-san! Please be happy-desu! - Ichiro

207
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,120
Alright, let's just say Ichiro learned Koren.

208
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,150
- Still, would he write "desu" in Korean?
 - Oh.

209
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,070
"Oh"? Hey, Gi Bong. Use your head!

210
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,520
Shut up! So loud. I can't even eat.

211
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,970
Is it a crime that Gi Bong's stupid?

212
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,670
Come here, Gi Bong. As long as you're healthy, that's all that matters.

213
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,330
You're tall, and you're still growing!

214
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,810
I'm going to go insane.

215
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,200
What's this? Where'd this microphone with Jo Yong Pil's autograph come from?

216
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,080
I think this is Woo Sik's.

217
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,440
What are you doing? Get up!

218
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,170
- What? 
 - We have to fill that hole. Come back up.

219
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,460
Wow, this hole is bigger than we thought.

220
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,800
Since we have to cover it with the sofa, bring the sofa here then push it that way. Okay?

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,460
Alright.

222
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,170
Gosh, I fell in here! Why'd you push so hard?

223
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,240
You told me to push more! Why are you getting mad at me?

224
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,870
- Geez, you're so tall and strong, but so dumb! 
 - What?!

225
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,720
Hey, my foot's stuck here!

226
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,780
What are you doing? Hurry and help me out.

227
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,560
Wow, you are so much work.

228
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,990
CEO Cha? Are you here?

229
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,250
- Isn't that the boss's voice? 
 - Why is she here so early in the morning?

230
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,830
Hold on. She can't know about this!

231
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,610
- Hurry, hurry. 
 - CEO Cha!

232
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,950
I'll go down first and do something about her. You pull him out!

233
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,680
Alright.

234
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,120
Hello, Boss! What brings you here?

235
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,340
Oh, I just thought that I lost my earring here yesterday. Have you seen it?

236
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,600
Earring? No, I haven't.

237
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,230
Really?

238
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,160
Use some more strength!

239
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,820
I already am!

240
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,100
But, why isn't your foot budging?

241
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,630
What was that noise?

242
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,130
Wasn't there a noise just now?

243
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,510
A noise? No, I didn't hear anything.

244
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,970
Did I mishear?

245
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,850
Oh, but, where is it?

246
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,780
You must be busy, boss. I'll find the earring and bring it to you later.

247
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,720
No, I'll find it myself.

248
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,560
You heard that, too, right, CEO Cha?

249
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,600
A sound? No, I didn't hear it.

250
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,690
No! I heard it for sure.

251
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,860
I think it came from the ceiling area.

252
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,100
What are you doing right now?

253
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,730
So... Well, I love you.

254
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,640
What?

255
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,510
For a long time, I have loved you, Boss.

256
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,800
What are you saying?

257
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,730
It's a bit hard to tell you here.

258
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,050
Let's leave first! Let's leave and talk!

259
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,670
Come here!

260
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,330
Let me go! Geez, it hurts! Ow!

261
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,860
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,520
So, is that true?

263
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,640
- You love me?
 - What?

264
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,700
How long has it been?

265
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,940
Well...

266
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,990
From six months ago.

267
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,100
Six months?

268
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,770
Is that why you didn't leave even though you were criticized so much?

269
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,480
- Yes. 
 - Oh, my.

270
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,330
So, that's why.

271
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,140
Oh, I never even expected this.

272
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,670
Even so, this really isn't right. There's such a big age difference between us.

273
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,970
And, I have a child. You know that.

274
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,180
A young man like you and me? That wouldn't make sense.

275
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,040
Right? Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

276
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,370
Of course not. This really isn't right.

277
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,610
I was being too ambitious. I apologize.

278
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,490
I'll be off then.

279
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,630
- Try being ambitious. 
 - What?

280
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,870
You can't just cut off your feelings for someone like that.

281
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,920
So...

282
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,730
You should be ambitious.

283
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,890
I like ambitious men.

284
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,700
What?

285
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,090
- You decided to date the boss? 
 - Yes.

286
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,940
Today's the first day of our relationship.

287
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,420
We have to go on dates now.

288
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,300
Why would you lie about something like that?

289
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,520
- What do I do now? 
 - No, no.

290
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,040
It's for the better. She won't ask for rent for a while.

291
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,190
Would she ask for rent from her boyfriend?

292
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,730
- Then, I'm supposed to keep dating her? 
 - Yeah!

293
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,620
Hey, that's a scam!

294
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,950
It's not! You can just officially date her.

295
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,040
She's an alright woman.

296
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,220
She has a lot of buildings, money, wrinkles, and years of age!

297
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,980
Look at yourself. She's overflowing with generosity compared to you!

298
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,070
Do you think that makes sense right now?!

299
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,890
Then, should we just start living on the streets?

300
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,440
This is driving me crazy. Why did things turn out like this?

301
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,620
Think about it. It's an opportunity!

302
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,060
I'm here.

303
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,960
Hey. Did you come back from your part-time job?

304
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,360
Yeah. I had three part-time jobs today. I feel like I'm dying.

305
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,130
What's up with him?

306
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,840
He has his reasons.

307
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,430
What's this box?

308
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,860
What's with this photo album?

309
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,470
Oh, that's our high school yearbook.

310
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,650
Oh, really? Should I take a look?

311
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,600
Oh, you all are so young.

312
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,870
Who's this? She's surrounded by so many boys.

313
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,410
Who?

314
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,450
Oh, it's Soo Yeon! Han Soo Yeon.

315
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,760
Our first love.

316
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,170
- First love? 
 - Yeah. 
 - "Our"?

317
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,980
She was the first love for all of you guys?

318
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah! She was! Not just us, but all the boys in our entire school!

319
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,160
Really? She's not even that pretty.

320
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,280
Hey! Kim Jeong Eun!

321
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,020
Gosh, you scared me. Why'd you yell?

322
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,560
You're being too harsh. Soo Yeon's not pretty?

323
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,860
Soo Yeon was a goddess! A goddess!

324
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,320
  Hut, hut! Hut, hut!

325
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,900
  Hey, hey! Huge news!

326
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,150
  What is it that you're freaking out about?

327
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,500
  There's going to be a transfer student in our class today. A girl!

328
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,210
  She's supposed to be super pretty.

329
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,060
  I thought it was something big. We're not interested in things like that.

330
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,990
  Oh, here she is!

331
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,960
  Gosh, I said I wasn't interested.

332
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,510
  Move!

333
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,200
  As soon as we saw Soo Yeon, we fell in love.

334
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
  She had a nice face, body,

335
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,420
  and even a bright personality.

336
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,060
  She was perfection itself.

337
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,830
 Not only was her family rich, but there was also elegance exuding from her entire body.

338
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,870
  So, what happened? Did you confess?

339
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,860
  Of course we did.

340
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,450
  Knock, knock.

341
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,710
  Have a drink.

342
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,700
  Alright. Thanks. I'll drink it well.

343
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,300
  If you drink it, we're dating.

344
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,550
  Oh, what do I do?

345
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,620
  I already saw you take a gulp.

346
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,660
  So, today's our first day of dating?

347
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,890
 That day, Soo Yeon vomited all her gastric juice, but also her bile.

348
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,620
  Without a droplet remaining.

349
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,510
  What about you, Gi Bong? What happened?

350
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,340
  Hey, Han Soo Yeon!

351
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,580
  With this ball,

352
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,690
  if I hit it into that can,

353
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,280
  we'll be dating.

354
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,210
 That was the first day Gi Bong's pitch resulted in a home run.

355
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,540
  His first love ended right there.

356
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,240
How pathetic. So pathetic.

357
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,430
What about you, Woo Sik? You didn't confess?

358
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,870
That doesn't concern you.

359
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,580
Geez.

360
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,460
What's with him all of a sudden?

361
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,140
I'm not sure. He's like that whenever Soo Yeon is mentioned.

362
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,210
Right?

363
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,880
Oh, it's the stunt director.

364
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,080
Oh, yes, Director?

365
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,040
One more person?

366
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,990
Yes, I know someone who can do it. Yes.

367
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,220
Alright, got it. I'll see you later!

368
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,880
- Hey, you said you're not training today, right? 
 - No, why?

369
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,370
The stunt director just called, and he said one of the actors didn't show up. We need to go.

370
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,050
Come with me.

371
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,640
- Stop it! 
 - Hold on.

372
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,150
Alright.

373
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,520
Hut!

374
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,590
It's no joke!

375
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,900
Hey, hey! Quiet down.

376
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,410
From now on, listen to me carefully.

377
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,570
This scene is where the gangsters' mountain hideout is discovered by the police.

378
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,400
It's a fight scene with the police officers.

379
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,390
So, you just need to follow exactly what we practiced. That's it.

380
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,710
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes!

381
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,770
Okay. Now, then...

382
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,190
- Oh, what was your name? 
 - Gook Gi Bong.

383
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,570
Oh, Gi Bong! Alright.

384
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,640
Gi Bong, since you're the first person, you'll be hit in the head by the police officer's baton.

385
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,530
Then, you'll be dead instantly. Just like that. Okay?

386
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,290
Don't close your eyes. Never! Keep them open. Then dead instantly!

387
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,790
I'm going to die with my eyes open?

388
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,130
I told you, you die instantly!

389
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,290
- Instant death! 
 - Okay.

390
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,480
And, Joon Ho...

391
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,250
I'm Joon Ki. Lee Joon Ki.

392
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,860
Oh, Joon Ki. Sorry, sorry. Joon Ki.

393
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,330
Joon Ki, you'll fight the police,

394
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,110
but you'll be holding the fire extinguisher and die instantly like that.

395
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,580
- Instant death. 
 - Instant death!

396
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,640
- Yes. 
 - Alright.

397
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
Okay, got it.

398
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,350
Instant death.

399
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,770
Oh, uh, what was your name?

400
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,210
Excuse me?

401
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,430
Go along with it.

402
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,830
Gook Gi Bong.

403
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,820
Oh, Gi Bong. That's right.

404
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,110
Gi Bong, so, what should we do with you?

405
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,790
Gi Bong, since you're the first person, you'll be hit in the head by the police officer's baton.

406
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,360
You already told me.

407
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,800
Instant death.

408
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,410
Oh, I told you?

409
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,490
Gi Bong, instant death. Yeah! Don't close your eyes.

410
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,180
- Oh, and, Joon Bong. 
 - It's Joon Ki! Joon Ki! Lee Joon Ki!

411
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,340
Oh, Joon Ki! Joon Ki!

412
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,270
Joon Ki, you'll fight the police,

413
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,150
but you'll be holding the fire extinguisher and—

414
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,390
You already told me! Instant death!

415
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,690
- Lee Joon Ki, instant death! 
 - Oh, I told you?

416
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,280
Okay, instant death. Okay. Everyone knows what they're doing, right?

417
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,720
- Okay, Director. We're ready. 
 - This is the director.

418
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,930
- It's me! 
  - Director, we're ready.

419
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,540
He's gotten worse.

420
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,430
Joon Ki, isn't he a bit strange?

421
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,520
He's always like that. He got an injury to the head while doing a stunt, so his memory only lasts three seconds.

422
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
Oh, I see.

423
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,400
Just be understanding.

424
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,280
So, Gi Bong, you'll die instantly!

425
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,810
Oh, I'll die instantly, too!

426
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:42,230
Joon Ki, you're dead today!

427
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,960
Ready, action!

428
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,800
Instant death!

429
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,760
Ow, ow!

430
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,560
Hey!

431
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,750
No, no! No!

432
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,210
No!

433
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,330
Cut, cut!

434
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,970
Hey, quiet! Director, it seems as if there's a problem with the fire extinguisher.

435
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm the director!

436
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,850
Hey, hey!

437
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,550
Open your eyes! Hey!

438
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,010
Ow, ow, it hurts! I can't open my eyes.

439
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,640
My eyes won't open.

440
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,360
Hey, why would you hold your fire extinguisher like that instead of dying?

441
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,530
And how could you kill a guy who's already dead?

442
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm sorry.

443
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,420
Hey, hey.

444
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,320
This is so sad. Here, hold on.

445
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,330
Just rest here.

446
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,340
- Thank you. 
 - How sad.

447
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,190
But, who's the one next to you? I haven't seen him before.

448
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,270
Oh, how many times do I tell you he's my friend?

449
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,950
Oh, really? He's your friend? Why is he here, though?

450
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,420
Obviously he came to film!

451
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,120
No, never mind. He came to visit.

452
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Oh, to visit? Okay.

453
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,590
Oh, you did well coming to visit.

454
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,230
It's cool, right?

455
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,780
- Cool? 
 - On to the next scene.

456
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,650
Gosh.

457
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,460
Well, then...

458
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,420
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

459
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,600
Are you not filming?

460
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,130
We're resting because our eyes hurt! You told us to!

461
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,610
Oh, I did that?

462
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,200
Okay, I'm sorry. Just rest.

463
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,790
Geez! I'm going insane.

464
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,660
It's getting worse. Geez.

465
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,870
Ouch.

466
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,250
Stop it! Stop it!

467
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,390
I told you that you should should eat slower.

468
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,900
Oh.

469
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,290
Yes.

470
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,510
Why? Are you really that nervous to be with me?

471
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,890
What?

472
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,820
Oh, yes.

473
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,990
How cute.

474
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,720
I should've caught on sooner.

475
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,210
It must have been so difficult on your own.

476
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm sorry, CEO Cha.

477
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,250
Oh, no, I mean,

478
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,050
- I'm sorry, Woo Sik. 
 -   Woo Sik?

479
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,830
  This is driving me insane.

480
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,960
  Hey, Cha Woo Sik? How much longer will you take this?

481
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,910
  Even though you need to pay rent, this isn't right.

482
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,340
  Yeah, that's right. I'll just be honest with her now.

483
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,930
- Boss. 
 - Yes?

484
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,320
There's something I must tell you.

485
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,680
What is it?

486
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,540
The thing is...

487
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,110
Hold on.

488
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,200
Hello? What? It was a lie?!

489
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,750
Don't you know that I can never tolerate lies?

490
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,830
What do you mean what are you supposed to do?!

491
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,370
Put him in prison this instant!

492
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,620
How dare he lie to me? You can't go easy on scum like this.

493
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,550
Even if I have to put all my assets on the line, I'm not letting him slide!

494
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,060
Whether it be a 100 or 1,000 lawyers,

495
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,560
have it so that he doesn't see sunlight again for the rest of his life!

496
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,130
I'm sorry. It's another new tenant.

497
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:20,410
But he lied. The thing I hate the most in the world

498
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,530
is lying.

499
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,290
But, what was it you were going to say?

500
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,030
Oh, about that...

501
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,920
I wish time stopped like this.

502
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,010
Oh, my. What do I do with you?

503
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,000
Gosh, I fell asleep.

504
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,650
Ow, it hurts.

505
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,790
What is this? Why is it so quiet? Hello?

506
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,590
Hello? Is there anyone there? Ouch!

507
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,750
Hello?! Hello, Director?

508
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,170
Is there nobody there?

509
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,760
Gosh, you scared me!

510
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,310
What is this? Why'd you yell?

511
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,690
Sorry, sorry.

512
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,190
Hey, it's weird. I don't think anyone else is here.

513
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,230
Do you think they left us here after filming ended?

514
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,870
Hey, hey. Call the director quickly!

515
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,300
Okay, good idea.

516
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,550
Are you calling him?

517
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,910
Hey, hey! We left our phones earlier. You fool!

518
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,460
Oh, right! Hey! What do we do now?!

519
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,250
How do I know, you fool?

520
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,240
Gosh, how could they leave without us when we can't even see!

521
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,060
Hello?

522
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,320
Hello?!

523
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,390
- Hello! 
 - There are people here!

524
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,140
Hello?! Hello!

525
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,530
Hello! There are people here!

526
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:35,970
How nice. I haven't walked with a man like this in so long.

527
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,480
But... Why have you been so pale and sweaty since earlier?

528
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,820
Are you sick?

529
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,160
No, it's not that.

530
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,110
What is it, then?

531
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,920
Oh, I can't with you!

532
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,280
Is this good enough? If you wanted to link arms with me, you could've said so!

533
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,470
You fool.

534
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,170
  I'm going insane.

535
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,100
  If she finds out the truth, it'll be a mess.

536
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,370
  But, still, this isn't right.

537
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,890
  I'd rather go to prison, I can't fool my conscience anymore.

538
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,530
Boss, I have something to tell you.

539
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,450
What is it?

540
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,480
Well, the thing is...

541
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,050
- Mom! 
 - Well...

542
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,760
Oh! My son!

543
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,230
Woo Sik! Say hi. This is my son.

544
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,960
- Hello. 
 - Mom!

545
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,390
Oh, my son!

546
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,640
Woo Sik, say hello. This is my second son.

547
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,140
Oh, h-hello.

548
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,070
Who is this?

549
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,030
It's someone I decided to date starting today.

550
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,530
My sons, you understand me, right?

551
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,710
Of course. We're fine as long as you're happy.

552
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,860
But... Didn't he approach you because of your money, like last time?

553
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,320
Oh, no! He said he's loved me since six months ago.

554
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,220
But, he finally mustered the courage and told me now.

555
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,590
What a relief.

556
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,280
Excuse me.

557
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,830
We won't let you be if you make our mom cry.

558
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,130
Woo Sik's not that type of person!

559
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:09,410
Oh, didn't you say you had something to tell me earlier? What was it?

560
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,220
Well...

561
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,010
I was just going to say it's a shame we must part ways.

562
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:28,670
Oh, my. Wow, you really say all you want! Even in front of my kids!

563
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,900
Hey, Joon Ki! Let's go together!

564
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,600
Just hurry and follow! Where are we?

565
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,340
Are we even going the right way? What is this?!

566
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,800
We should've just stayed there. They could've come back for us.

567
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,600
What? Come back for us?

568
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,940
I've known that stunt director for eight years.

569
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,040
But, he still doesn't know my name! As if he'll come back to look for us!

570
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,370
Still, how could we go on like this when we can't even see?

571
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,260
We'll just get on the street and find a taxi. Just follow me!

572
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,320
Alright. Geez.

573
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,420
- Hold on. 
 - What?

574
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,860
Oh, my stomach hurts all of a sudden!

575
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,200
Geez, I told you to eat only a little! You had three bowls!

576
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,970
What can I do about being hungry?

577
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,460
Gosh, where's the bathroom?

578
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,500
How can you go to the bathroom when we can't see anything?

579
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,830
Just do your business anywhere!

580
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,170
Alright.

581
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,770
But, do you have tissues?

582
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,490
Why would I have tissues in the middle of the mountain?!

583
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,380
- Just wipe it with your necktie! 
  - Okay.

584
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,880
Why do you keep getting annoyed?

585
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,330
How can I not be annoyed?!

586
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,530
Go do it. I'll be here.

587
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,040
My stomach.

588
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,190
Hey, Gi Bong! There are tissues here!

589
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,520
  Scent Of The Woods Camping Grounds

590
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,560
How about we play a silent 007 game?

591
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,660
- That sounds good. 
 - If you make a sound, you'll get a punishment. I'll start first.

592
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,250
Oh, my stomach. Ow.

593
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,280
Ow, my stomach.

594
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,770
It's quiet. There must be no one here.

595
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,370
Geez, I thought I'd die.

596
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,750
Oh, right, my tissues.

597
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,560
Gi Bong!

598
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,310
Gi Bong! I had tissues!

599
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,250
What is it? What's this sound? Who are you with?

600
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,010
- Joon Ki! 
 - Yeah?

601
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,260
I pooped.

602
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,230
  Waikiki Guest House

603
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,140
We couldn't get money and our eyes got hurt.

604
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,320
We just got utterly humiliated.

605
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,470
How could life be like this?

606
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,970
It's better than my situation.

607
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:53,490
I have to go to a theme park with the boss and her sons tomorrow.

608
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,430
She wants me to buy cotton candy.

609
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,860
I have my own sons now, too.

610
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,230
How come nothing works out for us?

611
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,450
I lived as best as I could.

612
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,870
Why does life never turn out right?

613
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,010
We had pretty great lives in the past, right?

614
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,930
Yeah, that's true.

615
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,030
When I think about the old times, I thought that by now,

616
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,270
I'd be in Carnegie Hall with an orchestral group

617
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,780
and having an amazing concert there.

618
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,530
I thought I'd be in Hollywood and getting an Academy Award.

619
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:36,620
I thought I'd be in the Major League and have my arms around Ryu Hyun Jin and Choo Shin Soo.

620
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,420
But, you know,

621
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,830
it's not over for us yet, right?

622
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,990
It's not time to give up, right?

623
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,470
Of course not. I'm never giving up.

624
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,240
Of course not. It'd be such a waste to give up now.

625
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,320
I have to strike out Choo Shin Soo before I give up.

626
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,050
Hey, hey. We're all Koreans here. Let's not be like that.

627
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,070
Don't be so harsh on Choo Shin Soo.

628
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,350
Is that so? Well, then,

629
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,330
I won't give up until Choo Shin Soo gets a homerun from my pitch.

630
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,710
- Yes, that's good. 
 - What?

631
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,680
Alright. Let's cheer up. Success is for those who don't give up.

632
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,500
- There's a saying like that. A yet seong in (ancient saint) said that once. 
 - Yeah.

633
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,310
Let's just try our best until the end. It'll work out somehow!

634
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,950
But, Woo Sik, who's Yet Seong In?

635
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:32,930
What?

636
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,830
You said Yet Seong In said those words.

637
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:41,840
Is there a last name of "Yet" in our country? I've never heard that surname before.

638
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,430
Hey, hey, don't do it! You'll feel worse.

639
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,470
Let's just sleep. I'm tired.

640
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,040
- Alright. 
 - Hold onto me.

641
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,100
Hey, take me, too! Who is Yet Seong In?

642
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,040
- Hey! Is he a scientist?  He's Chinese, isn't he?
 - Shut up!

643
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,560
Hey! Take me, too! I can't see, either!

644
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,250
Be careful! Ow, it hurts!

645
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,820
Hold on.

646
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,870
Oh, I can see!

647
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,780
Wow, what is this?

648
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,720
Oh, my gosh! What a relief.

649
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,390
You guys live like this? Why?

650
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,870
But, what happened to Woo Sik?

651
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,700
Woo Sik?

652
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,700
He went... somewhere.

653
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,710
Mom, Mom! Let's just ride the carousel one more time!

654
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,960
- One more time! One more time! 
 - Again?

655
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,450
Woo Sik, you're fine if we ride one more time, right?

656
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,900
Whoa, Ajussi, you're the best!

657
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,220
Ajussi, you're the best!

658
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,530
  Your Wedding

659
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,230
Oh, yes!

660
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,700
Hey, hey. I'm getting the first scoop.

661
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,020
Hey, if you're going to be like this, work at a ramen company!

662
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,540
One chopstick full.

663
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,920
Just take a little!

664
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,570
- You should just eat little. 
 - I didn't even take anything yet!

665
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,300
- I'm here. 
 - Hey, sit and eat ramen.

666
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,610
Hey. How was the theme park?

667
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,590
Hey, that headband suits you really well.

668
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,980
Did you buy her sons cotton candy?

669
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,960
Wow, do her sons say, "Thank you, Father!"

670
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,720
"Daddy, Daddy!

671
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,690
Shut up!

672
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,920
What is this? What is this?!

673
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,480
Why do those grown men like the carousel so much?

674
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,150
I rode that more than 30 times!

675
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,130
Just be patient until we get enough money for the rent and repair costs.

676
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,690
- Yeah. 
 - What?

677
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,550
With all those combined, it costs almost ₩ 10,000,000 ($10K).

678
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,030
You're telling me to keep this up until we save that much money?

679
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,440
Well, do you want to be on the streets, when it's all cold and windy out?

680
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,660
I'm going insane.

681
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,060
Who is it now?!

682
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,240
Oh, yes, Noona?

683
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,090
Oh, really? Okay! I'll be there soon.

684
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,240
What is it? What happened?

685
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,230
It's a sunbae who is a wedding planner. She said someone bailed on the congratulatory song for a wedding and wants me to fill in.

686
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,060
You're going so soon? Have some ramen!

687
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,330
Should I be eating ramen right now?

688
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:50,600
I'm going to get money as soon as I can and break free from this horrible situation.

689
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,300
So, you guys shouldn't be playing around!

690
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,960
Go out and get some money! Got it?!

691
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,790
Ouch!

692
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,230
Hey, it's time for my part-time job.

693
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,340
Hey, hey! Let's go together!

694
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,380
Let's keep eating.

695
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,050
- Noona. 
 - You're here!

696
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,990
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly. The congratulatory singer got into an accident.

697
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,880
No, I'm thankful. I needed money fast, so it worked out well.

698
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,530
Really? That's good, then.

699
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,050
Let's greet the bride and groom first. Follow me.

700
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,860
Alright.

701
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,470
- Thank you.
 - You're so beautiful.

702
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,950
Your dress is so pretty!

703
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,850
So pretty.

704
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,710
  Han Soo Yeon?

705
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,870
Why are you being so shy? Let's go greet them.

706
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:00,100
Hello, Bride!

707
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,830
What's with you? Are you crazy?

708
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,940
Noona. Let's leave first. Please.

709
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,800
How can we leave suddenly?

710
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,760
Oh, I'm sorry, hold on!

711
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,900
Hey! Don't do this! What's with you?

712
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,580
Let go!

713
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,300
- What's with you?! 
 - I'm sorry.

714
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,630
Noona, I'm sorry, but look for another person. I'll be off.

715
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,770
Hey! Where are you going? Why are you being like this?

716
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,160
Don't ask. Just let me go.

717
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,950
No, but there's 30 minutes left before the ceremony. How can we find another singer?

718
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,540
You said you needed money fast!

719
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,950
Even if I need money fast, this isn't it.

720
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,440
I'm really sorry.

721
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,610
Alright, alright. I'll give you double the pay. ₩1,000,000 ($1K).

722
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,200
Noona, money isn't the problem right now!

723
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,500
- ₩1,500,000 ($1.5K). 
 - I can't do this!

724
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,120
₩2,000,000 ($2K).

725
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,830
Alright. Whatever. I can't take this any longer!

726
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,770
I have a favor to ask then.

727
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,240
Oh, yes, I wanted a consultation for a loan.

728
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,550
Oh, my employer?

729
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,650
I don't have one.

730
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,890
A collateral? I don't have anything.

731
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,030
Oh, a car? I have one!

732
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:32,030
Her name is Rebecca. She's a 2001 or 2002 model...

733
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,400
Hello? Hello?

734
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,820
They hung up again.

735
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,540
Gosh, I'm being looked down on.

736
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,530
What are you doing?

737
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,140
How much ramen did you use so calmly?

738
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,780
Eight packs.

739
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,820
Hey, we should eat a lot to get strength to work.

740
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,060
Alright. Keep eating. Eat up.

741
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,900
So hot.

742
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,510
Can't a pack of money fall from the sky?

743
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,510
  A few days ago, a meteorite fell on a greenhouse in Rome.

744
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,930
- It fell here, too! 
   - They're calling it a lottery that fell from the sky.

745
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,400
- I wish. 
   - In the past, for a rare 500g meteorite,

746
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,370
  it was sold for ₩500,000,000 ($500,000K).

747
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:27,090
 The exterior is seriously blackened, however since the interior is denser than most rocks,

748
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:31,410
 it is a defining factor to show that it might be a meteorite.

749
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,560
I'm serious! It's true!

750
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,580
It fell on the store a few days ago.

751
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:45,580
Yes, yes. The Grand Coffee Shop? I know of it.

752
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,560
I'll see you later, Professor. Goodbye!

753
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,840
Joon Ki, what'd he say?

754
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,000
He's an expert on meteors said that he'll see our pretty little thing before he buys it.

755
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,370
- Let's go. 
 - Hold on.

756
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:59,140
You're going to take Rebecca?

757
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,190
Yeah.

758
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,120
I don't want to get in that.

759
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,850
It smells weird inside.

760
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,720
Hey, she'll be hurt when she hears that. You smell even worse! Just go.

761
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,500
Hey! I'm serious.

762
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,930
You smell worse!

763
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,800
Let's go.

764
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,640
What's this? What's wrong with this?

765
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,640
Oh, it's fine. You said she smelled weird, so Becca's feelings were hurt!

766
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,720
Just close the door so that we can go.

767
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,200
I'm sorry.

768
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,990
It's totally fine.

769
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,850
You can just close it really gently. Like patting a baby.

770
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,590
I'm sorry, Becca!

771
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,560
Is this AI, or what?

772
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,540
It's fine! We can close them together.

773
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,680
All at once.

774
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,200
Let's go. One, two, three!

775
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,160
Joon Ki!

776
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,600
This is great!

777
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,920
But, how much do we have to sell this for?

778
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,020
Earlier, the news said it's ₩500,000,000 ($500,000K) for 500g.

779
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,760
Then, this much... Maybe ₩1,000,000,000 ($1M).

780
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,720
No, no. ₩2,000,000,000 ($2M)!

781
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,370
- ₩2,000,000,000? 
 - No, no.

782
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:25,170
We'll sell this, pay our rent, then...

783
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,530
I'm sorry to Rebecca, but we'll buy a great car.

784
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

785
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,160
Then, what else?

786
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,970
I want go to a fancy buffet and eat all I want.

787
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,460
- Oh, yummy! 
 - Then...

788
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,180
We'll go to the best sushi restaurant and have the best sushi.

789
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,290
Then... We'll have the best Hanwoo beef from the best restaurant.

790
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:45,850
Hey, hey. Hold on. What are you doing?

791
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,000
He's my meteorite. Why are you making plans?

792
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,230
Your meteorite?

793
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,680
Why is it yours?

794
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,360
It fell on my guesthouse!

795
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,950
You guys said that I'm the CEO and you are the investors!

796
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,550
So, I can just pay you for your investments.

797
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,860
If you're going to play it like that, then the boss is the true owner! How is it yours?!

798
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,130
How do you know?

799
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,650
I'll call her myself. Myself.

800
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,800
- Hey! Are you crazy? 
 - What do you want to do?

801
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,480
Do you want to go splitsies or not?

802
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,990
Or, I'm just going to call the boss!

803
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,200
Hey, don't do it, or you'll die! Don't do it!

804
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,060
So, hurry and answer me!

805
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,990
If not, I'm going to press call.

806
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,250
Yeah? Okay! You want to do this, huh? Then go for it.

807
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,330
Try it! Try it! Try it!

808
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,750
Hey, hey! Alright! I'm going to call!

809
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,150
You see it, right? I'm halfway there.

810
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,440
It's about to be connected!

811
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,240
If I let go, the call is going to go through!

812
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,950
- Don't do it! 
 - Hey!

813
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,570
So, let's go splitsies!

814
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,420
Hey!

815
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,430
Focus on driving!

816
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,860
Alright, now, the star of the day, the bride, will enter.

817
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,600
Please give her a big round of applause!

818
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,280
The bride is entering.

819
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,900
She's beautiful as always.

820
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:36,580
Because of money, I'm singing the congratulatory song at my first love's wedding.

821
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,720
Life sure is crappy.

822
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,210
- You animal. 
 - Shut up!

823
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,830
You scumbag.

824
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:53,860
Hey. We're going to split it exactly in half, okay?

825
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,610
If you say something else,

826
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,950
I'm going to call the boss right away. Got it?

827
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,530
Okay, okay!

828
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:06,020
Gosh, you're so cheap. Focus on yourself.

829
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,880
Hold on! Why are you holding it? Let's hold it together.

830
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,840
Oh, are you being suspicious of me right now? You think I'll run away with this?

831
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,790
You're just the type of guy to do that.

832
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,400
Hey, just get out.

833
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,710
How can we both get out as we both hold it?

834
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,360
Why not? I'll leave this way, too.

835
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,990
- Okay, then. 
 - Yeah, get out!

836
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,520
Hey. Hey!

837
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,590
Get out.

838
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,000
Hey! Lee Joon Ki!

839
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,590
Hey, you!

840
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,130
I told you not to play tricks!

841
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,800
- You're dead. 
 - I won't run away!

842
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,110
I won't run away!

843
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,640
- Let go! 
 - No!

844
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,330
Ouch! Do we have to go this far?

845
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,630
People are watching. It's my meteorite!

846
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,310
Let go, then. I'll take it myself.

847
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,130
No! You're not even my friend, you cheap bastard.

848
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:01,340
Then, if we're not friends, don't talk informally, Mr. Lee Joon Ki.

849
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,670
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gook Gi Bong.

850
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,380
What do I do? The coffee shop is that way.

851
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,910
- No, it's not. It's that way. 
 - It's this way!

852
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:11,030
- It's this way!
 - You little...

853
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,710
Ouch!

854
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,280
My ₩2,000,000,000 ($2M)! My meteorite!

855
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,280
No! No!

856
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,170
Oh, my ₩2,000,000,000! My meteorite!

857
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,880
Is it not broken?

858
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,850
Hey! Hey!

859
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,780
What are you doing?

860
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,480
What are you doing?

861
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,870
Han Soo Yeon.

862
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,180
There she is.

863
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,930
It's really Soo Yeon.

864
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,260
Wow, our first love is getting married.

865
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,790
It's a strange feeling.

866
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:09,270
Yeah. If one of us had succeeded with our confessions, we could be standing next to her now.

867
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,660
- Right? 
 - It could've been me.

868
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,390
Next, the congratulatory song is in order.

869
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,070
Please give a big round of applause!

870
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,330
What is that?

871
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,000
What is this?

872
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,600
What a peculiar congratulatory singer.

873
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,830
- You are all surprised, right? 
 - Is this the Masked Singer or what?

874
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,050
This person is a new singer who will be debuting soon.

875
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,800
So, he said that he cannot have his face shown.

876
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,370
We ask for your understanding.

877
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:44,460
Well, let's listen to the song. Please applaud!

878
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,850
There is a song that the bride and groom wanted,

879
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:55,480
but I do not know that song well, so I prepared another song.

880
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,570
  What are you doing here?

881
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,160
  Oh, Soo Yeon!

882
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,000
  Oh, were you scared? I'm sorry. What are you doing, though?

883
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,510
  Oh, I'm arranging the song I want to sing at the concert.

884
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:55,040
  You're performing at a concert? Can I go?

885
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,620
  Oh, yeah, of course. I'll give you my invite.

886
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,420
  Really? Thanks.

887
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:06,040
  The next song is class 2-3's Han Soo Yeon's request.

888
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:13,220
  - I requested this song! How is it? 
 - It's good.

889
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,550
  It's my favorite song.

890
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,590
  Oh, really?

891
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,610
  Should I practice this song and perform it for you in the future?

892
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,060
  Really? You promise?

893
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,330
  Promise me.

894
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:05,420
I sincerely congratulate you two.

895
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:10,360
Oh, and to the bride, please be happy.

896
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,200
Goodbye, Soo Yeon!

897
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,490
Be happy, Soo Yeon!

898
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:19,090
Next... The greetings will be made to the parents.

899
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,620
Good work! We survived thanks to you.

900
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,570
Here's your money.

901
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:26,120
No, thanks. I'm good as long as I kept my promise.

902
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,900
Promise? What promise?

903
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,710
- What about the money? 
 - Give it to them as a congratulatory gift.

904
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,080
Hey, hey! It's the masked man!

905
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,330
We enjoyed your song!

906
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,780
Gi Bong! Joon Ki!

907
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,950
What? Who are you?

908
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,380
It's me!

909
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,220
Hey, why are you here?

910
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,210
You... You're the masked king that sang Soo Yeon's congratulatory song?

911
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,310
Well... About that...

912
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:58,880
Why are you guys here? What's that rock?

913
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,990
This... This rock.

914
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,880
Whatever. Just leave. Let's go out and talk.

915
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,370
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

916
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,480
What's he doing?

917
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,190
Over there!

918
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,550
What is this? What's going on?

919
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,240
This is a common scene from the movies.

920
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,030
Isn't that Soo Yeon's ex-boyfriend?

921
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,700
Sir, the company went bankrupt!

922
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,580
Leave!

923
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,490
- Bankrupt? 
 - Joon Gi, what's bankrupt?

My meteorite!

929
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,890
That's my meteorite, Gi Bong!

930
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,740
Hey! It's mine!

931
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,310
No! My meteorite!

932
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,450
Just let him go!

933
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,250

My meteorite! My meteorite!

My ₩2,000,000,000!

939
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,650
Who the heck took my meteorite?

940
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,180
Why would you come here with that?

941
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,230
Did we know this would happen?

942
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:47,160
It's good manners to watch your first love for the last time as she gets married!

943
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,420
And, you, you sang the congratulatory song to your first love!

944
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,670
That was for money!

945
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,800
Whatever! Our money is gone now.

946
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,130
For the last time,

947
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:03,010
can we just watch the security footage? Just once more.

948
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,230
We've already watched it ten times. Let's just go.

949
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,760
Once more.

950
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,900
- Give up! 
 - Once more.

951
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,220
You never know.

952
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,280
Hurry up!

953
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:22,590
Wait. Joon Ki, wasn't the trunk open earlier?

954
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:28,200
I don't know! It just opens and closes by itself.

955
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:33,500
I want to go back!

956
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,490
My ₩2,000,000,000!

957
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,580
The wedding hall was turned upside down!

958
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:44,280
Oh, they bragged so much about how rich they were,

959
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,160
they went bankrupt, the creditor came, and it was a huge mess.

960
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,520
Lee Joon Ki, I'm a fool for trusting you.

961
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,210
- Gosh, shut up! 
 - You and your ₩2,000,000,000!

962
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,830
It was my meteorite! Geez!

963
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:59,140
Stop fighting!

964
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,850
- Shut up! 
 - Stop fighting!

965
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:04,390
You shut up, too! We lost our ₩2,000,000,000!

966
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,670
- You call this a car? 
 - It's all wasted.

967
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,530
It's an automatic door now!

968
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,300
Geez.

969
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,380
Hey, hey, are you okay?

970
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,680
Hey!

971
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,140
Whatever. There's nothing to steal, anyway.

972
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,760
- Just throw this crappy car away! 
 - Go in!

973
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,460
Geez!

974
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,080
Wait! Hold on. There's a noise from the car.

975
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,180
What kind of noise would come from the car?

976
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,130
You must be going insane.

977
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,560
Shut up. Just go inside.

978
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,900
Come in.

979
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,550
Hey, hey.

980
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:47,570
What's with this? How strange.

981
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:06,360

982
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:18,470
What is it?

983
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,280
It's... Something's in there.

984
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,560
What is it? Move aside.

985
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,550
Hey, if you're fooling around with the meteorite, you're dead. I have a meteor trauma now.

986
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,110
What would be in here?

987
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,830
Ah!!!!!

988
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,540
♫  Why am I like this  ♫

989
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,440
♫  In my heart  ♫

990

997
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,170
  Preview

998
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,920
  We met our first love for the first time in ten years.

999
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,950
  We should leave a good impression.

1000
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,840
  - Is this the time to be talking about "first love?"
 - Woo Sik!

1001
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,710
  That's your girlfriend?

1002
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,750
  - Should I just stay the night? 
 - What?

1003
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,830
  The boss has a mental problem.

1004
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,490
  She has a mental problem.

1005
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,700
  - I can't believe this. 
 - Action!

1006
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,010
 Are you Bidam?

1007
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,440
  - You—!
 - Director! Hold on.

1008
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,720
  The bugs. The dust!

1009
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,710
  Kang Min Ho, come to your senses!

1010
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,270
  Oh, what's there?

1011
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,390
  We're stuck!

1012
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,820
  What's inside all of this?

1013
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,990
  - What do you mean? It's all for you. 
 - This?

1014
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,030
  Oppa.

1015
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,920
  I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

1016
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,970
  - Who is it? 
 - We're Soo Hyeon's first loves.

1017
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,510
  What about it?

1018
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:54,920
♫  I want to look at you all night long  ♫
