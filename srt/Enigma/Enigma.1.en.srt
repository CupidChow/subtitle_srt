1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,640
This door?

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,960
Does it even open?

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,840
Wow! This is beautiful.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Come on.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,960
Can you see that?

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Let's go to our secret hiding place.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,680
Follow me.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
This is amazing!

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
What are you taking a video for?

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,840
You said you were
going to show me what you drew?

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
Show me right now. Show me!

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,320
Wow, it's beautiful.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
Don't be embarrassed.
You should be proud of this.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,760
What am I thinking?

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,840
I don't know.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,680
Well...

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm just lost in this, I guess.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,680
I've always thought

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,960
that life makes me
feel like I'm trapped in a...

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,000
a cage of glass so clear it's invisible.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,320
As I'm getting older,
I only grow more and more sure of it.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,560
Because it's like I'm starting
to see tiny cracks right before my eyes.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,520
But these cracks...
no adults have ever told us about them.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,440
And it's strange
that no one else ever notices them before.

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,400
<i>I guess that's exactly why</i>
<i>no one can ever tell me</i>

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,160
<i>what is hidden beneath the cracks.</i>

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,880
Wanruthai.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,600
You're... You're bleeding.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,640
<i>Honestly,</i>

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,000
<i>what's under the cracks</i>

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,480
<i>might be something nobody should see.</i>

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
But I don't know.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,760
Even if it seems dangerous,
or highly unnatural,

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
<i>I still want to take a peek inside.</i>

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,920
Am I scared?

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,600
Well... I am.

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
<i>But it's exactly because it's terrifying,</i>

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
and mysterious,

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
that it makes my heart beat so fast.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
<i>I don't want any of you...</i>

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
WANRUTHAI KAMNUENGWITTAYA
GRADE 12 CLASS 1

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
<i>...to worry too much about what happened.</i>

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,600
EXCELLENT STUDENT AWARD: WAN

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,040
<i>The incident was</i>
<i>by no means life-threatening.</i>

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,040
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 43 STUDENTS
WHO GOT INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,800
<i>However, Wanruthai</i>
<i>must be suspended indefinitely.</i>

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,840
<i>She simply needs</i>
<i>to treat her mental outbursts</i>

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,280
<i>which the doctor suggested</i>
<i>are caused by prolonged severe stress.</i>

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
<i>As for Miss Jarinee...</i>

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Jan: Here's the video.

51
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,280
<i>She will also</i>
<i>be taking a break for a while.</i>

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>But you don't have to worry.</i>

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Fern: Crap. I just saw this. It's so sick.

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,120
<i>Miss Jarinee herself</i>
<i>has asked me to tell you all</i>

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,680
<i>that you should focus on</i>
<i>the upcoming exams.</i>

56
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Guess all that stress finally got to her.
Some top student she is.

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,200
The school is totally gonna cover this up.

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
<i>Study harder.</i>

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,120
It's obviously a drug-induced psychosis.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
No way.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,080
She's the top student of our year.
There's no way she would do drugs.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,600
Yeah, she needed
to stay up all night studying, you know?

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,920
What else would make someone
do something this crazy otherwise?

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
Now that got me thinking.

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>We have acquired a new biology teacher</i>
<i>to temporarily replace her...</i>

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,000
Hold on. Where is Fa?

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
I saw her around.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,160
But I bet it's like the usual.

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,680
She's probably wrapped up
in her own world somewhere.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,600
GRADE 12 CLASS 1

71
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,720
Student.

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,880
What were you doing just now?

73
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,720
I... came here to take
some class materials for Wan,

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,440
but there were shards of glass.

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
Show me your hand.

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
What is your name?

77
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Fa... Farinda.

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,920
Are you... the new teacher?

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,800
You needed to get the class materials
for your friend so badly...

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
that you had to skip assembly?

81
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,320
- Yes.
- You said you saw some glass shards.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,480
I don't actually know anything.

83
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
I think I'd better go to the infirmary.

84
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
You...

85
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,840
didn't happen to see
something strange, did you?

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh, Mr. Ajin.
The teachers' lounge is that way.

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Oh.

88
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,800
I was just thinking
this looks exactly like a classroom.

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,560
How could you
have mistaken that, I wonder.

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,520
You should go
before you're late to class.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
Yes.

92
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
Hey.

93
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,480
Don't waste your time
going to the infirmary.

94
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Just go wash your hands.

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
Pimmy: We have a quiz after lunch.
Tawaan: Okie.

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,320
Look at the new bio teacher, Ajin.

97
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,480
Hello, class. I'm Ajin.

98
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,280
I'll be your biology teacher
while Miss Jarinee is recuperating.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,360
Lame as hell.

100
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,480
G: He looks hot, though.

101
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
Jan: He's got that old dude vibe.

102
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,040
Shall we begin?

103
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Well... Our lesson today
is the nervous system.

104
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,080
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

105
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
Well, students...

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,120
You, I guess.

107
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,280
Can you tell me
how the nervous system works?

108
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,640
Well, I don't...

109
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,160
See? That's what happens
when you don't pay attention in class.

110
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,160
I'll tell you, then.
The nervous system is...

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
What I was going to say was
I don't understand the question.

112
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,680
The nervous system
of what are we talking about?

113
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,200
If it's the nervous system
of invertebrates like amoeba,

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
then they have no neurons.

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,800
They use pseudopodia to move around,

116
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,000
which is commonly
called the amoeboid movement.

117
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
But if it's vertebrates we're
talking about, then I can tell you too.

118
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,800
There are two types, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.

119
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,200
Has the previous teacher
already covered this in her lesson?

120
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
She hasn't.

121
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
But our school is, like,
known for just throwing pop quizzes at us.

122
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,320
And the final exams
are usually so freaking difficult.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,160
More difficult than the standard.

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,200
All just to make sure we're smarter
than students in other schools.

125
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,960
That's why I think nearly all of us
have already gone through these lessons.

126
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
But don't worry.

127
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,440
The school makes sure we know

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,520
how important
getting good grades is for our future.

129
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,960
Alright. Give your friend here
a round of applause.

130
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,000
I heard
the curriculum here is brutal but...

131
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
I didn't think it's this serious.

132
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,400
But with the way things are right now...

133
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,880
Aren't you all concerned?

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Honestly.

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,480
As human beings, what you're doing
would get only 50 out of 100 points.

136
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Because this school has never supported
you to do anything else, but study.

137
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,840
There are no clubs,
and they don't advocate for hobbies.

138
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,520
It's like you are all in an isolated cage.

139
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,840
You will eventually
graduate with a full score, I'm sure,

140
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,840
but your social skills
are going to be zero.

141
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,760
Zero immunity to anything.

142
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,880
It's going to be dangerous.

143
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,640
Do you really
want it to turn out that way?

144
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Excuse me.

145
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Your fly is open.

146
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,280
Watch it.

147
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,600
Sorry.

148
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,800
Look at him.

149
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,520
I wonder how he tricked
the principal into letting him teach here.

150
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,160
But what he said just now
kinda makes sense.

151
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Come on, Fa. Daydreaming again?

152
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
You need to get your head
out of the clouds.

153
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,280
Let's go. We have a quiz.

154
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,840
Don't call her out so much.

155
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,360
Every time she looks like she's in a daze,

156
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,200
she always gets a top score somehow.

157
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
<i>How have you been, honey?</i>

158
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,560
<i>Isn't it exam season?</i>

159
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,880
<i>Can you handle it?</i>

160
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,320
<i>Just the usual, Mom.</i>

161
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,280
<i>But you sound tired.</i>

162
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,240
When I say "usual,"
it means it's as difficult as usual.

163
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,080
And... I guess I'm a little stressed.

164
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,360
Strange things
seem to keep happening of late.

165
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
<i>How so?</i>

166
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
It's...

167
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,880
<i>Is this about your study?</i>

168
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,400
<i>You have to tell me</i>
<i>these kinds of things, you know.</i>

169
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,880
It's actually nothing
out of the ordinary, Mom.

170
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,240
Yes. Goodnight.

172
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,280
STUDY FOR BIOLOGY

173
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Fa.

174
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,120
Did you hear me?

175
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,920
Did you hear what happened last night?

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,160
What happened?

177
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,400
Why do you guys look so excited?

178
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,440
How could we not be?

179
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
You know Matt from Class 4?

180
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,520
She drowned herself last night.

181
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,560
We heard it was around 8:00 p.m.

182
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,920
<i>when a security guard</i>
<i>was patrolling like usual.</i>

183
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
<i>When he got to the pool,</i>
<i>he was in for a surprise.</i>

184
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,640
<i>He gradually came across pieces</i>
<i>of a uniform scattered along the way,</i>

185
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
<i>piece by piece.</i>

186
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,120
<i>And finally, when he looked up...</i>

187
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,320
Holy crap. That gives me
goosebumps every damn time.

188
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,160
That's not all.

189
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,400
The teachers
checked Matt's desk this morning.

190
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>And you know what they found?</i>

191
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,360
<i>Someone hid a camera under her desk.</i>

192
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,960
I think there's a pervert in our school.

193
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
True.

194
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,320
I bet they drug people or something.

195
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Matt acted just like Wan did.

196
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Could be.

197
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,960
They were both top students too.

198
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,800
Hello, Miss.

199
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,440
Oh, you scared me, Fa. What's going on?

200
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,280
Khaohom, you're close with the teachers
in the teachers' lounge, right?

201
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,360
And?

202
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,840
Can you sneak in there
and find something for me?

203
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,680
Wait...

204
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Is this about Matt?

205
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,920
What did you see, Fa?

206
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,040
I...

207
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,040
<i>Mr. Ajin?</i>

208
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,080
So you want me
to sneak into the teachers' lounge

209
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,280
to see if he has anything strange on him?

210
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
Too risky.

211
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,840
You know it's exam season.
If I get caught, I'll be suspended.

212
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,280
Exactly. If it were me sneaking about,
it'd be suspicious.

213
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,240
But you're a familiar face.

214
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,600
Help me out, Khao. Please.

215
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Fa.

216
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,600
Do you realize how ridiculous
you're sounding right now?

217
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,200
Not that I don't know what you're like,
but you're way out of line this time.

218
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,280
This is worse than every other time.
Why are you so obsessed about this?

219
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,160
But don't you think all this is strange?
Wan and Matt were never like this before.

220
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,280
And everything happened right
when that new teacher Ajin arrived.

221
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,800
And there's also...

222
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,280
There's also what?

223
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,520
I think...

224
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,280
you wouldn't get it even if I told you.

225
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,200
Of course. You're right.

226
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,760
Someone like me
would never understand anything.

227
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,160
Then you can investigate all this
by yourself, smart-ass.

228
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,320
Hold on. That's not what I meant.

229
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Oh?

230
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
I'll tell you what.

231
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,640
The only reason I've been trying
to lick up the teachers' boots

232
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,520
is because I've been hoping
that it would help me with my grades.

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
Even just a little.

234
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Maybe I could be
half as smart as you then.

235
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,560
AJIN NAKARITTA

236
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,880
Don't worry, Principal.

237
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,600
I'll finish up a few more papers
and I'll be going home.

238
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,120
Yes. Nearly done.
I'll go home once it's all taken care of.

239
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,120
Oh, no, I'm not hard-working or anything.

240
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,840
I don't want to work late, actually.

241
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
I'm afraid of ghosts, you see.

242
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,960
Thank you for your concern.

243
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Goodbye.

244
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,200
<i>Misbehaving children must be disciplined.</i>

245
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,680
<i>Misbehaving children must be disciplined!</i>

246
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
What are you doing here?

247
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,120
It's... I...

248
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,240
I forgot something.

249
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,640
You scared me off my pants.

250
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,400
Don't you know it's dangerous
to be out here this late?

251
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,560
Come. I'll walk you to the gate.

252
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,640
You know weird things
have been happening around here lately.

253
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,960
Like, just now,
I don't know which kid did it,

254
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,000
but they trashed the whole school.

255
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Kid?

256
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
Come to think of it,

257
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,840
did you hear a kid speaking just now?

258
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,920
What do you mean?

259
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,680
I... think I heard a child say,

260
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,360
"Misbehaving children
must be disciplined."

261
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
And are you...

262
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
misbehaving?

263
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,440
What should we do
with misbehaving children?

264
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,200
Oh, right!

265
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,800
Misbehaving children
must stand up straight, arms crossed.

266
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,040
And what else?

267
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,440
Oh, right!

268
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,200
They should... get hit!

269
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,960
Get hit!

270
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,080
Get hit!

271
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,680
Get hit!

272
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,560
Get hit! Get hit!

273
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,320
Get hit! Get hit!

274
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,440
Get hit! Get hit!

275
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,160
So...

276
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,680
are you misbehaving?

277
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,480
Where are you running?

278
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,920
Misbehaving children must be disciplined.

279
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,280
Where are you going?

280
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,800
Where are you going?

281
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,760
Get hit!

282
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,160
I got you!

283
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
Running away is very bad.

284
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,560
But I got you now.

285
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Please. Don't hurt me.

286
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,160
You're misbehaving.

287
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,000
You know what happens
to misbehaving children?

288
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,840
Misbehaving children must be disciplined!

289
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,560
No!

290
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,080
Who are you?

291
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,560
Who are you? Are you misbehaving, too?

292
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,920
Bad child.

293
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,240
Bad child.

294
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
You're a bad child!

295
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,040
Misbehaving children must be...

296
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,400
<i>See, honey? It could be that, you know?</i>

297
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,200
<i>When you're so wrapped up in something,</i>
<i>you just start dreaming about it.</i>

298
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,680
<i>I know that, Mom. But it all felt so real.</i>

299
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,640
<i>It felt too real to be just a dream.</i>

300
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
<i>But it is still just a dream.</i>

301
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,520
<i>Calm down.</i>

302
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,000
<i>I know it felt real enough for you</i>
<i>to believe that it was,</i>

303
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,720
<i>but what you believe</i>
<i>is just what you believe.</i>

304
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,560
<i>It won't become real</i>
<i>just because you really believe it.</i>

305
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
Yeah.

306
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,440
Thanks, Mom.

307
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,440
I have to go now.

308
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
Watch out!

309
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,080
Sorry.

310
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,960
I was trying to clean the camera,
but the ladder was wobbly.

311
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,760
Oh, shoot.
You're all soaked. I'll get you a towel.

312
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,960
Found it!

313
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,640
Oh! That's more of a rag than a towel.

314
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,960
What's wrong?

315
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,920
It's nothing. It's just...

316
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,840
I met a guy last night
who looked just like you.

317
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,880
But like...

318
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,200
You and that guy
are totally freaking different.

319
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Gosh, how could you be so clumsy?

320
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,760
I am?

321
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,320
Of course!
Look. You splashed me, didn't you?

322
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,920
How can I go to class like this?
You have to help me.

323
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
How can I help?

324
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,320
AJIN NAKARITTA

325
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,600
Wait a minute, Fa.

326
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,960
I remember I have a spare uniform
around here somewhere.

327
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,280
Where is it?

328
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,520
But I'm glad you could smile like that.

329
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,800
I've always only ever seen you frown.

330
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,360
Really?

331
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,880
It's probably
because of what happened recently.

332
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,440
It really is heavy to bear.

333
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,640
Especially what happened last night.

334
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
You mean
the dream about that guy you mentioned?

335
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Come on.
People have weird dreams all the time.

336
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
Dream?

337
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,160
I never said anything about dreams.

338
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,120
There's no one else here.

339
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,840
So drop your acting.

340
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,360
I'm pretty sure now
that everything that happened was real.

341
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,400
What... are you talking about?

342
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,440
I don't understand.

343
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,440
I'm talking about the fact
that the man I saw last night was you.

344
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,040
And I know too, that every strange
incident that happened in this school,

345
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,640
definitely has something to do with you.

346
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,240
Fa. I think you're imagining things.

347
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,000
Imagining things?

348
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,840
Yes.

349
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,880
I told myself
I was imagining things at first.

350
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,640
<i>Ever since what happened to Wan,</i>
<i>I've been keeping my eyes peeled.</i>

351
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,200
<i>I've been gathering evidence,</i>
<i>so I can give myself some answers</i>

352
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,120
<i>if I really was just imagining things.</i>

353
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,360
But you know what?

354
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,400
<i>The more I see, the more I know</i>
<i>I wasn't imagining any of it.</i>

355
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
<i>Someone really tried to hurt Wan and Matt.</i>

356
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,040
And you have something to do with it.

357
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
Hold on.

358
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,720
What makes you think
I'm involved in any of this?

359
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,320
You know what happened to Matt, right?

360
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,760
You know the teachers
found a camera under Matt's desk?

361
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
I left it there.

362
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,760
What?

363
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
You did?

364
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,240
Yes, because I was sure

365
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,880
<i>that the next victim would be Matt.</i>

366
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,400
I don't understand.
Why are you telling me this?

367
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,920
You could be punished for this, you know?

368
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,640
What I'm trying to say is, that wasn't
the only place I hid the cameras.

369
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,440
<i>I left them</i>
<i>in many other places in school.</i>

370
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,200
<i>I believed it could capture</i>
<i>the real culprit, or whatever.</i>

371
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,400
<i>And one place I hid a camera... is here.</i>

372
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,320
Fa.

373
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,600
You tried to fool me.

374
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,480
You tried to make me
chalk it off as a dream.

375
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,240
Why did you do that?

376
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,600
No...

377
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,440
How did you do that?

378
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,320
This doesn't make any damn sense.

379
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Answer me.

380
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,880
You students here really
are far too smart for your own good.

381
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,080
Do you realize how dangerous
your little detective escapade is?

382
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,040
Dangerous?

383
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,280
It's you who don't know anything.

384
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,520
I know Wan is a very smart girl.
She's the top student in our year.

385
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
So was Matt.

386
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,440
She came only second to Wan.

387
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,800
And you know who comes third?

388
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,760
<i>Me!</i>

389
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,080
And you're telling me
to not do anything to stay safe?

390
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,560
Who the hell would believe that!

391
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,040
Know what I found
on my desk the other day?

392
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
This.

393
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,800
Fa.

394
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,440
Calm down.

395
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,680
When did you find this?

396
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,920
Stop asking me questions.

397
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,160
And start telling me
what the hell this is.

398
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,600
- Fa...
- Am I the next victim?

399
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,200
Fa, how long have you been carrying it?

400
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,240
Stop trying to dodge my question!

401
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,600
Answer me!

402
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,240
Tell me what the hell is going on!

403
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,560
Don't get quiet! Tell me!

404
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,160
Tell me if I'm the next victim!

405
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
Stop being so quiet and answer...

406
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,240
Which building do you think is taller?

407
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm climbing this thing.

408
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,520
<i>Our school is so freaking boring,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

409
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,480
<i>All anyone cares about</i>
<i>is grades and results.</i>

410
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,280
<i>They don't care about anything else.</i>

411
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,520
How do I want it to be?

412
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,800
I'm not sure, either.

413
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,240
But I used to think
that if something fantastical happened,

414
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,960
or being swept off from this boring world
like in a fairy tale, it would be nice.

415
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,960
Does that make me sound insane?

416
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,800
<i>You're thinking it, too!</i>

417
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,080
Hey.

418
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,120
What is this place?

419
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,360
How...

420
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,440
How did I get here?

421
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,840
What are you doing to me? Mr. Ajin!

422
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,120
I'll kill you.

423
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,520
You deserve to die.

424
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,640
What...

425
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,440
What was that just now?

426
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,000
What is this?

427
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,480
No. No, please. No. No! No. No!

428
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
What's going on?

429
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,720
Fa, stay calm.

430
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,320
- Stay calm.
- Help! Somebody help me!

431
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,880
- Get yourself together, Fa.
- No!

432
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,200
Help! Somebody...

433
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,200
No more, please. No more...

434
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,680
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

435
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I'll kill you! Let me go! I'll kill you!

436
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,920
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

437
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Die!

438
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,040
Are you back now?

439
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,200
Good job.
I gave you 90 out of 100 points for that.

440
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,560
Ten points off for trying to kill me.

441
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
I know you must be confused right now.

442
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,960
But what you saw earlier
was just forged by your imagination.

443
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,720
I lifted all the curses off of you.

444
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,480
Don't worry. You're safe now.

445
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,960
And... you're already
way too deep into this.

446
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,600
Since it can't be helped,
I might as well tell you the whole truth.

447
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,280
First of all, there's one thing
you need to know before anything else.

448
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,920
In this world,
there really is such a thing as magic.

449
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,440
<i>Some of it is just superstitions...</i>

450
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,600
LOVE POTION

451
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,000
<i>...some downright fake.</i>

452
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,920
TALISMAN

453
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,920
But the deepest truth about it is
that it is real.

454
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,160
And there are people in this industry
who have lived among you all this time.

455
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:37,200
You see, while you students
are going about your life, all naively,

456
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,440
<i>there is another world</i>
<i>hidden just beneath yours.</i>

457
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,680
And I'm one of them.

458
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,800
I disguised myself as a teacher
to be here to look for someone.

459
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,560
Someone who is the cause of all this.

460
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,840
<i>There is someone at school</i>
<i>who resorts to black magic.</i>

461
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,880
<i>And every strange thing that happened</i>
<i>was because of this person's curses.</i>

462
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,560
And yes, you are one of the victims.

463
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,080
That's why, for your own safety,

464
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,240
from now on,
you have to live in this room.

465
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,240
Huh?

466
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,360
You will stay with me and help me
investigate who the real culprit is.

467
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,920
Do you understand?

468
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,960
<i>Let's work separately.</i>

469
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,160
<i>I'll lift the curses off</i>
<i>of all the places in school.</i>

470
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,480
<i>You keep an eye on this list of names.</i>

471
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,920
I believe either the next victim
or the culprit is a name on that list.

472
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,240
<i>Good news is</i>
<i>I think the culprit is an amateur.</i>
