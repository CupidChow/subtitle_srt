1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,560
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>all this is strange, Khaohom?</i>

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,320
<i>And everything happened</i>
<i>right when that new teacher Ajin arrived.</i>

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
You... didn't happen
to see something strange, did you?

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>You're already way too deep into this.</i>

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,880
From now on, you have to live in this room

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,040
and help me find out
who the real culprit is.

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,560
How would I sleep
with all these staring at me?

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,520
Yes, Mom.

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,320
I just called to tell you I'll be
staying over at a friend's place to study.

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Yes.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
What?

12
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,880
Never seen a half-naked man before?

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
It's not that.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
Why aren't you dressed?

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,320
It's my room. I can do whatever I please.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,120
Here.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,160
You sleep here.

18
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,160
The sofa?

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Where do you sleep?

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
In my warm bed.

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,800
No arguing.

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,120
Do you remember our rules?

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,880
From now on, you listen
and comply with everything I say.

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,240
Do not cross the line I draw.

25
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
Do not suspect anything.

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,080
Do not question me in any way.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,680
Because what you're going to face
from here on out is very dangerous.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,960
And if you don't do exactly as I tell you,

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,440
it's your life on the line.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Remember those?

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,240
As for school, I heard you loud and clear.

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,120
If exams really mean that much to you,
you can go to school if you want.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,720
Just don't forget that your school
is the most dangerous place right now.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Other than that,
you can do whatever you want.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,920
Feel free to grab anything
you need in this room.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
You're an adult so just handle yourself.

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,120
You know...

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
You're nothing like I thought you'd be.

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,680
What?

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
What did you expect me to be?

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
Wear all white
like some shaman geezer in a TV drama?

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,480
You have no idea
how well-paid my line of profession is.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,960
That's not what I mean.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,080
I'm talking about your... personality.

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,360
I just thought
you'd be a much kinder teacher.

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Look.

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,800
I told you I'm not even a real teacher.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Yeah, you did.

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,120
So drop the perfect image of
a proper adult who actually respects you.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,880
That just ain't me.

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,280
Then why'd you dress
and act like that at school?

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,760
It's just... more convenient that way.

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,320
Oh, I nearly forgot.

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,560
There's one more rule.

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
What are you doing?

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
This is my side of the room.

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,600
The rest of it
beyond this thread is yours.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
You can go anywhere you want.
It's all safe for you to check out.

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,720
But if you cross into my territory...

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,480
I'll starve you.

62
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
What the hell?

63
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,200
Did you have to be so dramatic
using the holy thread?

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
It just so happened to be within my grasp.

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,000
And I don't have any tape with me.

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,960
What? You scared of the voodoo stuff?

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
You didn't look particularly scared
when you were out playing detective.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,200
Who said I'm scared?

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,800
How about this? I won't starve you.

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,240
If you want to cross over to this side,
then by all means.

71
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,680
But once you're over here,
you might run into some kind of energy...

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,160
or some kind of spirit
waiting just for you.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Boo!

74
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Right, buddy?

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
100 YEARS OF ASTROLOGY CALENDAR

76
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
Wake up! Rise and shine!

77
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,320
- What's going on?
- It's time to wake up.

78
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Don't make such a ruckus in the morning!

79
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,960
It's late.
Don't you have school to attend?

80
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
It's not that late.

81
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
Did you have to ride so fast?

82
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,920
Look. I could hardly eat my breakfast.

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hey, stop yapping.

84
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,400
Who'd have thought a girl would take
that much time to get ready for school?

85
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,840
But why do we have to
pull up so far behind school?

86
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,120
You want your friends to see us
coming to school together?

87
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,720
Come on. It's a bit far off
but no one will see us.

88
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,840
- "A bit"?
- Stop complaining.

89
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,440
You're the one
who refused to lay low and stay...

90
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,240
Right. Okay.

91
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
Thank you for the ride, Mr. Great Teacher.

92
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,520
Hey. Wait.

93
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,400
Put this on at all times.

94
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Do not ever take it off.

95
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,360
You know what that means?

96
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,840
- I could have put it on myself.
- Stop speaking.

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
What?

98
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,480
Did I make you blush?

99
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,760
No.

100
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,320
It's... You said yourself
you didn't want anyone to see us.

101
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,880
Hence, the far-off parking spot.

102
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,160
Don't worry.

103
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,520
My plans never fail.

104
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,840
They're perfect.

105
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
So...

106
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,000
What's this about, Fa?

107
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
What's your relationship with Mr. Ajin?

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,520
I told you we're nothing like that.

109
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,880
Come on.

110
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,320
Look at this.
You're way too close to deny it.

111
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,720
Oh...

112
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
Maybe she's just cozying up to him...

113
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,040
for grades?

114
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Am I right?

115
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,520
Since everyone's already speculating,
we might as well tell them the truth.

116
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,080
Here. You forgot your sandwich.

117
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,800
So this uncle brought it for you.

118
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Uncle?

119
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,800
Uncle?

120
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
Yes. I'm Fa's uncle and she's my niece.

121
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,800
The Principal
didn't want us to tell anyone,

122
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,000
fearing the other students
might accuse me of favoritism.

123
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,960
But you guys don't have to worry.

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,960
We might be related,
but I'm totally impartial.

125
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,160
Bye, then.

126
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,520
Come see me
at my office during the lunch break.

127
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,960
We need to discuss that family matter.

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
Oh, right...

129
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,120
Your mom said you need to check your text.

130
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,680
<i>Fa, I talked to your Uncle Ajin.</i>

131
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>Look out for him, all right, honey?</i>

132
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>He's just moved here, after all.</i>

133
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>I don't want him to be clueless.</i>

134
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,680
<i>And don't cause trouble</i>
<i>for your uncle, all right?</i>

135
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,800
<i>Don't expect any special treatment</i>
<i>just because he's related.</i>

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,280
Yeah, that checks out.

137
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,360
What is it now?

138
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
What did you do to my mother?

139
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,880
She would never say that.

140
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,600
She doesn't even know I live with you.

141
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,880
How could it come to this?

142
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,240
Things fell out of plan.
I just had to fix it.

143
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,000
You did something
to hypnotize my mother, didn't you?

144
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Yeah.

145
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
What?

146
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
That's my mother!

147
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,400
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to do that?

148
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,640
You can't use your spells,

149
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,360
magic, or whatever occult stuff
on her like that.

150
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,440
What if something goes wrong with her?

151
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,920
Stop thinking of it as such an evil thing.

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,400
There are the kinds of occult
that are safe, you know?

153
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,640
What I did to your mother
was just like a simple magic trick.

154
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,000
If it's not your parents on the line,

155
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,360
don't say such an irresponsible thing.

156
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,160
I'll have you know

157
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,200
what you did
was more than crossing a line. Asshole.

158
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,400
I know you're not an actual teacher,
but act like a decent one.

159
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Listen.

160
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
I will say it only once more.

161
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm an occult specialist who came here
undercover to catch some bad guy.

162
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm no teacher.

163
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I don't care about your decency.

164
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,480
More importantly, remember your rules.

165
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
Do not suspect me.

166
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,160
Do not question me.

167
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,320
So just keep your mouth shut.

168
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Great.

169
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,200
Now that you've understood,
we can get to work.

170
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,000
What did you call me here for?

171
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
We need to hash out our plans.

172
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,800
We will work separately.

173
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,160
I'll take a look at each suspicious spot
around this place.

174
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,880
As for you...

175
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
Here.

176
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,280
This is the list
of top scorers' test result.

177
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,920
Keep an eye on the people on the list.

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,160
Don't draw attention.

179
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,160
Just keep a watchful eye on them.

180
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,280
The good news is... we still have time.

181
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,120
We still have time?

182
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,040
I observed what our bad guy did,

183
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
I think she's probably just an amateur.

184
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
What?

185
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,120
You're saying that everything
that happened was an amateur's doing?

186
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Surprised?

187
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,280
But that's the truth.

188
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,320
These days, if you know
your way around the Internet,

189
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,080
then it's easy to get this kind of thing.

190
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,200
Somewhere like the dark web
is a good place to start.

191
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,120
It all depends on
how strong-willed you are.

192
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,840
If you think about it,

193
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,120
the black magic that this person has used

194
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,160
is by no means advanced.

195
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
She just mostly made
the victims see hallucinations.

196
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Right?

197
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,320
Somebody, help me!

198
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Really?

199
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Look at this.

200
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,520
The long and short of it is that,
to cast a strong curse,

201
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,720
it relies on three factors.

202
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,000
First, the object.

203
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,480
Something like
a cursed object or a talisman.

204
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,520
Second, the mind of the caster.

205
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
CURSE - OBJECT - MIND

206
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,440
Lastly...

207
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
The place.

208
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,280
Right. This is the most important part.

209
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,360
Have you ever heard
of ghost stories in schools?

210
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
WHY DOES OUR SCHOOL
HAVE SO MANY GHOST STORIES?

211
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,480
It's actually common in any school.

212
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
TRUE

213
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
PLEASE TELL ME

214
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,760
It's just that
it's especially intense here.

215
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,640
<i>It could be because you guys</i>
<i>study too hard, so you're full of rage.</i>

216
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,600
That means

217
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,760
the curses here at your school are worse
than the rest, and they're infesting,

218
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,400
<i>which makes the black magic this person</i>
<i>uses become much stronger than normal.</i>

219
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
Like I said, we're working separately.

220
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,240
I'll exorcise these places.

221
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,360
You... keep an eye
on the people on this list.

222
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,520
I believe either the next victim
or the bad guy is among that list.

223
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,680
If it goes the way I expect,

224
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,160
as soon as I exorcise these places,

225
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,240
at least, this person won't be able to
hurt anyone else in this school anymore.

226
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,640
All that's left is... we grab her
and then it's case closed.

227
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
All though that would be a shame...

228
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,480
Why would it be a shame?

229
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,800
Forget it.

230
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,520
Go to class for now.

231
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,640
We'll start our plan when school is over,
after everyone's gone home.

232
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Okay?

233
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,640
KARATRAT KUEAVECHACHARN

234
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,680
<i>Show me! Won't you show me?</i>

235
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>- Stop it.</i>
<i>- Got you!</i>

236
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
<i>- Quickly.</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

237
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,040
<i>Oh, see that?</i>

238
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Namsai.

239
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
GRADE 12 CLASS 4

240
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,840
- Boo!
- Gosh!

241
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,360
Namsai, what were you looking at?

242
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,560
I don't know.
I just felt like I was being watched.

243
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
Come on.

244
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,120
It's late. No one else is here.

245
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
You're probably imagining things.

246
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,840
She's right. You probably are.

247
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,840
Let's go home.

248
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,160
Fa?

249
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,600
What's wrong?

250
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
No!

251
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
Fa.

252
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,200
Fa! Help me!

253
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,560
No! Help me!

254
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,520
Fa! No!

255
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,880
Fa!

256
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,200
Hello.

257
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,440
<i>Took you long enough.</i>

258
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
Taking a nap, were you?

259
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,120
Shut it.

260
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,960
What do you want?

261
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,400
<i>It's action time.</i>

262
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,360
<i>Class is long over</i>
<i>and almost everyone's gone home.</i>

263
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,920
I'll start exorcising right away.
It could take a while.

264
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,960
Don't forget to gather information
on the kids on the list I gave you.

265
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,400
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
<i>Let me know if anything comes up.</i>

267
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,560
The curse's as strong as I thought.

268
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,320
Don't go and disappoint me now.

269
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,120
<i>Hello.</i>

270
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,680
Namsai. It's Fa.

271
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,440
<i>What's up?</i>

272
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I...

273
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,320
I want to know where you are
and what you're doing.

274
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,720
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

275
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,040
Well, strange things
have been happening lately,

276
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,920
so the teachers asked me to check up
on us students to see how we're doing.

277
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,160
So I thought of you.

278
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,240
<i>Because I'm one</i>
<i>of the top students, isn't it?</i>

279
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,840
<i>That's why you're worried.</i>

280
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,840
Well, yes.

281
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,520
<i>You think there's something fishy</i>
<i>about this, don't you?</i>

282
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,000
You feel it, too?

283
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
<i>Of course.</i>

284
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>But don't worry. I'm home now.</i>

285
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,680
That's good to hear.

286
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,120
<i>Oh, hey, Namsai.</i>

287
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,240
You're still here?

288
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
You're still at school?

289
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,600
Sorry.

290
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,960
Someone sent me a weird letter
asking me to meet in the Music Room.

291
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,680
I thought I should check it out
in case I find something.

292
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,280
Music Room - Storage Room
Gymnasium - Dumpster

293
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,320
Wait, Namsai. Don't go.

294
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,720
What?

295
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Are you going to do this all by yourself?

296
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
<i>Don't worry. I'll be quick.</i>

297
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,200
Wait...

298
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,800
Namsai.

299
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Namsai! Are you alright?

300
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,600
You're okay now. You're okay.
I'm right here. It's all right now.

301
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,520
Hey, wait!

302
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
It's all right now.

303
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,680
It's okay now. It's okay.

304
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,520
How are you? Do you feel better now?

305
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,280
<i>Yeah.</i>

306
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,240
<i>But that scene is burnt into my eyes.</i>

307
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,080
<i>I talked to my mother.</i>

308
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,120
<i>I don't think I can go to school.</i>

309
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,720
It's okay. Just take a few days off.

310
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,680
You need to rest.

311
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,720
Well, I'm not
taking any more of your time.

312
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

313
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,400
Yeah.

314
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
How was it?

315
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,560
If you mean the Music Room,
I checked everywhere.

316
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,600
There are no curses in that room.

317
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,320
Nothing on the dummy, either.

318
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,080
I think our guy
just wanted to scare her off.

319
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Don't worry about your friend.
She's completely safe.

320
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,520
Good thing it's just an amateur
so that's all she can do.

321
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't get it. Why would she go that far?

322
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,720
Namsai is so scared
she can't even go to school.

323
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,240
I guess that's exactly what our guy wants.

324
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
By the way...

325
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,320
Are you close with Karatrat?

326
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,720
Well...

327
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,440
We were when we were in Grade 10.

328
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
And?

329
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,040
We just...

330
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,120
drifted apart
when we moved on to the next grades.

331
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
That's all.

332
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,080
Just forget about my history.

333
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
What do we do about the bad guy now?

334
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,880
Don't worry about that.

335
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,280
Why not?

336
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
Now that your friend is also a victim,
I can conclude with certainty

337
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,360
that the bad guy
is really targeting top students.

338
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,840
That means grades
are all that matters to her.

339
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Here. I've got a new plan.

340
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
What's that?

341
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,760
Hey. There's a pop-up test prep class.

342
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,160
On a freaking Saturday?
I already have a date.

343
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I heard it's from an actual exam.

344
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
- I'll be there. Definitely!
- Same.

345
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,200
<i>I'll set up a test prep class on Saturday</i>
<i>with all the best teachers there.</i>

346
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,320
<i>I'm pretty sure anyone who cares about</i>
<i>their grades will all show up.</i>

347
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,760
<i>And our bad guy</i>
<i>won't just stand by and watch.</i>

348
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,920
<i>She will come too.</i>

349
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,200
<i>What I need you to do is go to class</i>
<i>and see if anyone stands out.</i>

350
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,840
<i>I'll exorcise the rest of the places.</i>

351
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
<i>Do you understand?</i>

352
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,280
<i>I'll let you handle this on your own.</i>

353
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
<i>I believe if our bad guy shows up,</i>

354
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,200
<i>she's going to give herself away</i>
<i>in some way.</i>

355
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,080
<i>Or if there's going to be another victim,</i>

356
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,800
<i>we'll be there to save her in time.</i>

357
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,160
STUDENT RANK LIST

358
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,760
<i>What time do you think it is?</i>
<i>Go get a seat right now.</i>

359
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,800
<i>Alright. Let's continue with our lesson.</i>

360
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,520
<i>As you can see, there are three elements,</i>
<i>the question is...</i>

361
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,240
How was it? Anything out of the ordinary?

362
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,960
So far, there's nothing worth noting.

363
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,320
Everyone really showed up
just like you thought they would.

364
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,800
And they all looked normal to me
so I don't think anyone's been harmed yet.

365
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,880
As for the rest of them... they just
looked like they were focusing in class.

366
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Is that so?

367
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Looking for something like this
is more tiring than I thought.

368
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Take it easy.

369
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,080
Stressing over it
will only make it worse, you know.

370
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,440
It's only natural, isn't it?

371
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,720
There are, like, a hundred students,
and you're only looking for one person.

372
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,000
Of course it's exhausting.

373
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
You're so over the top.

374
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,960
There were only, like, 40 people
in the class this morning.

375
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
What?

376
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,280
There are 43 students
in my year in the Science Program.

377
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,400
And that class just now
was a chemistry class.

378
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,760
<i>But if I'm not wrong,</i>

379
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,040
<i>I think there was one student there</i>
<i>who isn't in the Science Program.</i>

380
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,320
Why did she show up?

381
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,320
Seven o'clock. Wavy hair.

382
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Study program: Arts-French

383
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,880
Don't turn around she's staring at you.

384
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,640
What do we do? Just grab her?

385
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,640
Not enough evidence.

386
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,800
What if she gets away?

387
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
Don't rush it, Fa. Don't panic.
I'm coming up...

388
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,280
Excuse me.

389
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,440
Is something the matter?

390
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,360
I have a stomachache.
May I go to the infirmary?

391
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,920
Excuse me. I need to go to the restroom.

392
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,640
Fa, wait.

393
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,800
I'll go that way.

394
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,680
INFIRMARY

395
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,160
Hey. Anyone there?

396
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,120
If you're in there, say something.

397
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,640
Or I'm breaking the door down.

398
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,920
Don't worry.

399
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,760
I'll protect you.

400
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,240
I'll count to three.

401
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
One.

402
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,120
Two...

403
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,520
Stop it! Stop!

404
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,920
- Stop!
- You're done.

405
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,560
- What the hell?
- Stop it!

406
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,960
Stop right now!

407
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,000
Stop it! Stop!

408
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,320
I said stop! Stop!

409
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,240
Get out!

410
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,720
Get out! Stop it!

411
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,280
- Stop!
- Get out!

412
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
You perverted spirit!

413
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,000
So your name is Yiwa, from Class 5.

414
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,360
President of the occult club,
with a total number of members of one,

415
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
which is yourself.

416
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes.

417
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,800
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ajin.

418
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,320
I thought you were the guy responsible for
all the weird things that are happening.

419
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
Oh, is that right?

420
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,000
What made you think so?

421
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,360
Well...

422
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,320
You're acting so sketchy.

423
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,040
And you're always alone with Fa.

424
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,760
So I thought...
you were trying to beguile her.

425
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,160
Beguile? Me? Beguiling?

426
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,960
I'm trying to protect her
is what I'm doing.

427
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,600
Do I look like someone
who could be a bad guy?

428
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,040
Come on, Mr. Ajin.

429
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,200
Even I thought
you were the bad guy at first.

430
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,160
- Yeah, well. Shut it.
- But it's true.

431
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,800
Well...

432
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,480
So... the fact that the top students
have been taken out one by one

433
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
is really because someone
is using black magic, right?

434
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
- No!
- Yes!

435
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,120
- So it is!
- It is not.

436
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,840
There's nothing of the sort.

437
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
You. Stop it.

438
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,680
I know what you're thinking.

439
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,600
But Yiwa might be able to help us.
At least, she's...

440
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,520
You girls are such a pain in my neck.

441
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,160
Alright, then.

442
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,000
All you need to know is that

443
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,760
a student is poisoning her friends,
making them sick.

444
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,960
And the teachers
are looking for that very student.

445
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,240
If you want your friend
to help look for clues, then by all means.

446
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,760
But other than that,
I won't be telling her anything.

447
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,960
Understood?

448
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,880
I promise I'll do my best to help Fa.

449
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,760
Go back to class. I have to go.

450
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,040
Where are you going?

451
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,760
Getting my actual job done.

452
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,000
Don't dawdle and just hurry back to class.

453
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,720
I thought for sure
I'd get suspended for that.

454
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,400
But do we really need to go back to class?

455
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't want to go.

456
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,160
Well...

457
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,280
Should we skip it?

458
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,600
A top student like you?

459
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,480
Skipping?

460
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
Hell yeah.

461
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
There it is.

462
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,320
This one's freaking packed.
A bit hard to understand, though.

463
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,760
This one is rather whimsical.
An easy-breezy read.

464
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,080
Thanks.

465
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,720
I didn't take you
for someone who's into the occult.

466
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,880
I thought you'd be an exemplary student
who doesn't care about anything else.

467
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,240
Not at all. I just like reading.

468
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,560
And I don't have hobbies.
So I guess that about sums me up.

469
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,120
Sometimes I envy people
who know what they like.

470
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Someone like you.

471
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,840
Really?

472
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,200
I don't scare you?

473
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,280
You know, ever since
I started getting into the occult,

474
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,080
my friends have all
disappeared from me one by one.

475
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,880
I guess everyone thinks
it's scary and dangerous.

476
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,120
Thank you for not being afraid of me.

477
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,240
I get them, though.

478
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,040
It's really scary, if you think about it.

479
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,320
Like that story?

480
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,920
That someone in school
is using black magic?

481
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,440
Please just tell me, Fa.

482
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,080
I promise I will keep it a secret.

483
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,880
Magic really does exist, doesn't it?

484
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,360
What types of magic do they use?
Any miracles happened yet?

485
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,880
Slow down. It's nothing that fancy.

486
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,200
The best she could do
is make people see illusions.

487
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
That's it.

488
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Really?

489
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Such a shame.

490
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,880
But who knows?
Maybe she's just an amateur.

491
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,880
Don't you agree?

492
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,480
Someone else said that too.

493
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
That's really not it.

494
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,280
AUDITORIUM

495
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,680
FOREST BEHIND THE SCHOOL

496
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,400
<i>Actually, ever since I started</i>
<i>reading up on black magic,</i>

497
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,800
<i>I knew right away that 90% of it</i>
<i>is just made up stories.</i>

498
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,480
But I still hope that one day
I could see something that is...

499
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,960
spectacular.

500
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Something like people walking on air,

501
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,160
cursed tools,
or spells that move mountains.

502
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,680
I think that last one is just impossible.

503
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,560
I guess.

504
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,440
But really,

505
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,240
at first, I even thought
Mr. Ajin was an Enigma.

506
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,040
But, well, I guess Enigma

507
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,480
is also just another made up story.

508
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,600
Don't you think?

509
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,000
Enigma?

510
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,720
Enigma. You never heard of that?

511
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,280
Not at all.

512
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,800
What is it?

513
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,120
Yiwa!

514
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,280
Yiwa!

515
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,520
As you can see,
there is a table and a graph.

516
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,720
In item one and two, this graph
explains the relation between...

517
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,280
What was that noise?

518
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,280
- What's that?
- What's going on there?

519
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Hey!

520
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Khaohom!

521
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
- Khaohom!
- What's happening?

522
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
What's going on?

523
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Students. What's wrong? Students?

524
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,600
Students! Why are you all vomiting?

525
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,440
Call the Principal.
Something is wrong with the students.

526
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,160
<i>Attention, please.</i>
<i>Today's classes will be suspended.</i>

527
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,680
<i>All students must</i>
<i>evacuate the building immediately.</i>

528
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,120
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Today's classes will be suspended.</i>

529
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,280
Crap. They can't do that.

530
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,880
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

531
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,800
Yiwa!

532
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,080
<i>All students must</i>
<i>evacuate the building immediately.</i>

533
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,720
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>
<i>Today's classes will be suspended.</i>

534
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,520
<i>All students must</i>
<i>evacuate the building immediately.</i>

535
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Yiwa.

536
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,840
Hang in there.

537
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Yiwa!

538
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,920
Yiwa!

539
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,200
Yiwa!

540
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,000
Yiwa!

541
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,240
Yiwa!

542
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
Hello.

543
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,640
Fa.

544
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,040
Where are you?

545
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,240
Are you safe?

546
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
<i>I'm fine.</i>

547
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,880
But I found someone suspicious
that could be our guy.

548
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,800
- I'm following her.
<i>- No.</i>

549
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,440
The situation has changed now.

550
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,240
This person
isn't an amateur like I thought.

551
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,920
<i>Do not follow her, you hear me?</i>

552
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,160
<i>Fa, don't you do something stupid.</i>

553
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,000
<i>Fa.</i>

554
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,320
Hey, what the hell do you want?

555
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,200
<i>Fa. Fa, can you hear me?</i>

556
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,360
Where are you? What's going on?

557
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,440
When... when I stepped into the room,

558
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,360
everything turned dark, like the night.

559
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,280
There's no one here.
What is going on, Mr. Ajin?

560
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,160
<i>What is this? Did I just teleport?</i>

561
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Fa.

562
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,240
Stay calm and pull yourself together.

563
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,200
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

564
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,800
You did not just teleport
or jump a multiverse or whatever.

565
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,880
<i>It's still daytime.</i>

566
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,000
<i>You're right where you are.</i>

567
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,960
<i>You're just...</i>

568
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,040
blinded by a spell.

569
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
What?

570
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,520
Listen.

571
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,320
There's one more thing.

572
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,280
What is it?

573
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,360
I believe you're not alone.

574
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,400
The bad guy is still
in that room with you,

575
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,560
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

576
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,920
<i>How long have you known it was Namsai?</i>

577
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,840
<i>This school never does</i>
<i>home visits for their students.</i>

578
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,480
Are you sure you're a teacher?

579
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,320
<i>Everything that happened that day</i>
<i>wasn't Namsai's doing.</i>
