1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,720
Fa, when did you realize it was Namsai?

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,520
If Namsai really is our bad guy,
it means I'm responsible for all this.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,040
<i>I didn't help her.</i>
<i>I'm the reason she became this.</i>

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,040
If we don't hurry up and do something,
she's definitely going to die soon.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,640
<i>Thought I could</i>
<i>waste a little more of your time.</i>

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,040
What have you done?

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>Why don't you take a guess?</i>

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,280
<i>All anyone cares about</i>
<i>is grades and results.</i>

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,600
They don't care about anything else.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,480
How do you want life to be instead?

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,320
How do I want it to be?

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Well,

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,560
I used to think
that if something fantastical happened,

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,200
or being swept off my feet
from this boring world, it would be nice.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,160
- Does that make me sound insane?
- Yeah, quite insane.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,720
You're thinking it, too! Shut up, you.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
I don't know.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,960
I don't think
I'd even dare to dream of such a thing.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,320
For me, hoping that this world
is kind to me sometimes

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
is probably more than enough.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,040
Fa.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,120
You think I don't know where you are?

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,160
Honestly, Namsai,
why are you doing all of this?

24
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,640
Are you stalling for time?

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,480
How adorable.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
You see it now, Namsai?

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Your entire body
has been consumed by the curse.

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
I really want to help you.

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,760
But if you go deeper into this,

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,320
the black magic you've been using
will reverse back and kill you.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
You think I don't know that?

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
You do know?

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,600
Then why? You want to get back
at people with better grades so bad

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,480
that you're willing to give up your life?

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,160
No. It's not a personal grudge.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,240
I only started with the top students

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,880
because I despise them.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,160
What I hold a grudge for...

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
is this world!

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
You wanna know...

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,200
You... you wanna know
why I'm doing all this?

42
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,840
It's because I want
to see this world go up in flames.

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,080
I want to see it all in ruins.
Just like the way my life is!

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,320
That's not true. You're not ruined.
It's not too late to turn back around.

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,760
You think it's possible to...

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,600
turn back now?

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,320
I have nothing left.

48
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
And since I have nothing left...

49
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,840
I no longer have anything to fear.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
Stop, Namsai.

51
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
What's wrong, Fa?

52
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
You've got no plan?

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Namsai.

54
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,680
Does it hurt? It does, doesn't it?

55
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Don't worry, Fa.
Soon enough, it won't hurt anymore.

56
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Run!

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,000
I told you to leave me alone!

58
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
Much stronger now, are you?

59
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,760
Yeah. Is this all you can do?

60
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,320
Namsai, listen to me carefully.

61
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,120
Fa and I came here
because we wanted to help you.

62
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,400
So let's find a way.

63
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,680
Find a what?

64
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,680
A way out?

65
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,400
When I'm like this?

66
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Don't give me that bullshit!

67
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,920
Die!

68
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,280
Enough!

69
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,400
Come here.

70
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,520
Fa, I told you to run.
Why did you come back?

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,840
To help you!

72
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
I can handle myself.

73
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,880
Hurry up and go to a safe place
like we agreed, all right?

74
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,720
Hey, this is no time to be giving orders.

75
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
- I really want to help you...
- Fa.

76
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm telling you this
because I'm really worried about you.

77
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
Please, Fa.

78
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,440
Just go to a safe place.

79
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll deal with Namsai.

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Promise me you'll be all right?

81
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,640
Muggles shouldn't
worry about wizards' fights.

82
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,440
AJIN NAKARITTA

83
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
Mr. Ajin!

84
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,240
Ajin!

85
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,920
Ajin! Are you all right?

86
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,360
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your friend.

87
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,680
Namsai, you know
your body is at its limit, don't you?

88
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,680
It's over. Stop resisting.

89
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
Otherwise you're going to die.

90
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,520
No! I won't accept it!

91
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,160
- Namsai.
- Let her go.

92
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,320
You know where she's heading.

93
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,080
<i>I don't know.</i>

94
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,880
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I'd even dare to dream of such a thing.</i>

95
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,640
<i>For me, hoping that this world</i>
<i>is kind to me sometimes</i>

96
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,160
<i>is probably more than enough.</i>

97
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
- What's wrong?
- What are you even saying?

98
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,280
Why can't you have a dream?

99
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,080
You have every right to dream.
You're freaking amazing.

100
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,240
<i>But if you're not too confident just yet,</i>
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

101
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
I promise.

102
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,160
No matter what happens,
I'll support you...

103
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,040
until your dream comes true.

104
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,400
You really thought we wouldn't figure out

105
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,560
that this is where
the center of the curses are?

106
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
I already asked Fa to exorcise it.

107
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,400
I'll say it again, Namsai. It's over.

108
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,360
You on your own
can't cast any more curses.

109
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,480
Why? Why me?

110
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,440
Why must this happen to me?

111
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,280
I just want to have a dream...

112
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,280
Can't I?

113
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Namsai.

114
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Is this even your dream?

115
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,880
The Namsai I knew wanted to be an artist.

116
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
Stop it!

117
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,040
Don't act like you know me.

118
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,240
You left everything behind.
You abandoned every promise.

119
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,520
You never really saw me at all.

120
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
That's not true!

121
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,560
I never forget about you.

122
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
I remember everything.

123
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,800
The first day I met you.

124
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,280
When you took me to that rooftop.

125
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Follow me.

126
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,560
When I nearly fell off the ladder.

127
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,440
And when you pointed out
the Elephant Tower to me.

128
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,400
Most importantly...

129
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,440
Mom, please. Mom, please, don't.

130
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,200
I never forget
the time I went to your house

131
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,880
and saw what your mother did to you.

132
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,760
You saw that?

133
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
I'm sorry.

134
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
But...

135
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,040
I was just so scared.

136
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,080
I was so scared
that I neglected my promise to you.

137
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,960
But the two of us,
we can still fix this together, Namsai.

138
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,360
Please?

139
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,040
Let's fight
alongside one more time, Namsai.

140
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Even when I'm like this?

141
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,760
You think I can still go back?

142
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
It's just like that time.

143
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,640
Honestly, Fa.

144
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,520
I don't even believe in myself.

145
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
What would you believe in?

146
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,600
I don't know.

147
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,680
It's just that...

148
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,760
When I look into your eyes...

149
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,320
When I look into your eyes...

150
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,440
...I just feel it.

151
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,120
...I just feel it.

152
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,880
I know you'll be able to do anything.

153
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
So, will you?

154
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,920
Deep down, you still believe
that you can do it too, don't you?

155
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,520
Just nod if you think so.

156
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,480
I still have a chance, don't I?

157
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,480
Of course.
Mr. Ajin and I are here to help you.

158
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Isn't that right, Mr. Ajin...

159
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
Who the hell are you?

160
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
What are you looking at?

161
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,320
Mr. Ajin!

162
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,320
Mr. Ajin.

163
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,640
Are you all right?

164
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,040
Fa!

165
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
No, stop!

166
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,800
Namsai, no!

167
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,280
No. Please.

168
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,640
- Namsai!
- Don't.

169
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Fa, help!

170
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,320
Fa, help me!

171
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,320
- Namsai!
- No!

172
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,520
Crap. Hold on to this.

173
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,840
- Mr. Ajin!
- Don't come closer.

174
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
Everything's out of hand now!

175
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,040
What can I do? Is there nothing I can do?

176
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,720
There is. There's one thing.

177
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,160
Take care of the rest.

178
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Mr. Ajin?

179
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,680
Mr. Ajin.

180
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,280
Mr. Ajin! It's not supposed
to be like this. Listen to me. Listen...

181
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,360
<i>Hello. Fa?</i>

182
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,160
Yiwa, I need your help
with something important.

183
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Is something wrong?
You sound like you're in a rush.

184
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,720
I don't have time to explain.

185
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm doing something
that has to do with black magic.

186
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,680
But I'm lacking some details.

187
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,320
- What do you need me to find?
- I'm... I'm looking for...

188
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,200
I don't have time. I'll text you.

189
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,560
<i>What? Fa? Hello?</i>

190
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,320
<i>Hello? Fa?</i>

191
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,960
WILL THIS HELP?

192
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Mr. Ajin.

193
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,360
Please.

194
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,720
Come to your senses.

195
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,720
You said you wanted to take Enigma down.

196
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
So don't give up so easily!

197
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Hey, do you even hear me?

198
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
Hey!

199
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,000
Mr. Ajin! Stop!

200
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,600
You know something?

201
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,280
For all your talk
about not being a teacher,

202
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,160
it turns out, I've learned
something from you anyway.

203
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,000
It's probably more than anything
I'd learned my entire life.

204
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,560
My world really has turned upside down.

205
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,400
It scares me sometimes.

206
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,800
But it just
makes my heart pound like crazy.

207
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,600
You know what's the most important thing
you've taught me?

208
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,600
It's the feeling that...

209
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,400
no matter what happens...

210
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
I can't give up!

211
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Thank you for teaching me everything.

214
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Let's get going.

215
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,560
What's wrong?

216
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm just...

217
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,840
not sure I can do this.

218
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,360
I'm... I'm just a normal person.

219
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm no exorcist. I'm no sorcerer.

220
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm nothing.

221
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,160
Fa, it has nothing to do with any of that.

222
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,640
The most important thing here

223
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,800
is that at the deepest part
of your consciousness,

224
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,480
you have to believe it.

225
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,520
If you believe it enough...

226
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,240
it will become true.

227
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,760
Please make it.

228
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,040
Get through it.

229
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,720
Get through it. Please!

230
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Fa?

231
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Fa.

232
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Namsai.

233
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,320
You haven't made good on your promise.

234
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,320
Don't leave me again.

235
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
I'll give you 100 points for that.

236
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,080
<i>After what happened that day,</i>
<i>time goes by slowly.</i>

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,640
<i>- ...everything's back to normal.</i>
<i>- ...is...</i>

239
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,800
<i>Miss Wanruthai from Grade 12 Class 1.</i>

240
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,040
<i>Our school keeps being strict</i>
<i>with their curriculum.</i>

241
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,400
<i>- But even when it seems normal...</i>
<i>- Congratulations to Miss Karatrat...</i>

242
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:39,000
<i>...we simply can't deny the fact that</i>
<i>that incident has certainly left its mark.</i>

243
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,840
Doesn't it look a little psycho?

244
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh, shush.

245
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,680
It looks amazing!

246
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,720
<i>But no matter</i>
<i>how big the wound left by your past is,</i>

247
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,600

248
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
You ready?

249
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,560
<i>As you can see,</i>

250
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Namsai's grades are more than enough
to get her a scholarship.

251
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,880
Digital art is still growing.

252
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,520
I can guarantee you
that if Namsai gets to study art,

253
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,520
it will be very good for her future.

254
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,520
You know deep down...

255
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,760
that Namsai never
wants to go to medical school.

256
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,720
Please.

257
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,320
You really are just like your teacher.

258
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,040
Please.

259
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,760
Whatever you want to do,

260
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,480
go for it.

261
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
Just make sure you give it your all.

262
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,920
You did it!

263
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,560
<i>- Everything slowly changes for the better.</i>
- Thank you, Mom.

264
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,280
<i>The clock has started ticking again.</i>

265
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,240
<i>That also means</i>
<i>the future is surely approaching.</i>

266
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,320
This hand-out is to help you
get familiar with university admissions.

267
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Please write down
your future career plan...

268
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,960
Hey. Why aren't you writing?

269
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,200
I just realized

270
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,520
that I never thought about
what I want to be once I graduate.

271
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,520
Not at all?

272
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,400
But you're amazing anyway
so just write whatever.

273
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
How could I just do that?

274
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,200
- Just...
- One more thing.

275
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,440
I have some news for you.

276
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,240
It's about Mr. Ajin.

277
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,120
BYE - THANK YOU
GOOD LUCK, MR. AJIN

278
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,520
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS GROUP?

279
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
LEAVE

280
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,520
Hey!

281
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,800
Surprise!

282
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,440
How did you get in here?
Did you make a spare key to my place?

283
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,280
'Course I did.
You didn't tell me about quitting, either.

284
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,080
- We're even. All right?
- Even, my ass. What is all this?

285
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,880
Your farewell party.

286
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Nonsense. Go. Go home already.

287
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,880
What? No way.

288
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,160
What kind of adult
doesn't say goodbye properly?

289
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,160
- We've been through so much together.
- Fine.

290
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,400
Okay. Chatty, as always.

291
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
You really want
to throw me a farewell party?

292
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,760
How about this?

293
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,360
I'll let you stay,
but only until midnight. All right?

294
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,920
All right! Let's go.

295
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,120
Come on.

296
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,040
- Sing.
- Nope.

297
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,560
Sing! Get up and sing right now. Dance.

298
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,720
One, two, three.

299
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,320
One, two, three. Catch!

300
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,520
That's cheating.

301
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,960
What's wrong now?

302
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,880
I don't know.

303
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,480
Maybe I'm drunk?

304
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,080
Drunk on what?

305
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,720
The soda you've been knocking back?

306
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,280
Know-it-all.

307
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,840
What about you? Are you drunk?

308
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
How could I be?

309
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,880
Today was your last day at school.

310
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,440
Which means...

311
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,280
you're no longer a teacher.

312
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,960
You know
I was never a teacher in the first place.

313
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,400
Why did you bring it up?

314
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,360
So...

315
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,520
What do you want to do after this?

316
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,560
I'll probably go back
to hunting Enigma down.

317
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Let's talk about you.

318
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,880
Now do you know what you want to be?

319
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,000
That's the problem.

320
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,520
How so?

321
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,000
Well...

322
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,880
I actually wrote it down.

323
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,560
But I didn't mean anything by it.

324
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,240
I've made up my mind...

325
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
about...

326
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,920
about what I actually
want to do after this.

327
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,920
It's almost midnight.
You'd better go. I'll clean up.

328
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,200
Hey, don't change the subject.
You know what I'm hinting at.

329
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,040
Exactly why I don't wanna talk about it.

330
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,240
Why not? Is it so bad?

331
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,080
You're rushing into this.

332
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,120
I am not rushing into this.

333
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,840
I really don't want to go on studying.

334
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,040
I want to follow you everywhere.
I really want to do what you do.

335
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,600
You know I've always dreamt
of doing something like this.

336
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,480
This is the future I want.

337
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,640
No.

338
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,520
This isn't the future you want. I know.

339
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,480
How could you know?

340
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,280
- I just know.
- That's not true.

341
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,080
Do you even know what I'm like?
I want to be rich, you know.

342
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,960
You said your profession
pays well, didn't you?

343
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,840
And it's full of thrilling challenges.

344
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,160
It's perfect for me.

345
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,360
Do you understand?

346
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,920
I like challenges.
I just want to do risky things.

347
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,400
- Fa.
- I want to stay with you forever...

348
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Enough, Fa.

349
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,720
Time's up.

350
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
I had fun too.

351
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,080
Good luck, Fa.

352
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,280
Ajin.

353
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,480
I love you...

00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,880
<i>Once you're older,</i>

358
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,880
<i>you start feeling</i>
<i>like you see tiny cracks all over it...</i>

359
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,280
<i>Cracks no adults have ever told you about.</i>

360
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,160
<i>It's strange that no one</i>
<i>has ever noticed them before.</i>

361
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,240
<i>Sometimes, it even gets me wondering</i>

362
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,960
<i>if the cracks ever really existed.</i>

363
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,040
Anyone know
about this organization named Enigma?

364
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,320
DOES ENIGMA EVEN EXIST?

365
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,240
ENIGMA ORGANIZATION
NOT FOUND

366
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
There's nothing.

367
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Look.

368
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,880
What exactly is Enigma?

369
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,680
I never actually learned who they were.

370
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,240
They just happened to contact me.

371
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,320
I never met anyone
from their organization or whatever.

372
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,200
But seeing
that all their information is wiped clean,

373
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,240
maybe they just don't want
junior detectives like you to find them.

374
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,480
Very funny.

375
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,400
But being like this...

376
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,840
<i>Everything about Enigma and Mr. Ajin,</i>

377
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,840
seems like something
that's never happened, don't you think?

378
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,440
What are you looking at?

379
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,440
Look at this.

380
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,840
<i>Next up is the currently hot topic</i>
<i>of top model, Anya.</i>

381
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,280
<i>There's been</i>
<i>a recent spotting of her out and about</i>

382
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,960
<i>with a non-celebrity socialite</i>
<i>whose first name starts with A.</i>

383
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,920
<i>Needless to say the star</i>
<i>is on the rise in love and in game.</i>

384
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,280
Hold on. Isn't that...

385
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Yeah.

386
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,240
You said everything
that we've been through...

387
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,160
seems like it's never happened, right?

388
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,440
Yeah.

389
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,400
Both Mr. Ajin and Enigma...

390
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,440
are no longer here in front of our eyes,

391
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,560
but they are both real.

392
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,000
As long as we believe it?

393
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,480
As long as we believe it...

394
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,680
it will become true.

395
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,280
All right.

396
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,920
I'll let you see me off here, like usual.

397
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,800
As adamant as always, I see.

398
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,040
I can't help it.

399
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,200
I gotta be more careful,

400
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,800
now that someone leaked our photos.

401
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,360
Leaks?

402
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,240
Isn't that nice?

403
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,160
We don't need
to keep this a secret anymore.

404
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,200
Don't you want us
to have a deeper connection?

405
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, then.

406
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm not teasing you anymore.
You should take a rest.

407
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,840
And I'll pick you up here tomorrow,
like usual.

408
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,480
Good night.

409
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,760
Good night.

410
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,040
You sure we should leave him be?

411
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,280
He's just an arm's reach away from us.

412
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,280
It's all right.

413
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,240
You can't force this kind of thing anyway.

414
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,840
As long as humans have desires...

415
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,920
as long as the world
hides its unexposed secrets...

416
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,760
and as long as
he keeps looking for Enigma,

417
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,360
there's nothing to worry about.

418
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,680
Eventually, one day...

419
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,560
the two of us...

420
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,160
will run into each other.
