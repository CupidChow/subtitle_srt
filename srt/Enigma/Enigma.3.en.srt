<i>Fa.</i>

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,000
<i>The situation has changed now.</i>

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,880
<i>This person</i>
<i>isn't an amateur like I thought.</i>

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,560
<i>Do not follow her, you hear me?</i>

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
What the hell do you want?

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,680
Stay calm and pull yourself together.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,640
The bad guy is still
in that room with you, I'm sure of it.

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
THIS WORLD IS FREAKING FAKE

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,360
BE HOME LATE. BUY YOURSELF A DINNER

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
WHEN WILL THIS HELL END?

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
THE WORLD HATES ME, WHY LIVE?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
ALL RUINED.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
I JUST WANT TO DIE.

14
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,400
<i>Fa.</i>

15
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,120
<i>Stay calm and do as I say.</i>

16
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,760
Really?

17
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Hey, Fa? Can you hear me?

18
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,200
<i>If you can, say something.</i>

19
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,400
Hello?

20
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Do you realize what you're doing?

21
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,520
Do you know
how dangerous and horrendous it is?

22
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you? Huh?

23
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,680
- What are you doing?
- That's not me.

24
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,840
Just give up before things get worse.

25
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Do you hear me?

26
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
Wait, no! Slow down!

27
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,600
What are you doing?
She's right in front of me.

28
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,440
If I don't follow her,
why did I even bother with all this?

29
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,040
But it could be a trap.

30
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
- And...
- And?

31
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't be ridiculous. I can handle myself.

32
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,720
Hey, wait. It's really dangerous.
Don't go. Please...

33
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,600
The only person who decides
what is or isn't dangerous is me. Not you.

34
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,760
Go back
and wait at my place. I'll be there.

35
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
MO MO
School says it's food poisoning. WTF.

36
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,120
PEARR - You think it has something
to do with what happened to Wan and Matt?

37
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,280
FERN - This is too weird.
Never seen food poisoning like this.

38
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,720
MINT - Doesn't this school get scarier?
My mom will make me move.

39
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,760
Still alive. Don't worry.

40
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,520
I told you I don't need
my wounds taken care of.

41
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm fine.

42
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,640
You don't get to say that
when you're covered in holes.

43
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,040
And you refused to go to the hospital.
Do you want to bleed out?

44
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
Is this... a golem?

45
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Well done.

46
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
You know stuff now.

47
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
How many points did I get?

48
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
As an occult student?

49
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,080
I'd say 70 from 100.

50
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
Occult student, my foot.

51
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,080
You know, when I peer into your world,

52
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,040
it's just full of things
I don't understand.

53
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,120
It's like...

54
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
If we're going
by a Harry Potter reference,

55
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm probably a muggle who never knows
what's going on in the wizarding world.

56
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,200
I expected no less of an analogy
from a bookworm like you, honestly.

57
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,640
But that's how I feel.

58
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,880
There. All done. You okay with that?

59
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,720
Yeah, I think so.

60
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Well...

61
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,360
How did it go with our bad guy?

62
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
She...

63
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
got away.

64
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,560
You look like you're worrying about her.

65
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
Oh, not at all.

66
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,800
I just feel bad you didn't get her.

67
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,520
That's all.

68
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Fa.

69
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,080
When did you realize it was Namsai?

70
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,640
You tried to stop me from pursuing her

71
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,960
because you knew
that it was your friend, didn't you?

72
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,600
You were trying to protect her.

73
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,680
If you don't want to say it, just nod.

74
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,760
Is it Namsai?

75
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,560
Namsai.

76
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,360
I don't know how to comfort people.

77
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Hungry?

78
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,400
I may not know how to comfort you,
but I can take you out to dinner.

79
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,920
How can we go? You're injured.

80
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
Injured? What are you talking about?

81
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,840
Who? Who's injured?

82
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,320
Told you you didn't need to patch me up.

83
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,160
You just wouldn't listen.

84
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
The ramen looks so good.

85
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
<i>Give me a smile.</i>

86
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,640
<i>I am smiling.</i>

87
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Whoa, aren't you pretty? So pretty.

88
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Stop it.

89
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Exorcise me.

90
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Alright, then.

91
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,280
There!

92
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
The first pattern.

93
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,840
Nice.

94
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,280
Can I have one chocolate crepe?

95
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
Oh, what's his name?

96
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
Is he cute?

97
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,560
Look, he's so cute. Come on.

98
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
- What's wrong?
- I'm leaving.

99
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
- Hey, wait.
- I am leaving.

100
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Wait for me.

101
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
Hello.

102
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,000
I heard someone around here
is scared of a little dog.

103
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,560
You know who that is, Mr. Ajin?

104
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
- Do you?
- Drop it already.

105
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,120
You're fearless with everything else,
but you're scared of dogs?

106
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,520
Hey.

107
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
What are you taking a video for?

108
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,240
<i>What are you taking a video for?</i>
<i>Give me the camera.</i>

109
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,520
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Come here.</i>

110
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,680
<i>But it's embarrassing.</i>

111
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,880
<i>Why? Alright. I'll just cover your face.</i>

112
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,360
<i>Fine. You'd better catch my good angle.</i>

113
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,560
<i>You're gorgeous, don't worry.</i>

114
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
What's wrong?

115
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,080
I'm just... reminiscing about something.

116
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,240
You know,
when I had something weighing on my mind,

117
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,240
I loved going up to the rooftop
to clear my head.

118
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,160
Maybe it was because it felt so calming
that it stopped me from worrying.

119
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
After that,

120
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,960
no matter where I went, I couldn't help
but look up to the rooftop.

121
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,160
I'd wonder to myself...

122
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,080
if the wind would be strong out there,

123
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,280
or how the view
from that place was going to be like.

124
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Like the Elephant Tower over there.

125
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,960
I used to imagine that the panorama
from up there would be amazing.

126
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,560
It must be
like riding a gigantic elephant.

127
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,040
I sound silly, don't I?

128
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,480
Well...

129
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,400
Do you want to go there?

130
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,240
<i>Actually...</i>

131
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,920
<i>I've never done this for anyone,</i>

132
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,760
<i>especially not for</i>
<i>ordinary people like you.</i>

133
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,760
<i>Really?</i>

134
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,360
<i>Yeah.</i>

135
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,120
<i>Are you scared?</i>

136
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
<i>I trust you.</i>

137
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,200
Close your eyes.

138
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,080
Holy crap!

139
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Careful. Hold your focus.

140
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,880
<i>You're going to fall away.</i>

141
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,480
What do you think?

142
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,160
This is amazing!

143
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Honestly,

144
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,920
what you can do is so freaking cool.

145
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,840
I envy you.
I wish I could do something like that.

146
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Fa.

147
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
It's not something to be envious of.

148
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,000
You know what I mean, don't you?

149
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,920
I know.

150
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Thank you for
showing me something so special.

151
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
Can I ask you something?

152
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,400
If you were well-versed in the occult,

153
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,400
what would you use it for?

154
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,680
I would...

155
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,600
astral travel and sit on
a rooftop like this every day.

156
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,720
I'd sit on every rooftop in Bangkok.

157
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,120
That's it?

158
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,040
You know...

159
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,040
The first person
who brought me to a rooftop...

160
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,960
was actually Namsai.

161
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,760
SAI

162
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
You drawing?

163
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,960
No. I'm not doing anything.

164
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,080
Hold on. What's wrong?

165
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Are you embarrassed?

166
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,040
When your drawing is that good?

167
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
You like it?

168
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,280
Very much.

169
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,920
Look at the detail in the eyes.

170
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,760
It's beautiful.

171
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,000
It has the same vibe as,
not sure if you know this artist,

172
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,480
but her name is...

173
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Linda Vachon.

174
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,600
Yeah, I know her. I love her art.

175
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,800
You do? Which one is your favorite?

176
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,920
Have you ever seen that one where...

177
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,640
<i>That's how I got to know Namsai.</i>

178
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
<i>We grew closer and closer after that.</i>

179
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,680
<i>But it looked like a lot</i>
<i>was expected of her about her grades.</i>

180
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
<i>She has no friends. She has no hobbies.</i>

181
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,760
<i>She's like me, I guess.</i>
<i>That's why we became friends so fast.</i>

182
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,640
<i>We studied hard,</i>

183
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,080
<i>but we also did a lot of things</i>
<i>we never got to try.</i>

184
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,960
<i>We saw a lot of things</i>
<i>we never got to see.</i>

185
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,360
<i>Those were the times</i>
<i>when we were both very happy.</i>

186
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,480
<i>And those times...</i>

187
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,000
YOU GOT YOUR REPORT CARD TODAY?

188
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,680
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE
YOUR FRIEND FA OVER FOR DINNER?

189
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,320
<i>...slowly caused problems for Namsai.</i>

190
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,520
I saw your report, Sai.

191
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,240
81 points for Physics. 83 points for Math.

192
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,800
Much lower than last time.

193
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,480
So I signed you up with some more tutors.

194
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
Yes, Mom.

195
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,840
Come to think of it.

196
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,480
You've been here several times
to study with Sai, Fa.

197
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm surprised her grades got worse
when you studied harder.

198
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm sorry.

199
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,040
Maybe I got Namsai
distracted from her study.

200
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,440
That's not it.

201
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,800
They changed some curriculum
at school, so it's just harder now.

202
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,960
Fa and I have been
helping each other study.

203
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,200
We always do that at school too.

204
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
But classes are just really difficult.

205
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Is that so?

206
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
But from what I see...

207
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,000
That's not exactly what happened.

208
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,800
<i>Just come on. Follow me.</i>

209
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,680
<i>Be careful. You got it now?</i>
<i>I'm zooming on your face.</i>

210
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,280
<i>Let's go to our secret hiding place.</i>

211
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,400
<i>Stop it, you.</i>

212
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,720
Since we're already on the topic,

213
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,600
what about your grades, Fa?

214
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,080
How are they?

215
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
My grades are...

216
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,440
Fa doesn't remember them, Mom.

217
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,920
Too many subjects.

218
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,960
- Right?
- Show me your report card.

219
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,760
Oh... Fa doesn't have it with...

220
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,200
Quiet.

221
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,400
Didn't you just
get your report cards today?

222
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,000
It has to be in her bag.

223
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,960
You're not a liar,

224
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,040
are you, Fa?

225
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Oh, wow.

226
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,040
You're smart, Fa.

227
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,440
You did much better than Namsai...

228
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,360
in every subject.

229
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,080
I remember that it was so uncomfortable.

230
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
I had to ask to leave soon after.

231
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,200
<i>On my way back home,</i>

232
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,760
<i>I realized that I left something behind.</i>

233
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,760
Sir.

234
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,880
Can you circle back for a bit, please?

235
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,840
If you do it again,
this is what you'll get!

236
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,040
Do you realize
how badly you've embarrassed me?

237
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,200
Did you have to bring
a smarter friend over to gloat at me?

238
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
Your grades got worse

239
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,160
because you've been
drawing these stupid things.

240
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,600
Mom, please.

241
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,880
You problem child.

242
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,280
Mom. Mom. Please, don't.

243
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Mom, I'm sorry.

244
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,440
- Remember this.
- I won't do it again.

245
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,240
If you embarrass me again,
this is what you get.

246
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
Mom! Mom! I'm sorry!

247
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Oh, you're in pain?

248
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,160
That's how you learn!

249
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
Keep this in mind!

250
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,200
After I saw that,

251
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,840
I was just too stunned.

252
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,200
I never went back to her house again.

253
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,400
I didn't even dare approach her at school.

254
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,640
I slowly faded away from her life.

255
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,440
Next thing I knew,
we hadn't talked for years.

256
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,920
Until...

257
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,360
<i>that incident at school.</i>

258
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,760
<i>I always suspected something,</i>
<i>especially that day</i>

259
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,920
<i>when I saw Namsai with that dummy.</i>

260
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,560
<i>It was dark in that room,</i>
<i>but I saw blood under her fingernails.</i>

261
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,160
<i>Someone as smart as Namsai</i>
<i>might have already worked out</i>

262
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,000
<i>that you and I</i>
<i>have been probing into this.</i>

263
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
<i>Everything in the Music Room that day</i>

264
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,040
<i>must have been her doing</i>
<i>to misdirect us away from her.</i>

265
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,920
<i>But you know,</i>

266
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,920
<i>even after seeing</i>
<i>the proof right in front of my eyes,</i>

267
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I just kept lying to myself
that there was nothing.

268
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
<i>I kept lying to myself</i>

269
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>that everything that happened</i>
<i>that day wasn't Namsai's doing.</i>

270
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,360
I don't know.

271
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,280
I guess I knew deep down that...

272
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,760
If Namsai really is our bad guy,

273
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
it means that
I'm responsible for all of this.

274
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,080
<i>I ran from her.</i>

275
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,000
<i>I didn't help her.</i>

276
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,320
<i>I'm the reason she became this.</i>

277
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,680
I just didn't want to accept the fact
that my selfishness that day

278
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,160
was the reason Namsai lost her mind.

279
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
I've made her twisted.

280
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,160
I've turned her into someone
I don't even know anymore.

281
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
<i>Look. It's beautiful.</i>

282
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,200
<i>- No recording</i>
<i>- Turn around.</i>

283
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
<i>Enough.</i>

284
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,520
<i>Stop it, you.</i>

285
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
<i>- ...two, three.</i>
<i>- ...two, three.</i>

286
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,440
<i>- Sai!</i>
<i>- Fa!</i>

287
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,520
It was me.

288
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,000
I created our villain.

289
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,840
I'm sorry.

290
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

291
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm really sorry.

292
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,600
Well,

293
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,440
now that you know everything,
what do you want to do next?

294
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,360
Can you...

295
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,880
Can you promise me
that you'll save her from all of this?

296
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,960
I want the old Namsai back.

297
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,760
Even if you didn't ask me that,
I'd do it anyway.

298
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,080
<i>It's evidently clear</i>
<i>that she's also a victim.</i>

299
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,040
YOU HAVE NEW MESSAGE!!

300
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,440
<i>Those people's victim.</i>

301
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
<i>If we don't hurry up and do something...</i>

302
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,840
she's definitely going to die soon.

303
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,360
What do you mean?

304
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,640
Since you're willing
to tell me your story...

305
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
I'll tell you about mine.

306
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
SAVED BY A MIRACLE! MAN SURVIVES CAR CRASH
BECAUSE OF PROTECTIVE SPELL

307
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,600
<i>I told you before</i>
<i>that most occult stuff you see,</i>

308
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,520
<i>especially on the Internet,</i>
<i>are most likely fake.</i>

309
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,680
<i>But much deeper into it all,</i>

310
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
the occult exists.

311
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,880
It diverges into two main disciplines.

312
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
First,

313
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,840
the White Arts,

314
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,920
also called the <i>Dharma-khun.</i>

315
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,960
<i>Practitioners in this discipline</i>
<i>focus on Vipassana meditation.</i>

316
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,960
<i>Any magic resulting from this practice</i>

317
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,040
is mostly used for good, to help people.

318
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,280
The other discipline

319
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,200
is the Black Arts.

320
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,800
<i>This focuses on black magic and spirits.</i>

321
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,280
<i>These practitioners use their knowledge</i>
<i>in a negative way,</i>

322
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,800
<i>abuse it for bad things,</i>
<i>for their own gains, or to hurt people.</i>

323
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,600
Both arts exist, but that doesn't mean
any lay person can easily learn them.

324
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,640
Its conditions are far too complex
and too difficult to meet.

325
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,720
Normally these people keep to themselves.
They don't flaunt around who they are.

326
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,320
But there is one group

327
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,920
who believes the occult
should be tangible and verifiable.

328
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
CHANGE YOUR FATE!
POPULARITY SPELL - GURU PANYA

329
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,480
<i>That makes them understand</i>
<i>the occult more than anyone.</i>

330
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,880
<i>They hide in the deepest part of society.</i>

331
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,800
These people are called...

332
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,320
Enigma.

333
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,800
<i>Nobody knows who Enigma is.</i>

334
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,840
But we know they're
more adept in the occult than anyone.

335
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,320
<i>Better than anyone in the world.</i>

336
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,760
Enigma is looking for people in despair
to do business with them.

337
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,560
They probably reached out to Namsai

338
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,520
<i>and all she has to do is</i>
<i>move according to their orders.</i>

339
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
What about you?

340
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,880
Sorry. I can't say much right now.

341
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,520
What I can tell you is
that I am hunting down Enigma.

342
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,360
<i>I've always been hunting them down.</i>

343
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,480
<i>I got intel</i>
<i>that they might be in this school.</i>

344
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,560
<i>That's why I came here undercover,</i>
<i>as you know.</i>

345
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,520
Then again, I thought I might have
misunderstood this whole mess.

346
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
But as it turned out,

347
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Enigma really is borrowing Namsai's hands.

348
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
I don't get it.

349
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,720
Why would Enigma do all this?

350
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,520
What do they get
from making Namsai do all this?

351
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,080
Firstly, it's probably for money.

352
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,440
<i>Businesses that claim to change</i>
<i>people's luck always prosper.</i>

353
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,120
The next thing they want
is probably to see the world burn.

354
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,520
Because the more messy the world is,

355
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,160
the more people
turn to their superstitions.

356
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,880
But no one knows for sure
what their end goal is.

357
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,360
What I know is
that they're abusing their victims.

358
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,600
These dangerous things
come at a cost for the user.

359
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,360
From what I estimated of Namsai,

360
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
if we don't do anything now,

361
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,600
within two days,

362
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
she will definitely die.

363
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,280
Can we really save Namsai?
Do you have a plan?

364
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,400
What do you need me to do?
I'll do anything.

365
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,000
- Please.
- I heard you already.

366
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
But before you worry about your friend,

367
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,680
you should worry about yourself first.

368
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
What?

369
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Your time is running out.

370
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,880
Don't worry.

371
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,480
I'll save Namsai.

372
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,040
I won't ever let anyone else die.

373
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,520
You ready?

374
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,640
Good. Let's get going.

375
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,800
<i>Like I said.</i>

376
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>Namsai has no more than two days left.</i>

377
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,680
<i>That means today is our last chance.</i>

378
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,080
I must apologize for not being
able to welcome you properly.

379
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,840
I didn't know there was
going to be a home visit from school.

380
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,480
It's absolutely all right.
You didn't need to.

381
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,400
I just need to talk to Namsai for a bit.

382
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,360
Is she upstairs?

383
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,080
Yes. She's been keeping to herself
studying hard every day lately.

384
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,960
I'll call for her.

385
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,480
Sai, your teacher
is here to see you, dear.

386
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I'm busy.

387
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,440
I'm still studying.

388
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,960
Is something the matter?

389
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,120
Not at all.

390
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm fine.

391
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,480
I often have a headache myself
when my blood pressure spikes up.

392
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,080
Oh, I haven't taken my medicine today.
Please excuse me.

393
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
How long...

394
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,040
have you been taking this medicine?

395
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,680
Don't worry about me.

396
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,040
I work in the industry
so I know how to take good care of myself.

397
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,720
Honestly, I'm more worried about you.

398
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Me?

399
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,280
Sai is usually an exemplary student.

400
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,760
There's never been
a home visit from a teacher before.

401
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,680
Unless she's started
having issues at school.

402
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,160
Is she being bullied?

403
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,760
It's not like that. I just have
something to talk to her about.

404
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,200
If someone is hurting her,
you have to tell me.

405
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,360
No one is.

406
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,120
She's at that age where she keeps
something to herself, but we...

407
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
Nobody is hurting Namsai, ma'am.

408
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,920
It's Namsai who's been...

409
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Been what?

410
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,440
Are you accusing my daughter
of causing trouble at school?

411
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,040
She's a good kid.
I know because I raised her.

412
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,400
Please stay calm, ma'am.
What I'm trying to tell you is that...

413
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,320
Excuse me, but I must talk to her.

414
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,840
Wait. We're not done talking.

415
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,920
A teacher with tattoos?

416
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,000
Now that I think about it,

417
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,520
the school never informed me
there was going to be a home visit.

418
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,480
Are you even a real teacher?

419
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
I really am a teacher.

420
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,920
But I have no time
to explain it to you anymore.

421
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,800
I need to talk to Namsai right now.

422
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,200
I don't believe you. Who are you?

423
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,800
Are you trying to lure my daughter away?

424
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,600
Please listen to me.

425
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,520
Namsai is in trouble.

426
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,720
You have no right.

427
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,760
Namsai is mine.

428
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,360
She's as pure as a snow white cloth.

429
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,480
You have no right to stain her.

430
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,280
Get out!

431
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,440
What did you do?

432
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,280
Now, I'm not surprised
why Namsai turned to that.

433
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,200
It's because you've been fooling yourself,

434
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,360
fooling Namsai, you've been lying to her.

435
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,480
What are you saying?
What could I have been lying to her about?

436
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,800
- About everything.
- That's not true.

437
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,160
I've never lied to her.

438
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Really?

439
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,400
When you can't even be honest
about what drug you've been taking?

440
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,680
You think I don't know
that it's not for your blood pressure?

441
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,960
That's not true. It's not. It's not.

442
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,800
You just won't accept the truth.

443
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,200
That's not true. It's not true.

444
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,160
You keep lying to yourself that it's fine.

445
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,760
- It's not true.
- That's all.

446
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,920
It's not true. It's not true.
I'm calling the police.

447
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,920
Do you even realize
how much Namsai loves you?

448
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,120
Why the hell are you meddling?

449
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
Namsai.

450
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,960
I need to talk to you.

451
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm here to help.
I'm not here to hurt you.

452
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,280
I don't want to talk. Leave me alone.

453
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,560
The black magic you've been using
is about to reverse back on you.

454
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,040
You're being used.

455
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,200
Your body is at its limit,
do you know that?

456
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,600
Namsai, do you hear me?

457
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm being used? By who?

458
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,440
I don't have time to explain.

459
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,360
- Let me come in.
- No.

460
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,520
First tell me who is using me
and why they would do that.

461
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,560
- Am I really going to die?
- Stay calm, Namsai.

462
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,280
There's still a way to save you.

463
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,960
But what you need to do right now
is pull yourself together and...

464
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,600
And what?

465
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,320
Mr. Ajin? Why did you go quiet?

466
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,680
Mr. Ajin?

467
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,920
<i>That was quick. Thought I could waste</i>
<i>a little more of your time.</i>

468
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,560
What have you done? Where are you?

469
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,080
<i>Why don't you take a guess, Mr. Ajin?</i>

470
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Fa.

471
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,080
Coming to school
all by yourself on a weekend...

472
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,800
is dangerous, don't you know that?

473
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,960
I've been worried sick about you.

474
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,520
Namsai, stop.

475
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,720
Hurry up and go somewhere safe.

476
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,320
<i>I'm telling you this,</i>

477
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,600
because I'm really worried about you.

478
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,360
Who the hell are you?
