1
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,741
How long have they locked up this room?

2
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,821
Very long. It's deserted and creepy.

3
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,824
Is there anything worth taking?

4
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:16,974
The professor said

5
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,120
we can take anything we want to use.

6
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:30,335
What is it?

7
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,743
Class 37?

8
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,096
They wouldn't mind if we take it?

9
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,175
They won't. Just take it.

10
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,756
LAST CHEER

11
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,029
That's nice, Shin.

12
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:29,744
Cool.

13
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,983
Take photos for me.

14
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,385
- Stop nagging me.
- But it's nice here.

15
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,409
Later.

16
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:36,927
Tai!

17
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:39,192
Who's that?

18
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,579
Here's the application
to the cheerleading team.

19
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,079
Fill it out and give it to the seniors.

20
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:46,104
Yes.

21
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
Give me a pen.

22
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,407
Again?

23
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,397
Thanks... Fay and...

24
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:58,203
I'm Shin. But call me Shinny, it's cuter.

25
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,810
Shinny, I'm Tai.

26
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:02,336
Are you keen to join?

27
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:06,047
I've never been a cheerleader before.

28
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,400
I'll need your advice.

29
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:12,672
Easy-peasy.
You just wave your hands back and forth

30
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:15,840
and use your good looks
to command attention.

31
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,603
Have you joined the class's chat group?

32
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,015
I'll invite you.

33
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:21,472
Sure.

34
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:25,271
Who's that?

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,382
That's Maysa, my friend.

36
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:30,567
Oh, right.

37
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,383
Call her here.

38
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:43,080
The book you want to borrow me.

39
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:45,632
Hold it for me, now come.

40
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,344
This is Maysa, my friend from high school.

41
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,360
This is Fay and Shin.

42
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,055
Hi, I'm Shin, I mean I'm Fay!

43
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,960
And I'm Shin.

44
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,640
I like your wavy hair.

45
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:09,560
Yeah, it's so nice, like... wavy.

46
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,480
Shin, you want me to take your photos?

47
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:22,071
- Yeah, over there.
- Let's go. Don't be too picky.

48
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,375
Sorry, just a sec.

49
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,164
The view is nice there.

50
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,336
Yes, it's nice.

51
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,480
I thought we'd come up here to read.

52
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,207
We can read later.

53
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:40,806
Is this still our secret place?

54
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,080
Sure is,

55
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,914
but we can share it with others sometimes.

56
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:48,527
Tai!

57
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,458
It's so nice up here,

58
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,881
we should get more people
to hang out here later.

59
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:53,890
All right!

60
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:55,182
Thanks

61
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,420
Cool! You got 10K "Likes"!

62
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:00,601
Are you okay with that?

63
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,648
No problem.

64
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,153
The rituals are about to start.

65
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,996
Tai, the seniors want
us in the common room,

66
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,608
let's go.

67
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,217
Go now or they'll bark at us.

68
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,409
We have to practice the song.

69
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:16,737
We can pick another place if you'd like.

70
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,051
This café is cute, I'll ask Maysa again.

71
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:25,508
We can go just you and me.
I want someone to take my photos.

72
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:29,656
I took like 2,000 photos of you
at the last café we went.

73
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,933
And how many did you post?

74
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,993
Well, one.

75
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:36,665
Have you been a cheerleader before?

76
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

77
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:53,099
You guys go head.

78
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,957
Is she all right?

79
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:59,570
She's like that. Sometimes
she'd just zone out,

80
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,453
I'll catch you up later.

81
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,420
No, we can wait with you.

82
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,780
It'll take a while.

83
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:07,099
You go now before the
seniors chew your head off.

84
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,500
Yeah, we should go.

85
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:12,546
See you in the common room then.

86
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,720
Okay.

87
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:32,907
Why did you go in there?

88
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,680
Did I?

89
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,464
I didn't realize...

90
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:48,520
Remember what I told
you at the orientation?

91
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,888
We have to act normal.

92
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:54,913
Yes.

93
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,289
Look, I even applied to
the cheerleading team.

94
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:07,983
Don't worry.

95
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:10,649
I'll have your back if anything happens.

96
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm scared.

97
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:23,858
Can't it just be only you and me?

98
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,936
No! We're in college now,

99
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,875
no one knows about our past.

100
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,104
You can do it.

101
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,657
Let's go.

102
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,330
Let's hurry.

103
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,784
Proper uniform, everyone.

104
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,857
Keep walking.

105
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:52,902
Tuck your shirts in and
roll your sleeves down.

106
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm Fay.

107
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,143
What's your name?

108
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,168
I'm Bua.

109
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,823
Hi, I'm Shinny.

110
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,983
Did we meet at the orientation?

111
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,053
You remember me?

112
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,640
Your lip color is cute.

113
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:24,703
Look, we'll have to rate the quality
of our new environment.

114
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:25,570
You mean new friends?

115
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,843
I mean hot guys.

116
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:27,986
Duh.

117
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:32,811
Speaking of which, look at that yummy hunk.

118
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:37,131
Husband material, his name's Ninew.

119
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:40,058
Hey, he's giving me the eye.

120
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,920
Do I look pretty today?

121
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:43,938
He's still looking at me.

122
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,405
Yeah, he is.

123
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,442
- He fancies me.
- Whatever.

124
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,043
- He really likes me.
- Okay, he digs you.

125
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,068
Tai!

126
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:53,600
Can my friends squeeze in here?

127
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,771
Thanks.

128
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:30,149
If you see anything, just ignore it.

129
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,774
Hello freshies!

130
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,024
Welcome to our fraternity night!

131
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:51,211
We're the seniors who'll
supervise our activity today.

132
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,219
My name's Nuch.

133
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:56,898
This is Cho, our team captain this year.

134
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:02,110
Any problem you can come to us, all right?

135
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,414
Our first activity is simple.

136
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,315
You'll practice our school anthem together.

137
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,944
If you make a mistake, the drum will stop

138
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:16,022
and you'll have to start over
until all of you can sing as one.

139
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,388
We also have an ex-senior
observing us today.

140
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,840
His name's Ming.

141
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,149
Hi.

142
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,983
What's an "ex-senior"?

143
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,480
Someone who graduated years ago.

144
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,225
And doesn't he have anything better to do?

145
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,370
- No, that's why the loser sticks around.
- We'll sing it for you once.

146
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:41,360
You can find the lyrics
in your phone or on this board.

00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:50,030

167
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:48,536
Maysa, you're out of sync.

168
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,084
But I was singing the same verses.

169
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,635
No, you were chanting something else.

170
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:11,880
Start over.

171
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:31,992
♪ When you're weary, we'll
be your strength... ♪

172
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,184
Stop.

173
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,367
Maysa.

174
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:31,404
Hey.

175
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:34,280
Are you all right?

176
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,041
She just needs some air.

177
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:40,831
Cho.

178
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:49,704
Let's take a 15.

179
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,150
But don't go anywhere.

180
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,637
Stay here.

181
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,131
You feel better out here?

182
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,646
I'm sorry.

183
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:25,960
It's happening again.

184
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:30,702
It's all right.

185
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:32,732
We've been through this before.

186
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,537
I remember that time
during the swimming class

187
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:51,440
when I had to watch over you.

188
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:56,080
You told me to skip class

189
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,101
it was my first time doing it.

190
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,740
Are you as afraid now as you were then?

191
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,266
Not really.

192
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:23,350
Look, they say Maysa can see ghosts.

193
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:24,800
So...

194
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:27,440
she saw something here.

195
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:30,857
Drowning...

196
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,318
Traditional dance in the school building...

197
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,852
Sounds creepy.

198
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,619
Do you think it was real?

199
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,092
No, she was acting.

200
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,818
But her scream was horrifying.

201
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,320
How many incense sticks?

202
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:47,280
Dunno. Google it.

203
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,343
Me?

204
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:53,576
What do I search?

205
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,136
What are we praying to?

206
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,420
Just light 3.

207
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,855
I have more than 3.

208
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,176
- Three sticks are for monks.
- How is she?

209
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,499
- Let's go with 3 sticks.
- What's wrong with her...

210
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:06,711
Look, they're fighting.

211
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:10,880
What's wrong with her?
Why didn't you talk to her?

212
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:15,374
I don't know, but she
doesn't seem up to it.

213
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,935
What do your mean, huh?

214
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,591
Hey.

215
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,936
Your hands are cold.

216
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:26,680
I'll get you a jacket.

217
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:29,495
I think...

218
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:31,943
I should leave.

219
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:35,636
I'm bound to ruin the practice again.

220
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:46,571
Okay.

221
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,811
Can you wait here by yourself.

222
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:55,944
It's fine here.

223
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:02,248
I'll go talk to the seniors
and find you a jacket.

224
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:16,136
When she screamed,

225
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:18,803
did she see a ghost?

226
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:21,372
She totally freaked out.

227
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:23,740
What?

228
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:29,202
Tai.

229
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,658
How's Maysa?

230
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:33,320
Not good.

231
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,199
She wants to go home,
I'll go ask the seniors.

232
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:38,638
Can she go?

233
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,260
Then I want to go too.

234
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,099
It's spooky here.

235
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:47,675
So, what's wrong with Maysa?

236
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:51,969
Tai...

237
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,974
You can be frank with us.

238
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,629
Maysa can see ghosts, right?

239
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,632
Everyone is talking about it.

240
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:04,857
It's just a mean gossip.

241
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:06,368
Gossip?

242
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:10,720
But it seems pretty credible
what people are talking.

243
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:13,257
Like the story of the swimming pool.

244
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:16,400
You've been with her
since high school, right?

245
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:19,458
She's a bit of a loner,

246
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,419
so she was bullied a lot.

247
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,770
They spread this ghost
nonsense to hurt her.

248
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:27,130
So can you explain what just happened?

249
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:30,465
She's not well.

250
00:21:31,015 --> 00:21:32,433
What else do you want to hear?

251
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,498
Not well?

252
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:34,751
With what, exactly?

253
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:38,349
What do want from her?

254
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:42,551
If she really can see ghosts,
you guys will stop being her friends?

255
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,723
Can I borrow your cardigan?

256
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,090
Explain it!

257
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:41,160
She's just texted me.

258
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:43,480
She wants to go home.

259
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:46,720
And will you let her?

260
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,001
I think we should.

261
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:53,455
What about the others?

262
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,396
Should we let them go too?

263
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:01,693
But she was scared stiff.

264
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:03,023
Oh really?

265
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:04,636
What exactly is wrong with her?

266
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,848
I don't know,

267
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:10,334
but she's really in a bad shape.

268
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,587
You don't know? Then who does, huh?

269
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:14,044
Now what?

270
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,686
So our rituals lasted only 20 minutes?

271
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:19,680
I thought I'd lay low this year.

272
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:22,477
But you guys suck.

273
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:28,904
I'll let her rest in the back with us.

274
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,849
But she wants to go home.

275
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,088
This is the best for now.

276
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,552
It's your call.

277
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:50,395
What do they tell you?

278
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,966
Can I just run away?

279
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,203
Not now.

280
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:17,449
I just talked to Nuch.

281
00:24:18,187 --> 00:24:20,880
She's probably discussing it
with the other seniors.

282
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:26,168
Put this on.

283
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:32,398
Hey, you.

284
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,456
Well...

285
00:24:57,481 --> 00:25:01,091
I know you're not feeling well.

286
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:04,101
I'm concerned.

287
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:07,960
But the show must go on.

288
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:13,857
I'll allow Maysa to take a break
and hang back with us.

289
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,520
But I want to go home.

290
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:20,194
Girl.

291
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,651
Girl.

292
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:24,991
What's your problem?

293
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:31,013
- My friend's not feeling well.
- Are you her interpreter?

294
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:33,224
I'm asking her,

295
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,831
not you

296
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,520
What's your problem, huh?

297
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,080
Is there a name for your condition?

298
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,214
If you don't talk, I can't help you.

299
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:55,040
Maysa, we'll be done in an hour.

300
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,696
It's stuffy in here,

301
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:00,983
she feels suffocated.

302
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,692
Suffocated?

303
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:14,744
Hey, open the curtain for her.

304
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:22,320
Is it better now?

305
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,572
Hey, look at me
when I'm talking to you!

306
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:32,139
I can't! There's a ghost
right in front of you!

307
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:39,122
In front of me?

308
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,103
You mean...

309
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:48,320
Right here?

310
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:55,240
Like, can I smack its head like this?

311
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:59,142
Like this?

312
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:03,429
Well, listen up.

313
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,501
The thing is,

314
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,818
this girl wants to go home.

315
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:13,396
She wants to quit.

316
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:16,660
But if I allow her to leave,

317
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,365
then everyone should be able to leave too.

318
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:21,552
Since we're living in a democracy...

319
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:26,021
Cho, that's your thing, right? Democracy.

320
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:31,934
So let's put this to a vote.

321
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:36,576
Any of you who wants
to leave the ritual and go home,

322
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:39,641
Raise your hand.

323
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:43,873
Raise your hand if you want to go home.

324
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,287
You can see ghosts, right?

325
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,320
Anyone else can see ghosts here?

326
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:54,657
Anyone?

327
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,223
If just one of you admits
you can see ghosts,

328
00:28:00,701 --> 00:28:03,617
I'll let you all go home.

329
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:07,327
Come on, if you believe
there's a ghost here.

330
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:11,000
Raise your hand

331
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:14,154
Just one hand raised,

332
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:15,899
and we're done.

333
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,568
Anyone?

334
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:31,165
Raise your hand!

335
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:34,007
Hand!

336
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,634
Nada.

337
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:43,834
What about you?

338
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:46,005
Can you see ghosts?

339
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:02,280
Answer me.

340
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:43,072
You should leave.

341
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:47,535
Both of you.

342
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:59,471
We can continue without these two.

343
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:04,815
Girl!

344
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,505
Maysa.

345
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,857
Maysa.

346
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:08,998
Is that you?

347
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,173
Maysa.

348
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,018
Maysa!

349
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:01,935
Maysa,

350
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:03,840
what're you doing here?

351
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,111
Why didn't you help me?

352
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:15,873
I've been helping you.

353
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,455
Why didn't you tell him you can see ghosts?

354
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:23,018
Because if they know.

355
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:25,640
- We'll...
- Stop making an excuse.

356
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:34,685
Couldn't you just tell him you're like me?

357
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:38,052
Why do you care what other people think?

358
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:43,253
I care,

359
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:45,880
because I don't want to look like a freak!

360
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:49,849
Don't you know you're a freak?

361
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:53,480
Then you are, too.

362
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,960
We both are.

363
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:03,960
We both are freaks.

364
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:07,379
Yes, we're freaks,

365
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:10,373
that's why I've been trying.

366
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:12,640
I want to be normal, don't you get it?

367
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,600
You're not the only one
who's scared of ghosts.

368
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,279
I'm scared too,

369
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,802
but I force myself to ignore them.

370
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:24,040
Why can't you do the same?

371
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:35,880
You can't say I never tried.

372
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:40,143
I did try.

373
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,043
But I couldn't do it!

374
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:48,083
I'm not like you.

375
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,436
Every time you told me
you'd help me become normal.

376
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:02,048
I get it.

377
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:04,581
But when you abandoned me like that...

378
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,218
Abandoned you?

379
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:09,183
How could you say that?

380
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:11,800
I've always had your back!

381
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:15,415
Whenever I make new friends,

382
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,365
I bring you along to cheer you up.

383
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,480
I've done everything I could. Everything.

384
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,974
I've supported you until
I have nothing left.

385
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:32,275
You know I want to live a normal life.

386
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,092
To hang out with friends,
to travel like everyone does.

387
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:40,537
But why is it so difficult?

388
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,590
I'm so damn tired.

389
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:21,376
Maysa.

390
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,067
Let's start over.

391
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,920
You're the only friend I have.

392
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:37,528
Of course.

393
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:44,246
I'll be right here.

394
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:50,287
I'll never leave you
alone in this world, okay?

395
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,428
Come down here,

396
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:58,938
so we can talk.

397
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:02,318
Don't do this.

398
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,508
You'll only make it worse.

399
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:07,880
Come down here.

400
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,115
When you treated me
like you treated the ghosts

401
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,080
it hurt me more than
when I saw those ghosts.

402
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,679
From now on,

403
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:03,745
when you see me.

404
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,400
Don't ignore me like you ignore them.

405
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:14,496
Maysa!

406
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:28,283
Someone has jumped off the roof!

407
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,904
Call an ambulance!

408
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:18,696
I'm sorry.

409
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:38,361
Maysa, come read with me.

This movie contains scenes with flashing lights. This
may cause physical reaction in sensitive people.

00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:44,598
Hi, this is Pre-Med Show, Season 3.

412
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,176
I'm Tang.

413
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:50,537
I'm here to share tips for those
who want to enter med schools.

414
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,002
Starting with your responsibility...

415
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:56,071
Hello...

416
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:03,709
Now, what health conditions
might stop you from becoming a doctor?

417
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:08,800
First off, epilepsy.

418
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:12,581
If the condition is mild
and can be controlled,

419
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:16,154
then there's no problem.

420
00:44:16,926 --> 00:44:19,400
But if it's severe...

421
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:34,712
Are you sleeping on Bed C?

422
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:39,912
Careful, the real owner may return
like he did every year.

423
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:45,237
He was a first-year med student like us.

424
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:47,860
On the night he came back,

425
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,622
no one dared to stay in the dorm.

426
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:50,837
Even the security guys.

427
00:44:52,486 --> 00:44:54,599
You know why?

428
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:57,780
He got ran over by a car on the night

429
00:44:57,805 --> 00:45:00,078
of the 30th anniversary
of the college's founding.

430
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:04,010
They say...

431
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:06,810
he still wanted to continue his studies.

432
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:11,320
So every year on the anniversary night,

433
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:17,200
He would come back to the dorm

434
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,889
and walk into the room with Bed C.

435
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,285
His bed.

436
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:29,005
So if you don't want to see him...

437
00:45:55,618 --> 00:46:00,303
You stayed up or you just woke up?

438
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:02,600
What a nerd.

439
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,734
Turn off the light.

Hi Tang.

444
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:49,966
I didn't know your podcast...

445
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:51,623
has ghost stories.

446
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:54,179
Only that EP.

447
00:46:54,204 --> 00:46:56,160
For your ears only.

448
00:46:57,053 --> 00:47:00,229
Oh, I already forwarded it
to the professor with the other files.

449
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:01,254
What?

450
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:02,894
Are you serious?

451
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:03,919
Yes.

452
00:47:09,008 --> 00:47:10,921
You're pulling my leg.

453
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:15,209
Ghost stories will help you stay awake.

454
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,520
See, you're too scared to
stay in the room, right?

455
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:21,968
Not at all.

456
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:29,776
Tan, do you have something to tell me?

457
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:35,975
No, I don't.

458
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,112
The quiz is tomorrow evening.

459
00:47:40,522 --> 00:47:42,647
You have time to go home and study.

460
00:47:42,672 --> 00:47:44,655
It's quiet here.

461
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,027
I can concentrate more.

462
00:47:46,052 --> 00:47:47,069
But...

463
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,842
what if the ghost shows up?

464
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:54,264
The last bus is at 10pm.

465
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,295
I'll study until then and go home.

466
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,700
But you can leave first.

467
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:58,725
Don't wait for me.

468
00:47:58,995 --> 00:47:59,995
It'll be late.

469
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,400
You want me to go alone again.

470
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,840
It's no big deal. Don't sulk.

471
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:13,695
I'm not.

472
00:48:15,444 --> 00:48:17,215
I just feel lonely.

473
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:30,018
Tan, how about this?

474
00:48:32,499 --> 00:48:36,702
All medical students, it's time to
declare an oath of ethical behavior

475
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:40,943
and commitment to the medical profession.

"70th ANNIVERSARY OF COLLEGE OF MEDICINE"

As member of the medical profession

478
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:53,529
I pledge to dedicate my
life to serve humanity.

479
00:48:54,688 --> 00:49:01,880
I pledge to conduct my professional duty
with conscience and dignity.

480
00:49:02,404 --> 00:49:07,186
I will regard the health of
my patients as top priority.

481
00:49:07,821 --> 00:49:10,787
I will protect the honor,

482
00:49:10,812 --> 00:49:14,748
dignity and tradition of
the medical profession.

483
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:21,143
My fellow practitioners
are my blood brothers.

484
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:27,818
In the face of a threat, I pledge to
uphold the value of the human life.

485
00:49:28,774 --> 00:49:35,427
I will not exploit my professional
knowledge in ways that are immoral.

486
00:49:35,817 --> 00:49:43,817
I will respect the right to life of
patients, fellow humans, and of myself.

Next, we will hand out the 70th anniversary
commemorative pins to all of you.

488

00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:09,347
No.

493
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:12,060
I'm off then, good luck.

494
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:14,505

495
00:50:15,623 --> 00:50:17,056
watch your back, okay?

"MALE COLLEGE STUDENT DORMITORY"

498
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:12,699
There are many factors,

499
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:14,737
that can trigger seizures.

500
00:51:14,762 --> 00:51:16,496
Such as stress...

501
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:19,401
Sleep deprivation or flashing lights.

502
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:21,947
But in severe cases,

503
00:51:21,972 --> 00:51:24,011
such as having an hour-long seizure

504
00:51:24,036 --> 00:51:26,730
followed by temporary hemiparesis

505
00:51:26,755 --> 00:51:29,823
or full-bodied paralysis,

506
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:31,861
the patient needs a thorough diagnosis

507
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:36,198
and an EEG test or by MRI

508
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:38,753
before a course of
treatment can be determined.

509
00:51:38,778 --> 00:51:41,862
Doctors who have severe epilepsy

510
00:51:42,089 --> 00:51:44,737
and whose condition
might harm the patients,

511
00:51:44,762 --> 00:51:48,200
such as having a seizure
while performing an operation

512
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,160
will likely to be disqualified
from specialized practices.

513
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:18,160
If the condition cannot
be medically alleviated,

514
00:52:18,826 --> 00:52:22,800
they will not be allowed
to perform an operation.

515
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:13,502
So you really came.

516
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,851
You said you'd stay,

517
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:20,332
so I'll stay and study
with you until 10 p.m.

518
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:35,200

520
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:45,509
Maybe... I should sleep here.

521
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,080
Really?

522
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,040
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

523
00:53:50,676 --> 00:53:52,635
I'm more scared of you.

524
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:54,560
That's funny.

525
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:18,503
Hyperventilation is
abnormally rapid breathing

526
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:23,392
caused by mental panic
and not by physical conditions.

527
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:27,801
Level of Co2 is also a factor.

528
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:30,419
As well as flashing lights...

529
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:34,253
But in severe cases,
such as having an hour-long seizure

530
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:38,669
the patient needs a thorough diagnosis
and an EEG test.

531
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,127
If the condition cannot
be medically treated,

532
00:54:41,128 --> 00:54:45,871
they will not be allowed
to perform an operation.

534
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:52,200
Please be quiet.

535
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,541
I'm beat.

536
00:54:59,048 --> 00:55:00,512
I want to study in peace.

537
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:07,240
Are you sure you don't
have anything to tell me?

538
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,036
Yeah.

539
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,316
You can tell me everything.

542
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:21,296
I said it's nothing.

543
00:55:21,876 --> 00:55:23,335
I just want to be alone.

544
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:25,664
How could you say that?

545
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:29,776
I've always been by your side.

546
00:55:30,548 --> 00:55:31,548
I...

547
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,536
I really want to be alone.

548
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:50,417
Remember what you said to me?

549
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,057
You said you wanted to be a doctor

550
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:58,911
so you could look after me.

551
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:04,270
You still want to do that?

552
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,478
I'm sorry.

553
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:18,956
Tang.

554
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,140
Tang.

555
00:57:45,473 --> 00:57:46,473
Tang.

556
00:58:09,034 --> 00:58:12,793
Many factors can trigger seizures.

557
00:58:12,794 --> 00:58:15,557
Stress, sleep deprivation,

558
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,786
or flashing lights.

559
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:38,455
Tang!

560
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:51,369
Shit!

561
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,480
Is that you?

562
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,120
Tang.

563
00:59:08,877 --> 00:59:10,163
This is not funny.

564
00:59:15,195 --> 00:59:16,195
Tang.

565
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:58,490
Tang.

566
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:03,133
Don't do this.

567
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:08,963
If you don't want him to come,

568
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,213
write "No Bed C here"

569
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:13,096
on a piece of paper

570
01:02:13,391 --> 01:02:15,157
and put it outside the door.

571
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:19,175
But no one knows if the trick is foolproof.

572
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:37,822
I'm home.

573
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:40,066
No need to call.

574
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:46,744
The only foolproof trick is...

575
01:02:49,597 --> 01:02:51,545
Let's go home together!

576
01:02:51,546 --> 01:02:55,400
Let's go home, pleaseeee.

577
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,033
No Bed C here

578
01:03:07,628 --> 01:03:08,672
Shit!

579
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:46,720
No Bed C here

580
01:06:40,353 --> 01:06:43,603
Bed C here

581
01:15:06,579 --> 01:15:09,419
"30th ANNIVERSARY"

582
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,977
"70th ANNIVERSARY"

583
01:15:11,002 --> 01:15:15,618
May this pin remind you of your oath...

584
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:20,480
I pledge to dedicate my life to serving
humanity... to respect the right to life...

585
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:23,274
They say...

586
01:15:23,837 --> 01:15:26,051
he still wanted to continue his studies.

587
01:15:26,076 --> 01:15:27,835
"30th ANNIVERSARY"

588
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:37,403
I will protect the honor

589
01:15:37,702 --> 01:15:41,120
and tradition of the medical profession.

590
01:15:47,602 --> 01:15:49,983
My fellow practitioners

591
01:15:51,036 --> 01:15:54,070
are my blood brothers.

592
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:06,920
In the face of a threat,

593
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:12,104
I will respect the value of the human life.

594
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:15,173
From womb to tomb,

595
01:16:16,449 --> 01:16:17,576
I...

596
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:21,048
will not exploit my knowledge

597
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:26,533
in ways that are immoral.

598
01:17:02,562 --> 01:17:03,920
I...

599
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:07,884
will respect the right to life of patients

600
01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:11,320
of fellow humans,

601
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:15,495
and of myself.

602
01:19:00,786 --> 01:19:03,723
Calling Tang...

603
01:19:21,205 --> 01:19:22,205
Tang.

604
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:27,928
Tang.

605
01:19:30,215 --> 01:19:32,332
I have something to tell you.

606
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,600
I have epilepsy.

607
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,736
It's severe.

608
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,073
I don't think I can become a doctor.

609
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:58,480
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

610
01:20:02,586 --> 01:20:06,911
I'm sorry for acting weird.

611
01:20:12,169 --> 01:20:14,400
Honestly, I've always wanted to be with you

612
01:20:15,702 --> 01:20:18,640
I really want to do what I promised to you.

613
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:25,680
I'm sorry.

614
01:20:30,562 --> 01:20:31,562
Tang.

615
01:20:33,723 --> 01:20:35,096
Are you there?

616
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,800
Tan...

617
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:43,720
You don't have to be a doctor.

618
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:48,584
I still want you to look after me.

619
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:37,721
You guys know...

620
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:42,973
why our school had to
move out of the old Science building.

621
01:21:45,425 --> 01:21:48,650
But have you heard about what happened...

622
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,699
one night at the walkway?

623
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:03,112
THE ABANDONED

624
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:14,979
Faculty of Science

625
01:24:07,338 --> 01:24:10,895
Faculty of Science

626
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,720
They say...

627
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,385
a vile she-ghost has resided

628
01:24:15,793 --> 01:24:19,556
in the iron wood sign for centuries.

629
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,635
Anyone who disrespects it,

630
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,653
especially at night,

631
01:24:26,237 --> 01:24:28,984
will pay a dear price.

632
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:35,791
Well,

633
01:24:37,182 --> 01:24:38,745
can I ask you something?

634
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:44,762
If there's a ghost in the iron wood sign

635
01:24:45,644 --> 01:24:50,126
what about rusty iron wood?

636
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:53,463
Does the ghost turn rusty too?

637
01:24:56,497 --> 01:25:00,822
Is that the wittiest joke
you can come up with?

638
01:25:03,571 --> 01:25:04,685
Let's say,

639
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:07,680
if we use the very same iron wood

640
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,588
to make signs for...

641
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:13,132
Faculty of Medicine,

642
01:25:13,157 --> 01:25:15,080
Faculty of Fisheries,

643
01:25:15,105 --> 01:25:16,714
Faculty of Astrology,

644
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:20,422
Will the vile she-ghost
split her ghostly atoms

645
01:25:21,006 --> 01:25:23,200
so she can haunt every one of them?

646
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:29,855
I think the seniors who made our sign

647
01:25:31,151 --> 01:25:34,543
must have anticipated
a pain in the neck like you

648
01:25:34,568 --> 01:25:37,717
and decided to make just one sign,
to end all problems.

649
01:25:38,135 --> 01:25:39,243
May.

650
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:40,502
You just disrespected the ghost.

651
01:25:40,526 --> 01:25:41,768
You'd better watch your back.

652
01:25:41,793 --> 01:25:44,057
- Yeah.
- I was just curious.

653
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:46,117
Why so serious?

654
01:25:47,695 --> 01:25:48,711
You'll see.

655
01:25:50,298 --> 01:25:51,335
And you, Meen,

656
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,680
enough with ghost stories.

657
01:25:53,907 --> 01:25:56,655
Finish your lab paper or you won't graduate

658
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,677
and become another ghost
haunting this school.

659
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,800
Aoi Forever.

660
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,680
Text me back, please.

661
01:26:27,196 --> 01:26:29,308
Meen.

662
01:26:33,968 --> 01:26:36,362
Hi Mom.

663
01:26:36,578 --> 01:26:38,536
Ten minutes late and

664
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:39,858
you're already on my ass.

665
01:26:39,883 --> 01:26:42,290
I need my laptop now.

666
01:26:42,315 --> 01:26:43,094
You don't.

667
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:43,798
Why?

668
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:46,174
A college dropout isn't
worthy of your laptop?

669
01:26:46,199 --> 01:26:47,899
You can use it.

670
01:26:47,924 --> 01:26:49,854
But not to Photoshop pictures for girls

671
01:26:49,879 --> 01:26:51,417
without telling me.

672
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:56,360
Sis, I've had a bad day.

673
01:26:57,285 --> 01:26:59,600
Scraped my bike against a pole.

674
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,699
And shit keeps hitting the fan.

675
01:27:01,724 --> 01:27:03,480
Oh, tough day.

676
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:06,520
What happened exactly?

677
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:10,863
Aoi didn't text me back all day.

678
01:27:16,582 --> 01:27:17,818
In one day,

679
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:22,277
my whole world crumbles.

680
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:28,928
A delivery rider is condemned
to a life without a future.

681
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:30,160
Wait.

682
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:33,472
Is this the girl you've met 2 weeks ago?

683
01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:37,814
Golf, get your act together
before thinking about getting a girl!

684
01:27:37,839 --> 01:27:39,902
So it's a tie!

685
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:41,893
You have no boyfriend and I have no future.

686
01:27:41,918 --> 01:27:45,181
Whatever, dumb-ass.

687
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:46,683
Where are you now?

688
01:27:46,806 --> 01:27:51,089
I'm right in front of some sign...

689
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:55,105
Con-gra-tu-la-ti-on-s.

690
01:27:56,431 --> 01:27:58,495
Bring the computer to me now!

691
01:27:58,761 --> 01:28:00,920
You can do that, right?

692
01:28:10,472 --> 01:28:11,762
Shit,

693
01:28:13,276 --> 01:28:14,315
which way now?

694
01:28:14,642 --> 01:28:19,634
Text me back, dearest Aoi.

695
01:28:19,942 --> 01:28:23,488
Let's start over.

696
01:28:23,513 --> 01:28:27,085
I'll do my best this time.

697
01:28:41,959 --> 01:28:43,726
Faculty of Science.

698
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:46,120
Finally!

699
01:28:52,526 --> 01:28:53,640
Must be this way.

700
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:14,160
I haven't finished the story
of the old Science building.

701
01:29:16,306 --> 01:29:18,034
On the ground floor,

702
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:20,370
there's a glass cabinet.

703
01:29:20,804 --> 01:29:23,222
With the graduation gown inside?

704
01:29:23,472 --> 01:29:27,931
Yes, it's a tribute to one of the students.

705
01:29:27,956 --> 01:29:29,667
She was a poor student,

706
01:29:30,011 --> 01:29:32,367
and got bullied all the time.

707
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,503
So she studied hard,

708
01:29:34,528 --> 01:29:36,860
hoping to graduate in 4 years.

709
01:29:39,405 --> 01:29:40,705
But in the end,

710
01:29:41,524 --> 01:29:42,968
she failed.

711
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:47,620
Distraught that she
couldn't achieve her goal,

712
01:29:47,645 --> 01:29:49,320
on graduation day,

713
01:29:49,768 --> 01:29:51,960
she put on the gown

714
01:30:11,941 --> 01:30:15,933
On the eve of every graduation day since,

715
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,360
at least one student died

716
01:30:18,952 --> 01:30:21,760
an unnatural death at that building.

717
01:31:45,785 --> 01:31:48,616
Why do they even display this crappy gown?

718
01:32:19,143 --> 01:32:25,200
Earn respect from students
with the spirit of teaching.

719
01:32:58,845 --> 01:33:01,288
A student once challenged the ghosts there.

720
01:33:02,085 --> 01:33:05,049
The next day he was found dead.

721
01:33:05,444 --> 01:33:07,800
His guts all over the floor.

722
01:33:10,809 --> 01:33:11,809
Gory stuff.

723
01:33:15,579 --> 01:33:16,792
You're enjoying this.

724
01:33:18,245 --> 01:33:20,972
There's more to the story, guys.

725
01:33:24,775 --> 01:33:29,928
This professor was having
a recurrent heart attack.

726
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:33,217
Too bad she couldn't
find her medicine bottle.

727
01:33:35,178 --> 01:33:37,057
So she died.

728
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:42,240
Who the hell left a medicine
bottle on the floor?

729
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,372
What an asshole.

730
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,784
Just my luck.

731
01:33:54,707 --> 01:33:57,741
My medicine.

732
01:34:06,378 --> 01:34:08,222
"For heart condition"

733
01:34:15,235 --> 01:34:18,346
Is this your medicine?

734
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:24,416
I'm sorry, professor.

735
01:34:40,765 --> 01:34:41,840
Hey.

736
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:44,778
Are you okay?

737
01:34:50,937 --> 01:34:52,366
Are you...

738
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:56,538
"For heart condition"

739
01:34:59,272 --> 01:35:00,713
Are you...

740
01:35:01,342 --> 01:35:03,000
having a heart attack?

741
01:35:03,487 --> 01:35:04,680
Stop.

742
01:35:23,316 --> 01:35:24,963
Aoi's text!

743
01:35:26,568 --> 01:35:30,256
I've been giving it some thought

744
01:35:44,816 --> 01:35:48,887
And I suppose...

745
01:35:54,762 --> 01:35:56,029
"For heart condition"

746
01:35:57,224 --> 01:35:58,224
that...

747
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:02,289
"For heart condition"

748
01:36:03,102 --> 01:36:04,102
that...

749
01:36:07,647 --> 01:36:09,280
Give me back my medicine.

750
01:36:11,068 --> 01:36:12,560
Come on, professor.

751
01:36:12,816 --> 01:36:13,968
Be kind, okay?

752
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:16,040
She's dying right there.

753
01:36:16,304 --> 01:36:18,640
Stop thinking about
yourself for a second, okay?

754
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,392
And what the hell's wrong with this chick?

755
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,240
Hey, are you all right?

756
01:36:28,361 --> 01:36:29,678
Get over here.

757
01:36:29,929 --> 01:36:32,631
Away from the nutty professor.

758
01:36:34,741 --> 01:36:36,463
You okay?

759
01:36:45,067 --> 01:36:46,200
Is this yours?

760
01:36:47,894 --> 01:36:50,428
It might help.

761
01:36:53,354 --> 01:36:56,700
Is this a no?

762
01:36:56,725 --> 01:36:58,452
Never mind.

763
01:36:59,626 --> 01:37:00,626
I will...

764
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,616
take you to a hospital.

765
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:07,600
Let's go get my bike, okay?

766
01:37:15,053 --> 01:37:15,811
Hello.

767
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:17,616
Golf, what's taking you so long?

768
01:37:17,641 --> 01:37:19,740
I'm already at the Science Building.

769
01:37:19,765 --> 01:37:21,670
Right in front of the faculty's office.

770
01:37:22,053 --> 01:37:22,975
By the way,

771
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,584
this building looks like shit.

772
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:31,120
You got the wrong building, idiot.

773
01:37:35,157 --> 01:37:36,776
I have to go now.

774
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:39,679
Whoa.

775
01:37:40,634 --> 01:37:41,862
You okay?

776
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:44,545
I'll take you to a hospital.

777
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:48,520
But I have to return this
laptop to my sister first, okay?

778
01:37:49,335 --> 01:37:52,053
Stop screaming, would you?

779
01:37:52,078 --> 01:37:53,345
Come on, let's go.

780
01:37:59,463 --> 01:38:00,730
Just a sec.

781
01:38:02,014 --> 01:38:03,342
She'll be here soon.

782
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:07,400
Told me to hurry and now I have to wait.

783
01:38:13,559 --> 01:38:15,874
You know, I admire your spirit.

784
01:38:16,378 --> 01:38:20,960
You're sick but you still
put on the gown to take photos.

785
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:22,950
Respect.

786
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:34,168
You know what?

787
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:42,311
I used to take graduation
day photos for a small fee.

788
01:38:42,594 --> 01:38:44,168
My photos are cool.

789
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,400
Would you hire me?

790
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:52,498
Any style you want.
You're into Goth, right?

791
01:38:55,552 --> 01:38:56,640
Ah ha.

792
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,223
No budget, huh?

793
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:02,139
Don't worry.

794
01:39:02,533 --> 01:39:04,520
No Charge. Covid promotion.

795
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,321
You're broke, I see.

796
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:08,648
When you recover,

797
01:39:09,164 --> 01:39:10,456
just give me a call.

798
01:39:15,106 --> 01:39:16,143
What's wrong?

799
01:39:25,053 --> 01:39:26,053
Medicine.

800
01:39:26,138 --> 01:39:27,277
You need your medicine.

801
01:39:35,713 --> 01:39:37,888
Hang in there. Just a sec.

802
01:39:38,531 --> 01:39:39,800
Where is it?

803
01:39:42,237 --> 01:39:43,377
What medicine?

804
01:39:45,007 --> 01:39:46,381
What took you so long?

805
01:39:46,406 --> 01:39:47,840
I'd been waiting for ages.

806
01:39:48,244 --> 01:39:49,381
Are you messing with me?

807
01:39:49,406 --> 01:39:50,406
Give it here.

808
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:52,302
Ungrateful sis.

809
01:39:52,327 --> 01:39:54,016
You went to the old building?

810
01:39:54,041 --> 01:39:55,477
Be careful,

811
01:39:55,502 --> 01:39:57,233
the ghosts will break your neck.

812
01:39:58,343 --> 01:39:59,343
Ghosts?

813
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:02,629
You're a science student, for God's sake!

814
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:04,840
What a waste.

815
01:40:05,395 --> 01:40:07,577
Well, I explored the entire building.

816
01:40:07,602 --> 01:40:10,640
Not a single ghost in sight.

817
01:40:11,669 --> 01:40:12,859
Only a professor and...

818
01:40:13,241 --> 01:40:14,770
a senior taking her graduation photos.

819
01:40:14,795 --> 01:40:17,005
Who would take photos this late?

820
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:18,269
Are you high?

821
01:40:18,653 --> 01:40:20,624
If I don't finish my paper

822
01:40:20,649 --> 01:40:22,530
and have to drop out like you,

823
01:40:22,555 --> 01:40:23,960
it will be your fault.

824
01:40:24,678 --> 01:40:26,752
Dropping out is not a crime.

825
01:40:27,337 --> 01:40:28,991
Stop rubbing it in.

826
01:40:29,647 --> 01:40:30,780
Are you done?

827
01:40:30,805 --> 01:40:31,966
Yeah, done.

828
01:40:31,991 --> 01:40:33,022
I have work to do.

829
01:40:33,047 --> 01:40:34,715
Good, now go.

830
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,007
Can't wait.

831
01:40:44,322 --> 01:40:45,413
Where did she go?

832
01:41:29,124 --> 01:41:30,124
Hey.

833
01:41:34,093 --> 01:41:35,093
You.

834
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:40,237
Where's Meen?

835
01:41:41,874 --> 01:41:43,680
Getting the laptop from her brother.

836
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,898
Brave girl.

837
01:41:45,923 --> 01:41:47,491
She just told us a ghost story and...

838
01:41:47,516 --> 01:41:49,560
went off all alone like that.

839
01:41:50,406 --> 01:41:54,000
Joy, nothing to be scared of!

840
01:41:54,267 --> 01:41:58,866
The ghosts are at the
old building, not here!

841
01:42:29,413 --> 01:42:30,640
Hey there,

842
01:42:31,582 --> 01:42:33,370
you need help?

843
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:47,721
My brother is so dumb
he went to the wrong building.

844
01:42:56,955 --> 01:42:58,607
Give me back my medicine!

845
01:43:11,263 --> 01:43:13,920
What's going on here?

846
01:43:14,213 --> 01:43:16,670
The professor-ghost and
the grad-gown ghost!

847
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:18,791
Shit! Why are they here?

848
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:20,374
What do they want?

849
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:22,592
Offerings, I guess.

850
01:43:22,617 --> 01:43:24,341
The professor is easier to deal with,

851
01:43:24,366 --> 01:43:25,982
she just wants her medicine.

852
01:43:26,007 --> 01:43:28,044
But where the hell is it?

853
01:43:29,555 --> 01:43:31,015
Give me back my medicine!

854
01:43:39,033 --> 01:43:39,648
Sup?

855
01:43:39,673 --> 01:43:42,630
Is the medicine bottle with you?

856
01:43:45,591 --> 01:43:46,591
Come again.

857
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,615
Did you take any medicine bottle
from the old building?

858
01:43:50,278 --> 01:43:51,661
Medicine...

859
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:53,390
Oh yeah.

860
01:43:55,817 --> 01:43:58,812
It's in your laptop case.

861
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:00,931
No, it's fucking not.

862
01:44:00,956 --> 01:44:02,880
No need to yell.

863
01:44:02,905 --> 01:44:04,492
But how do you know about
the medicine bottle?

864
01:44:04,516 --> 01:44:07,101
Golf, go find it right now.

865
01:44:07,126 --> 01:44:10,475
- Someone is dying to have it back.
- Give me back my medicine!

866
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,840
Where did you lose it?

867
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:15,004
Relax,

868
01:44:15,702 --> 01:44:17,738
let me think.

869
01:44:24,517 --> 01:44:25,517
You're hungry?

870
01:44:27,913 --> 01:44:31,240
Calm down, guys. Let's work it out.

871
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,895
If we can't find her meds,
we can get her some other meds.

872
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,336
Get an app rider to buy it

873
01:44:37,361 --> 01:44:38,864
from a store or something.

874
01:44:38,889 --> 01:44:41,780
Meen, have your brother go buy it now.

875
01:44:41,805 --> 01:44:45,146
Joy, you dork!
You're the one who needs to calm down!

876
01:44:45,647 --> 01:44:47,544
I've seen a lot of horror films.

877
01:44:47,569 --> 01:44:49,772
This ghost is after a
specific bottle of meds,

878
01:44:49,802 --> 01:44:50,737
she wouldn't take anything else for it.

879
01:44:50,762 --> 01:44:53,889
A heart med is a heart med.
Old bottle, new bottle. It doesn't matter!

880
01:44:53,914 --> 01:44:55,280
Give me back my medicine.

881
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:58,986
Stupid crone, go to hell!

882
01:45:09,191 --> 01:45:10,650
How the hell can I find it?

883
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:12,932
Just a small bottle.

884
01:45:19,445 --> 01:45:24,000
Hey, there you are.

885
01:45:32,865 --> 01:45:34,457
A flower garland?

886
01:46:08,983 --> 01:46:13,147
Shit, what now! I don't want to die!

887
01:46:17,169 --> 01:46:19,968
Leave us alone, bitches.

888
01:46:24,321 --> 01:46:25,640
Split up!

889
01:46:49,905 --> 01:46:53,097
She's coming this way.

890
01:46:53,122 --> 01:46:55,936
Nooooo!

891
01:46:55,961 --> 01:46:57,843
Stop right there!

892
01:47:03,428 --> 01:47:04,810
It won't come off.

893
01:47:06,407 --> 01:47:08,634
I'm sorry.

894
01:47:14,473 --> 01:47:17,575
Come baby, come.

895
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,053
She's here!

896
01:47:19,078 --> 01:47:20,614
Help me!

897
01:47:21,022 --> 01:47:22,943
Five, six, seven, eight.

898
01:47:22,968 --> 01:47:25,040
Meen, help me!

899
01:47:31,585 --> 01:47:34,600
The door's stuck.

900
01:47:36,936 --> 01:47:37,936
Golf

901
01:47:40,532 --> 01:47:41,646
Pick up, Golf.

902
01:47:42,825 --> 01:47:45,647
Sis, there's a she-ghost at the walkway!

903
01:47:45,672 --> 01:47:47,881
The medicine bottle is there,
but I can't get past her.

904
01:47:47,906 --> 01:47:49,340
You saw the iron-wood ghost?

905
01:47:49,365 --> 01:47:51,375
We have the professor and
the grad-gown bitch here.

906
01:47:51,399 --> 01:47:53,739
Damn, I can't help you.

907
01:47:53,764 --> 01:47:55,014
You're on your own.

908
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:56,897
Golf listen, the iron-wood ghost

909
01:47:56,922 --> 01:47:59,570
isn't always at the sign.

910
01:47:59,595 --> 01:48:01,173
You can do it.

911
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:03,042
I believe in you.

912
01:48:08,633 --> 01:48:10,899
What's with all this friggin' thunder!?

913
01:48:17,327 --> 01:48:20,569
- What do I do?
- If you believe there's nothing, then there's nothing.

914
01:48:20,594 --> 01:48:24,368
Right, that's easy for you.

915
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,536
Enough with the thunder!
Just rain, for fuck's sake!

916
01:48:51,077 --> 01:48:51,864
What?

917
01:48:51,889 --> 01:48:53,450
Got it?

918
01:48:53,475 --> 01:48:55,850
Goddamnit!

919
01:48:55,875 --> 01:48:58,120
I'll tell you when I've got it. Okay?

920
01:49:16,468 --> 01:49:19,780
Stop calling me, bitch.

921
01:49:19,805 --> 01:49:22,577
Fine, I won't call you ever again.

922
01:49:22,602 --> 01:49:23,880
Asshole.

923
01:49:27,672 --> 01:49:29,515
Aoi.

924
01:49:30,395 --> 01:49:31,663
Aoi.

925
01:49:42,093 --> 01:49:46,233
Sorry, the number you
dial cannot be reached...

926
01:49:51,803 --> 01:49:53,811
My beloved Aoi!!!

927
01:49:53,836 --> 01:49:59,889
♪ Is it raining where you are? ♪

928
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:03,249
My beloved Aoi!!!
♪ Are you fine? ♪

929
01:50:03,274 --> 01:50:06,735
♪ Are you afraid of thunder? ♪

930
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:14,080
♪ Don't worry, I'll come over... ♪

931
01:50:31,123 --> 01:50:37,803
Give me back my medicine!

932
01:50:44,154 --> 01:50:46,614
The iron-wood ghost just got me good.

933
01:50:46,909 --> 01:50:48,160
I can't do this.

934
01:50:49,126 --> 01:50:50,701
You failed again?

935
01:50:54,063 --> 01:50:55,497
Why do you have to say that?

936
01:50:55,522 --> 01:50:57,280
You think it feels good to keep failing?

937
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:11,813
Run. I'll deal with everything here.

938
01:51:24,357 --> 01:51:26,000
Give me back my medicine.

939
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:31,704
It's stuck!

940
01:51:31,729 --> 01:51:33,751
Try pushing.

941
01:51:35,033 --> 01:51:36,280
You're right.

942
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:38,138
Meen, come!

943
01:51:38,163 --> 01:51:39,783
Give me back my medicine.

944
01:51:40,131 --> 01:51:41,656
Give me back my medicine.

945
01:51:52,241 --> 01:51:53,441
Are we safe now?

946
01:51:56,898 --> 01:51:58,120
I'm beat.

947
01:51:58,968 --> 01:52:00,044
Look!

948
01:52:03,272 --> 01:52:04,345
Ma'am, we're sorry!

949
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:07,058
We didn't mean to lose your medicine!

950
01:52:12,702 --> 01:52:14,120
Give me back my medicine.

951
01:52:42,518 --> 01:52:47,932
A long life awaits, walk
with your head held high.

952
01:52:56,068 --> 01:52:58,320
This time I won't fail.

953
01:53:44,094 --> 01:53:45,360
Catch!

954
01:54:34,683 --> 01:54:35,683
Hey!

955
01:54:42,385 --> 01:54:44,088
Why are you doing this?

956
01:54:48,922 --> 01:54:50,382
If I don't graduate,

957
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:52,851
no one will.

958
01:55:31,149 --> 01:55:32,149
Here.

959
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:34,897
Your gown is a mess.

960
01:55:35,207 --> 01:55:37,118
You won't look good in photos.

961
01:56:06,138 --> 01:56:07,553
You know...

962
01:56:08,434 --> 01:56:09,920
Everybody tells me

963
01:56:11,015 --> 01:56:14,880
this faculty is so damn hard
to graduate from.

964
01:56:16,549 --> 01:56:20,464
I wouldn't make it past the first semester.

965
01:56:24,632 --> 01:56:29,216
But you've come this far.

966
01:56:31,948 --> 01:56:34,383
I'm really proud of you.

967
01:56:43,748 --> 01:56:45,216
You made it.

968
01:56:45,872 --> 01:56:47,216
You've graduated.

969
01:56:48,376 --> 01:56:50,057
Con-gra-tu-la-ti-on-s.

970
01:56:52,254 --> 01:56:53,662
As promised,

971
01:56:54,174 --> 01:56:55,640
smile.

972
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:00,736
One, two, three.

973
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:19,788
Okay, time to go...

974
01:57:20,107 --> 01:57:22,975
make up with your Aoi.

975
01:57:26,467 --> 01:57:30,880
It's probably too late.

976
01:57:38,845 --> 01:57:42,670
Hey, girls are like that.

977
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:44,752
She'll forgive you.

978
01:57:46,996 --> 01:57:48,379
Though I think...

979
01:57:48,629 --> 01:57:51,662
maybe you should let her go.

980
01:57:52,948 --> 01:57:55,176
You deserve someone better.

981
01:57:59,937 --> 01:58:01,053
Yeah,

982
01:58:02,717 --> 01:58:04,263
I'm done with her.

983
01:58:11,325 --> 01:58:14,487
Umm, you said

984
01:58:14,512 --> 01:58:16,735
you're proud of that grad-gown ghost.

985
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:19,071
What about me?

986
01:58:20,019 --> 01:58:21,608
Are you proud of me?

987
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:25,503
Yeah, sure.

988
01:58:27,462 --> 01:58:28,608
Honestly,

989
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:32,107
I want to be a good student like you.

990
01:58:39,749 --> 01:58:40,817
Hey, Golf.

991
01:58:41,424 --> 01:58:45,389
Dropping out doesn't
mean your life is over.

992
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:48,129
Life is much more than that.

993
01:58:48,738 --> 01:58:50,520
There's plenty of opportunities out there.

994
01:58:58,717 --> 01:58:59,717
Yeah.

995
01:59:01,209 --> 01:59:03,854
Now go back to your lab.

996
01:59:04,948 --> 01:59:06,000
I'm going home.

997
01:59:14,373 --> 01:59:15,602
Ride safely.

998
01:59:19,543 --> 01:59:20,680
What was that?

999
01:59:35,498 --> 01:59:38,515
It's con-gra-tu-la-tions, dumb-ass.
