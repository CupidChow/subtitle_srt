[Episode 4]

17
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,980
I have proof

18
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,940
that I'm telling the truth.

19
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,420
Go ahead, explain.

20
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,530
We all saw it earlier.

21
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,940
Zhou Shiyun

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,420
fell in Mr. Fu's direction.

23
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,250
If I had thrown a ball from

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,340
where I was standing,

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,780
it would've followed

26
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,220
a parabolic arc
and landed on Zhou Shiyun.

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,450
We all know that

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,780
the direction of the force

29
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,810
is perpendicular
to the point of its application.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,730
If I really threw it,

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,420
how could she

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,140
possibly fall

33
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,940
toward Mr. Fu?

34
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,530
Shiyun,

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,530
you always say

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,690
we're best friends.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,530
Then can we go back

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,650
and do the whole thing again

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,500
in front of everyone?

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,970
The school has
surveillance cameras everywhere.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,940
We can replay the footage

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,810
and verify it anytime.

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,220
But as for the mental distress

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,850

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,370

I'm on duty today.

49
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,220
Mr. Fu,

50
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,460
I'll head back now.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,970
Gu explained everything thoroughly,

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,570
didn't she?

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,740
We'll also reserve our right

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,940
to pursue legal action

55
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,780
for slander and those things.

56
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,250
Let us know if there is any news.

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,810
Let's go.

58
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,370
Oh, by the way,

59
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,620
you all have my card, right?

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,300
Big projects, no sweat,

Come on, Dad.

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,780
Let's move.

He…

65
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,740
The kids really are

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,530
at a critical stage

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,530
right now.

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,250
Yeah.

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,620
Even though this happened,

70
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,410
don't worry.

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,090
I promise

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,650
I'll handle it properly.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,300
Alright.

74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,090
Thanks.

75
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,900
You're welcome.

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,810
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,410
See you.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,340
Okay.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,850
Take care.

80
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,460
Lin!

81
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,530
Mr. Fu.

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,220
What brings you here?

83
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,900
I've been listening for a while.

84
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,220
Come on,

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,180
let's chat inside.

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,370
Long time no see.

87
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,340
Did you grow taller?

88
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,060
Here, have some tea.

89
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,650
Mr. Fu, I think
you should have some first.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,690
Otherwise, you won't

91
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,340
be able to hold back the anger
stirred up by those parents.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,530
You heard it all?

93
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,410
I'm noticing

94
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,740
this new batch of students

95
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,940
is really impressive.

96
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,090
They value truth and facts,

97
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,410
stand up for themselves,

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,620
and refuse to be wronged.

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,660
Kids these days

100
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,500
are getting tougher.

101
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,890
They're not as obedient

102
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,690
as you guys used to be,

103
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,770
though

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,940
you weren't

105
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,450
a rule-follower either.

106
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,860
These young students
are bigger headaches than you.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,810
Yet, I also spent

108
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,250
much time worrying about you back then.

109
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,570
Students are wayward in their own ways.

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,250
Mr. Fu, did you call me here

111
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,250
just to take a walk

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,370
down memory lane?

113
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,540
Of course not.

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,980
Let's talk some real business.

115
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,010
Have you made up your mind

116
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,980
about giving that speech?

117
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,420
Our school really needs

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,660
a top grad like you

119
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,620
to come back and help your juniors.

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,370
Tell them about

121
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,860
your college experience

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,770
at Capital University.

123
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,740
Give them some motivation

124
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,660
and cheer them on.

125
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:02,940
Now,

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,420
we need to push hard

127
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,860
on both academics and mindset.

128
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,810
Did you see

129
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,980
that troublemaker earlier?

130
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,010
I suspended her on the spot.

131
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,210
No one could talk me out of it.

132
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,810
Anyway, enough about that.

133
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,860
How've things been
for you at school lately?

134
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,250
I got suspended, too.

135
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,130
Drink your tea.

136
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,300
Not a single one of you is easy.

137
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,540
Are you serious?

138
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,250
Just drink.

139
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,300
Gu Xuejiao, I'm heading off.

140
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,740
Bye.

141
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,210
Bye.

142
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,450
No wonder Lin Zhihua

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,620
likes writing code

144
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,210
during part-time gigs

145
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,860
and memorizing vocab at work.

146
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,890
It's so efficient.

147
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,450
Hey, there,

148
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,690
is this Class 8 of Grade 12?

149
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,100
Yes.

150
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,370
Is Zhou Shiyun a homing pigeon?

151
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,500
She informs parents in no time.

152
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,690
Gu Xuejiao.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,330
Mom.

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,740
If…

155
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,890
If Zhou Shiyun's mom

156
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,540
hadn't told you,

157
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,420
you wouldn't even know

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,060
I caused such a mess at school.

159
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,570
She…

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,980
Mom,

161
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,250
I swear

162
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,660
I didn't lay a finger on anyone.

163
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,810
From beginning to end,

164
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,100
the only thing I did was

165
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,060
try to keep things from spiraling.

166
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,210
If you didn't touch anyone,

167
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,450
why didn't you tell us?

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,890
Why hide it from us?

169
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,770
Because I knew that

170
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,570
even if I told you

171
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,420
I didn't hurt anyone,

172
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,740
you'd still drag me

173
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,330
to apologize

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,250
like you're doing now.

175
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,130
You'd think that

176
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,420
saying sorry would smooth things over.

177
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,420
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

178
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,980
You should go and offer

179
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,810
an apology.

180
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,450
Understand?

181
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,570
A smile can disarm aggression.

182
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,690
Just humble yourself

183
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,690
a little.

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,980
It never hurts.

185
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,660
Mom,

186
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,770
how humble should I be?

187
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,620
Am I supposed to swallow my pride

188
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,370
and apologize to others

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,770
for something I didn't do?

190
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,130
And what

191
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,370
do we get out of that?

192
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,570
Expired drinks we can't even finish?

193
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,940
Xuejiao,

194
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,180
here, have a drink.

195
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,370
Why aren't you drinking?

196
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,100
She loves this.

197
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,330
But it's expired.

198
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,570
Or maybe their snobbish attitude?

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,690
Can you get her a job?

200
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,370
Any department.

201
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,620
Let her do some

202
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,330
odds and ends.

203
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,100
My husband's company runs a tight ship.

204
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,450
We may

205
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,690
address

206
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,540
each other as relatives,

207
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,330
but we're not related by blood.

208
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,370
I'm afraid

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,860
there's really nothing
my husband can do.

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,180
Hope you understand.

211
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,060
Xuejiao,

212
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,370
what's gotten into you?

213
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,210
If you keep this up,

214
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,180
how are you supposed to get along

215
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,100
with your classmates?

216
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm…

217
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,570
I'm doing this for your own good.

218
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,620
I don't need it.

219
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,660
Mom,

220
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,100
honestly, none of us need it.

221
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,420
Jiao!

222
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,740
Jiao, are you okay?

223
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,130
I knew it was a misunderstanding.

224
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,100
Auntie,

225
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,300
what brings you here?

226
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,210
It's fine, just a misunderstanding.

227
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,980
No need to worry so much.

228
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,180
Shiyun, you're always so considerate.

229
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,770
Help me talk some sense into Jiao.

230
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,740
Classmates will always
have little disagreements.

231
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,570
It's better to reduce
the trouble to a minimum,

232
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,060
right?

233
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,130
After all,

234
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,420
you're in Grade 12 now.

235
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,500
Studies come first,

236
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,180
right?

237
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,100
Auntie, don't worry.

238
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,860
I definitely will.

239
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,060
Speaking of which,

240
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,450
Jiao, I'm really concerned about you.

241
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,570
What's going on with you lately?

242
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,570
Your grades have dropped again.

243
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,860
You can't keep going on like this.

244
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,540
Last time,

245
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,450
you went home past midnight,

246
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,210
and I covered for you.

247
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,370
But honestly, I didn't feel…

248
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,180
Wait.

249
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,380
She went home past midnight?

250
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:32,970
No…

251
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,090
Auntie,

252
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,570
you didn't know about that?

253
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,570
Jiao,

254
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,610
I'm sorry.

255
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,330
- I…
- You…

256
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,300
Enough.

257
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,420
You should leave now.

258
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,300
Gu Xuejiao!

259
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,490
Sorry, Shiyun.

260
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,090
I need to talk

261
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,210
to Xuejiao about something private.

262
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,610
Why don't you head back first?

263
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,900
Don't make your mom worry.

264
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,970
Okay.

265
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,940
I shouldn't have said anything.

266
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,730
Auntie, please don't be mad.

267
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,020
Xuejiao didn't mean it.

268
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,330
I'll get going now.

269
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,490
You…!

270
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,450
Gu Xuejiao,

271
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,420
I knew you and Gu Mingze were

272
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,420
up to no good.

273
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,900
A girl your age,

274
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,020
staying out till
the middle of the night,

275
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,970
what were you doing?

276
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,060
Tell me the truth.

277
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,060
Mom,

278
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,900
just because Zhou Shiyun said something,

279
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,940
you're going to scold me again,

280
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,420
aren't you?

281
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,970
I've got nothing to say.

282
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,570
Fine.

283
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,850
If you're so tough,
then don't come home!

284
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,940
Honey, I might've

285
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,140
gone too far just now

286
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,090
with what I said to Xuejiao.

287
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,090
What should I do now?

288
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,210
We're leaving.

289
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,730
Bye.

290
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,210
Bye.

291
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,490
What are you doing here?

292
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,260
It's late.

293
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,330
I don't drink coffee at night.

294
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,570
It's hot chocolate.

295
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,450
My treat.

296
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,020
Thanks.

297
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,610
Weren't you off today?

298
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,210
What are you doing in the bookstore?

299
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,330
Didn't you go toe-to-toe

300
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,610
with a bunch of people this afternoon?

301
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,210
Why the sudden gloom?

302
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,690
How do you know about that?

303
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,090
I was at No. 7 High this afternoon

304
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,490
and overheard it.

305
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,540
So you know I got suspended?

306
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,690
It's just temporary.

307
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,810
Just wait for the truth to come out.

308
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,380
Gu Xuejiao,

309
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,660
do you remember your declaration
for the college entrance exam?

310
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,330
Of course I do.

311
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,940
You look so defeated.

312
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,610
I thought you forgot.

313
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,970
I may be bummed out,

314
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,060
but that won't stop me from getting
into Capital University.

315
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,420
You've been suspended.

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,570
How are you supposed to do that?

317
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,810
You're really rubbing it in

318
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,490
when I'm already down.

319
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,690
You've managed to get me on board.

320
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,540
What's impossible for you to achieve?

321
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,610
Bookstore's closing.

322
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,420
Let's go.

323
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,900
You go.

324
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,140
I'm crashing here tonight.

325
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,210
It's not safe here.

326
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:40,970
Come on,

327
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,210
I'm taking you somewhere.

328
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,060
Capital University?

329
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,680
[Capital University]

330
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,850
Why'd you bring me here?

331
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,090
Have you come here before?

332
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,020
Yeah.

333
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,940
When I worked,

334
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,730
I passed it every day.

335
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,570
What?

336
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,610
I mean…

337
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,970
I've never been inside.

338
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,180
I don't have a student ID.

339
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,450
All I can do is stare at the gates.

340
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,020
Come on.

341
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,540
This place is at least

342
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,450
twice as big as No. 7 High.

343
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,020
Is Capital University

344
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,210
three times bigger than No. 7 High?

345
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,330
Probably more.

346
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,210
Actually,

347
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,420
I wanted to check out the lab building.

348
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,210
I wanna see

349
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,210
where you usually have classes.

350
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,060
Once you get in,

351
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,730
you can wander freely.

352
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,330
How about a match?

353
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,570
I don't know how to play.

354
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,660
There are no rules.

355
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,970
If you score once,

356
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,570
I'll grant you one wish,

357
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,020
as long as it's legal.

358
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,210
Deal?

359
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,330
You serious?

360
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,780
The loser calls the winner Master.

361
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,420
Bag.

362
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,300
Drop the bag.

363
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,900
Come on.

364
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,780
Game on.

365
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,690
Can you do this?

366
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,380
Of course.

367
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,570
A strong woman never says no.

368
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,490
Don't have to go easy on me.

369
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,090
I can block you just by standing still.

370
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,300
What?

371
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,020
One more time?

372
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,260
Come on.

373
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,300
Try again.

374
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,260
Run a little.

375
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,090
This field's pretty big, huh?

376
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:24,730
Huge.

377
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,490
Try again.

378
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,570
Again.

379
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,210
I'm done.

380
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,690
You're a pro,

381
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,610
yet I'm an amateur.

382
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,850
I'm just a bookworm,

383
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,540
but even I know

384
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,610
playing basketball takes brains.

385
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,490
You should use yours, too.

386
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,450
I'm done. I'm going home.

387
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,940
Giving up that easily?

388
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,730
Careful!

389
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,140
I won!

390
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,610
You tricked me.

391
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,450
How's that tricking you?

392
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,420
Everyone dodges

393
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,330
out of instinct.

394
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,210
That's called playing smart.

395
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,970
I haven't said my wish yet.

396
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,330
Wasn't your wish to be called Master?

397
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,490
Let me hear you.

398
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,540
Master.

399
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,490
No.

400
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,540
Lin,

401
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,570
can you help me

402
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,570
talk to the school?

403
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,730
I really don't know what else to do.

404
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,210
You're so smart.

405
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,540
Please help me figure something out.

406
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,490
I'm basically your strategist now.

407
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,690
Capital University's field

408
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,330
is gorgeous,

409
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,690
but lying around like this

410
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,570
is gonna get us sick.

411
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,490
Can't you just enjoy your life?

412
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,730
Why do you cherish yourself so much?

413
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,970
Because someone once told me that

414
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,660
as long as I stay alive,

415
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,140
the tables will turn.

416
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,900
Which life coach shared

417
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,100
this insightful maxim with you?

418
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,970
Let me check

419
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,010
on your review progress.

420
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,580
[*Rhapsody on the Epang Palace]

421
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,660
"With the fall of the six kings,
the empire unified.

422
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,450
The mountains in Shu were denuded,
and the grand Epang Palace was built."

423
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,100
I really can recite it.

424
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,100
From Earth,

425
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,620
what's

426
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,380
the brightest planet
in the solar system?

427
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,290
Venus.

428
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,010
The heliocentric theory was established

429
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,690
in which century?

430
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,660
Sixteenth.

431
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,210
An astronaut throws a ball

432
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,290
of mass m

433
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,530
straight up on the moon.

434
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,490
The time

435
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,820
for the ball to return is t.

436
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,290
Given that the ratio of the moon's mass

437
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,530
to Earth's is p,

438
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,820
and the ratio of their radii is q,

439
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,660
with Earth's

440
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,730
gravitational acceleration being g,

441
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,900
what is the ball's

442
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,250
initial speed

443
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,450
when the astronaut

444
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,210
throws it upward?

445
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,380
V equals

446
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,380
pg divided by 2q².

447
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,620
One more question.

448
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,140
Do you have

449
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,770
anything harder?

450
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,900
Let me show you

451
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,450
what genuine

452
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,100
all-round development is like.

453
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,340
Tell me about the development
of cosmic evolution theory

454
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,050
in China.

455
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,730
Back in the Western Han dynasty,

456
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,970
Huainanzi: Activating the Genuine said…

457
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,660
It said…

458
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,250
It said…

459
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,940
Alright, alright.

460
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,290
You're

461
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,820
the real MVP

462
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,180
of all-round development.

463
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,620
Happy now?

464
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,490
Let's go.

465
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,450
Huainanzi: Activating the Genuine,

466
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,940
what's the quote?

467
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,660
I know!

468
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,490
Who?

469
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,340
Who's there?

470
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,940
Run.

471
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,290
Who's there?

472
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:40,770
Stop!

473
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,380
Huainanzi: Activating the Genuine said,

474
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,010
"The cosmos had a start.

475
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,820
It also had a phase

476
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,580
without a start.

477
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,010
And even before
that phase without a start,

478
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,820
there existed another state."

479
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,770
Did I get it right?

480
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,450
Yep.

481
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,970
Thanks

482
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,140
for tonight.

483
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,690
Although

484
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,420
I was a little down

485
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,820
from being wrongly accused,

486
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,180
nothing's gonna stop me

487
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,580
from aiming for Capital University.

488
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm off.

489
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,250
Where are you going?

490
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,210
Home.

491
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,180
Otherwise, my mom's

492
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,820
gonna think I ran away,

493
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,620
and she'll cry.

494
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,620
It's late. I'll walk you.

495
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,270
[Only 261 Days Remain
Before the College Entrance Exam]

496
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,210
[19 September, 2014]
Here's a question.

497
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,660
If FC is perpendicular to AB,

498
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,580
and we need the value
of the ellipse's eccentricity e,

499
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,100
then, tell me,

500
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,820
what method
should we employ to solve this?

501
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,530
Plug-in values.

502
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:02,970
Correct.

503
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,290
We will plug in values

504
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,450
to solve this.

505
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,490
First, we substitute point A

506
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,290
- into what?
- The ellipse equation.

507
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,140
Right.

508
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,860
That way, we know what?

509
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,050
That point A lies on the ellipse,

510
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,730
right?

511
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,050
Then what do we do?

512
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,690
We assign

513
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,860
KAQ

514
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,050
and KAP

515
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,660
as 1 and -1.

516
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,250
Sound right?

517
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,820
Next, what can we do?

518
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,730
We can set…

519
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,730
Why are you pushing yourself so hard?

520
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,970
Why do you come since you're suspended?

521
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,940
Got it?

522
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,100
If you have a similar problem next time,

523
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,490
solve it the same way.

524
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,530
The weather report just warned

525
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,210
of heavy rain.

526
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,690
Don't get soaked.

527
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,690
Okay.

528
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,140
Time for the sympathy play.

529
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,530
Let the storm come,
the bigger the better.

530
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,970
Now let's move on to the next one.

531
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,180
Let's check the next question.

532
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,940
It's…

533
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,770
It's number 14,

534
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,900
right?

535
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,340
What is the question?

536
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,450
It's about

537
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,210
five Olympic volunteers

538
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,140
who are randomly assigned

539
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,660
to four

540
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,100
different service posts,

541
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,420
with each post having

542
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,490
at least one volunteer.

543
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,140
Remember how

544
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,580
I told you to solve this

545
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,860
last time?

546
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,820
So where's the storm?

547
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,100
I'm sweating buckets in this raincoat.

548
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,100
What's the method?

549
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,770
Gu Xuejiao's parents

550
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,900
really don't care enough

551
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,100
about her studies.

552
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,250
Their kid got suspended,

553
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,290
and instead of coming themselves,

554
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,900
they sent you, the tutor,

555
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,770
to plead on their behalf.

556
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,140
Not educating a child well
is the father's fault.

557
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm her tutor, which makes me

558
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,580
like a father…

559
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,210
I mean, it's my fault.

560
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,100
Don't act like it's all on you.

561
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,050
Lin, let me tell you,

562
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,340
no one can sway this decision.

563
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,250
A student's job is to study,

564
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,860
and that's all No. 7 High cares about.

565
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,490
As long as I'm still

566
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,580
the Dean of Students here,

567
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,340
anything

568
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,730
that distracts students from learning

569
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,010
will be kicked out of this school.

570
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,770
Then let's go out.

571
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,860
Why?

572
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,820
I haven't been back in a while.

573
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,010
I'd like to walk around.

574
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,210
Spare me. Go on your own.

575
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,580
Come with me.

576
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,100
I'll have my tea.

577
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,770
What are you doing?

578
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:11,820
Come on.

579
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,940
Can't you enjoy staying alone?

580
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,420
Jeez.

581
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,050
This is nice.

582
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,050
Yi Tianyu.

583
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,940
Yi Tianyu?

584
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,490
Why are you there?

585
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,250
Do you understand?

586
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,860
I got it.

587
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,490
If you got it, then the whole class
probably does too.

588
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,100
Come on, tell me.

589
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,660
What method should we

590
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,660
use to solve

591
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,010
this very problem?

592
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,970
Been a while since you came back, huh?

593
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,970
Mr. Fu,

594
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,580
it's really hot today.

595
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,140
Sure is.

596
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,940
Why else would I wear short sleeves?

597
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,580
Why is this kid still

598
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,010
attending classes even while sick?

599
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,860
Eager to learn, that's all.

600
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,450
Mr. Fu.

601
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,900
How considerate am I!

602
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,010
I'm going to Capital University!

603
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,900
Why is this kid still

604
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,340
attending classes even while sick?

605
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,900
Eager to learn, that's all.

606
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,450
Bring over Gu Xuejiao from Class 8

607
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,970
of Grade 12.

608
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,080
[See You at the Summit
Today's Reading]

609
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,490
It's for you.

610
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,340
I'm good.

611
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,660
Well,

612
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,050
plans really can't
keep up with change.

613
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,180
I nearly roasted

614
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,050
out there.

615
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,250
So, tell me,

616
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,050
how'd it go?

617
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,940
Total victory, of course.

618
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,050
I'm allowed to return.

619
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,820
Congrats.

620
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,340
But the one who framed you

621
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,180
got off scot-free.

622
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,420
Does that sit right with you?

623
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,730
I thought you hated injustice most.

624
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,620
What's the point of beefing with a kid?

625
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,340
It'll drag me down to her level.

626
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,210
Aren't you a kid yourself?

627
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,660
Yeah.

628
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:00,970
Hey,

629
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,180
what's keeping you so busy?

630
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,420
Say what you want to say,

631
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,180
but keep your distance.

632
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,730
Thing is,

633
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,940
I need another favor.

634
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,730
I already got you reinstated,

635
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,490
and you still want more?

636
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,530
I was indeed reinstated,

637
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,290
but Mr. Fu added a condition.

638
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,380
He said

639
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,100
I must make it

640
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,180
into the top 100 in the next mock exam.

641
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,770
What?

642
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,970
Into what?

643
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,940
Into the top 100.

644
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,730
Lin,

645
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,450
don't go. Please help me out!

646
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,900
Don't try that same act
you pulled on Mr. Fu

647
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,530
with me.

648
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,530
Please sit down first.

649
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,690
Come on.

650
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,050
Sit down.

651
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,180
Show me

652
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,820
your last report card.

653
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,770
Hand it over.

Mr. Fu's

655
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,100

Read it.

657
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,210
I got 89 in Chinese

658
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,340
and 81 in English.

659
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,340
As for math,

660
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,450
well…

661
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,770
58.

662
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,140
That was because I got spooked

663
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,140
during the test,

664
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,770
and I totally blanked.

665
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,290
Second-to-last in the entire grade.

666
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,620
How many students
are there in your grade?

667
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,490
Four or five hundred?

668
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,770
Trust me.

669
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,770
Before Grade 11,

670
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,450
I was doing really great.

671
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,530
It's just that I got

672
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,620
a bit carried away
with all the distractions.

673
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,140
But I'm back on track now.

674

about your past glory.

680
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,940
It wasn't much to brag about anyway.

681
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,970
Have you really

682
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,530
never been beaten up

683
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,450
for being too mean?

684
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,250
You've got just over

685
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,450
three months before the first mock exam.

686
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,140
It's only possible if you can study 24/7

687
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,050
with no break,

688
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,970

and have photographic memory.

I'm not alone.

Buff.

694

You're gonna help me.

The clock is ticking,
and the task is daunting.

Polysaccharide.

724
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,250
And monosaccharides?

Isn't it obvious?

746
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,290
That's a history question.

747

Oh, history.

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,450
Her brother's pretty handsome, though.

766
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,420
Mind your own business.

767
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,340
I just wanted her to teach me.

768
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,010
I need to know how she managed

769
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,970
to keep you grinding

770
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,570
through the festival

771
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,450
while I can't even

772
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,780
get you to sit down

773
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,610
for a family dinner.

774
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,700
Your parents decided

775
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,650
to spend Chinese New Year in Hawaii,

776
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,010
and I got your ticket right here.

777
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,170
If you're not going,

778
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,130
come up with your own excuse.

779
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,940
The time difference is a pain.

780
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,860
Remote tutoring's not really doable.

781
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,220
So

782
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,530
you're skipping

783
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,740
the year-end party too?

784
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:51,820
What a coincidence.

785
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,700
I've already got plans.

786
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,610
Lin,

787
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,970
drop by for dinner

788
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,860
sometime before the festival.

789
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,050
A little thank-you feast.

790
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,740
You really are the full package

791
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,570
when it comes to helping her.

792
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,570
You got an express package.

793
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,650
Since when did you
start shopping online?

794
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,530
Why would you need a red sweater?

795
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,050
I've been tutoring
for free all this time.

796
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,450
She sent it to show

797
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,380
a little gratitude.

798

Thin skins and generous fillings.

801
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,170
It's the New Year.

802
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,780
I'm surely getting greeting messages.

803
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,570
Just let me take a look.

804
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,050
What?

805
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,900
Jackpot!

806
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,570
Lots of profits!

807
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,940
We're gonna be rich!

808
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,530
What profits?

809
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,050
My brother's

810
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,610
[Henglin Co., Ltd.6003134]
stock went up, what else?

811
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,260
What fits?

812
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:42,860
Oh, I get it.

813
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,260
The electric coil fits.

814
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,420
They must be doing a physics experiment.

815
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,820
How nice.

816
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,420
Water's boiling.
Let's cook the dumplings.

817
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,170
Okay.

818
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,090
Alright, everyone,

819
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,940
get ready.

820
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,610
Dinner's on, dumplings are coming!

821
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,050
Let me do it!

822
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,490
I'll hold the tray.

823
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,300
Go ahead.

824
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,490
Let them spin.

825
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,450
These dumplings are gonna be tasty.

826
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,420
New year, fresh start.

827
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,940
Luck is coming our way.

828
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,820
Take a chance,

829
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,340
we may win a jackpot.

830
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,010
Gu Xuejiao,

831
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,820
good times are coming our way.

832
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,090
Here we go!

833
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,380
Here are the dumplings!

834
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,260
Come on.

835
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,820
Here, dumplings!

836
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,650
Come on.

837
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,530
Careful.

838
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,380
You're never in a rush to study,

839
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,130
but when it comes to food,
you're first in line.

840
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,130
Did you scald yourself?

841
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,130
Our guest hasn't even tried one.

842
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,170
Have some drinks.

843
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,300
Cool off your mouth.

844
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,700
Lin,

845
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,090
you and Mingze

846
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,130
should have a drink with me.

847
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,700
How can you let kids have alcohol?

848
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,260
You really set a bad example.

849
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,010
It's okay.

850
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,490
I'll have some.

851
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,530
Good.

852
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,740
You…

853
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,780
Thanks, Uncle.

854
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,780
Don't mention it.

855
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,570
This bottle's been

856
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,820
aging for years.

857
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,260
Don't drink too much at once.

858
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,170
Alright then,

859
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,420
let's raise a glass.

860
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,130
Come on.

861
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,010
Today,

862
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,300
on behalf of the family,

863
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,860
I just want to thank Lin

864
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,130
for being

865
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,570
so dedicated to tutoring

866
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,700
the two of them all this time.

867
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,010
Thank you so much.

868
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,530
I'm not

869
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,570
great with words.

870
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,860
So, may you

871
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,860
eat well,

872
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,780
enjoy yourself,

873
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,820
and stay warm today.

874
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,450
Cheers!

875
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,490
Cheers!

876
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,530
Come on. Dig in!

877
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,490
Dad,

878
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,420
did you put a coin

879
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,570
in the dumplings today?

880
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,010
Whoever gets it will strike it rich.

881
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,900
You…

882
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,170
Oh, come on.

883
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,740
Your sister said

884
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,340
coins aren't hygienic,

885
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,900
so I went with peanuts today.

886
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,220
Peanut, peanut, luck's your strut!

887
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,090
Right?

888
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,650
Not bad!

889
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,260
I think I got one.

890
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,130
Me, too.

891
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,420
What about you?

892
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,220
I gotta get one, too.

893
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,700
Lin,

894
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,130
wishing you a year

895
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,220
filled with success

896
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,300
and luck.

897
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,340
Then I wish you

898
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,420
steady progress and smooth sailing

899
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,420
on your college entrance exam.

900
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:30,820
Mom,

901
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,940
I choked.

902
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,610
Go to the bathroom, quick.

903
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:34,900
Go!

904
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,650
No.

905
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,420
I just ate too much

906
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,050
and got bloated.

907
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,940
I'll take a walk downstairs.

908
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,050
Alright then. Go ahead.

909
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,340
It's that, uh,

910
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,130
amylase

911
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,170
or something.

912
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,530
Alright, enough.

913
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,130
You have food in your mouth.

914
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,090
Don't bite your tongue.

915
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,090
I'm off, bye!

916
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,050
Silly kid.

917
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,090
Here, Lin,

918
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,700
try some of this fish.

919
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,340
Give it a taste.

920
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,820
Thanks.

921
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,530
Hey, big-time designer Gu.

922
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,900
How'd you know I'm here?

923
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,610
You were spotted and posted.

924
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,340
Come on, let's go.

925
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,170
Come on.

926
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,610
Hey!

927
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:42,970
Don't drag my mentor away!

928
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,490
Mr. Fu.

929
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,780
You're going home anyway!

930
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,970
Lin, what are you doing here?

931
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,010
Happy New Year, Mr. Fu.

932
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,340
It's the holiday,

933
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,530
so I'm having fun here.

934
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,570
What a coincidence.

935
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,900
Someone just sent me

936
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,900
an anonymous text saying

937
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,570
a student from our school

938
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,130
is hanging out in this internet bar.

939
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,490
Why is Mr. Fu here?

940
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,700
How would I know?

941
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,420
I was just eating nearby

942
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,450
with my wife and kid.

943
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,610
That student is really unlucky.

944
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,130
Come on.

945
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,490
Let's catch him red-handed.

946
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,380
Mr. Fu.

947
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,700
What now?

948
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,650
You…

949
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,260
Just watch for my cue.

950
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,740
Stay sharp.

951
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,300
Where are you going?

952
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,740
About

953
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,820
that speech at school,

954
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,900
I want to give it another shot.

955
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,610
Didn't you

956
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,650
turn me down last time?

957
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,780
Changed your mind?

958
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,780
What?

959
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,260
What is it?

960
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,780
How can this kid be so reckless?

961
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,300
Is this a flyer?

962
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,300
I don't even play this stuff.

963
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,130
Stop!

964
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,450
You walk so fast.

965
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,530
Why do you look so familiar?

966
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,010
Are you from No. 7 High?

967
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,570
Yeah.

968
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,610
No.

969
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,170
You changed your words.

970
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,300
Spill it.

971
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,780
Which grade, and which class?

972
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,650
Uh…

973
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,970
I've already graduated.

974
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,490
Graduated?

975
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,420
Then it's okay.

976
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,820
By the way,

977
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,450
which university are you at now?

978
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,300
Homeis College in the UK.

979
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:31,860
Homeis College?

980
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,450
Yeah, exactly.

981
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,380
