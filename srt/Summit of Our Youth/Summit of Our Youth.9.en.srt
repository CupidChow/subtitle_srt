00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,450
Maybe we should just skip this meal.

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,810
The big exam just finished,

19
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,650
it's a critical time
to choose universities.

20
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,860
This is adding

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,780
more pressure on the kids,

22
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,290
isn't it?

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,650
But they're already here.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,450
Li's been sighing and worrying

25
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,010
these past few days.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,290
She won't tell me anything.

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:55,890
So I thought,

28
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,980
why not invite

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,250
her whole family over

she's not stressed.

No need to rush back.

They're not really important guests.

he can't make it back.

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,340
He asked me

42
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,970
to take good care

43
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,740

Come on, everyone dig in.

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,970
I specially ordered

52
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,020
these dishes from a big restaurant.

53
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,940
Try this boiled cabbage soup,

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,340
it's their signature dish.

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,130
Didn't want to trouble Li with all this.

56
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,530

57
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,810
Thanks.

Li.

60
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,690
I... I'll go get it.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,220
Auntie Wanjun,

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,740
the boiled cabbage soup

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,780
should have a rich, flavorful broth,

64
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,690
taste fresh and light,

65
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,130
not oily or greasy at all.

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,810
But look at this one,

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,570
there's a layer of fat on top.

68
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,180
It's obviously not made
from fresh stock.

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,650
What kind of restaurant is this?

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,900
Even my mom's soup

71
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,060
tastes better than this.

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,650
Right, Dad?

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,460
Exactly.

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,810
Were you ripped off?

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,650
Li.

76
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,020
Take this dish away.

77
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:16,970
Okay.

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,250
I'll do it, Mom.

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,130
Xuejiao.

80
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,810
How did you do on the exam?

81
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,180
So that's what this is really about.

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,530
Not great.

83
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,810
Missed by a dozen points.

84
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,300
That's such a shame!

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,220
Missing the first-tier
cut-off by just a bit

86
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,180
is the worst.

87
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,650
Can't get into
a good second-tier university,

88
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,020
but a bad one doesn't

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,570
feel worth it either.

90
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,130
What a pity.

91
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,940
But

92
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,220
you could always choose

93
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,250
a decent third-tier one.

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,690
Shiyun,

95
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,460
give her some advice.

96
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,940
Choosing a college

97
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,020
is no small matter.

98
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,850
No problem.

99
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,940
Xuejiao is...

100
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,130
My husband really

101
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,970
paid good money

102
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,810
to hire

103
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,300
a college application consultant.

104
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,370
And we settled

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,900
on the Veritas University.

106
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,020
It felt like a huge weight

107
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,340
off my chest.

108
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,940
You know,

109
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,850
the college entrance exam is one of the

110
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,970
most important life decisions.

111
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,410
Better to play it safe,

112
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:11,970
right?

113
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,530
Right.

114
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,220
Xuejiao,

115
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,060
any third-tier schools

116
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,620
you're interested in?

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,300
Actually,

118
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,620
I'm a dozen points short

119
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,300
of Capital University's usual cutoff.

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,420
Six hundred...?

121
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,690
Six hundred and seventy-nine.

122
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,570
Shiyun.

123
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,890
You must've done better

124
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,450
than my sister.

125
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,770
By how much?

126
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,500
Yeah.

127
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,180
By...

128
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,010
Mom,

129
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,540
I'll go change clothes.

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,690
You're such a disappointment.

131
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,860
I worked so hard

132
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,100
to raise you all these years,

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,450
and you can't even outscore her.

134
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,300
The only thing

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,420
you can be thankful for now

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,210
is that with her score,

137
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,250
she won't get into

138
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,250
Capital University.

139
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,940
And their family's flat broke,

140
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,570
can't afford to let her
repeat senior year.

141
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,540
Why are you hiding here?

142
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,660
Everyone disappeared,

143
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,690
I couldn't eat all alone.

144
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,940
You were clearly enjoying

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,370
your food.

146
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,010
I just couldn't stand

147
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,690
sitting at that table anymore.

148
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,300
Didn't you notice?

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,690
Feels like Auntie Wanjun's

150
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,500
trying to compete with us.

151
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,450
Bro,

152
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,540
you're only realizing that now?

153
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,570
Are you

154
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,810
a little bit too slow

155
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,420
on the uptake?

156
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,060
But why?

157
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,890
They live in a big fancy villa.

158
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,250
Why compare it

159
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,540
to our tiny, shabby house?

160
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,250
Oh, you have no idea.

161
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,810
Our Mom was amazing

162
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,570
when she was young.

163
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,450
Auntie Wanjun was

164
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,660
nowhere near her level.

165
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,330
She may have a comfortable life now,

166
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,570
but deep down, she's still insecure.

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,940
Some people

168
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,860
never grow out of their mean-girl phase.

169
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,980
No way.

170
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,420
If Mom was really

171
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,620
that awesome back then,

172
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,180
how did she end up marrying Dad?

173
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,620
Mom

174
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,500
clearly had a bad judgment.

175
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,300
And now,

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,740
that's been passed down to you.

177
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,570
You are even worse.

178
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,100
Bad judgment?

179
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,250
Mine's better than yours.

180
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,690
You're just jealous of me.

181
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,660
Shiyun.

182
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,130
You look even better in this outfit.

183
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,180
Thanks.

184
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,300
Li.

185
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,300
Why didn't you stop Xuejiao?

186
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,330
No way she's getting

187
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,810
into Capital University with that score.

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,060
What a waste

189
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,620
of such a good score.

190
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,890
That girl's stubborn

191
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,210
like a mule.

192
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,420
We just

193
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,370
hope Yun can grow

194
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,740
in a well-rounded way.

195
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,010
We don't count on her

196
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,940
to support us

197
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,980
in the future.

198
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,980
She applied to the Veritas University

199
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,770
out of personal interest.

200
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,100
We don't really expect her

201
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,010
to drag the whole family up.

202
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,300
It was my own decision.

203
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,940
My parents didn't say a word.

204
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,450

205
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,620
Of course not.

206

It's already submitted.

207
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,060
Then, what should we do?

208
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,620
Isn't it too late?

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,370
What now?

210

Put down your phone, this is serious.

211
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,420
She can always repeat the year

212
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,540
and score higher next year.

217

218
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,890

219

It's not necessarily

220
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,770
impossible.

This area carried
many people's memories...

253
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,330
I got the digital version

Seven apartments.

Didn't the agreement

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,610
I told you I'm not coming back.

389
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,730
Come on.

390
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,660
If not for your Mom or Dad,

391
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,850
do it for me.

392
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,380
Just help keep the peace for a bit,

393
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,970
okay?

394
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,730
You know how it is.

395
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,660
I might be part of your Dad's camp,

396
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,300
but I'm basically working for your Mom.

397
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,380
If they fall out,

398
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,810
I'll be the first casualty.

399
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,660
I really don't know what else to do.

400
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,260
Hello? Petal?

401
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,900
Hello?

402
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,810
Cold-blooded.

403
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,940
Who was it?

404
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,180
She...

405
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,900
Worry about yourself first.

406
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,450
Do take your meds.

407
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,210
When are we

408
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,570
getting the results?

409
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,220
[Admission Results for 2015
Jinghai College Entrance Exam]

410
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,680
[Not Yet Available]

411
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,810
Hello, Tiantian?

412
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,730
Xuejiao.

413
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,060
I just uncovered

414
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,020
Lin's big secret.

415
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,140
Lin's big secret?

416
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,900
Hold on.

417
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,330
Here's what happened.

418
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,380
I was browsing online

419
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,330
at home yesterday,

420
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,330
guess what I found?

421
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,970
A super fancy dessert shop

422
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,540
just opened in Jinghai.

423
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,490
So, I went to check it out.

424
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,810
Guess what I found again?

425
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,180
It was really delicious.

426
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,570
But I also felt like my skills

427
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,730
were totally on par.

428
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,940
So, I made a decision,

429
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,380
forget the college entrance exam,

430
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,970
I wanna become

431
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,090
an amazing pastry chef.

432
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,570
Stop!

433
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,780
Tiantian.

434
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,540
First,

435
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,490
congrats,

436
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,610
you found your true passion.

437
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,490
Thanks.

438
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,850
But what's it got to do

439
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,610
with Lin's secret?

440
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,780
About Lin.

441
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,690
When I was at that dessert shop,

442
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,730
I saw him getting

443
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,850
into a rich lady's car.

444
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,450
Rich lady?

445
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,660
You sure?

446
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,180
I followed them all the way.

447
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,180
100% sure.

448
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,210
And my eyes

449
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,180
aren't near-sighted.

450
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,810
Maybe they're just friends?

451
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,180
But she patted him on the back,

452
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,450
how's that 'just friends'?

453
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,140
Oh, no, cr*p.

454
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,490
What?

455
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,300
The man of the house is back!

456
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,060
The...

457
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,260
What's going on?

458
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm leaving you!

459
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,610
They're fighting!

460
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,610
Fight...

461
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,810
Say something, would you?

462
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,260
We can talk,

463
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,420
don't break stuff.

464
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,380
Put that down.

465
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,210
Do you even know what that is?

466
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,610
That's expensive!

467
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,140
All the more reason I'm smashing it!

468
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,780
Xuejiao, come here.

469
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,380
What's going on? Which house?

470
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,420
That one?

471
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,810
I swear

472
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,570
I didn't get it wrong.

473
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,380
6'1, long legs,

474
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,020
pale skin, curling his lip,

475
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,140
glasses, serious husband vibes.

476
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,140
And turns out he's also a gold-digger!

477
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,420
You might as well say his name.

478
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,090
You sure it's him?

479
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,780
Really?

480
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,900
Look.

481
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,380
Absolutely him.

482
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,850
Yeah.

483
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,970
You got anything else to say,

484
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,140
say it now

485
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,450
before our son comes down.

486
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,690
I just hate it when you're

487
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,970
smashing things!

488
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,850
So ignorant!

489
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,330
I just bought this beautiful pair

490
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,140
of porcelain pieces.

491
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,210
Now one's gone,

492
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,540
the set's ruined!

493
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,330
You know that?

494
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,810
This is marital property,

495
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,660
I'm entitled to half.

496
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,570
Just think

497
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,780
I smashed my half.

498
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,810
Fine.

499
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,940
You want half, huh?

500
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,300
I'll give you your half.

501
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,610
What are you doing?

502
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,940
You said half.

503
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,690
Put it down. Don't!

504
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,730
Your half, my half!

505
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,810
Your half, my half!

506
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,900
Your half, my half!

507
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,140
Your half, my half!

508
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,210
My half, your half!

509
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,780
My half...

510
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,490
You happy now?

511
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,210
You psycho!

512
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,730
Hope Lin doesn't get beaten to death...

513
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,420
I'll go check.

514
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,140
What?

515
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,020
I don't think it's a good idea.

516
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,420
Technically it's Lin's fault.

517
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,420
If we show up now,

518
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,260
they might think

519
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,420
we're his backup.

520
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,180
They may beat us

521
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,020
with him.

522
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,900
But we gotta help him.

523
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,580
Sorry!

524
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,530
I'm not with him!

525
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,820
I'm not here to help him!

526
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,730
Lin?

527
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,250
What are you doing here?

528
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,660
I... Tiantian called me. She...

529
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,730
Where's she?

530
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,660
Doesn't matter.

531
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,420
I'm relieved to see you

532
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,210
alive and well.

533
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,250
Let's go. It's dangerous here.

534
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,940
I live here.

535
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,690
What's so dangerous?

536
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,490
Live here?

537
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,010
How could you lie to me

538
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,100
and bail!

539
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,450
I'm sorry.

540
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,940
Tiantian made a mistake.

541
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,660
I already gave her a warning.

542
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,340
Thanks for the cake.

543
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,010
Eat it and get going.

544
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,450
What's the rush?

545
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,140
We love it

546
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,490
when Petal brings friends home.

547
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,490
You know,

548
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,900
it's his first time

549
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,690
bringing someone over.

550
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,490
What do you

551
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,490
like to eat?

552
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,820
I will

553
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,940
have the chef

554
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,970
make us a feast,

555
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,660
we can have dinner together, alright?

556
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,530
Actually,

557
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,340
we live overseas

558
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,660
most of the time.

559
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,620
We're only here for a short while today.

560
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,140
We've got something else

561
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,100
to get to later.

562
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,900
Where do you live?

563
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,900
I'll have Petal drive you home.

564
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,730
She's a student at No. 7 High.

565
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,420
I tutored her a few times.

566
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,690
Yes.

567
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,290
I just finished
my college entrance exam,

568
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,380
happened to

569
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,010
bump into Lin today.

570
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,730
Intergenerational friendship.

571
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,940
She's only,

572
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,100
what,

573
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,530
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
years younger than Petal,

574
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,660
right?

575
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,940
Besides, he's got

576
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,660
a baby face.

577
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,690
You could pass him off

578
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,860
as a college freshman,

579
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,290
people would believe that.

580
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,180
Yeah.

581
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,900
Tell me,

582
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,690
which university are you applying to?

583
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,140
Capital University.

584
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,620
Really?

585
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,420
Capital University?

586
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,620
That's our Petal's school!

587
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,820
You'll be

588
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,100
his junior then!

589
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,690
Wait,

590
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,450
didn't we take a photo

591
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,900
with Petal at the university's gate

592
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,100
when we took him

593
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,940
to check in?

594
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,450
Yeah.

595
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,100
Hon, go get the photo album.

596
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,340
- Go.
- Okay.

597
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,900
How did you get here?

598
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,290
I'll get you a taxi.

599
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,010
I'm fine with any way.

600
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,290
Let me just finish
looking at Petal's photos.

601
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,820
Here.

602
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,340
Look.

603
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,970
That's him.

604
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,530
He had such big eyes as a kid.

605
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,530
Isn't he cute?

606
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,050
This one is my favorite.

607
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,730
Look,

608
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,970
the tears on his face.

609
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,420
So adorable.

610
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,180
Just say you need to get somewhere.

611
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,140
Don't worry.

612
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,620
I won't remember a thing
once I leave here.

613
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,660
Petal.

614
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,340
Don't talk to a girl

615
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,380
like that.

616
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,290
Be gentle,

617
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,530
smile a little.

618
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,420
I'm used to it.

619
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,940
He always has that poker face

620
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,100
when tutoring me.

621
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,450
He's indeed

622
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,620
really serious now,

623
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,970
doesn't smile much.

624
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,730
This one.

625
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,340
It was from the day

626
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,490
he enrolled in Capital University.

627
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,340
His dad and I,

628
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,140
we went there

629
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,290
with him.

630
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,050
Look at you,

631
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,250
a happy family.

632
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,970
If there's one thing about our family,

633
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,450
it's that we're very close.

634
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:13,970
Yeah.

635
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,900
I'll get you a tissue.

636
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,010
This is...

637
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,970
A limited edition.

638
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,450
Right.

639
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,100
A limited edition.

640
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,420
Yes...

641
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,290
Are you taking a photo?

642
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,940
No.

643
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,450
I hit the flash accidentally.

644
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,100
Oh, Lin,

645
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,820
we're going camping at Mount Jun

646
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,420
for our graduation trip.

647
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,450
Do you wanna join us?

648
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,730
I probably won't be available then.

649
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,860
Honestly, you really should learn

650
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,050
to relax a little.

651
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,970
You always look so serious.

652
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,050
And when you're home, you...

653
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,530
I'll have to play along with them.

654
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,450
Lin,

655
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,860
let me take a picture of you.

656
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,380
Why all of a sudden?

657
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,660
You're frowning in every single photo

658
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,860
I've seen today.

659
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,010
Not a single smile.

660
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,250
Let me take one for you.

661
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,140
Come on, smile.

662
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,490
Three, two, one.

663
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,690
Cheese.

664
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,530
Cheese.

665
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,380
Will a smile kill you?

666
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,420
Maybe I'm born this way.

667
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,530
Well, then don't blame me for this...

668
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,290
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

669
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,290
Tickle, tickle!

670
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,380
Enough.

671
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,660
You're such a child.

672
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,490
If you still don't smile,

673
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,770
I'm going to the supermarket

674
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,860
and buy you two kilos of litchi.

675
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,050
What does that mean?

676
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,860
At a horse raising red dust
the imperial concubine smiled;

677
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,360
No one knew it was

678
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,450
for the 'Lin Zhi' it had brought.
[* Originally 'litchi fruit']

679
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,250
Snap.

680
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,940
There you go.

681
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,860
You look good when you smile.

682
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,140
Alright, are you happy now?

683
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,770
Let's go.

684
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,940
See? Doesn't it look good?

685
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,250
'Lin Zhi' it brought.

686
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,250
Lin Zhihua.

687
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,970
Look,

688
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,860
I took a great shot.

689
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,770
Spill it.

690
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,530
Who were you secretly dating

691
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,180
behind my back?

692
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,940
What date?

693
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,820
I went home.

694
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,860
Got you some medicine and a thermometer.

695
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,490
Home?

696
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,050
If you really went home,

697
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,970
why do you look so love-struck?

698
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,420
Whatever, just take your temperature.

699
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,420
I'm already getting better.

700
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,340
No need for medicine.

701
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,180
You know what,

702
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,180
I'm so fired up

703
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,530
thinking about

704
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,900
the upcoming exchange meeting.

705
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,250
All the attendees are

706
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,420
important people.

707
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,690
And the venue is

708
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,730
Mount Jun Hotel.

709
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,420
Fresh air, elegant surroundings,

710
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,210
perfect for me to recover.

711
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,490
Wait, Mount Jun?

712
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,140
Yeah.

713
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,620
Tempted?

714
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,100
Wait,

715
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,420
Lin,

716
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,290
stand still, stop moving.

717
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,820
You're making me dizzy.

718
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,290
Let me see the thermometer.

719
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,900
Thirty-nine degrees?

720
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,210
Your fever's worse.

721
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,290
Told you to take medicine.

722
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,050
I'm fine. I can still fight.

723
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,860
Forget it.

724
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,860
You need to rest now.

725
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,340
Group fight! Open the ult!

726
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,290
Gu Mingze.

727
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,580
Can you give us a hand?

728
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,690
Push the tower! Push!

729
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,620
Do you even know how to play?

730
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,580
I'm telling you,

731
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,530
men are totally unreliable

732
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,490
in crucial moments like this.

733
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,250
Ain't that the truth.

734
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,050
I'm here.

735
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,690
Bro,

736
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,340
how can you be late
to the event you organized?

737
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,250
I stayed up late last night.

738
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,010
Let me do it...

739
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,730
I can't believe you!

740
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,530
Xuejiao and I have been

741
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,530
working for ages.

742
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,450
You take care of this.

743
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,290
Let Xuejiao rest.

744
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,690
Why'd you bring such a huge bag?

745
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,490
Your makeup kit?

746
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,620
I brought snacks for Xuejiao.

747
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,290
Thanks on her behalf.

748
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,770
This won't do.

749
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,900
The door won't shut.

750
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,900
Take this out then.

751
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,660
Take that out.

752
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,940
What?

753
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,900
That fell on my foot.

754
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,210
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

755
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,490
You alright?

756
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,580
I'm fine.

757
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,180
Sorry, I'm late.

758
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,860
Hi, Shiyun.

759
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,490
Here, give me that.

760
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,580
I think I broke this bag.

761
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,140
Have you been waiting long?

762
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:27,900
No...

763
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,210
You're right on time.

764
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,900
Hey, wait.

765
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,730
Careful.

766
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,940
Why did your brother bring her here?

767
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,180
He even got a driver's license

768
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,250
just for her.

769
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,690
My suitcase is a bit heavy.

770
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,490
It's packed.

771
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,820
Need me to help?

772
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,180
No.

773
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,450
Piece of cake.

774
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,340
Alright.

775
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,010
Go sit at the back.

776
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,100
I called it first.

777
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,380
Why bother with all that?

778
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,380
Thanks.

779
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,050
Go over there.

780
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,180
I've got these two huge bags.

781
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,530
Let's go...

782
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,900

00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,340
Here are our latest projects.

795
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,010
Excuse me,

796
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,420
this is an exchange meeting,

797
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,580
no insurance sales allowed.

798
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,420
I'm not selling insurance.

799
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,660
I'm from Capital University.

800
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,900
No universities are allowed
to sell here.

801
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,730
Sorry,

802
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,010
he's with me.

803
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,210
Okay, sorry about that.

804
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,420
Hello.

805
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,820

807
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,140
Could I have five minutes to

808
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,900
briefly introduce

809
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,970
our latest research results?

810
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,580
Sorry,

811
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,690
I don't know tech.

812
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,970
Just tell me

813
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,420
what's the return on investment.

814
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,860
You've asked the right person!

815
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,210
Our ROI

816
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,940
is about...

817
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,970
is...

818
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,420
um...

819
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,420
I'm calculating.

820
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,180
Here's my card.

821
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,010
Contact me when you're done.

822
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,420
Thank you.

823
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,580
Tianyu, where are you?

824
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,970
Finally!

825
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,900
Come on, friends!

826
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,690
The sky is so blue!

827
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,450
Qi Lei!

828
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,180
White clouds!

829
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,940
Coming!

830
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,900
Green grass!

831
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,450
Coming!

832
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,050
Look.

833
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,620
You brought a camera?

834
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,450
Of course.

835
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,900
When we take photos later,

836
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,140
stand close to Gu Xuejiao.

837
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,100
Qi Lei,

838
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,900
you brought a camera?

839
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,180
Yeah, of course.

840
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,450
How about

841
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,530
we take a photo

842
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,450
to remember our senior year?

843
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,100
Okay, let's go!

844
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,820
Your second senior year.

845
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,660
Let's go!

846
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,580
Go...

847
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,250
My classmates and I

848
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,250
have been playing

849
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,340
your Roller Blast all summer.

850
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,180
Shiyun knows what's good.

851
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,490
Heard that?

852
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,580
Take the photo.

853
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,340
Alright,

854
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,450
Qi Lei, go in a bit.

855
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,290
Get your pose ready.

856
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:00,970
Ten seconds.

857
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,820
Are you happy?

858
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,380
Happy!

859
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,200
[Xuejiao: The journey is beautiful,
but the destination is just as thrilling.]

860
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,620
Zhihua, what are you looking at?

861
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,450
Nothing.

862
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,290
How's it going?

863
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,420
Seems like our Capital University

864
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,660
is not famous enough.

865
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,620
They all ignored me.

866
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,250
I was in there for half a day,

867
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,770
and I only got this one card.

868
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
[General Manager Zhao Qiansun
Junlian Investment Co., Ltd.]

869
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,420
Junlian Investment?

870
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,140
You know them?

871
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,050
Heard of them.

872
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,450
Hello, Dr. Cai.

873
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,450
We'd like to cooperate with you.

874
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,180
That's the CTO of B&C Motors.

875
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,010
A very impressive person.

876
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,010
Thank you.

877
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,730
If he could take

878
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,820
an interest in our project,

879
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,180
we're set for good.

880
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,250
Thank you.

881
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,770
Again, for the record,

882
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,860
B&C Motors is seeking

883
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,660
more advanced

884
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,210
and innovative partners.

885
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,210
But I believe it's not just

886
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,140
a multinational company

887
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,210
focused solely

888
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,970
on technology.

889
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,900
Right, Dr. Cai?

890
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,970
I think

891
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,860
autonomous driving isn't only

892
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,690
about overcoming tech barriers.

893
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,210
It also involves many

894
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,620
social and legal issues.

895
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,900
We must also consider them

896
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,940
while solving

897
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,820
technical problems.

898
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,620
Good.

899
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,690
I'm listening.

900
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,140
Our lab has developed

901
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,250
a brand-new C1 system,

902
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,490
which allows cars to collect data

903
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,770
about their surroundings

904
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,450
through cameras and other sensors.

905
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,660
We've also started

906
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,820
to teach the machines

907
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,290
how to perform tasks

908
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,420
as excellently as humans do.

909
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,250
Great.

910
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,900
Here's my card.

911
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,770
Thank you.

912
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,900
If you have time later,

913
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,490
we can talk more in detail.

914
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,380
Thank you, everybody.

915
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,490
Go.

916
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,490
Dr. Cai.

917
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,580
Great.

918
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,770
Just wait.

919
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,210
I'll let you all taste my cooking.

920
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,660
I promise it'll be unforgettable.

921
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,970
I'm the head chef today.

922
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,970
No one's taking my place.

923
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,420
Cut the bragging.

924
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,010
I'm now an official apprentice

925
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,100
at the dessert shop.

926
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,210
You can't compete with me.

927
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,380
You made all these?

928
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,860
Yeah.

929
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,970
You're awesome.

930
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,490
You made this?

931
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,660
Yeah. Do you like it?

932
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,580
You made this?

933
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,620
I think I'm getting close.

934
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:06,940
Tianyu,

935
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,730
you see that raised tent peg

936
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,900
next to

937
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,490
Gu Xuejiao?

938
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,970
When you go over there later,

939
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,770
step on it on purpose.

940
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,940
Good idea.

941
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,900
Lin.

942
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,010
You came?

943
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,690
Why did he come here?

944
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,770
No idea.

945
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,690
Lin.

946
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,770
Hello.

947
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,690
Morning!

948
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,380
This place is nice.

949
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,770
No.

950
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,420
Hello, Lin.

951
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,220
Hello to you too.

952
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,610
You two...

953
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,050
look good.

954
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,900
Lin.

955
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,050
Why did you come here?

956
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,090
I...

957
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,050
I have an academic conference nearby,

958
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,940
the resort hotel is just next door.

959
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,860
What a coincidence.

960
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,900
You should join us.

961
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,780
Okay.

962
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,570
Okay, good.

963
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,300
Join us.

964
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,130
Let's go.

965
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,340
Yi Tianyu, fix that.

966
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,490
Help me with the skewers.

967
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,130
Okay.

968
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,610
Welcome, Lin!

969
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,300
How did you...

970
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,610
Okay...

971
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,570
Seriously?

972
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,610
Interesting.

973
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,740
Fix that.

974
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,700
Lin.

975
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,570
I also baked some cupcakes.

976
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,340
When you go over there later,

977
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,970
step on it on purpose.

978
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,570
Qi Lei!

979
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,530
Me too?

980
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,610
What about this?

981
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,940
This...

982
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,260
I'll do the grill.

983
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,050
Let me help you with that.

984
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,490
Watch closely.

985
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,170
This is a single take.

986
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,130
Your parents left some papers here

987
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,130
when they left.

988
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,340
I'll get them and go.

989
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,900
Definitely won't touch your stuff.

990
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,700
See?

991
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,860
This is it.

992
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,220
Petal.

993
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,610
Are you keeping a dog in the guest room?

994
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,380
Or

995
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,130
I might just run into a thief.

996
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,050
Oh, right,

997
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,010
a classmate of mine has a fever

998
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,490
and is isolating at my place

999
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,900
to avoid infecting others.

1000
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,740
Wear a mask when you go in.

1001
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,090
Classmate?

1002
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,340
Am I

1003
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,610
seeing things?

1004
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,970
Goddess.

1005
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,420
Goddess.

1006
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,050
Don't go.

1007
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,940
Don't go.

1008
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,050
Here...

1009
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,380
Eat while it's hot.

1010
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,970
Looks delicious!

1011
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,450
Careful, it's hot.

1012
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,340
Come on, dig in.

1013
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,260
- Dig in.
- Thanks.

1014
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,820
Clothes really do make the man.

1015
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,700
Lin looks even more handsome

1016
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,650
in this outfit.

1017
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,780
What a poser.

1018
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,490
Try it.

1019
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,780
Pretty good, huh?

1020
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,420
Yeah.

1021
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,820
Then hang the rope

1022
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,530
and the lights.

1023
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,490
I'll help you.

1024
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,450
Here.

1025
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,450
Are you done?

1026
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,820
The light.

1027
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,650
Okay.

1028
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,650
Here, let me.

1029
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,740
Wrap it up!

1030
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,450
Skewers are ready.

1031
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,450
Oh, coming.

1032
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,610
I need to make a quick call.

1033
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,170
Looks good.

1034
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,860
Lin.

1035
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,530
We've got guests in our room.

1036
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,900
When will you be back?

1037
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,650
Other than Dr. Cai from B&C Motors,

1038
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,610
don't approach

1039
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,610
any other investors yet.

1040
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,740
Words spread fast among investors.

1041
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,380
Let's secure B&C first.

1042
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,570
You sure?

1043
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,610
Yes.

1044
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,610
They're showing strong interest

1045
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,260
in our project.

1046
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,450
I know what I'm doing.

1047
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,490
Alright, got it.

1048
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,740
You mentioned earlier that

1049
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,610
ROI matters most

1050
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,490
to you, right?

1051
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:27,940
Yes.

1052
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,010
My senior just sent me

1053
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,650
the formula.

1054
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,010
How about this?

1055
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,940
You head back first.

1056
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,820
I'll reach out to you

1057
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,820
after I calculate it.

1058
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,490
Okay.

1059
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,010
Okay.

1060
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,090
Here, let me walk you out.

1061
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,820
Come on, eat while it's hot.

1062
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,940
Impressive!

1063
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,260
I think you've got real talent

1064
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,970
in cooking.

1065
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,220
Of course.

1066
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,050
Got the seasoning

1067
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,940
just right.

1068
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,300
Where's Gu Xuejiao?

1069
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,490
She went to the restroom.

1070
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,050
Zhou Shiyun went earlier too.

1071
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,740
I wonder if they ran into each other.

1072
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,260
It's about to rain.

1073
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,900
Did they bring umbrellas?

1074
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,010
This morning, the CMO

1075
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,700
continued issuing

1076
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,260
a Yellow Alert
for severe convective weather

1077
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,900
and a Blue Alert for heavy rain,

1078
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,860
accompanied by widespread

1079
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,170
short-term downpours,

1080
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,420
thunderstorms, strong winds,

1081
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,300
or hail.

1082
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,490
Xuejiao,

1083
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,450
you really applied
to Capital University?

1084
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,970
I've submitted my application.

1085
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,740
Why would I lie?

1086
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,490
No way you'll make it

1087
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,650
with your score.

1088
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,900
You just wanna spite me.

1089
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,900
What if you don't

1090
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,900
make the cut-off

1091
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,900
and fail?

1092
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,740
That's not worth it.

1093
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,610
To spite you?

1094
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,740
You got it all wrong.

1095
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,820
I never

1096
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,130
even saw you

1097
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,170
as competition.

1098
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,420
You know why?

1099
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,260
Because

1100
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,780
my eyesight's poor,

1101
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,300
I can't see petty people.

1102
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,700
I wasn't done talking.

1103
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,940
Let go.

1104
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,340
You did it on purpose, right?

1105
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,050
Last time you came to my house,

1106
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,220
you just wanted to show off.

1107
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,820
"Only scored 679"?

1108
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,170
What's your problem?

1109
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,420
Do you know how long

1110
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,610
my Mom grounded me for this?

1111
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,340
The kind of person you are

1112
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,530
is the kind of world

1113
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,300
you see.

1114
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,860
Also,

1115
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,090
it was your Mom who grounded you,

1116
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,530
so don't take it out on me.

1117
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,260
If you don't even know

1118
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,130
who you should rebel against,

1119
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,740
you're either weak

1120
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,010
or stupid.

1121
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,130
Gu Xuejiao!

1122
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,090
I'm leaving.

1123
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,260
You think about that.

1124
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,220
Where is it?

1125
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,170
Not that way.

1126
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,340
Wrong direction.

1127
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,780
That...

1128
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,260
That way...

1129
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,170
My eyesight's poor,

1130
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,530
I can't see petty people.

1131
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,450
If you don't even know

1132
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,380
who you should rebel against,

1133
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,130
you're either weak or stupid.
