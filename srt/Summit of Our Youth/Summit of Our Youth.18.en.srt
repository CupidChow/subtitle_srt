[Episode 18]

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,780
Remember Ms. Zheng from B&C Motors?

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,700
The one who tried

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,860
hitting on you at that

20
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,340
dinner party?

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,220
She's been working her team

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,340
to the bone,

23
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,370
a total cancer in the business!

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,810
She's Lin Jiadong's aunt.

25
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,890
Got the same taste, huh?

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,890
You knew all along,

27
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,810
but still

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,500
kept him around, why?

29
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,250
Not worried

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,340

He's not

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,690
exactly a saint,

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,090
but I doubt

34
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,180
he's involved.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,130
He's just indecisive,

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,370
easy to sway.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,500

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,410

Then try this.

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,410

Stop acting like one.

Listen, kid,

109
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm way more mature than I look.

110
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,890
What about you?

111
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Shouldn't you be doing homework

112
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,300
instead of scrolling on your phone?

113
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,300
Guess your teachers

125
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,620
Why? Got plans?

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,300
Just tired.

00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,130
Yeah.

133
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,940
Finish eating, then rest.

134
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,180
I gotta head back to campus.

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,660
The competition's

136
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,500
been keeping me so busy

137
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,330
I can't even keep up with classwork.

138
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,660
That sounds tough.

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,500
I'll root for you from here.

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,450
How about I feed you?

141
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,740
I can feed myself.

You forgot

147
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,420
I was here again?

148
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,980
Thought she didn't mind!

149
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,660
I'll do it myself.

173
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,450
Turn that off!

174
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,250
I know

175
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,770
Ms. Zheng hates being interrupted.

176
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,660

No idea what you mean.

182

this video won't just

184
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,210
stay on my phone;

185
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,540
it'll be

186
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,940
all over social media.

187
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:07,890
Maybe Ms. Zheng

188
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,100
doesn't care about her rep,

189
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,180

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,090
don't tell the nurse

193
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,330
I slipped out, yeah?

194
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,490
No way!

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,900
She told me

196
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,020
to keep an eye on you.

197
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,020
Stuck on that question?

198
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,540
Come on,

199
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,690
I'll help you out

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,850
if you keep my secret.

201
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,900
Deal?

202
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,490
Are we living in the Stone Age?

203
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,420
I can always find an answer online.

204
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,330
Saves you the trouble.

205
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,210
Messi's Legendary Journey?

206
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,850
Book cover trick?

207
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,780
I'm telling your mom.

208
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,970
It's not a trick!

209
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,210
It's THE legend,

210
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,060
you know?

211
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,210
How about this?

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,060
You keep quiet,

213
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,810
and I'll tell you

214
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,260
when Messi wins his next title.

215
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,660
Why would I believe you?

216
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,660
Smart!

217
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,490
Always fact-check first.

218
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,690
In a few weeks,
in the World Cup qualifiers,

219
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,330
China beats Korea 1–0

220
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,210
for their first win.

221
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,450
Come on,

222
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,060
at least make up a good story.

223
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,970
What's it gonna hurt?

224
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,850
Could be true.

225
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,090
You seriously know

226
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,060
when Messi wins a title?

227
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,540
For real?

228
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,540
For real!

229
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,660
Keep it to yourself.

230
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,810
Where are you going?

231
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,690
Citizenship & Conduct

232
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,420
Assessment's coming up.

233
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,330
Can I skip it?

234
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,450
Wanna watch the national team

235
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,380
make us proud.

236
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,540
What, planning to retake it again?

237
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:43,960
[China Dragon Team Fan Club]

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,380
Why even watch?

239
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,420
We're gonna lose anyway.

240
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,450
True.

241
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,610
Come on, we're gonna be late.

242
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,020
Move it.

243
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,090
Take Lin Jiadong down

244
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,690
in this round,

245
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,490
or nobody leaves, got it?

246
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,300
Got it!

247
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,660
Wrap this up in five minutes,

248
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,260
don't wanna

249
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,540
miss the qualifiers.

250
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,780
Let's do this!

251
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,210
Beat Lin Jiadong in five minutes?

252
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,730
Savage.

253
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,020
Three minutes, tops.

254
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,780
Gonna hear the anthem.

255
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,540
Here comes the soon-to-be loser.

256
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,380
Lin, welcome back from the hospital!

257
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,850
Show me your

258
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,570
firewall source code.

259
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,180
So?

260
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,060
Pretty ironclad, right?

261
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,060
Check this out.

262
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,540
Isn't this our source code?

263
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,940
All out in the open now?

264
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,210
Posted half an hour ago.

265
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,450
Guess we didn't clean up

266
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,300
the wreckage properly,

267
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,210
someone swiped it.

268
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,660
Last time, our computers

269
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,690
got smashed to pieces,

270
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,940
we salvaged what we could,

271
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,140
something must've slipped out.

272
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,060
You don't think

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,570
they recovered our hard drive data,

274
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,490
did they?

275
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,090
What now, Xuejiao?

276
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,810
The intra-team comp's

277
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,610
about to start.

278
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,300
There's no time to recode.

279
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,810
Zhihua, you're here!

280
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,380
Zhihua!

281
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,300
Don't worry,

282
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,090
we're fully prepared,

283
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,090
ready to roll.

284
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,300
Scared

285
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,940
to watch me lose?

286
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,210
Hello, Gu Xuejiao.

287
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,300
Hello, Shu Lan.

288
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,180
Hello,

289
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,140
Wenbo.

290
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,810
Hello,

291
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,210
the rest of "Nobody Cares".

292
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm Zhao Feifei.

293
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,300
This is Siqi.

294
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,660
Whatever.

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,330
After this match,

296
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,660
we're done seeing you.

297
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,330
Did you leak

298
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,210
our firewall source code?

299
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,380
I beg your pardon?

300
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,810
Checked it already.

301
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,610
You all saw it?

302
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,090
Help me reach out

303
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,540
to the teams on this list.

304
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,850
Get me details

305
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,330
on their deals with B&C.

306
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,810
Nice work.

307
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,940
Shame it's leaked.

308
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,690
Your perfect code

309
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,090
is now scrap paper.

310
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,260
Such a waste.

311
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,660
How about this?

312
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,380
Merge the two teams.

313
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,540
But I'm afraid

314
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,610
that'd be like

315
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,850
mixing oil and water.

316
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,690
You've got an idea, don't you?

317
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,690
I do.

318
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,300
For this comp,

319
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,690
Professor Tan's

320
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,060
heading the judging panel.

321
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,380
Also,

322
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,490
to keep it fair,

323
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,610
we've got

324
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,690
a mystery

325
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,730
guest judge.

326
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,450
Now,

327
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,730
I'll announce the new rules.

328
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,690
Due to unforeseen circumstances

329
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,540
affecting

330
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,090
one competing team,

331
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,330
as per Professor Tan's instructions,

332
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,380
the format's shifting

333
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,570
from smart-device control

334
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,420
and attack/defense

335
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,900
to precision strikes

336
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,810
on distributed server nodes.

337
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,900
Forget about your firewalls,

338
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,570
attack only,

339
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,330
no defense.

340
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,850
With school's approval,

341
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,900
Professor Tan

342
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,730
will repurpose

343
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,780
all idle classroom PCs

344
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,850
during

345
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,090
this afternoon's

346
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,060
Citizenship & Conduct

347
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,940
Assessment.

348
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,730
They'll form a local network

349
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,020
of distributed server nodes.

350
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,260
Both teams

351
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,940
must precisely locate

352
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,490
the judges' PC

353
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,020
hidden in a matrix

354
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,900
of hundreds of

355
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,380
campus computers,

356
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,780
then hack

357
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,940
and take over

358
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,570
its smart-device simulator.

359
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,210
All PCs

360
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:28,900
run the same

361
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,060
simulation program

362
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,660
with dozens of randomized

363
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,850
countermeasures

364
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,020
and dynamic IPs.

365
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,140
Zero hints provided.

366
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,090
Pure tech skills only.

367
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,260
First team to break in

368
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,450
and take control

369
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,970
wins the competition.

370
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,540
Any offensive tactics allowed,

371
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,540
attacks stay

372
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,660
inside the campus LAN.

373
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,420
All the campus PCs are ancient.

374
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,380
Shu Lan,

375
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,180
mask your laptop

376
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,940
as the OS server

377
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,140
and push

378
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,610
system update requests to every node.

379
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,780
Once you've logged

380
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,180
all their system versions,

381
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,810
launch zero-day attacks on the targets.

382
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,300
Quick reminder, everyone:

383
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,380
among all distributed nodes,

384
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,940
only one

385
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,940
is your real target.

386
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,180
Waste time

387
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,060
on the wrong machines, and you...

388
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,540
Check this one

389
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,540
in Lab 1,

567
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,660

568

Nope.

No idea.

576
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,580
I'm emo.

577
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,660
Need to crash here a few days.

580
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,210
you've been here the whole time?

581
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,820
Just woke up

582
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,250

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,140
So,

586
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,180
rough night?

587
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,100
Whatever.

588
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,820
Just

589
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,380
feels off.

590
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,340
I'm fine.

591
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,530
Doesn't

592
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,340
look that way to me.

593
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,620
Just carry on.

594
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,970
I'll get the door.

595
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,050
You're here too?

596
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,940
Hello?

597
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,530
It's me, Gao Rui.

598
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,010
You okay now?

599
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,530
Thanks for taking care of me last time.

600
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,690
So, uh,

601
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,100
I lost my phone,

602
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,490
using a backup now,

603
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,690
just in case

604
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,530
you need me.

605
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,970
Here's my new number,

606
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,140
wanna save it?

607
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,450
Got it, thanks.

608
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,490
Bye then.

609
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,180
Hang on!

610
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,210
One more thing.

611
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,660
Spill.

612
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,620
Well, uh,

613
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,420
your earring fell off at the...

614
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,970
I've got it here.

615
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,940
I can drop it off

616
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,580
when you're free.

617
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,010
Earring?

618
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,420
We'll see.

619
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,380
I've been swamped.

620
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,140
Oh, and

621
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,420
if it's easier,

622
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,770
I can just mail it.

623
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,490
Got another call,

624
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,530
hanging up if it's nothing urgent.

625
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,530
No, it's urgent!

626
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,490
This is super urgent!

627
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,580
Hello?

628
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,250
Slippers here!

629
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,420
Bag can go up there.

630
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,490
I've

631
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,380
got a few things

632
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,940
to wrap up.

633
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,970
Just make yourself at home.

634
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,050
What's the deal?

635
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,820
Xuejiao!

636
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,250
Knew I'd find you here.

637
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,620
Congrats, little rockstar!

638
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,530
Thanks, Zhiyue!

639
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,180
Petal's been stressing

640
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,970
about this competition thing nonstop,

641
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,770
worried you'd be down if you lost.

642
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,250
But now it's all good,

643
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,380
happy ending!

644
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,580
By the way,

645
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,940
talked to everyone

646
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,250
on that list you sent me.

647
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:57,860
Here's

648
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,820
their feedback.

649
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,340
What list?

650
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,860
Well,

651
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,970
I won't crash

652
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,820
your duo time.

653
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,210
I was just

654
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,100
passing by anyway.

655
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,180
Trio?

656
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,450
I'm out.

657
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,620
You're leaving?

658
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,140
What now?

659
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,940
Do something!

660
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,180
Zhiyue,

661
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,340
we're out of...

662
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,940
Soy sauce!

663
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,050
Can you take Gao Rui

664
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,940
to grab some?

665
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,900
Got it.

666
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,140
Let's go.

667
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,420
Yeah, I see.

668
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,290
But the more money

669
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,620
the industry raises,

670
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,380
and prepares to deploy,

671
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,580
and the more it is open
to ordinary investors.

672
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,250
The more pressure

673
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,380
it will come from regulators

674
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,250
to improve transparency.

675
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,620
Okay,

676
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,660
call you later.

677
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,050
Zhiyue,

678
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,380
you've been

679
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,450
pretty busy lately, huh?

680
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,530
Swamped.

681
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,730
Laying the groundwork

682
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,940
for your startup team

683
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,180
takes a ton of paperwork.

684
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,730
Still caring for me then, right?

685
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,580
What's that mean?

686
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,450
Well, after that night,

687
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,860
I tried calling,

688
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,250
but you kept dodging me.

689
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,860
So I wondered

690
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,250
if maybe

691
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,420
I messed up that night.

692
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,580
What else

693
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,820
do you remember?

694
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,940
That night,

695
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,660
things got kinda blurry and we just…

696
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,450
Well,

697
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,490
next morning

698
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,860
I woke up feeling guilty.

699
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,250
But don't worry,

700
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,290
I'll definitely

701
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,180
take good care of you.

702
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,010
Who asked for that?

703
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,820
Come on,

704
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,860
as a guy,

705
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,730
I should

706
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,380
take responsibility.

707
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,050
Gao,

708
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,530
I think

709
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,290
you might've gotten the wrong idea.

710
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,770
Wrong idea?

711
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,730
No way.

712
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,010
So,

713
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,290
that 300 yuan

714
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,380
you left me

715
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,580
that night...

716
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,050
Was that hush money?

717
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,690
Hush for what?

718
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,010
That was for your cab.

719
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,290
Now I get

720
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,450
what you mean.

721
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,010
Listen.

722
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,860
First,

723
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,180
I didn't do

724
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,730
anything to you that night.

725
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,530
Hitting on my brother's friend

726
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,690
would be way out of line.

727
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,970
You were just too drunk,

728
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,140
and I was worried about you.

729
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,620
So I got you to a hotel.

730
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,290
Second,

731
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,340
I was looking out for you

732
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,490
only because

733
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,860
Lin got you hurt

734
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,180
once before.

735
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,730
As his sister,

736
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,580
it's only right

737
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,010
that I take care of you.

738
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,490
Third,

739
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,660
I'm not the kind

740
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,970
to play the games like you think.

741
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,290
So,

742
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,050
please get that idea

743
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,690
out of your head right now.

744
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,380
Sorry,

745
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,730
I misunderstood.

746
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,860
I'll hop out up ahead.

747
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,530
Your stuff.

748
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,580
Thanks.

749
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,380
This year's National College

750
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,940
Intelligent Security
Competition Preliminaries

751
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,900
have successfully concluded.

752
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:15,970
The prelims used

753
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,340
a mix of group matches

754
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,660
and round-robin rounds.

755
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,690
From Group A,

756
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,180
the long-time powerhouse Capital U,

757
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,250
and from Group F,

758
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,340
the dark-horse UFE,

759
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,690
both punched their ticket to the final.

760
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,380
This edit is amazing!

761
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,820
Got me all fired up!

762
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,820
Totally!

763
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,530
Come on,

764
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,820
here's to our most esteemed MVP!

765
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,010
Someone commented,

766
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,420
"Who says geeks can't be gorgeous?

767
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,340
Capital U's captain proves them wrong."

768
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,290
Xuejiao, you're totally
stealing the spotlight!

769
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,970
Too bad no one was allowed

770
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,380
to watch the prelims in person.

771
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,580
I'd have been there with my camera,

772
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,340
snapping you from every angle.

773
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,380
Can I come to the final?

774
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,250
Oh, come on!

775
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,250
Give me a break.

776
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,860
Besides,

777
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,210
your boba shop is super busy.

778
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,530
You wouldn't even have time.

779
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,450
But speaking of the final,

780

787
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,290
