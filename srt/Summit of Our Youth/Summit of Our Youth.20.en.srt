Why are you here again?

196
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,860
I don't come back often.

197
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,540
Just wanna visit

198
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,210
my old classmate.

199
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,850
Why didn't you

200
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,610
pick up my call?

201
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,210
Didn't we

202
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,060
just meet last time?

203
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,570
Since you don't come back often,

204
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,540
spend more time with your Dad.

205
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,850
I gotta go.

206
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,690
Xuejiao, I...

207
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,660
Hi, Dad?

208
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,330
I told you to come to the shop

209
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,180
and learn the accounting.

210
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,380
Where have you been?

211
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,970
Your old man just opened

212
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,260
his first store in the service sector.

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,490
Can you take it seriously?

214
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,060
I'm counting on you.

215
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,900
I came to Capital University.

216
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,940
Forgot my phone again.

217
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,180
Gotta go back to the lab.

218
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,260
What's at Capital University?

219
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,330
Buried treasure?

220
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,330
Or something more irresistible?

221
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,300
Don't tell me

222
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,380
you went to see Xuejiao again.

223
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,850
Son,

224
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,570
I've got to say, back then

225
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,090
I really did hope

226
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,330
Xuejiao could give

227
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,690
our gene pool a little boost.

228
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,450
But she's been dating

229
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,660
her boyfriend for years.

230
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,660
No one in our family should ever be

231
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,180
a homewrecker.

232
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,900
Dad,

233
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,850
what are you talking about?

234
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,970
I... I have a girlfriend.

235
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,260
Son,

236
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,780
how can you hide such good news from me?

237
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,900
Is she also from Capital University

238
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,660
or what?

239
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,730
When will you bring her home?

240
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,690
Let me see her.

241
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,260
I'll talk to you later.

242
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,260
That's it for now.

243
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,140
I gotta go. Bye.

244
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,850
You finally took a

245
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,140
completely different life path.

246
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,380
Great.

247
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,330
Why did you come back, Xuejiao?

248
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,210
I came to get my phone.

249
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,300
Good for you.

250
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,970
Looks like you did well studying abroad.

251
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,730
You even have a girlfriend now.

252
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,810
No...

253
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,540
Listen to me.

254
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,940
Is she

255
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,090
jealous?

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,140
We should get Lin...

257
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,020
Hang out some time.

258
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,970
I'm meeting Tiantian for dinner today.

259
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,060
I'll go in now.

260
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,690
No time like the present.

261
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,300
How about today?

262
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,850
I'll wait for you.

263
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,540
Xuejiao!

264
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,450
I'll be here!

265
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,690
Didn't you go abroad

266
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,810
to be a pro basketball player?

267
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,090
Why are you reading

268
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,140
economics books now?

269
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,660
My Dad said

270
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,380
basketball's no future.

271
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,380
So he bought me a business

272
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,380
bachelor's degree.

273
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,570
More skills, more opportunities.

274
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,610
Your Dad's not wrong.

275
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,610
But this book...

276
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,810
No problem.

277
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,610
I can understand it.

278
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,300
Let me tell you,

279
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,260
ugh...

280
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,380
I mean,

281
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,810
this book is okay

282
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,660
as a general intro to economics.

283
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,540
But if you want to excel

284
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,810
in investing,

285
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,750
[THE DARWIN ECONOMY]

286
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,450
it might not be enough.

287
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,300
Then what should I do?

288
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,850
Do you want

289
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,090
my advice?

290
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,420
Theories are important,

291
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
but investing

292
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,900
needs foresight.

293
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,570
Needs foresight?

294
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,490
What does that mean?

295
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,850
Simply put,

296
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,570
you need to know

297
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,660
which companies and industries

298
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,420
will be

299
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,660
at the forefront of the times

300
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,850
and dare to bet on them.

301
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,210
How am I supposed to know

302
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,900
which companies

303
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,610
to bet on?

304
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,140
It feels unfair to teach you

305
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,260
step by step.

306
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,260
Come on,

307
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm your old classmate.

308
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,380
What's wrong with that?

309
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,180
It's not cheating.

310
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,210
True.

311
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,690
Helping my ex get a second chance

312
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,140
is kind of a good deed.

313
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,610
The future

314
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,420
is about open AI,

315
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,380
using digital currency,

316
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,970
shopping on Temu.

317
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,970
What O C I?

318
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,140
I what?

319
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,090
I can only tell you

320
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,780
this much.

321
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,300
As your old classmate,

322
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,970
I've done my best.

323
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,660
You figure out the rest.

324
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,210
Wait up.

325
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,540
The info you asked for.

326
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,420
Will this do?

327
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,210
Yeah.

328
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,300
Lin,

329
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,090
we're leaving now.

330
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,210
Bye.

331
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:50,970
Lin.

332
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,450
Bye.

333
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,900
Thanks.

334
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,450
Bye.

335
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,180
Bye, Xuejiao.

336
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,020
Bye.

337
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,090
Bye.

338
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,060
Feifei, I'm a bit hungry.

339
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,850
Me too.

340
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,610
Right?

341
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,730
Shu Lan.

342
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,780
You're hungry too.

343
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,020
No, I'm not.

344
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,090
You are!

345
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,540
Hungry.

346
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,690
Let's go.

347
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,850
Xuejiao, we're leaving.

348
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,450
Bye.

349
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,060
Bye.

350
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,300
- Bye.
- Bye, Lin.

351
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,020
Bye, Lin.

352
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,180
Xuejiao.

353
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,540
I'd rather we have a big fight.

354
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,810
You can hit me, yell at me.

355
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,490
Just don't keep ignoring me.

356
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,420
Can you stop

357
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,450
being so childish?

358
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,690
The last person

359
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,570
who cut the power

360
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,140
got their butt kicked

361
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,060
like crazy.

362
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,140
I didn't do this.

363
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,180
The power really went out.

364
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,570
Xuejiao, what are you looking for?

365
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,210
I'll help you.

366
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,060
A door pry tool.

367
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,810
The lab's a secure facility,

368
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,610
all doors are anti-theft
and tamper-proof.

369
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,970
I've called security.

370
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,090
They're on their way.

371
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,020
How long will that take?

372
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,140
I can't wait.

373
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,260
Do you really

374
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,210
not want to be with me?

375
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,570
Let me do it.

376
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,380
Almost done.

377
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,330
You already sold C1,

378
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,660
but didn't even upgrade

379
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,780
the lab's equipment?

380
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,850
Xuejiao.

381
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,260
My fight with B&C

382
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,490
was never about winning.

383
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,490
I wanted to lose.

384
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,780
The goal was always

385
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,540
to get them

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,810
to buy C1 at a high price.

387
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,940
Then I'd use the money

388
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,940

Seems like you cared a lot

582
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,250
about our contractors.

583
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,860
I've always wanted
to explain about these.

584
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,690
Just...

585
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,010
Didn't get a chance.

586
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,490
That's just an excuse.

587
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,530
You need

588
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,620
to fight for a chance.

589
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,340
You're right.

590
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,770
I guess

591
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,450
I didn't try hard enough.

592
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,820
From now on, you just lift your finger.

593
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:45,970
I'll go

594
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,970
where you say,

595
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,010
sound good?

596
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,530
Then I need you

597
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,730
to let go of me now.

598
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,420
No can do.

599
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,140
What?

600
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,940
You only hear

601
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,250
what you wanna hear.

602
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,530
Okay.

603
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,100
Well.

604
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,380
Since you've been

605
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,450
watching me for so long,

606
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,860
and you know all about me,

607
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,690
now it's my turn to know you.

608
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,180
How many...

609
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,820
ex-girlfriends?

610
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:23,970
Me?

611
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,050
You know my circle.

612
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,970
Always Gao Rui,

613
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,580
Lin Jiadong, Professor Tan.

614
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,250
Unlike you.

615
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,530
That ex-boyfriend of yours,

616
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,140
Yi Tianyu,

617
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,290
is still hanging around.

618
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,210
Past crimes don't count, alright?

619
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,380
How do you know

620
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,690
he was my ex last time?

621
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,380
Someone was slacking off

622
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,210
at work,

623
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,580
cleaning your picture with him.

624
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,050
Then after work, he picked you up

625
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,050
with snacks.

626
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,690
Stop...

627
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,620
It's in the past now.

628
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,580
This time,

629
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,860
we are really

630
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,860
just friends.

631
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,820
Do you think Yi Tianyu

632
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,940
will be different this time?

633
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,970
What if

634
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,450
he's changed?

635
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,490
What?

636
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,730
Are you jealous?

637
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,250
No.

638
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,380
So what if he's changed this time?

639
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,450
We've both

640
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,860
gotten a second chance at life.

641
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,530
Why dwell

642
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,530
on the past?

643
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,140
For me,

644
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,290
every day now

645
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,450
feels fulfilling.

646
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,580
I like this feeling

647
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,530
of living without regrets.

648
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,290
This is the life I want.

649
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,730
Yi Tianyu

650
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,660
is getting better now.

651
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,620
I am really

652
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,860
happy for him.

653
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,620
That's all.

654
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,770
Besides, he has

655
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,690
a girlfriend now.

656
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,900
They are great together.

657
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,490
Don't overthink it.

658
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,420
Really?

659
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,340
It's real...

660
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,140
Can't we have a little trust

661
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,970
between us?

662
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,660
Yes.

663
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,180
I heard something.

664
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,250
Someone's outside.

665
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,210
There's no sound.

666
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,940
No one's there, you're lying.

667
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,770
Trying to trick me?

668
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,940
You don't trust me?

669
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,340
I do.

670
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,010
But you, little fox, are too cunning.

671
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,180
[2024]
Mr. Lin,

672
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,660
your competitor B&C Motors

673
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,940
announced a complete withdrawal

674
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,900
of their autonomous vehicle line
from the global market.

675
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,690
What's your take on that?

676
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,660
I've never really

677
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,340
seen them as "competitors".

678
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,420
The market makes its choice.

679
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,290
The fittest survives.

680
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,050
With B&C's era ending,

681
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,690
another brand

682
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,420
will rise

683
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,250
to replace it soon.

684
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,660
And hopefully, they'll set

685
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,380
a new, healthy standard

686
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,770
for competition in our industry.

687
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,620
Six years ago,

688
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,180
you sold your C1 autonomous driving tech

689
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,290
to B&C Motors.

690
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,210
Did you foresee that

691
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,050
one day C1

692
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,010
would be completely

693
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,690
outmatched by C2?

694
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,010
The new replaces the old.

695
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,210
It's how the market works.

696
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,010
Some companies cut corners,

697
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,730
hoping to milk one technology forever.

698
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,730
That's impossible.

699
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,100
In the end,

700
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,140
good money drives out bad.

701
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,380
That's something our company

702
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,530
always reminds itself of.

703
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,970
Okay, thank you.

704
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,690
Thank you

705
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,660
for taking my interview.

706
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,730
Thank you too.

707
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,490
Gu Xuejiao,

708
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,820
aren't you just generous?

709
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,010
Applying to make

710
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,180
the V2X protocol public.

711
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,380
Do you know how much profit

712
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,250
the licensing fees

713
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,900
for just the protocol

714
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,940
could bring to the company?

715
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,420
If everyone's year-end bonus gets cut,

716
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,140
are you gonna cover that?

717
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,250
Our private protocol

718
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,180
is the most advanced

719
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,290
for the next few years.

720
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,290
By granting free licenses
to other manufacturers

721
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,490
to produce protocol chips,

722
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,940
we can actually expand Huachuang's

723
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,900
market influence

724
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,450
and share.

725
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,100
Can you stop

726
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,100
just focusing

727
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,970
on your own little patch?

728
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,010
My patch?

729
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,010
Stick to the facts.

730
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,380
It's 2024...

731
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,010
Zhihua, where are you going?

732
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,450
Project lead at Blue Mountain Capital,

733
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,050
Jason Yi,

734
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,180
is arriving in Jinghai today.

735
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,530
I've arranged a business lunch

736
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,290
to welcome him.

737
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,970
Let Gao handle the reception.

738
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,970
Zhihua,

739
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,050
aren't you meeting

740
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,290
this important guest yourself?

741
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,450
I have

742
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,660
more important matters.

743
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,180
Ugh, well,

744
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,010
this view is nice.

745
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,820
Beautiful.

746
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,380
Honey,

747
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,820
pour some more tea

748
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,860
for the future in-laws.

749
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,900
Right...

750
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,100
Here, in-laws,

751
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,180
have some tea.

752
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,450
Look at them.

753
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,860
What a harmonious couple.

754
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,530
Good.

755
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,290
Our family

756
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,340
doesn't have much,

757
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,820
just a harmonious home.

758
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,900
A mutual respect

759
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,180
has become

760
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,380
a family tradition for us.

761
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,050
How wonderful.

762
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,580
No wonder they say

763
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,730
parents are

764
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,580
the reflection
of their children's future.

765
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,530
You two

766
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,940
are such excellent parents,

767
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,100
that's how you raise

768
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,660
an outstanding kid like Lin.

769
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes.

770
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,970
Yes...

771
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,180
Yes, you're right.

772
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,290
I wonder

773
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,620
where those two kids are now.

774
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,940
They haven't called either.

775
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,580
Wait a bit longer.

776
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,210
Okay...

777
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,900
Take your time.

778
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,210
I've already

779
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,340
picked some gifts.

780
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,970
I'm waiting for you.

781
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,140
Okay, I'll be there soon.

782
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,660
But what

783
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,580
do your parents actually like?

784
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,730
When I get there,

785
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,050
let's pick something good.

786
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,140
Why are you so nervous?

787
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,580
It's not your first time

788
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,340
meeting my parents.

789
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,860
This time's different.

790
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,100
Don't worry.

791
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,660
My parents are really nice.

792
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,100
They'll make your folks

793
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,210
feel right at home.

794
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,730
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

795
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,620
Now,

796
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,050
I'm looking at two keychains.

797
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,010
I like them both.

798
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,050
Which one do you think I should pick?

799
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,730
Just buy both.

800
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,690
Yi Tianyu?

801
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,450
Isn't it funny?

802
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,530
The lunch your company arranged for me

803
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,620
is also in this mall.

804
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,970
Jason Yi?

805
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,380
You're with Blue Mountain Capital?

806
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,100
What?

807
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,970
Do we only talk about work now?

808
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,100
Isn't that

809
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,180
why you came back?

810
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,660
There are more important things too.

811
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,940
Like

812
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,730
relationships.

813
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,660
You and your girlfriend

814
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,860
are getting married?

815
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,900
Congrats.

816
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,900
How about these?

817
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,210
That depends on

818
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,900
your girlfriend.

819
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,180
Not up to me.

820
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,050
Do you like it?

821
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,940
Welcome.

822
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,380
Lin.

823
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,380
Is that bouquet for me?

824
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,300
Mr. Yi.

825
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,130
It's actually

826
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,220
for my future mother-in-law.

827
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,010
You'd better hurry.

828
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,860
Looks like

829
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,050
these flowers are wilting.

830
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,010
We're meeting soon.

831
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,090
I'll make it.

832
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,090
You picked the gifts

833
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,740
for my parents?

834
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,220
I'll take them.

835
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,090
We're leaving now.

836
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,740
See you.

837
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,050
Neither of you two top execs

838
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,170
is gonna have lunch with your investor?

839
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,090
Is a business lunch

840
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,490
more important than meeting our parents?

841
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,450
Let's go.

842
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,220
We're off.

843
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,940
Say hi to Uncle and Auntie for me.

844
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,050
Will do.

845
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,900
Be there soon.

846
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,970
They're already on their way.

847
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,740
Almost here.

848
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,740
These two kids are always so busy.

849
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,820
Today they finally found time

850
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,820
for this lunch.

851
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,570
Our two families

852
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,970
can finally meet.

853
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,380
They're usually so busy.

854
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,170
We can't even see them.

855
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,170
A perfect match.

856
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,700
Two workaholics.

857
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,940
Yes...

858
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,610
Right...

859
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,340
Sorry,

860
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,530
I gotta take this call.

861
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,450
Go on.

862
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,970
Go ahead.

863
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,970
Actually,

864
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,050
our Petal

865
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,490
takes after his Dad.

866
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,570
Just loves to work.

867
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,490
Yeah...

868
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,490
Of course,

869
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,610
he takes after me too.

870
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,650
Excuse me.

871
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,610
Okay...

872
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,570
Look at them,

873
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,450
balancing career and life perfectly.

874
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,940
Doing great on both fronts.

875
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,170
Compared to them,

876
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,530
we are just...

877
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,860
Life's alright.

878
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,650
But work, well...

879
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,300
I have a call too.

880
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,050
Why are you calling me?

881
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,050
Ms. Li,

882
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,570
could you spare some time

883
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,740
to discuss our dinner menu?

884
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,450
Stop it.

885
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,780
They'll laugh at us.

886
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,260
The phone's been silent forever.

887
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,090
It's awkward.

888
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,610
Okay,

889
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,420
I got it.

890
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,090
Just leave it.

891
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,650
Why did you veto everything again?

892
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,450
I haven't even accused you yet,

893
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,700
and you're coming at me first?

894
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,860
I've been in charge

895
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,220
of this Shen City project,

896
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,490
and now you're kicking

897
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,220
my people out?

898
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,860
What does that mean?

899
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,380
It's not your first time!

900
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,570
Can you keep your voice down?

901
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,940
Aren't you afraid they might hear?

902
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,490
I should be the one saying that.

903
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,940
Tell me,

904
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,940
are you the one

905
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,170
who leaked our divorce news?

906
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,050
Do you know

907
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,260
how much I spent on PR

908
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,970
to keep this

909
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,860
under wraps?

910
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,610
Why are you

911
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,740
always like this?

912
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,170
Why can't you just shut your...?

913
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,530
Stop!

914
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,450
Quit acting.

915
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,260
Just stop.

916
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:04,820
You think

917
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,820
they can't see

918
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,860
how demanding you are?

919
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,530
You kicked me a few times

920
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,170
while we were in there.

921
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,260
I'm telling you,

922
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,970
I've put up with you

923
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,970
more than enough!

924
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,740
My phone.

925
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,450
Who could it be?

926
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,220
Hello?

927
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,650
I'm not buying any house,

928
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,610
and I don't want a loan.

929
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,740
Hello?

930
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,260
Where is this house at?

931
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,090
Future in-laws.

932
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,900
Sorry.

933
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,780
Five minutes.

934
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,610
It's alright.

935
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,570
Gotta handle some family stuff.

936
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,010
I have something too.

937
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,820
Don't touch me.

938
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,380
Talk nicely.

939
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,490
Take your time.

940
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,650
Good thing the call came through.

941
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,170
Aren't you tired of this yet?

942
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,130
What's going on?

943
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,820
Lin Wenbin!

944
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,970
What did I tell you?

945
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,170
Have you ever

946
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,220
done anything properly?

947
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,650
I told you this is

948
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,610
very important...

949
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,860
Don't mess it up.

950
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,900
I think you just love

951
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,530
to act,

952
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,090
to pretend.

953
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,380
When will this come to an end?

954
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,340
This time,

955
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,740
you lied to Xuejiao's family.

956
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,420
I can't open it.

957
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,050
But

958
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,340
in the end, you'll be

959
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,380
exposed anyway.

960
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,650
I'll be exposed?

961
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,380
I'm telling you.

962
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,010
As long as you're out of my sight,

963
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,570
I'm super happy!

964
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,940
You think I wanna see you?

965
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,650
Wait...

966
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,420
I'll get the waiter.

967
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,220
Waiter!

968
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,170
Waiter!

969
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,450
Come help.

970
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,300
- Quick.
- What's going on?

971
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,380
Are you meeting in-laws?

972
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,450
Why are you fighting?

973
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,420
Asked for too much dowry?

974
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,740
The key...

975
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,450
You got the key?

976
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,260
It's locked. The key.

977
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,940
The key.

978
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,050
Go grab the key.

979
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,820
What...

980
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,450
Look at this.

981
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,450
They're fighting one-on-one?

982
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,530
Yeah...

983
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,130
What should we do?

984
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,970
Dad, Mom.

985
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,820
Uncle, Auntie.

986
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,860
Just in time!

987
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,570
Xuejiao, you're here!

988
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,090
Ugh...

989
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,860
Uncle?

990
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,130
Xuejiao?

991
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,090
Wait,

992
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,380
they're fighting in here.

993
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,170
Open the door, quick!

994
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,740
I...

995
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,700
Quick, the key!

996
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,220
They're fighting, quick!

997
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,050
Who are fighting?

998
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,740
His parents.

999
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,130
Mom, Dad, don't worry.

1000
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,090
I know their situation.

1001
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,860
Let's go in.

1002
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,300
Okay...

1003
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,900
Dad! Mom!

1004
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,820
I'm telling you...

1005
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,900
Please...

1006
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,650
Calm down.

1007
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,490
Why fight with your partner?

1008
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,740
- I'm not his partner!
- I'm not her partner!

1009
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,090
So you're divorced.

1010
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,970
Look at all these...

1011
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,420
Did you know about this?

1012
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,820
Did you know?

1013
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,340
I...

1014
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,380
Do I?

1015
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,010
It's alright.

1016
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,220
Come...

1017
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,740
Does it have to be now?

1018
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,780
Does it have to be here?

1019
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,090
Your Mom's acting up

1020
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,780
regardless of the situation.

1021
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,820
Am I?

1022
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,900
I'm acting up?

1023
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,260
Look.

1024
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,130
Look at her now.

1025
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,820
You two said it at the same time.

1026
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,490
I heard you.

1027
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,010
Son...

1028
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,940
Do you know

1029
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,260
who came to our restaurant today?

1030
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,170
Ugh,

1031
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,860
future in-laws,

1032
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,740
I'm so sorry.

1033
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,780
It's nothing...

1034
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,450
Yeah...

1035
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,380
Is this bouquet from Petal?

1036
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:48,900
Yes.

1037
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,650
Yeah!

1038
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,780
Quick, give it to Auntie Li.

1039
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,300
So our kids' marriage

1040
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,380
is settled then.

1041
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,650
No... Don't...

1042
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,170
We can't take it...

1043
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,970
What do you mean "can't take it", Dad?

1044
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,130
What are you saying?

1045
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,090
We can, we can take it.

1046
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,780
Stop talking.

1047
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,170
Isn't this great?

1048
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,570
Harmony brings wealth,

1049
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,420
right?

1050
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,420
Seeing you all so happy now,

1051
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,340
I'm in a good mood too.

1052
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,170
Guests come first.

1053
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,740
Today, your meal's on me.

1054
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,970
Forget about all this.

1055
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,970
I'll get someone to clean up later.

1056
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,260
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

1057
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,090
Wait a moment.

1058
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,170
Quick, take a seat.

1059
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,780
Thank you.

1060
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,570
It's alright.

1061
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,050
Weren't you two pretty good

1062
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,340
at acting in front of me?

1063
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,090
Why did you lose your cool this time?

1064
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,700
That was all your Dad's idea.

1065
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,860
We were hiding it pretty well.

1066
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,050
Nothing about

1067
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,610
stock shake-ups or info leaks.

1068
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,300
Then out of nowhere,

1069
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,220
he just couldn't

1070
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,340
hide it anymore.

1071
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,780
I clearly said

1072
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,610
we should be honest

1073
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,780
with our future in-laws.

1074
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,940
Why can't we just be honest?

1075
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,740
It was your dumb idea.

1076
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,170
How old are you?

1077
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,300
Think before you speak!

1078
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,780
Honesty?

1079
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,300
It'll just drive our in-laws away!

1080
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,900
Seriously...

1081
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,700
You're right.

1082
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,490
You're right, okay?

1083
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,170
You're always right.

1084
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,050
Always the right one.

1085
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,780
Son.

1086
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,300
Son.

1087
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,300
Today we messed up.

1088
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,450
You invite the in-laws out another time.

1089
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,170
We'll apologize to them in person,

1090
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,650
okay?

1091
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,780
Forget it.

1092
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,570
I'll clean up

1093
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,010
this mess myself.

1094
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,820
Let's invite your parents

1095
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,420
for dinner next time. I'll cook.

1096
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,860
Speaking of

1097
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,220
the kids' marriage,

1098
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,740
in-law stuff

1099
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,650
is all about fate,

1100
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,450
right?

1101
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:52,970
Yeah...

1102
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,260
Dad.

1103
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,380
Let's not talk

1104
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,740
about the in-laws.

1105
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,610
No.

1106
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,700
But

1107
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,490
you and I, we really hit it off.

1108
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,570
I knew it as soon as you walked in.

1109
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,010
You're a true savior

1110
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,130
of my family.

1111
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:05,940
Me?

1112
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,570
When...

1113
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,010
I'm someone

1114
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,420
who likes to help others.

1115
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,530
But when did I

1116
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,570
save you?

1117
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,970
If you hadn't

1118
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,610
driven so slowly back then,

1119
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,090
causing me to miss my flight,

1120
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,050
and left my suitcase

1121
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,090
by the roadside...

1122
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,050
What...

1123
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,570
How could you have done that?

1124
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,420
Yeah, I... How...

1125
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,450
Hurry, say you're sorry.

1126
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,900
Sorry..

1127
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,490
My bad.

1128
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,420
Don't be.

1129
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,220
Thanks to missing that flight,

1130
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,820
I dodged

1131
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,010
an investment trap.

1132
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,900
Really?

1133
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,010
That's some fate right there.

1134
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,650
And

1135
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,450
you're Xuejiao's Dad.

1136
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,940
Are we destined or what?

1137
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,260
Wait, this is...

1138
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,570
Don't drink too much.

1139
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,090
Okay...

1140
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,050
She's right.

1141
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,450
You drink less, and I drink up.

1142
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,010
That way,

1143
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,010
our bond keeps going.

1144
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,740
Right?

1145
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,780
Keep going.

1146
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,610
Good.

1147
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,820
Dad, Mom,

1148
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,420
Lin asked

1149
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,860
when we'd be available

1150
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,970
to have another meal together.

1151
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,490
Another meal?

1152
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,570
Daughter,

1153
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,700
I don't know

1154
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,050
if your Mom can handle this,

1155
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,220
but your Dad

1156
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,740
sure can't.

1157
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,490
Bro.

1158
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:07,860
Don't...

1159
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,610
