00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,060
totally reminds me of someone.

386
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,940
Even their sleep schedule is similar.

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,140
Earlier, you asked

388
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,090
if I feel

389
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,450
nervous.

390
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,490
Honestly,

391
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,490
the moment I saw him

392
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,940
in the woods,

393
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,140
I was hoping I'd get

394
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,180
to keep seeing him at college.

395
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,690
Wait, where are you going?

396
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,810
Off to lose my mind.

397
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,490
Gu Xuejiao,

398
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,850
come grab your flag

399
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,540
for your squad

400
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,940
at the playground.

401
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,380
Making me run errands this late?

402
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,060
Isn't it too much?

403
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,380
Is it?

404
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,330
You seemed

405
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,060
full of energy just now.

406
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,380
Halt.

407
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,250
Why are you running?

408
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,100
Feeling guilty?

409
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,660
Why would I?

410
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,530
Only you know why.

411
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,290
Got the flag.

412
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,050
I'm heading back.

413
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,820
Wait.

414
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,420
You forgot something.

415
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,050
- Happy…
- How do you know

416
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,970
today's my birthday?

417
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,490
I saw your ID when we were

418
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,580
checking into the hotel.

419
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,250
On the grad trip.

420
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,820
That… grad trip

421
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,580
was a total disaster.

422
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,010
Can you not bring that up?

423
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,860
So embarrassing.

424
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,290
Okay, I'll drop it.

425
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,100
When I was nineteen last time,

426
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,580
I totally slacked off.

427
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,580
This time

428
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,970
is my second shot.

429
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,620
I can't mess it up again.

430
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,820
Gu Xuejiao!

431
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,100
Gu Xuejiao.

432
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,420
Happy…

433
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,820
Xuejiao!

434
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,690
Wait, you…

435
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,100
There's a gate.

436
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,420
Do you have to climb that?

437
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,340
Yes…

438
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,380
Hua…

439
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,290
Lin Zhihua!

440
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,050
Lin Zhihua!

441
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,210
Bro…

442
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,250
Quick…

443
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,140
Give me a hand.

444
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,140
I'm scared of heights!

445
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,900
For real!

446
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,900
Hurry, bro.

447
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,940
Please…

448
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,940
Quick…

449
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,210
Hurry!

450
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,100
Happy birthday to you.

451
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,450
Happy birthday to you.

452
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,290
Happy birthday to you.

453
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,900
Happy birthday to you.

454
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,620
Xuejiao, make a wish.

455
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,690
And then we eat the cake.

456
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,490
I've got you a…

457
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,290
gi… gift.

458
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,820
I think I left it in my dorm.

459
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,660
Why am I

460
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,690
not surprised?

461
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,970
Doesn't matter.

462
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,970
Make a wish.

463
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,290
I gotta head back

464
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,900
early later.

465
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,690
There's a dorm check.

466
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,580
Wish I could stay clear

467
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,290
of my ex soon.

468
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,250
Wish I could get completely

469
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,290
over my crush soon.

470
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,690
Xuejiao.

471
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,340
What did you wish for?

472
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,730
And you glanced at me.

473
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,530
Just eat, will you?

474
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,820
Eat the cake and shut up.

475
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,340
You think I'd tell you

476
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,290
what I wished for?

477
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,100
If I tell you, it wouldn't work.

478
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,730
Tomorrow's
the military training showcase.

479
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,770
Dorm check may be earlier.

480
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,140
And our school

481
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,050
locks up at midnight.

482
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,580
You won't be able to get out then.

483
00:20:59,550 --> 00:20:59,970
Xuejiao.

484
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,660
I gotta go now.

485
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,660
I'll walk you.

486
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,730
Nah, no need.

487
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,210
I'll go by myself.

488
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,660
You're an unstable element

489
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,340
that raises security risks

490
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,050
on campus.

491
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,250
Let's go.

492
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,340
Xuejiao, see you around.

493
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,340
Meet me at the cafeteria…

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,050
tomorrow…

495
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,050
Meet me there.

496
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,860
I'll come find you.

497
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,210
Cafeteria.

498
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,290
Bye-bye.

499
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,900
She gave me a macaron.

500
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,180
She gave me a macaron.

501
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,100
Didn't give you one.

502
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,860
I bought the cake.

503
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,820
So what?

504
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,730
She let me have it.

505
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,820
I ate the cake you bought.

506
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,900
Sorry, sir,

507
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,100
I didn't mean to…

508
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,690
You…

509
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,120
♪I keep searching for you♪

510
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,240

Good thing I made it.

513
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,940
Happy birthday.

514
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,840
♪To the ends of the earth♪

515
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,040

♪I'll be yours

518
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,180
Slow down or you'll choke.

519
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,250
Who would've thought

520
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,970
the class schedule could change?

521
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,940
I was told early this morning

522
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,140
that I had an English class.

523
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,580
Guess this is what they call

524
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,620
college life.

525
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,180
Good luck, Xuejiao.

526
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,530
Don't even mention it.

527
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,450
I was completely lost

528
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,010
the moment I saw that placement test.

529
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,050
None of it was high school-level stuff.

530
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm running late.

531
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,860
Gotta go now.

532
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,490
Take the milk tea.

533
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:30,770
Okay.

534
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,380
Good luck!

535
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,660
Good luck!

536
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,860
This is the right classroom.

537
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,420
It's class time already.

538
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,010
Where is everyone?

539
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,770
Sir?

540
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,940
You are…?

541
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,970
I'm here for the English class.

542
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,530
Isn't this the English class?

543
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,100
Why am I the only one here?

544
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,010
So you're

545
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,860
the only student.

546
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,290
Kid,

547
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,860
freshman English is basically

548
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,820
just for show.

549
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,940
Anyone who scores over 90

550
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,250
on the placement test

551
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,140
can skip it.

552
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,180
Looks like you…

553
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,940
So…

554
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,690
I'm the only one

555
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,100
who didn't get to skip?

556
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,620
It's been years.

557
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,620
This is the first time I've seen

558
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,970
anyone actually attend this class.

559
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,940
Come on.

560
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,690
Come sit up front.

561
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,580
Big lecture class

562
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,970
turned into a one-on-one session.

563
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,290
You lucked out.

564
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:50,080
[Bar]

565
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,860
Come on!

566
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,050
An early toast

567
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,140
to our AAA masterpiece

568
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,420
going live soon!

569
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,250
Cheers…

570
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,180
Cheers!

571
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,380
Mingze,

572
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,010
why do you look

573
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,940
so down?

574
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,490
Yeah.

575
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,420
Have a strong one to boost…

576
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,770
He doesn't drink.

577
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,580
Remember?

578
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,250
Oh, right.

579
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,730
Project's just getting started.

580
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,050
That's the kind of discipline

581
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,210
a team leader should have!

582
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,140
My bad.

583
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,420
I shouldn't drag him here

584
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,010
to drink.

585
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,970
I'll take a punishment shot.

586
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,530
Honestly,

587
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,620
the problem is your poor arrangement.

588
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,820
Who wants

589
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,530
to be stuck at an all-dude gathering?

590
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,290
Especially our leader.

591
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,140
Exactly!

592
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:46,770
Mingze,

593
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,530
drink.

594
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,420
Zhou Shiyun?

595
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,290
Okay.

596
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,210
Do come over later.

597
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,010
Am I drunk?

598
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,180
I'm seeing things now.

599
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,420
Come on,

600
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,820
this drink's just 3% alcohol.

601
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,860
Yeah.

602
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,250
He's drunk.

603
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,450
Who is he looking at?

604
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,250
Mingze.

605
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,660
Does your wife know

606
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,290
you're out here

607
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,140
hitting on college girls?

608
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,290
Fine,

609
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,450
just you wait.

610
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,530
What a coincidence.

611
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,010
Is it?

612
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,490
You've been looking for me for days.

613
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,340
Now the whole school knows

614
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,530
someone's been looking for me.

615
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,690
That's not it.

616
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,140
I just wanted to know

617
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,380
which school you are in.

618
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,530
A second-tier college.

619
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,210
Happy now?

620
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,530
I didn't mean it like that.

621
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,250
Shiyun.

622
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,770
Let's go.

623
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,450
Let's go somewhere else.

624
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,530
Shiyun.

625
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,620
Wait.

626
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,250
Wait.

627
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,620
Shiyun.

628
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,050
Wait.

629
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,340
What?

630
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,970
What are you doing in a place like this?

631
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,860
What's wrong with it?

632
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,620
Who are you?

633
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,660
It's none of your business.

634
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,530
Let's go.

635
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,010
I'm not trying to get in your business.

636
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,100
I just…

637
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,730
I just…

638
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,940
Just what?

639
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,010
You wanna say

640
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,770
you care about me?

641
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,250
Well, thanks you.

642
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,940
Even my mom doesn't care anymore.

643
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,660
You can just save it.

644
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,380
Shiyun.

645
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,660
I'm warning you!

646
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,100
Don't follow me.

647
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
[Confirmed?]

648
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,050
Done.

649
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,520
[Course Selection Failed!]

650
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,660
Done!

651
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,420
Wait.

652
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,420
How is it full already?

653
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,140
Of course.

654
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,970
Three-credit courses are already rare.

655
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,050
Everyone's got their eyes on it.

656
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,660
Not just three-credit ones,

657
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,580
even two-credit classes

658
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,530
are basically gone.

659
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,730
Did you guys all succeed?

660
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,400
[Course Selection Successful!]

661
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,820
Yeah.

662
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,380
No way.

663
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,250
I even wrote a code

664
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,530
to snipe classes.

665
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,140
How could someone beat me to it?

666
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,900
That code

667
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,140
you wrote is so amateur.

668
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,730
You think that was gonna get you ahead?

669
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,100
Save it.

670
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,420
Did you notice the asterisks

671
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,620
next to the course you chose?

672
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,450
That means it has grade requirements.

673
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,250
With your bottom-tier

674
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,290
placement test score,

675
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,580
you might want to consider dancing

676
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,290
or music.

677
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,250
Pick up a skill

678
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,530
in case you'll go jobless.

679
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,900
Or just settle

680
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,970
for a one-credit course.

681
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,660
But I need ten credits.

682
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,770
At this rate, I'll be patching together

683
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,450
credits forever.

684
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,210
My whole semester's gonna be

685
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,380
filled with electives.

686
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,860
Autonomous Driving Lab?

687
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,730
Programming Practicum.

688
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,530
Instructor, Professor Tan Ze.

689
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,820
Don't ever think about it.

690
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,620
Why not?

691
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,420
It's got high credits,

692
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,210
but it's basically

693
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,530
a swamp of electives,

694
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,290
a death trap for freshmen.

695
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,490
How so?

696
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,140
I heard this lab

697
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,290
is ruthless.

698
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,140
A freshman

699
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,490
once dared

700
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,180
to sign up for it.

701
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,900
Dude failed eight times.

702
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,050
Eight times?

703
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,770
And then he got expelled.

704
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,580
I suggest you value your life.

705
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,530
Stay away from that course.

706
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,820
Anyone

707
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,580
who survives that lab

708
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,820
isn't human.

709
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,140
At least not normal.

710
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,690
Autonomous Driving Lab?

711
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,050
Isn't that…?

712
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,660
Your math grades in freshman

713
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,970
and sophomore years are okay.

714
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,180
But you're mainly

715
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,860
good at spatial geometry.

716
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,580
For our Autonomous Driving Lab,

717
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,010
you'll need algorithmic thinking.

718
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,730
Your grades in probability
and statistics

719
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,620
aren't looking so great.

720
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,180
Next.

721
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,770
I've re-evaluated

722
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,380
your code.

723
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,050
There is

724
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,140
a critical bug.

725
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,250
We planted a critical bug

726
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,490
in her code.

727
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,530
That guy's like the judge of hell.

728
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,010
Xuejiao, good luck.

729
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,140
Though I didn't sign up,

730
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,820
I'll always cheer for you.

731
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,340
He is really trouble.

732
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,690
A giant lackey.

733
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,900
You know him?

734
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,900
He's like the lab's chief of staff,

735
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,530
not a big boss,

736
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,620
but totally acts like one.

737
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,770
Likes to oversee

738
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,580
every little thing

739
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,970
in the organization, top to bottom.

740
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,420
Playing power games, pulling strings.

741
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,490
Every newbie

742
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,490
gets caught in his grip.

743
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,340
You've seen right through him.

744
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,380
I've taken plenty of hits
because of him.

745
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,820
Next.

746
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,140
Your turn.

747
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,690
A freshman?

748
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,580
What a bold move.

749
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,690
Hello, senior!

750
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,970
I'm just a freshman,

751
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,970
but I'm confident…

752
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,620
Hang on.

753
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,690
Your college entrance score

754
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,050
is by far the lowest

755
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,660
I've ever seen.

756
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,100
How did you even get in?

757
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,530
Still got that foul mouth.

758
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,820
Just love to embarrass people.

759
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,860
Well, that just means

760
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,660
I'm lucky.

761
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,290
Sorry.

762
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,010
Your good luck ends here.

763
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,010
Next.

764
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,450
Wait, senior.

765
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,770
At least give me a reason.

766
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,970
Do I need a reason to reject you?

767
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,250
At Capital University,

768
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,380
juniors

769
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,770
never question seniors.

770
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,450
Since when

771
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,690
did this rule pop up?

772
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,180
Starting tomorrow.

773
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,970
Next.

774
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,660
Lin Jiadong

775
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,860
really said that?

776
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,290
Word for word.

777
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,140
I swear.

778
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,490
This chief of staff

779
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,420
of yours

780
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,620
talks all sarcastic,

781
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,530
like some mean old witch.

782
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,450
He's got

783
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,490
the tiniest little mind, like a pea.

784
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,820
That's kinda true, though.

785
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,100
But you barely even know him.

786
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,050
Don't jump to conclusions.

787
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,380
Give it some time.

788
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,210
I didn't jump to conclusions at all.

789
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,690
I know him way too well.

790
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,770
I am just

791
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,490
stating facts here.

792
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,420
Besides, if this is

793
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,250
how your lab recruits,

794
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,290
you're missing out

795
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,820
on talents like me.

796
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,220
Just a few days ago,
you were avoiding me.

797
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,380
Why do you wanna get

798
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,700
into our lab now?

799
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,900
That's because

800
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,940
I need the credits.

801
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,860
However,

802
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,530
I'm not gonna

803
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,570
give you any special treatment.

804
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,940
If you want to be in the lab,

805
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,050
you gotta earn it.

806
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,380
I wasn't asking

807
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,380
for special treatment.

808
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,420
Lin,

809
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,300
I've got real skills.

810
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,530
I didn't get into Capital University

811
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,700
by luck.

812
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,740
And then, the first thing you did was

813
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,010
bomb the English placement test

814
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,860
and become the only freshman
who didn't pass.

815
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,010
Second,

816
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,610
you messed up picking electives

817
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,970
and actually had the nerve

818
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,570
to sign up for Professor Tan's lab.

819
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,380
Do you have to be that harsh?

820
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,450
Stand up.

821
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,780
You haven't shown

822
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,090
even a little bit

823
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,300
of what a Capital University student

824
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,220
is supposed to be like.

825
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,090
I gotta wake you up

826
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,940
a bit.

827
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,050
Start with the basics.

828
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,380
Don't expect to figure

829
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,170
everything out overnight.

830
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,610
If you need the credits,

831
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,090
wait till

832
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,010
someone drops a class,

833
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,130
and there's a vacancy.

834
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,570
The Autonomous Driving Lab,

835
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,450
honestly,

836
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,650
is out of your league

837
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,780
at the moment.

838
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,860
Lin Jiadong

839
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,650
wasn't totally wrong.

840
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,300
I said

841
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,380
I don't like that guy.

842
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,380
But he's in the lab.

843
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,610
We'll see.

844
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,820
Give it a month, tops.

845
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,260
You'll see my name

846
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,530
on that lab roster.

847
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,780
Maybe sooner.

848
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,300
Tomorrow is

849
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,570
Professor Tan's

850
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,570
first public programming class.

851
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,490
He always gives freshmen
a problem to solve.

852
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,740
Let's see if you can

853
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,900
make it past round one.

854
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,900
I guarantee!

855
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,740
I'm off to prep.

856
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,380
Sir,

857
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,860
what kind of work do you do?

858
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,420
Boring.

859
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,300
Shiyun.

860
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,860
Why are you avoiding me?

861
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,940
Avoiding you?

862
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,940
I'm not.

863
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,530
It's not like I care about you.

864
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,380
Why would I hide from you?

865
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,490
That's fine.

866
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,530
You don't care about me,

867
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,610
but I care about you.

868
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,820
In that case,

869
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,940
say no more.

870
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,820
Let's go.

871
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,130
You just stand here.

872
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,700
Pretty girl,

873
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,170
let me buy you a drink.

874
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,970
Shiyun.

875
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,130
Did you come here

876
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,900
just to piss off your mom?

877
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,970
Of course not.

878
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,650
Good.

879
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,700
Whatever you wanna do,
I'll do it with you.

880
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,740
Really?

881
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,610
Yeah.

882
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,900
So come on,

883
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,860
you're in a bar.

884
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,170
You have to drink.

885
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,740
Here.

886
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,900
I can't handle alcohol.

887
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,490
Didn't you say you'd do

888
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,450
whatever I wanna do?

889
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,700
Shiyun!

890
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,530
Come here!

891
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,380
I'm Zhou Shiyun,

892
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,170
from Class 1 Grade 12.

893
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,260
You, too!

894
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,860
Hope you never have to retake the exam!

895
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,260
Shiyun.

896
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,610
Today, I saw

897
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,340
a different you again.

898
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,300
Even when drinking,

899
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,010
you have to be the best.

900
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,650
Always out to win.

901
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,420
Drinking's

902
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,340
what makes you happiest now,

903
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,220
right?

904
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,010
Then I'll drink with you.

905
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,570
Be happy with you.

906
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,740
Seeing you happy

907
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,260
makes me happy.

908
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,170
It's true.

909
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,050
I'm very happy.

You scared me.

Where am I?

925
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,970
What happened to me?

926
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,780
Shiyun.

927
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,450
Get back.

928
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,170
Sit tight.

929
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,820
Shiyun.

930
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,220
Don't call my name.

931
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,420
So embarrassing!

932
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,940
Sorry,

933
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,340
I embarrassed you.

934
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,780
What you need to do now

935
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,650
is sit tight,

936
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,530
and I'll get you home.

937
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,050
Got it?

938
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,820
You're so nice.

939
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,090
Something's wrong with you.

940
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,090
No.

941
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,530
I just have a tiny

942
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,530
little bit of

943
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,650
an alcohol allergy.

944
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,700
I mean your brain.

945
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,090
Do you know

946
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,260
how hard it was dragging you

947
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,220
out of that bar?

948
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,090
If you can't handle it, don't drink.

949
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,860
Why did you have to act tough?

950
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,050
I didn't.

951
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,010
You told me to drink,

952
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,010
so I gotta drank.

953
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,380
So you'll do what I tell you to do?

954
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,650
What if I told you to jump off a cliff?

955
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,130
Bro, come back here.

956
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,570
Unbelievable.

957
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,490
You really would've gone, huh?

958
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,820
Are you dumb?

959
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,780
You're smiling.

960
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,490
You look better when you smile.

961
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,340
Back in high school,

962
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,700
you smiled all the time.

963
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,490
You were so great back then.

964
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,090
Pretty and smart.

965
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,780
Queen of the school.

966
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,650
No one could touch you.

967
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,610
Sometimes I wish

968
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,260
I could go back to those days, too.

969
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,610
But no way I'm repeating one more year.

970
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,970
But that version of you…

971
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,780
really…

972
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,220
really…

973
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,360
[Jushui Garden]

974
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,740
Why is the trash can here?

975
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,700
Perfect though.

976
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,340
Mingze?

977
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,490
How much did you drink?

978
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,050
How did you get this drunk?

979
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,900
You…

980
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,450
What are you even

981
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,570
doing here this early?

982
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,650
You just passed out?

983
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,090
Where's Shiyun?

984
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,940
What Shiyun?

985
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,530
Shiyun…

986
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,420
That's all you ever know.

987
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,220
You almost got hauled away

988
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,050
like a dead body.

989
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,900
Get out!

990
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,130
Get out now!

991
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,300
Come on!

992
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,610
My legs are numb.

993
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,860
You stink.

994
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,970
I'm gonna dump you here.

995
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,860
