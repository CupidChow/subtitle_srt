00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,010
These are

195
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,420
just theories.

196
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,010
Read them

197
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,740
by yourselves.

198
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,100
Okay.

199
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,450
That's it for today.

200
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,210
Class is over.

201
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,620
Thank you.

202
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,330
Bring your homework next time.

203
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,690
Okay.

204
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,620
Gu Xuejiao, right?

205
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,770
Bye, Professor.

206
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,330
Bye.

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,980
Would you like to be

208
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,010
my class representative?

209
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,810
Is this a reward?

210
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,100
The class representative

211
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,330
gets bonus points

212
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,810
on academic performance.

213
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,450
Could I ask for something else?

214
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,250
What is it?

215
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,980
I'd like to join your

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,100
elective course in the lab.

217
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,690
Not bad.

218
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,770
You have the courage

219
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,690
to sign up for that as a freshman.

220
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,940
You also removed the virus

221
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,180
and received points.

222
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,940
Only one person has done that

223
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,810
as far as I can remember.

224
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,860
You're going to test

225
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,780
the freshmen again?

226
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,420
It's the same trick for years.

227
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,450
You did it to me

228
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,570
when I was a freshman.

229
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,540
We must emphasize the security

230
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,970
of the programming environment.

231
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,060
I'm exploring their potential.

232
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,140
You're upgrading the virus?

233
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,970
Because

234
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,940
you cracked

235
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,730
the program.

236
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,940
This time,

237
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,730
I must up the game.

238
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
[Laboratory Building]

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,120
[LAB 309, Autonomous Driving Lab,
Capital University]

240
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,330
Go ahead.

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,330
Who said I can't pass

242
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,970
the first test

243
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,060
of Professor Tan's programming course?

244
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,940
Who said

245
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,610
I haven't placed myself in the position

246
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,780
of a college student?

247
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,940
And who said

248
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,660
I shouldn't

249
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,090
consider joining the lab?

250
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,300
Check this out.

251
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,300
Freshman lab member.

252
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,900
Impressive.

253
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,610
But do you have to be

254
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,260
so excited

255
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,380
like you won the lottery?

256
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,730
You're not the first freshman

257
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,180
who's been admitted to the lab.

258
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,690
I know.

259
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,180
The first one was you.

260
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,210
I'm the second.

261
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,300
Lin,

262
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,730
nice provocation tactic.

263
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,850
It almost drove me crazy.

264
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,450
But

265
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,780
since you are

266
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,730
my senior alumnus,

267
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,330
I will continue

268
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,260
to be your humble and prudent

269
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,690
freshman colleague in the lab.

270
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,180
Please take good care of me.

271
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,690
Now we're talking.

272
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,420
Welcome to the lab.

273
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,570
Also,

274
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,780
maybe I'm even better than you.

275
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,210
The virus

276
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,060
has been updated,

277
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,970
but I still removed it.

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,020
How do you know

279
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,970
it's been updated?

280
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,610
You're just a freshman

281
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,060
who barely took any courses.

282
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,690
I-I…

283
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,180
I was eager to join the lab.

284
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,570
So I did my homework.

285
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,850
Let me find the wealth position

286
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,970
in the lab.

287
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,140
That's where

288
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm going to sit.

289
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,850
Don't take it lightly.

290
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,490
It's not so easy

291
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,570
to complete this course.

292
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,140
How did you sneak in?

293
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,210
Get out…

294
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,260
You think you can just come in here?

295
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,810
Hello, senior.

296
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,690
I'm Gu Xuejiao

297
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,570
from Grade 2015, majoring in AI.

298
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,380
It's my first day here.

299
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,140
I took the elective course

300
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,060
of Professor Tan's programming practice.

301
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,540
From now on,

302
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,850
we'll see each other a lot.

303
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,210
Looking forward to working with you.

304
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,940
Didn't I fail you

305
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,850
in the interview?

306
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,810
Who took you in?

307
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,260
I did.

308
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,540
'Master' Lin?

309
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,260
I called you here because of this.

310
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,610
No one has signed up for Professor Tan's

311
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,660
elective course for years.

312
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,610
She's the only one this year.

313
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,730
He wants you

314
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,570
to do her paperwork.

315
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,540
Alright, I'm on it.

316
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,940
Tell you what.

317
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,660
It's easy to join us
but hard to complete the course.

318
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:57,940
I don't care

319
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,900
what tricks you pulled.

320
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,730
The real challenge is to

321
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,970
complete this course.

322
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,180
I'm willing to bet

323
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,690
that

324
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,330
your chances of failing

325
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,380
this elective course

326
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,180
are 99.99999%.

327
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,660
Let's wait and see.

328
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,970
I'm melting.

329
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,540
You're back.

330
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,090
It's almost autumn.

331
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,690
Why is it still so hot?

332
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,300
Turn on the AC.

333
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,330
Fine.

334
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,090
A calm mind brings natural coolness.

335
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,060
It's so hot these days.

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,420
Crazy late-summer heatwaves.

337
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,090
Xuejiao will find it

338
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,850
unbearable in here.

339
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,900
Xuejiao?

340
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,780
You're acting strange today.

341
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,610
I thought you

342
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,730
didn't really like her.

343
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,420
I just hate fools.

344
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,210
But now, she doesn't

345
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,420
look so stupid anymore.

346
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,570
So, we can

347
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,540
actually be friends.

348
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,420
Right.

349
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,140
When is she coming back?

350
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,180
I want to ask her

351
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,060
how she removed

352
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,180
that virus in class.

353
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,490

but it doesn't work.

355
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,450
Don't be like that.

356
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,660

Isn't the office of B&C Motors

361
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,780
way too fancy?

362
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,940
Also,

363
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,900
they approached us

364
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,210
for cooperation this time.

365
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,660
That's very sincere.

366
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,970

367
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,540
They're up to no good.

You flatter me.

387
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,210
Come on.

388
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,300
Here.

389
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,810
Thank you.

390
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,570
Here's the contract

391
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,300
drafted by

392
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,260
our legal department.

393
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,540
My goodness.

394
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,450
They're showing so much sincerity.

395
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,450
Ms. Zheng.

396
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,900
Why

397
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,540
is your investment ratio so low

398
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,420
in this contract?

399
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,660
We are working with

400
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,850
more than 30 universities
around the world.

401
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,380
This is the biggest investment

402
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,210
we have made.

403
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,970
But

404
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,380
this level of funding

405
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,780
is completely insufficient

406
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,610
to build a test track.

407
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,610
That's why

408
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,660
we'd like both of you

409
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,810
to work in Germany.

410
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,300
In Germany?

411
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,810
Germany.

412
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,690
Nice place.

413
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,610
Well…

414
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,900
They're trying
to get something for nothing.

415
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,900
What a fraud.

416
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,140
Germany is great.

417
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,660
Do they have no shame?

418
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,300
They said they'd spare no effort

419
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,020
to make it work.

420
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,850
In the end,

421
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,260
the effort is ours to make.

422
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,020
A large enterprise like B&C Motors

423
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,940
wouldn't let us

424
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,850
gain any advantage

425
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,610
in the contract.

426
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,730
They'll squeeze every last drop

427
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,020
of value from us

428
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,260
before they're done.

429
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,810
Yeah.

430
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,940
Less investment, more shares.

431
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,730
They only offer

432
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,730
a shared test track,

433
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,570
which is in Germany.

434
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,660
And they only help
the two of us with visas.

435
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,260
Enterprise-university

436
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,970
collaboration, my foot.

437
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,180
They're just exporting

438
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,210
the labor force overseas.

439
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,540
No way.

440
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,900
We can't sign the contract.

441
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,900
I'll look around

442
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,690
and see

443
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,690
what others offer.

444
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,690
I'm not going to…

445
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,660
It has to be them.

446
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,380
Come on.

447
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,780
We should turn them down

448
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,780
right now!

449
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,780
Since they can exploit us,

450
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,690
we can also exploit them.

451
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,570
Wait.

452
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,570
You really think

453
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,060
we can outplay them?

454
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,780
Forget it.

455
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,380
You'll see.

456
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,300
Where are you going?

457
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,610
Back to the lab.

458
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,780
Someone is waiting for me.

459
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,780
The equipment

460
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,690
is under maintenance.

461
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,490
Who's waiting for you?

462
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,560
[Laboratory Building]

463
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,960
[Autonomous Driving Lab
Outstanding Innovative Team Award]

464
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,810
Junlian may not be

465
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,730
a big company,

466
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,180
but

467
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,300
we've been

468
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,780
doing investments for years.

469
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,810
Insiders say

470
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,570
that I have insight.

471
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,660
I'm willing to run around

472
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,260
for any profitable project,

473
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,330
be it big or small.

474
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,260
So,

475
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,660
people in the industry
gave me a nickname…

476
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,770
Zhao Qiansun.

477
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,730
I know that.

478
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,450
Yeah.

479
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,970
I don't know

480
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,450
the technology,

481
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,100
but the moment I heard

482
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,660
that B&C Motors wanted to work with you,

483
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,010
I knew I had to invest in you.

484
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,250
Look at you.

485
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,210
Mr. Zhao, you're truly insightful.

486
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,420
Right.

487
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,250
What is B&C Motors

488
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,730
offering you

489
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,420
in the contract?

490
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,490
None of the terms

491
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,250
matter that much.

492
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,820
What matters

493
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,290
is that they have
the best technical team.

494
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,140
But you're from Capital University.

495
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,380
Isn't your team top-notch?

496
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,290
We must always

497
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,490
benchmark against the market.

498
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,820
No team and no technology can remain

499
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,970
top-notch forever.

500
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,290
Well said.

501
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,580
I bought you a car

502
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,340
but you sold it in two days.

503
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,290
You really think it's so easy

504
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,420
for me to make money?

505
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,940
That car is of no use to me.

506
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,380
And I get parking tickets all the time.

507
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,180
It's easier to get a taxi.

508
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,210
You think I bought you that car

509
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,620
to make things easy for you?

510
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,140
You're meant to…

511
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,450
Anyway, other kids go out for fun

512
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,900
on the weekends.

513
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,050
But you asked me

514
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,580
to pick you up and go home.

515
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,620
What's wrong with you?

516
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,380
I am having fun

517
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,620
with my friend.

518
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,420
Qi Lei went to college in another city.

519
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,340
We can't go out for fun.

520
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,730
So we're hanging out online.

521
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,210
Do you have to hang out with guys?

522
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,050
Can't you hang out with some girls?

523
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,820
For example,

524
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,490
Gu Xuejiao.

525
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,690
Xuejiao

526
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,250
never asks me out.

527
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,580
Why can't you ask her out?

528
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,730
I bought you that car

529
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,100
so that you could take the girls out

530
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,180
for a drive.

531
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,100
Son.

532
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,250
I know you're not so good at studying.

533
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,290
But do I really

534
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,100
have to

535
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,340
teach you everything in life?

536
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,340
But Xuejiao

537
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,900
doesn't buy it.

538
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,180
She doesn't like taking a drive.

539
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,620
Then what does she like?

540
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,900
Look into it.

541
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,820
I figured it out long ago.

542
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,900
She only

543
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,180
likes to read

544
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,770
and study.

545
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,380
She spends all day

546
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,380
in that stupid lab.

547
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,100
She is

548
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,290
different from your mom.

549
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,940
Your mom loves going for a drive.

550
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,380
She loves shopping

551
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,900
and wasting money.

552
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,180
Extravagantly.

553
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,050
You're saying

554
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,100
my mom's shallow, huh?

555
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,580
That's what you said.

556
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,380
I didn't say that.

557
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,420
Anyway,

558
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,860
Xuejiao is different.

559
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,290
Of course.

560
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,660
Otherwise,

561
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,250
you wouldn't like her so much.

562
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,490
I'm tired of it.

563
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,900
Are you

564
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,900
studying for the CET-4 and CET-6?

565
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,620
Why are we talking

566
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,490
about studying again?

567
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,660
I'm only a freshman.

568
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,340
I'll take the tests

569
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,380
before my senior year, okay?

570
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,340
You really don't get it, kid.

571
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,620
I was way smarter when I was your age.

572
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,530
What did you do?

573
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,180
You can take the tests
in the senior year,

574
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,210
but the person

575
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,620
who can help you prepare for the tests

576
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,100
can't wait that long.

577
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,210
That's right.

578
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,180
"That's right."

579
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,970
I've been

580
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,210
planning everything for you.

581
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,140
Dad.

582
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,450
You're the expert.

583
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,140
Stop the car.

584
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,250
There is a bookstore nearby.

585
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,900
I'll get the study materials.

586
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,580
Slow down.

587
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,180
Hello, Xuejiao?

588
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,250
Got a minute?

589
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,450
Help me.

590
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,970
I have done my best

591
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,620
to make you a handsome kid.

592
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,660
It's up to you

593
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,900
to improve the intelligence

594
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,380
of the next generation, son.

595
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,420
You're already studying

596
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,420
for the CET-4 and CET-6?

597
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm busy.

598
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,140
Talk later.

599
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,940
A cup of cappuccino, please.

600
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,690
My colleague will make it for you.

601
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,210
I want the one in your hand.

602
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,180
It's not for sale.

603
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,940
Why are you here?

604
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,010
How does it taste?

605
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,420
The little fox is so cute.

606
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,580
I can't bear to drink it.

607
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,250
The little fox is cute.

608
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,250
You weren't there when I went to the lab

609
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,970
early this morning.

610
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,140
I asked Gao Rui

611
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,420
and he said you were here.

612
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,450
Didn't you

613
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,660
stop the part-time job long ago?

614
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,580
Is it voluntary labor?

615
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,100
Part-time jobs made me realize

616
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,970
that brainless work

617
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,620
helps me think clearly.

618
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,530
You're thinking about the B&C Motors?

619
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,690
Everyone in the lab knows.

620
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,620
It's good news

621
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,290
that an industry leader wants to

622
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,180
work with you.

623
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,820
An industry leader

624
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,380
and an industry bully

625
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,250
are only a thin line apart.

626
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,210
Acquire elite skills

627
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,770
solely to serve the powerful.

628
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,820
I know you tend to look for

629
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,180
optimal solutions.

630
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,140
B&C Motors is the optimal solution

631
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,380
at the present stage.

632
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,290
But who's willing to be

633
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,690
a workslave for a company?

634
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,900
It's not just that.

635
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,100
I simply…

636
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,900
hate to fall twice

637
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,820
in the same place.

638
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,770
It's the era of a free economy

639
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,530
but the industry is monopolized.

640
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,820
B&C Motors has reached the top

641
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,860
in technology

642
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,290
and R&D.

643
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,770
They're even trying to

644
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,010
monopolize the talents.

645
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,340
It may help them

646
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,490
minimize their marginal cost

647
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,530
to the extreme,

648
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,940
but it reduces

649
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,010
top talents like you

650
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,660
to mere screws in the machine.

651
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,820
Your marginal benefits

652
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,250
get minimized to the extreme.

653
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,100
In the end,

654
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,100
they can also

655
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,180
kick you out

656
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,820
and take possession of the work.

657
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,100
How do you know all this?

658
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,340
I…

659
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,100
I…

660
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,140
Well,

661
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,900
they write about it

662
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,010
in the official accounts

663
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,140
of economics

664
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,290
all day long.

665
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,210
Did I say something wrong?

666
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,770
Not at all.

667
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,450
So

668
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,860
what's your plan?

669
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,010
An enterprise that monopolizes

670
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,290
the market and talents

671
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,940
must get a taste

672
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,050
of its own medicine.

673
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,730
Yeah.

674
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,100
Wait.

675
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,050
Here.

676
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,180
Thank you.

677
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,690
You're also from
Capital University, right?

678
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,420
Yeah.

679
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,210
That's why you look familiar.

680
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,180
What do you study?

681
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,380
I'm a sophomore
in Physics and Electronics.

682
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,970
I'm…

683
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,940
Physics and Electronics?

684
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,180
It's right next door to us.

685
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,730
I'm from the Institute
for Interdisciplinary Information.

686
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,690
Interdisciplinary Information?

687
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,580
This is destiny.

688
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,340
Add me on WeChat.

689
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,250
Feel free

690
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,820
to ask me

691
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,660
any questions.

692
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,450
I…

693
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,580
Your QR code.

694
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,690
Sure.

695
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,100
You can ask me about anything.

696
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,380
You too.

697
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,860
Your boyfriend?

698
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,050
He…

699
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,180
He…

700
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,180
None of your business.

701
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,420
What's wrong?

702
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,180
We are alumni.

703
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,900
Why are you so hostile?

704
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,100
As the saying goes,

705
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,820
"Be on guard against fire,
theft, and seniors."

706
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,940
Totally.

707
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,690
Senior.

708
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,580
Totally, little fox.

709
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,450
Hello.

710
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,620
I'll be right there.

711
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,100
I'll ask someone

712
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,580
to take you to the reception room.

713
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,620
His surname is Gao.

714
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,100
The most dumb-looking one in the lab.

715
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,010
Would you like to…

716
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,820
I have to go.

717
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,580
- I'm meeting…
- Don't tell me

718
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,940
you're meeting a girl.

719
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,620
Why not?

720
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,340
See you.

721
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,970
No coffee when you have a cold.

722
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,730
Her face…

723
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,940
Isn't she

724
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,210
the goddess in my dream?

725
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,620
Goddess.

726
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,050
Goddess.

727
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,420
Is this what they call

728
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,450
a dream coming true?

729
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,380
Senior.

730
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,250
Senior.

731
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,340
Be careful

732
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,140
with these.

733
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,620
Don't drop them.

734
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,180
Okay.

735
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,970
I need them for my reports

736
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,730
to the higher-ups.

737
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,420
Go ahead.

738
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,420
These crappy machines…

739
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,380
I-I…

740
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,420
I must seize the chance

741
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,900
to attract her attention.

742
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,660
No idea.

743
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,730
Maybe he wants to

744
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,770
sell them for money.

745
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,860
Our senior really

746
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,210
cares about the university.

747
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,660
Hello.

748
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,490
What?

749
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,580
Principal Li values my thesis?

750
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,490
And Principal Liu wants to see me?

751
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,340
Lin.

752
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,620
I have to criticize you.

753
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,380
Scientific researchers

754
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,140
must focus on the studies.

755
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,180
How can you

756
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,050
take on

757
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,210
so many social activities?

758
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,620
I'm not mad at you.

759
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,530
I'm just saying

760
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,210
that as an assistant,

761
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,050
you must learn

762
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,250
to share my burden

763
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,490
so that I can focus on my research.

764
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,620
Alright, that's it.

765
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,210
Talk later.

766
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,340
Young people nowadays

767
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,210
make me worried.

768
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,490
Are you waiting for someone?

769
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,620
The equipment is under maintenance.

770
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,690
Many people are on leave.

771
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,010
Who are you waiting for?

772
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,010
I'll look around.

773
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,290
No need.

774
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,010
I'll call him.

775
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:42,940
Hello.

776
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,860
Lin.

777
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,580
This is your cousin.

778
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,530
Hello.

779
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,860
Are you done with work?

780
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,490
You remember you agreed

781
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,210
to help me, right?

782
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,770
I…

783
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,730
I remember, of course.

784
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,900
So

785
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,210
when shall we meet?

786
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,820
Today.

787
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,530
See you at my university canteen.

788
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,490
Okay.

789
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,210
Be right there.

790
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,420
Bye.

791
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,340
Right,

792
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,900
I went through

793
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,940
the contract of B&C Motors.

794
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,490
The terms are harsh.

795
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,050
Why didn't you

796
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,940
come to Linqi?

797
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,820
I didn't want to.

798
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,050
Our family business

799
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,050
isn't as big as the B&C Motors?

800
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,770
Huh?

801
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,450
I have to work for them
if I take their money.

802
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,290
I don't want to

803
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,820
commit fraud for them.

804
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,620
Isn't enough that you're taking care

805
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,580
of those two?

806
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,250
Leave me out of it.

807
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,210
You'd better

808
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,940
not hand any proposals to Linqi.

809
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,530
B&C Motors

810
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,580
sent me a new contract

811
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,050
with much better terms.

812
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,580
But the investment

813
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,210
hasn't reached

814
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,050
my expectations.

815
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,140
They gave in?

816
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,970
This is not their style.

817
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,050
They usually won't budge

818
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,140
no matter what.

819
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,900
Absolutely arrogant.

820
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,690
Because I spread the news

821
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,820
that Junlian is also approaching us.

822
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,140
Way to go, cousin.

823
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,820
You've played the B&C Motors.

824
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,010
Congratulations.

825
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,420
But I have another idea now.

826
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,100
I…

827
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,210
I need to take this.

828
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,210
Save me a spot.

829
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,940
Okay.

830
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,900
Hello.

831
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,530
Aren't you

832
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,250
meeting someone?

833
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,180
Yeah, I am.

834
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,660
Xuejiao.

835
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,690
There you are.

836
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,530
It's you again?

837
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,620
Well…

838
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,340
Well…

839
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,210
Let's eat together.

840
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,490
Xuejiao.

841
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,250
Try this.

842
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,180
It's amazing.

843
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,690
It's enough.

844
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,820
Have it yourself.

845
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,490
Isn't it amazing?

846
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,180
So spicy. I can't breathe.

847
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,940
Really?

848
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,140
Have this then.

849
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,210
Spicy stir-fried carrots.

850
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,180
It helps you breathe.

851
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,620
Come on.

852
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,100
No, thanks.

853
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,940
Thanks.

854
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,180
Dig in.

855
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,940
Mr. Ex-boyfriend,

856
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,250
you're really a living curse in my life.

857
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,250
Thanks.

858
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,140
Lin.

859
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,580
Waiting for your girlfriend?

860
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,620
So sweet.

861
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,050
He got the dishes,

862
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,290
set the chopsticks,

863
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,050
and even brought her water.

864
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,210
I have to learn from you.

865
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,290
Lin is indeed very sweet

866
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,770
to his cousin.

867
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,770
He'll be even sweeter

868
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,620
to his girlfriend.

869
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,210
Right?

870
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,620

871
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,580
Lin is meeting

872
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,940
with you?

873
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,100
Cousin?

874
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,860
She's not

875
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,180
your girlfriend?

876
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,770
Let me introduce myself.

877
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,900

879
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,530
Are you

880
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,450
Xuejiao 's boyfriend?

881
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,210
- No.
- No.

882
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,900
Not yet.

883
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,050
But I will be one day.

884
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:13,860
Dig in.

885
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,940
It's turning cold.

886
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,730
Dig in.

887
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,010
Avoid spices since you have a cold.

888
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,340
Y-You caught a cold?

889
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,620
Come here.

890
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,380
Do I have to stuff tissue

891
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,340
into your nose

892
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,660
for you to understand?

893
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,380
Should I get you

894
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,180
some medicine?

895
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,210
I'll change the dishes for you.

896
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,100
No need.

897
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,340
Are you sure?

898
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,250
Really?

899
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,690

No need.

902

It will spill.

903
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,450
It's pointless, no matter what.

904
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,250
True.

905
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,490
The opponent is too simple-minded

906
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,970
for you to take extreme measures.

907
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,530

I'll help Yi Tianyu

with English.

912
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,650
- See you around.
- Bye.

Bye.

914

918
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,260
deceive others, but not me.

919
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,130

923
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,450
You met Lin Zhiyue?

924
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,450
Tell me about her.

926

have food with us?

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,450
Have food?

928
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,420
You had dinner?

929
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,740
I-I was thinking

930
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,010
about buying you dinner.

931
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,420
Why are you overly attentive

932
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,450
for no reason?

933
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,220
Spill it out or I'm leaving.

934
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,170

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,340
have a boyfriend?

No.

00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,740
Isn't she looking forward
to a relationship?

941
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,740
Not really.

942
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,490
The word 'man' doesn't exist

943
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,940

944
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,970

945
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,300
What…

946
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,530
What kind of dictionary is that?

947
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,820
She should reprint it.
