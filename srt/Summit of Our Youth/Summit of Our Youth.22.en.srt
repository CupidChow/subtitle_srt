[Episode 22]

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,170
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

18
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,940
The vehicle's onboard system

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,860
logs all operations.

20
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,370
If we analyze them, it'll be clear.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,500
This part is

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,620
even more suspicious.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,370
The company's server

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,700
was undergoing maintenance

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,620
during that exact period.

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,580
So the program logs

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,090
from Yi Tianyu's accident vehicle

28
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,010
has been lost.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,940
But such an operation

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,170
requires great technical support.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,340
Mr. Yi is in the financial field.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,220
How did he do it?

33
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,740
If this car accident

34
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,690
was a man-made one,

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,500
he must have a technical helper

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,850
in Huachuang.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,900
We can track the technical issues.

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,940
But the traitor…

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,220
Let's put this on hold.

How can we stop?

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,810
The accident briefing is in two days.

42
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,850
They only gave us

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,650
72 hours because

44
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,060
it's the golden hours for crisis PR.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,250
I bet they want to

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,570
make it final at the briefing.

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,090

Wait for my update.

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,060
I need some fresh air.

52
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,180
He's already given up?

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,690
You underestimate him.

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,810
Do you really think

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,940
Yi Tianyu

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,810
orchestrated all this?

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,650
He staged

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,370
this car accident?

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,220
What do you think?

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,780
I don't know.

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,460
That's why I'm so clueless right now.

62
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,180
But if he did

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,090
orchestrate this,

64
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,180
I bet he was coming after me.

65
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,180
Then I'm more obligated

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,300
to solve the problem.

67
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,250
Never blame the victim.

68
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,940
What you need to do now

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,570
is to take a nap

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,940
and rest well.

71
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,180
Come on.

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,570
So?

73
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,650
Do you trust me?

74
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,410
Do you believe

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,570
that we can

76
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,570
get through this together?

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,130
Of course.

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,340
Just like every time before.

79
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,300
This time,

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,460
we'll surely get through it, too.

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,690
Stop thinking.

82
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,810
Tackle a problem at its source.

83
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,620

about Gu Xuejiao.

91
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,540
Xuejiao?

92
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,010
I heard that he had been discharged

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,810
and came to visit.

94
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,890
Uncle Yi told me

95
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,620
that he lives here.

96
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,370
Perfect.

97
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,180
Give me a hand.

98
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,770
I couldn't even park because of him.

99
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,980
Let me park first.

100
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,940
Come on, hold him.

101
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,450
Be careful.

102
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,420
Be careful.

103
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,740
Be careful. Here's the key card.

104
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,300

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,180
Be careful.

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,810
Okay.

107
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,420
You got wasted

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,540
first thing out of the hospital?

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,130
Bring me another bottle.

110
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,500
I can drink.

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,100
Yi Tianyu.

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,570
Yi Tianyu.

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,860
Although the program log

114
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,130
stored in the cloud is lost,

115
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,010
there must be clues

116
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,450
left in his mobile phone,

117
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,300
more or less.

118
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,450
It's the same as last time.

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,250
His password

120
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,810
is still my birthday.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,450
Someone's a pro at typing passwords.

122
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,570
You've recovered.

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,940
You tricked me.

124
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,500
You tricked me, too.

125
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,740
Didn't you come

126
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,770
to get something

127
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,500
from me?

128
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,420
What is it?

129
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,250
I'll help you.

130
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,890
I want the truth about the C2 accident.

131
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,060
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

132
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,100
Everything's gone.

133
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,370
The game isn't over yet.

134
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,660
What's the rush?

135
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,300
Your game is ending.

136
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,130
I'm calling the police.

137
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,420
You…

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,810
Why are you calling the police?

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,100
Because my leg recovered

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,620
too soon?

141
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,890
You orchestrated

142
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,420
the C2 accident.

143
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,890
How could you wrong me?

144
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm the victim.

145
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,690
Lin Zhihua is the victim.

146
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,450
He may be the victim,

147
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,620
but I'm the one who's hurt.

148
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,740
You've lost it.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,860
Open the door.

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,770
Nobody has figured out

151
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,940
why the brakes of the C2

152
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,370
suddenly failed.

153
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,660
If you just walk away,

154
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,450
aren't you scared

155
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,420
that those sold C2s

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,540
will have the same problem?

157
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,810
I hold the switch right here.

158
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,370
If you walk out of that door today,

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,100
this accident won't be

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,060
the only one of its kind.

161
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,370
Will you bear to see

162
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,180
innocent people

163
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,300
suffer the consequences of your choice?

164
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,780
Yi Tianyu.

165
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,540
You're not like this.

166
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,570
Am I not?

167
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,260
Give it a try and you'll see.

168
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,090
Give it a try.

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,450
I'll keep this for you.

170
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,420
Do you know

171
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,850
how many laws you've violated?

172
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,180
It's because

173
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,810
you don't play along.

174
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,900
I told Lin Zhihua you were going

175
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,570
to your parents.

176
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,300
Am I considerate?

177
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,660
Where will you sleep?

178
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,850
I only have one bedroom.

179
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,690
If you don't feel comfortable,

180
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,260
sleep on the sofa.

181
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,570
This is my home.

182
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,330
You think you can lock me out?

183
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,020
Stop looking.

184
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,610
There's nothing in there.

185
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,660
What's wrong?

186
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,210
Why did you

187
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,090
ask me to come here?

188
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,300
I got the footage

189
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,780
outside the server room.

190
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,850
How did you get it?

191
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,900
But the footage

192
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,970
on the day of the accident

193
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,330
was intentionally overwritten.

194
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,490
Home PCs

195
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,780
can't handle this computing load.

196
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,450
I asked for permission

197
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,210
to use the lab.

198
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,020
Data recovery can be accelerated.

199
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,260
We'll find the traitor

200
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,970
very soon.

201
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,090
Done.

202
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,660
Isn't it…

203
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,140
Is Siqi at the company?

204
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,940
What's wrong?

205
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,380
She's taken a long leave.

206
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,090
I bet Xuejiao knows where she lives.

207
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,730
Hello.

208
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,660
The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

209
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,780
Sorry.

210
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,490
The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

211
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,780
Hello, Auntie.

212
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,900
May I speak to Xuejiao?

213
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,140
Xuejiao?

214
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,260
She hasn't been back these days.

215
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,810
What's wrong?

216
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,420
Nothing, Auntie.

217
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,420
I got confused.

218
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,180
Xuejiao came to the company
early in the morning.

219
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,180
Bye.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,560
[Inpatient Department]

221
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,020
Mom,

222
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,260
the operation is tomorrow.

223
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,450
You'd better be careful.

224
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,850
The caregiver said

225
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,140
you slipped a few days ago.

226
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,140
Thankfully, the surgery
doesn't have to be delayed.

227
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,140
I heard

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
that the surgeon
who's going to operate on me

229
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,940
came all the way

230
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,210
from a different city.

231
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,690
Is it very expensive?

232
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,450
You changed my medicine

233
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,610
to the imported ones.

234
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,420
Where did you get so much money?

235
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,850
The company

236
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,810
offered me equity

237
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,730
and gave me a raise.

238
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,660
Xuejiao helped with that again,

239
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,940
didn't she?

240
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,690
She's such a good friend.

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,730
You must

242
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,330
repay her well.

243
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,260
You wanted to be a civil servant

244
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,610
in our hometown to take care of me.

245
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,540
But my treatment

246
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,260
is costly.

247
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,140
So, you gave up on the exam

248
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,810
and joined Huachuang

249
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,660
for a high salary.

250
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,020
If only

251
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,060
I hadn't held you back.

252
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,780
Mom.

253
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,940
Why are you saying this?

254
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,490
We've looked

255
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,660
everywhere for her.

256
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,020
Seriously,

257
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,260
where else could she go?

258
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,570
One more place to check.

259
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,810
Where?

260
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,060
H-How did you get in?

261
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,660
What do you want for breakfast?

262
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,140
I'll cook for you.

263
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,140
The virus program of C2.

264
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,810
The safety of drivers.

265
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,260
You…

266
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,210
You…

267
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,540
You're quite something.

268
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,210
Yi Tianyu.

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,970
The show is about to begin.

270
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,490
Don't forget

271
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,780
what I told you.

272
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,420
Xuejiao!

273
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,090
Xuejiao!

274
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,850
Show some manners

275
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,780
as a visitor, okay?

276
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,450
Lin.

277
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,420
Xuejiao.

278
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,020
Not the bedroom.

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,090
My girlfriend is in there.

280
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,610
Whenever you see a strap

281
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,260
on the handle,

282
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,610
you'll know that I'm inside.

283
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,420
If you barge into

284
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,180
the bathroom,

285
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,940
I swear I'll call the police.

286
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,570
So?

287
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,690
Do you trust me?

288
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,420
Do you believe that we can

289
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,490
get through this together?

290
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,450
Of course.

291
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,140
Just like every time before.

292
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,530
Hear that?

293
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,730
She's in the shower.

294
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,180
You can't go in there.

295
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,250
Why do you have the time

296
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,250
to visit my home?

297
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,620
If I remember correctly,

298
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,210
the accident briefing

299
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,250
is in a day and a half.

300
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,660
Yeah, I remember.

301
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,620
Since you're here,

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,820
have some tea.

303
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,530
I forgot.

304
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,490
You're probably not in the mood.

305
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,340
After all,

306
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,620
you're going to lose everything.

307
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,100
Actually,

308
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,730
you reminded me.

309
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,940
Xuejiao's college roommate

310
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,380
brought her a box of fine tea

311
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,380
made in her hometown.

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,340
I forgot

313
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,940
where I put it.

314
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,900
Once I find it,

315
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,180
I'll bring you some to try.

316
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,690
Alright, I'll be waiting.

317
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,050
Yi Tianyu.

318
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,050
Stop making mistakes.

319
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,010
They don't serve nice tea in jail.

320
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,420
You made me do this.

321
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,290
My roommate brought me a nice tea?

322
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,010
Siqi brought us tea.

323
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,860
My hometown

324
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,100
is known for tea production.

325
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,050
Siqi.

326
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,820
Flash drive.

327
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,050
It's one and a half days left

328
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,530
until the accident briefing.

329
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,380
Yi Tianyu still

330
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,050
holds all the evidence.

331
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Gu Xuejiao.

332
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,730
You can figure something out.

333
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,940
Xuejiao.

334
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,140
What's wrong?

335
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,730
Xuejiao.

336
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,290
Get lost.

337
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,690
Okay.

338
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,690
I'll leave.

339
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,420
I'll do whatever you ask me to

340
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,450
as long as you stop crying.

341
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,690
What if I ask you to stop?

342
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,770
No way.

343
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,530
Anything except for that.

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,180
How about this?

345
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,660
As long as you behave,

346
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,210
I'll take you out.

347
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,530
The soft approach works on him.

348
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,450
Don't have to go to work?

349
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,620
I have my staff.

350
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,050
Anyway,

351
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,820
Huachuang is already in my possession.

352
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,580
Nothing matters more than you.

353
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,530
I don't like love-struck guys.

354
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,940
Okay.

355
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,050
Then I'll go to work.

356
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,620
Qi Lei will take you out.

357
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,140
Where do you want to go?

358
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,180
None of your business.

359
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,690
I want my card back.

360
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,100
How could I let you pay?

361
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,860
Listen.

362
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,210
Use my add-on card

363
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,100
to buy some outfits

364
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,140
for the upcoming

365
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,290
accident briefing.

366
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,860
After all, you'll come with me.

367
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,580
You just came out alone?

368
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,580
Lin.

369
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,140
You can't give up without a fight.

370
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,010
I'm still biding my time.

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,900
I didn't see her,

372
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,340
but I'm sure

373
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,210
she has a plan.

374
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,050
I just don't know

375
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,100
what she's planning.

376
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,290
I believe in her.

377
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,100
We share the same goal.

378
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,340
So what are we

379
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,140
doing next?

380
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,580
Next?

381
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,860
Next, things must unravel

382
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,450
according to Yi Tianyu's plan.

383
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,900
The more we play along,

384
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,580
the more likely it is for Xuejiao

385
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,340
to find a chance.
