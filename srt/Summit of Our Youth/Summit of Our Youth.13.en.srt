00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,690
on my own.

194
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,730
It's good enough.

195
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,210
Let's go.

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,570
No thanks, I'll pass.

197
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,610
I don't really know anyone

198
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,260
in the lab.

199
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,490
You don't?

200
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,300
Don't you know

201
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,570
me and Gao Rui?

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,730
Cheers.

203
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,260
Come on.

206
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,780
Take over the mic for now.

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,570
Okay.

208
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,420
Why are you drinking?

209
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,810
It's hard on your liver.

210
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,900
It's fine to drink

211
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,780
once in a while.

214
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,810

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,060
Okay.

251
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,850
There are seven or eight solutions

252
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,020
in programming languages.

258
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,490
Then

259
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,610
it depends on the code logic,

260
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,810
whether you can

266
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,210
I'll definitely maximize efficiency,

267

it's good enough.

274
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,940
Then we'll have to

336
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,770
But without a great tutor,

337
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,180

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,900
I haven't

349
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,770

350
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,660

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,340
The emblem of our university.

352
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,690
I have one, too.

353
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,290
This is different.

354
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,900
It has my name on it.

355
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,860
I never wore it when I was at school.

356
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,210
That's because

357
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,690
you don't love your university.

358
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,290
That's because my cousin has OCD

359
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,770
and won't let me
make holes in my clothes.

360
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,340
Your cousin?

361
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,580
She's here?

362
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,380
Where is she?

363
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,770
No, she's not.

364
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,730
Go back to sleep.

365
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,860
I just thought about it.

366
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,530
If you want to

367
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,050
achieve everything

368
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,820
with that code,

369
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,050
it's likely going to result in

370
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,100
a process deadlock.

371
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,420
Deadlock?

372
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,290
When two processes are both waiting

373
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,940
for each other's

374
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,860
computational results

375
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,660
to proceed,

376
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,490
they end up in a mutual waiting state

377
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,140
and halt completely.

378
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,820
This is called a process deadlock.

379
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,970
Do you get it?

380
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,250
You don't get it,

381
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,580
or you refuse to get it.

382
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,530
I think I'm drunk.

383
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,770
Do you know how to break

384
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,730
a process deadlock?

385
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,900
It requires external intervention

386
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,100
to break resource-holding conditions.

387
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,210
Where is

388
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,290
everyone?

389
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,860
I want to drink more.

390
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,900
Where are we?

391
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,690
At your favorite Capital University.

392
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,730
So what are we doing?

393
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,770
You're so drunk.

394
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,140
I'm taking you back to your dorm.

395
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,690
I can't walk anymore.

396
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,180
I-I'm not going back.

397
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,660
I can't walk anymore.

398
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,340
I thought you'd never get drunk.

399
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,820
But you barely took a sip.

400
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,730
Where do you want to go?

401
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,660
I'll go wherever

402
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,420
you're going.

403
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,820
To Germany?

404
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,620
No, thanks.

405
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,690
You're not allowed to go, either.

406
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,420
I thought

407
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,860
you'd go wherever I go.

408
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,420
Don't go.

409
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,140
Alright, we need to hurry up.

410
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,010
You must get back

411
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,380
before they lock the doors.

412
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,490
Lin Zhihua.

413
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,210
Lin Zhihua.

414
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,580
Actually, I have a secret.

415
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,530
What are you mumbling?

416
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,970
I said,

417
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,010
"Actually, I have a secret."

418
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,900
What secret?

419
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,450
Lin Zhihua.

420
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,420
Lin Zhihua.

421
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:45,900
Here.

422
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,860
Actually,

423
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,940
I really have a secret.

424
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,050
Trying to sneak a kiss again?

425
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,660
Sneak?

426
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,940
I kissed you fair and square.

427
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,420
Fine.

428
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,770
You kissed me fair and square.

429
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,970
And I liked it.

430
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,050
Happy now?

431
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,290
You're much cuter

432
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,940
this time.

433
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,420
No one has ever

434
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,580
said that about me.

435
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,860
What do you mean by 'this time'?

436
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,140
Actually,

437
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,530
I came back from

438
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,100
ten years in the future.

439
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,520
[One-minute trial run
of the light show code completed]

440
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,490
There will be a significant rise.

441
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,620
This will be

442
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,100
extremely popular.

443
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,100
It may even bring honor to the country.

444
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,900
How do you know

445
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,730
it's been updated?

446
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,380
You're just a freshman

447
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,860
who barely took any courses.

448
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,340
I…

449
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,970
I was eager to join the lab.

450
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,250
So I did my homework.

451
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,970
Why should I bother with a kid?

452
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,340
It's beneath me.

453
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,770
But since I started over…

454
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,860
What do you mean?

455
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,050
And met you again.

456
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,010
Do you want to know

457
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,140
what you'll be like

458
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,380
in ten years?

459
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,380
I really value

460
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,180
this opportunity.

461
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,450
I gave up the chance

462
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,730
to be a formal employee

463
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,380
to join the tech team.

464
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,210
Miss Gu.

465
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,660
You do have some

466
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,620
amazing achievements.

467
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,690
But your experience

468
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,770
doesn't quite match

469
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,940
our tech team.

470
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,050
I quit.

471
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,490
Lin Zhihua.

472
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,140
Have I offended you?

473
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,210
Why are you picking on me?

474
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,250
I'm "picking on you"
because I didn't hire you?

475
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,900
You gave up

476
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,580
your promotion

477
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,690
and everything for a guy.

478
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,620
You're still a replaceable

479
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,860
outsourced worker after five years.

480
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,770
You quit the job

481
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,730
just because you failed

482
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,420
to get transferred.

483
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,340
You can't prioritize properly

484
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,530
and crack under pressure.

485
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,210
You'll only

486
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,050
be a liability.

487
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,420
I accept it if I'm not qualified.

488
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,970
But I won't accept unfair treatment.

489
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,490
No, I don't want to know.

490
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,860
I bet it's nothing good.

491
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,050
You…

492
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,820
Your face

493
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,730
constitutes my nightmares.

494
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,770
You discriminate
against us outsourced workers,

495
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,580
and let your lackey

496
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,820
change my program

497
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,820
to get Zhou Shiyun promoted.

498
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,450
Everything I've worked so hard for

499
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,380
and sold my soul for

500
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,100
is worth

501
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,050
nothing to you.

502
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,180
If it weren't for you,

503
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,180
I wouldn't have come back.

504
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,050
"Sold your soul"?

505
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,820
Do you have to be so dramatic?

506
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,380
You keep gaslighting me,
but I have to sell my soul

507
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,820
and wear a smile at work.

508
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,730
But if I hadn't come back,

509
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,180
I wouldn't have

510
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,530
what I have now.

511
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,690
Do you know

512
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,940
how much I like my current self?

513
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,100
So,

514
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,730
I don't know

515
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,860
if I should hate you

516
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,730
or thank you.

517
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,250
Doesn't matter.

518
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,660
Anyway,

519
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,010
if you were that guy
from ten years later,

520
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,730
there is

521
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,660
absolutely

522
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,730
no way

523
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,900
I would like you.

524
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,940
Absolutely no way.

525
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,660
It's okay.

526
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,860
It's fine.

527
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,340
Anyway, you're not

528
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,050
that guy from ten years later.

529
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,180
Shu Lan.

530
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,690
I can't breathe.

531
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,940
Are you trying to kill me?

532
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,820
I was about to be nicer to you,

533
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,580
but look at you,

534
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,730
coming back drunk last night,

535
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,580
reeking of alcohol.

536
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,490
I got up early in the morning

537
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,340
and lined up

538
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,490
at the supermarket to get it.

539
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,490
Last night…

540
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,820
We are both adults.

541
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,210
So what if I kissed him?

542
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,420
Actually,

543
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,450
I have a secret.

544
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,010
What got into you?

545
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,010
What secret?

546
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,620
Did I tell him or not?

547
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,770
Did I?

548
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,900
I don't think so.

549
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,380
Did I?

550
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,140
No way.

551
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,530
What are you doing?

552
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,940
Having a beer in the day?

553
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,860
I got wasted last night.

554
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,730
I'm trying to remember what happened.

555
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,530
You were so good

556
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,140
at memorizing vocabulary.

557
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,210
You weren't drinking

558
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,660
to boost your memory.

559
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,290
It's not the same.

560
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,900
Do you know what it looks like

561
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,660
right now?

562
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,010
Like you just broke up.

563
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,820
Absolutely not.

564
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,860
Getting nervous, huh?

565
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,530
Let me think.

566
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,290
You went to the party last night

567
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,770
and met

568
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,660
an interesting guy.

569
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,580
You got more and more
in tune as you talked.

570
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,730
You even thought that you met

571
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,940
the love of my life.

572
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,210
Then he slowly approached you

573
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,770
and said,

574
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,380
"Want to learn about our gym courses?"

575
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,290
You woke up this morning,

576
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,100
feeling deceived.

577
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,140
It infuriated you.

578
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,490
"What a scam!"

579
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,100
That's why

580
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,420
you're drowning your sorrows.

581
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:09,940
Right?

582
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,100
I really admire you, Sun Tiantian.

583
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,290
You missed every single point.

584
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,970
But anyway,

585
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,970
drinking only makes you feel worse.

586
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,770
Drinking away your sorrows
just makes them worse.

587
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,490
Here.

588
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,250
Try my new recipe.

589
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,940
My exclusive secret recipe.

590
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,970
Crazy Good Bubble Tea.

591
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,820
Thanks, Tiantian.

592
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,180
But I can't drink anything anymore.

593
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,450
Just take a sip.

594
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,820
This is my new recipe.

595
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,900
Refreshing and smooth.

596
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,490
I promise, with one sip,

597
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,340
all your troubles

598
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,210
will go away.

599
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,770
Then I hope

600
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,580
I can remember

601
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,530
what happened last night.

602
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,530
What secret?

603
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,450
Trying to sneak a kiss again?

604
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,010
Sneak?

605
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,180
I kissed you fair and square.

606
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,770
Lin Zhihua.

607
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,660
Lin Zhihua.

608
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,140
You remember now?

609
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,100
What is it?

610
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,730
I remember now.

611
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,050
I remember…

612
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,620
Wait.

613
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,050
What is this recipe?

614
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,180
How come I don't remember

615
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,940
what I should

616
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,580
and remember

617
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,290
what I shouldn't?

618
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,620
I'm going back.

619
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,010
I have to say

620
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,690
that your recipe is quite something.

621
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,530
But let me

622
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,530
rename it next time.

623
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,860
Don't call it 'Crazy Good' and stuff.

624
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,450
It's hard to remember.

625
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,530
See you around.

626
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,580
Your bag, Xuejiao.

627
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,730
Your bag.

628
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm off.

629
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,340
Bye.

630
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,340
Stop drinking.

631
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,180
Bye.

632
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,740
Come on.

633
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,260
Lin, hurry up.

634
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,300
The Germans

635
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,090
are eagerly

636
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,900
waiting for us.

637
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,450
Are you so eager to leave?

638
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,050
Don't you have

639
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,050
anything that keeps you here?

640
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,780
None of your business.

641
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,700
Anyway, you do.

642
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,820
Hurry up.

643
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,860
I can't bear

644
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,340
to leave our campus.

645
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,940
How about this?

646
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,300
Let's get some gifts

647
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,220
to take with us.

648
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,090
Gifts?

649
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,740
Gifts.

650
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,170
Sure.

651
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,490
I'll check the store on campus.

652
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,300
Good idea.

653
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,010
Go ahead.

654
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,380
Be careful.

655
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,380
Get something nice.

656
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,130
Hurry up and load these.

657
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,820
Got it.

658
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,490
Go ahead.

659
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,610
Why is he acting strange today?

660
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,740
Where's Lin?

661
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,610
He left.

662
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,170
He left?

663
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,170
Yeah.

664
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,420
He's flying in the afternoon.

665
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,970
So he didn't come to the lab today.

666
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,530
Zhihua left without a word

667
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,260
or anything to remember him with.

668
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,420
Isn't this his hard drive?

669
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,170
Tidy things up.

670
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,820
I'll deliver it.

671
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,420
Gu Xuejiao.

672
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,610
Why are you suddenly

673
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,010
trying to save the day?

674
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,860
I can't bear it.

675
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,860
It is easier for someone

676
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,780
with a lofty goal

677
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,260
to achieve success.

678
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,420
So I don't

679
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,220
find it funny.

680
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,780
Go!

681
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,860
Alright.

682
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,610
I'm done.

683
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,010
Happy now?

684
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,650
Let's go.

685
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,010
What did you buy? Let me see.

686
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,780
T-shirts and school emblems.

687
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,700
I bought everything.

688
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,570
Good. Let me see.

689
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,220
A raccoon doll.

690
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,450
T-shirts.

691
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,860
And pink dolls.

692
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,050
That's enough.

693
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,220
I've bought everything.

694
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,300
If it's really not enough,

695
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,090
we'll ask the guys at the lab

696
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,260
to buy more and send us.

697
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,420
Let's get going.

698
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,820
Lin.

699
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,170
Get in the car.

700
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,970
Lin Zhihua.

701
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,340
Why did you come?

702
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,050
Lin.

703
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,420
Last night, I…

704
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,340
Lin Zhihua.

705
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,170
You're much cuter

706
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,820
this time.

707
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,090
Did you sleep well last night?

708
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,380
Last night,

709
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,340
did I say anything weird?

710
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,010
I drank too much last night.

711
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,130
If I said something

712
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,780
that sounded

713
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,900
weird to you,

714
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,740
please don't…

715
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,900
About the linear function code,

716
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,340
right?

717
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,260
Yeah.

718
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,530
We talked about that.

719
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,650
I also got drunk.

720
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,420
That's all I remember.

721
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,900
Looks like you found a way

722
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,380
to break the process deadlock.

723
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,050
No.

724
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,220
It's…

725
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,130
Lin Jiadong.

726
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,420
He said you forgot your hard drive.

727
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,090
So I brought it to you.

728
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,700
You came all the way for this?

729
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,420
Thank you, Gu.

730
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,260
This is very important to me.

731
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,130
Lin.

732
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,420
Take care.

733
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,010
I have to go.

734
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,970
Go back.

735
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,300
Bye.

736
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,380
He must be

737
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,010
landing soon.

738
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,650
Lin.

739
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,170
About that secret I mentioned,

740
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,420
don't take it seriously.

741
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,860
No.

742
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,940
What if I didn't tell him?

743
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,900
Lin.

744
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,130
How was your trip?

745
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,860
Let me know once you land.

746
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,420
Pretentious greetings.

747
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,380
There's obviously something shady.

748
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,490
Xuejiao.

749
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,010
Yeah?

750
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,490
Have you checked the forum?

751
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,610
About your…

752
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,170
What?

753
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,900
My rebirth.

754
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,490
Everyone knows?

755
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,650
Oh no.

756
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,530
Who'd believe that?

757
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,650
They'll think I'm crazy.

758
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,130
I…

759
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,780
It's not about you.

760
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,010
It's about

761
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,490
your high school classmate
working in the canteen.

762
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,050
She's serving a new type of bubble tea.

763
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,300
Let's try it tomorrow.

764
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,300
That's it?

765
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,340
You scared me.

766
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,260
Okay, let's try it tomorrow.

767
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,450
So it's a deal.

768
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,940
They say it's amazing.

769
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,570
Good night.
