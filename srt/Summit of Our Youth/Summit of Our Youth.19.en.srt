destroying a computer information system]

387
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,020
[and sentenced to one year in prison.]

388
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,500
[In addition, Zheng Qin was
investigated and dismissed by B&C Motors]

389
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,880
[for manipulating the competition.]

390
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,310
[According to Article 24
 <Voluntary Withdrawal from Crime>,]

391
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,760
[if, during the course of a crime,
a person voluntarily abandons]

392
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,310
[the criminal act or effectively prevents
the criminal result from occurring,]

393
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,580
[it constitutes a voluntary withdrawal.]

394
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,130
[For such cases, if no harm is caused,the
person shall be exempt from punishment;]

395
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:08,480
[if harm is caused,the punishment
shall be mitigated.]

396
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,930
[As Lin Jiadong voluntarily ceased
his criminal conduct in time,]

397
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,320
[he shall not be held criminally liable.]

398
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm terribly sorry

399
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,690
to let you see this.

400
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,900
Lin,

401
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,300
thanks to you,

402
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,970
B&C Motors got

403
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,850
to root out this big mole.

404
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,180
Don't worry.

405
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,330
We will deal

406
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,610
with this seriously.

407
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,020
It won't affect

408
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,090
our future cooperation.

409
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,300
Sorry, Dr. Cai,

410
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,090
we've decided to end

411
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,140
our tech partnership

412
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,140
with B&C Motors.

413
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,940
Why?

414
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,660
Everyone knows

415
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,940
we and other startups

416
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,660
have been

417
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,570
treated unfairly.

418
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,690
Your company breached the contract first.

419
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,540
We have the right

420
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,420
to choose not to cooperate.

421
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,540
It's a demonstration of contract spirit.

422
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,810
Alright,

423
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,180
I respect your choice.

424
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,970
But

425
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,690
if you ever

426
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,780
need help,

427
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,420
you can always reach out to me.

428
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,180
I will.

429
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,300
So you already contacted

430
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,260
Dr. Cai.

431
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,180
Just like that,

432
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,610
you took Ms. Zheng down.

433
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,300
And you even lied to me about it.

434
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,850
I gotta thank you, champion.

435
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,140
Otherwise, how could we

436
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,660
have a legit reason?

437
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,970
Of course.

438
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,450
You have to pick the fruit

439
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,690
yourself.

440
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,490
Can't just wait

441
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,690
for the enemy to surrender.

442
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,140
Let's go.

443
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,450
Let's have a little celebration.

444
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,780
You forgot the schedule?

445
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,610
I have lab work this afternoon.

446
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,420
I'll help you.

447
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,660
More effective.

448
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,610
Let's relax now.

449
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,140
Lin,

450
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,690
you were fully prepared this time.

451
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,020
It was a close call.

452
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,540
But I hope next time,

453
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,090
if you have something,

454
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,090
you can tell me first.

455
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,210
I can be the person

456
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,570
you trust completely.

457
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,540
Okay?

458
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,420
Trust.

459
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,260
Trust.

460
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,090
Should I tell you

461
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,060
what I already know?

462
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,850
Good job, Petal.

463
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,690
You not only saved C1

464
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,300
out of B&C's traps

465
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,210
unscathed,

466
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,300
but also made a name for yourself.

467
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,300
Wanna give your sister's

468
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,850
investment pool a push

469
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,140
by bringing the project to Linqi?

470
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,420
I didn't come to you

471
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,450
for this, Zhiyue.

472
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,730
Then it's

473
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,060
for your relationship?

474
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,090
I've been

475
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,380
keeping something from Xuejiao.

476
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,970
I wanted to tell her many times,

477
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,900
but didn't get the chance.

478
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,250
Now I feel like

479
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,940
I have to tell her.

480
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,620
Don't look at me like that.

481
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,010
She's hiding the same thing

482
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,770
from me.

483
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,290
I just worry that

484
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,660
if I say it out loud,

485
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,730
it will ruin our relationship.

486
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,660
What if she thinks differently?

487
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,180
So what is it?

488
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,100
I can't tell you.

489
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,580
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

490
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,250
It's not important.

491
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,490
What can't you tell me?

492
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,340
You haven't said anything yet.

493
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,380
How do you know I won't believe you?

494
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,450
Mark my words.

495
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,690
Girls hate it most

496
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,730
when you're not honest.

497
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,100
What exactly happened?

498
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,730
Tell me.

499
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,380
I still plan

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,690
to sell C1 to B&C Motors.

501
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,730
That's it?

502
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,140
Hello, Xuejiao.

503
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,250
Where are you?

504
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,620
On my way back to the lab.

505
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,690
I'm

506
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,940
going to put the trophy

507
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,940
in the lab.

508
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,820
After all,

509
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,010
we earned this together.

510
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,900
I'll come and find you.

511
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,100
What's wrong?

512
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,900
Talk later.

513
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,420
I'm off.

514
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,660
What is it?

515
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,050
So mysterious.

516
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,580
You're the girl

517
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,730
who kissed in the hospital.

518
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,420
What?

519
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,580
What kiss?

520
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,100
Kid,

521
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,340
why are you here

522
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,940
all alone?

523
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,490
My mom went to the restroom.

524
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,730
She told me to wait here.

525
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,730
Besides,

526
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,210
I'm not a kid.

527
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,580
I'm already in fifth grade.

528
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,900
Okay…

529
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,730
Adult, let me stay with you

530
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,940
and wait for your mom.

531
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,620
Let's go.

532
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,660
Guess who I ran into.

533
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,690
Study so hard?

534
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,530
Messi's Legendary Journey?

535
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,250
You like soccer?

536
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,050
Yeah.

537
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,420
Did you catch the last

538
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,210
World Cup qualifier?

539
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,140
China beat Korea one to zero.

540
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,210
Of course.

541
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,250
Thanks to me,

542
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,250
I had over 100 people watching with me.

543
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,770
It was so intense.

544
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,620
You're just like your boyfriend.

545
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,050
A bragging big talker.

546
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,690
What did he brag about?

547
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,620
Tell me.

548
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,690
He'll get here later.

549
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,900
We'll call him out to his face.

550
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,450
That's not gonna happen

551
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,770
because his big talk

552
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,580
actually came true.

553
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,290
Came true?

554
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,180
Yeah.

555
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,250
He told me in the hospital

556
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,180
that China would win one to zero.

557
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,530
And he was right.

558
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,180
He also said

559
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,140
Messi would win

560
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,450
the 2022 World Cup.

561
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,100
That's years away.

562
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,490
Your boyfriend…

563
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,970
Actually, I have a secret.

564
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,580
Actually, I have a secret, too.

565
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,180
My mom said…

566
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,900
Do you wanna know

567
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,100
what you'll be like

568
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,620
ten years from now?

569
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,100
I've liked you for ten years.

570
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,100
Xuejiao.

571
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,450
Why are you sitting here?

572
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,340
I've been looking for you.

573
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,340
Remember where this is?

574
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,490
Actually, I have a secret.

575
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,660
What secret?

576
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,290
You remember it all now?

577
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,100
If I hadn't

578
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,420
run into that kid today,

579
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,250
how long were you gonna keep it from me?

580
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,820
Sorry.

581
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,100
Believe it or not,

582
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,580
I planned

583
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,420
to tell you today.

584
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,660
And I've been waiting

585
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,340
for the right moment.

586
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,010
When is

587
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,140
the right moment anyway?

588
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm afraid the memories of both lives

589
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,970
will get mixed up.

590
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,180
It might hurt us.

591
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm afraid that if I tell you,

592
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,380
you won't accept it.

593
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,770
You know what's

594
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,450
most unacceptable?

595
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,450
It's you

596
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,770
who looked down on me in the last life.

597
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,860
Even in this new life,

598
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,050
you still

599
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,210
treat people like idiots.

600
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,380
Xuejiao, it's not what you think.

601
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,420
I have never

602
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,620
thought of you that way.

603
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,100
But that's exactly what you did!

to say anything now.

608
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,730
But I planned to tell you

before signing

610
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,970

611
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,380

Thanks.

Xuejiao, let me explain.

616
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,660
Don't explain.

617

I don't wanna hear it.

Food, sex, and desire.

Tell me, hurry.

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,210
a white lie.

655
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,180
Isn't a white lie

656
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,580
still a lie?

A white lie

658
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,530
means it's forgivable?

770
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,290
would actually be better.

771
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,450
But I was wrong.

772
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,050
Does it sound like

773
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,690
I'm making excuses?

774
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,340
Screw your white lies.

775
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,530
But I was wrong.

776
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,730
Any concealment or deceit

777
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,340
is just irresponsibility.

778
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,530
Forgive me for hesitating

779
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,050
and not telling you the truth sooner.

780
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,970
I apologize

781
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,620
for my selfishness.

782
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,290
I'm sorry.

783
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,010
What are you doing here?

784
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,660
I don't think

785
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,050
I need to explain it.

786
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,730
This is the lab.

787
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,620
It's work hours.

788
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,970
Don't disturb them.

789
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,140
Please leave.

790
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,530
I'm here for Xuejiao,

791
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,620
not for you.

792
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,580
What?

793
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,010
Do I need your permission?

794
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,860
You're not her boyfriend anymore.

795
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,620
Who says I'm not?

796
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,180
You don't need to know.

797
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,180
I know what I know.

798
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,770
Do you know what yellow roses mean?

799
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,660
Why are you asking?

800
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,900
Look it up.

801
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,050
Xuejiao must be very happy

802
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,250
to have an old friend

803
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,900
like you, all brawn.

804
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,730
All brawn?

805
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,380
What do you mean?

806
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,970
Yellow roses are the only kind of roses

807
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,420
without a romantic meaning.

808
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,580
They symbolize friendship and care.

809
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,660
Hello, Tiantian.

810
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,050
It's me…

811
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,490
I just got back.

812
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,290
I called you

813
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,250
as soon as I landed.

814
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,450
Yeah, I miss you, old friend.

815
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,530
Actually,

816
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,770
I need a favor from you.

817
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,660
Coming…

818
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,250
Come in.

819
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,660
Sun Tiantian is using us

820
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,690
to test her new milk tea again.

821
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,140
We should start charging her.

822
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,820
Everyone's getting work-fat.

823
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,180
We've all put on weight lately.

824
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,620
What Sun Tiantian?

825
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,010
That's Ms. Sun.

826
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,490
Peach oolong tea,

827
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,450
zero sugar, less ice,
crunchy popping boba

828
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,250
instead of normal boba.

829
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,490
Thanks.

830
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,770
Exactly what I wanted.

831
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,380
Yi Tianyu?

832
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,970
How did you…?

833
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,140
Surprise?

834
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,770
I told you,

835
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,770
as long as I want,

836
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,490
there's nowhere

837
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,340
I can't get to and nothing

838
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,940
I can't pull off.

839
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,450
You did pull off a bit of a shock.

840
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,860
Let me introduce myself.

841
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,900
I'm Xuejiao's high school classmate.

842
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,090
A very close one.

843
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,380
Pick whatever flavor you want.

844
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,650
Thanks…

845
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,050
What flavor do you want?

846
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,340
I forgot.

847
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,010
You don't drink this.

848
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,380
Says who?

849
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,300
No need to force yourself.

850
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,420
I love milk tea.

851
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,170
You…

852
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,490
Hurry and pick your milk tea.

853
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,570
Don't hold up the line.

854
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,450
Yeah.

855
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,780
And you.

856
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,940
Leave if you're done.

857
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,010
Don't hold people up at work.

861
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,170
You've come home?

862
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,650
I'm just back to grab some stuff.

863
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,170
I'll take

864
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,700
the useful things back to my dorm.

865
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,130
You can throw away

866
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,610
the rest

867
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,780
before moving out.

868
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,420
Who said we're moving?

869
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,860
The more people think
we're down and out,

870
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,900
the more we have to keep our pride.

871
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,170
Mom,

872
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,860
don't be so proud.

873
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,260
Just face reality.

874
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,050
Sell the house

875
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,170
and pay off debts.

876
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,050
Maybe

877
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,170
there's a chance to start over.

878
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,090
You've always lived

879
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,130
by what others think.

880
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,650

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,010
to your pride,

882
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,780
are you really happy?

883
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,940
That's why I think you're hopeless.

884
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,260
You couldn't beat Gu Xuejiao
on the college entrance exam.

885
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,050
Finally got a chance

886
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,170
to be in a national contest,

887
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,380
and you lost to her again.

888
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,050
Sometimes I wonder

889
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,570
if you do this on purpose.

890
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,490
Are you just fighting me

891
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,780
to make me angry and embarrass me?

892
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,340
Now look,

893
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,420
she moved into a big house.

894
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,340
And we're moving

895
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,380
from a fancy neighborhood

896
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,900
to an old rundown place.

897
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,300
Would you want to live there?

898
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,300
Is the second place
in the national contest

899
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,570
so embarrassing?

900
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,860
Who in this world

901
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,650
would remember second place?

902
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,050
I've always given you

903
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,780
the best since you were little.

904
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,300
But you?

905
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,010
Look at these.

906
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,340
Look.

907
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,820
How many first places have you won?

908
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,260
My daughter

909
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,900
shouldn't lose to anyone.

910
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,130
Forget it,

911
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,780
maybe that's just your fate.

912
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,650
Yes.

913
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,900
Back then, when I couldn't

914
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,900
get first in class,

915
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,260
you yelled at me.

916
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,090
But when I finally

917
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,820
got first place in my grade in English,

918
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,340
you still complained

919
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,220
that my total score wasn't high enough.

920
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:33,970
Sometimes

921
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,220
I'm curious that

922
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,010
if I had

923
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,940
got into Capital University

924
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,780
and won first place

925
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,170
in the national contest,

926
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,260
would you really be content?

927
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,700
No, you're never content.

928
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,340
Because in your eyes,

929
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,300
I'll never be the daughter

930
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,570
who truly makes you proud.

931
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,010
So sometimes,

932
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,050
I even forget

933
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,970
that maybe

934
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,010
I'm actually quite good.

935
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,420
Yeah,

936
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,130
I lost this competition,

937
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,090
but I lost with honor.

938
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,860
Second place nationwide

939
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,220
is just the beginning
of my science track.

940
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,170
From now on,

941
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,740
I won't be

942
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,170
swayed by anyone's opinions.

943
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,170
By the way,

944
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,900
I'm not moving

945
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,170
to the new house.

946
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,260
I'll live on my own.

947
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,900
Shiyun,

948
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,940
if you're sad,

949
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,860
it's okay to cry.

950
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,260
Then,

951
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,940
let's go.

952
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,700
I'll take you to eat something good.

953
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,900
You walked all the way with me

954
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,780
from my doorstep to here.

955
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,450
Why didn't you

956
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,940
ask me

957
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,340
why I'm crying?

958
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,090
When you're down,

959
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,380
I just wanna be there with you.

960
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,420
And I've been calling you,

961
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,450
but you never picked up.

962
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,010
Seeing you okay now

963
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,340
means everything.

964
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,450
Say that again.

965
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,220
I said something wrong again.

966
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,740
Don't cry…

967
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,940
Alright… I'm sorry…

968
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,740
Don't cry…

969
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,260
Alright, don't cry…

970
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,700
Hush now…

971
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,450
What…

972
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,700
are you looking at?

973
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,820
You

974
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,380
look like you've got tears

975
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,500
'ascending to the blue sky'.
[*Originally 'A line of white egrets]

976
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,860
'ascending to the blue sky'.
[ascends to the blue sky.']

977
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,820
Your foundation is melting off.

978
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,130
You…

979
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,780
If you don't know how to use poetry,

980
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,940
don't just throw it around.

981
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,740
You actually look better now

982
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,610
than when you're crying.

983
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,820
You mean I look ugly when crying?

984
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,530
I never said that.

985
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,900
That's not what I meant.

986
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,450
I swear.
