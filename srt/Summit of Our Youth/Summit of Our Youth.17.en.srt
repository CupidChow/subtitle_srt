00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,690
and ended up

389
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,690
at the lab.

390
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,420
She got lost.

391
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,260
Xuejiao is out,

392
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,020
having hot pot with her friends.

393
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,730
Why didn't she invite you?

394
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,730
She…

395
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,970
I guess it didn't work out.

396
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,210
Keep observing.

397
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,970
It's okay. Let's take the things

398
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,060
to her dorm.

399
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,210
You are so busy.

400
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,330
We can't trouble you.

401
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,780
It's okay.

402
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,260
Give it to me.

403
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,140
- You're so busy.
- Let's go.

404
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,900
Okay.

405
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,290
Lin.

406
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,450
Have you been busy?

407
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,690
What's that question?

408
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,210
Of course, he's busy.

409
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,010
Right?

410
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,940
It's been fine.

411
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,450
You're not busy at all?

412
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,380
Y-Yeah.

413
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,620
Can't you be busier?

414
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,100
Auntie,

415
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,900
are you trying to

416
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,730
say something?

417
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,580
Is it so obvious?

418
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,340
Absolutely.

419
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,050
Just ask him.

420
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,290
Then I'll cut to the chase.

421
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,580
Lin,

422
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,490
do you have a girlfriend?

423
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,180
Are you

424
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,250
finding me a girlfriend?

425
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,250
Didn't Xuejiao tell you?

426
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,580
About what?

427
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,730
I guess it's not very clear yet.

428
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,140
So you're still pursuing someone?

429
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,900
I guess.

430
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,730
I just feel that

431
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,210
Xuejiao is quite dependent on you.

432
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,180
I'm asking you that for my daughter

433
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,450
because I'm worried.

434
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,620
Of course.

435
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,180
An excellent young man like you

436
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,770
wouldn't fall for someone

437
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,530
ordinary.

438
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,450
She is extraordinary.

439
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,770
Alright.

440
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,820
It's a huge weight off my mind.

441
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,660
I'm just not meant to be

442
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,860
your mother-in-law.

443
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,820
Auntie.

444
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,900
You're meant to be.

445
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,940
I'm pursuing

446
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,900
Xuejiao.

447
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,180
What…

448
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,940
What… You…

449
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,620
Well,

450
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,730
Lin,

451
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,860
go about

452
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,180
your business.

453
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,420
Leave us the things.

454
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,420
No, I'm not busy.

455
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,530
I'll walk you to the dorm.

456
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,860
N-No need.

457
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,940
We can go by ourselves.

458
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,140
Go back to work.

459
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,620
H-How can I do that?

460
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,450
L-Let me do it.

461
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,660
I got this.

462
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,210
Hurry up.

463
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,180
Isn't Xuejiao

464
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,380
having hot pot?

465
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,340
Check on her.

466
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,580
Yeah, go ahead.

467
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,490
Go ahead.

468
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,210
Go ahead. Be bold.

469
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,420
Then, I'm leaving.

470
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,450
Go ahead.

471
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,180
Go ahead.

472
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,490
Thank you, Uncle, Auntie.

473
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,380
Don't mention it.

474
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,770
Then I…

475
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,770
I'll try harder.

476
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,380
Go for it.

477
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,180
I knew it. You see?

478
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,290
You can rest assured, huh?

479
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,380
Our 'beast'

480
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,210
finally found the 'beauty'.

481
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,490
What nonsense.

482
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,940
Our 'beauty'

483
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,940
finally found a prince.

484
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,660
Yeah.

485
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,900
I knew it.

486
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,660
You didn't even have to come.

487
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,770
I had to come.

488
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,900
Otherwise, how would I

489
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,010
see my wonderful son-in-law?

490
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,210
Yes!

491
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,100
- Slow down.
- Hurry up.

492
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,210
- Okay…
- Hurry…

493
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,900
Lin is such a wonderful child.

494
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,900
So what pot

495
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,860
are we having?

496
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,100
- Spicy.
- Tomatoes and mushrooms.

497
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,420
You have three-grid pots?

498
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:00,900
Forget it.

499
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,860
Let's get the dishes first.

500
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,900
Duck intestines.

501
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,140
I don't eat intestines.

502
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,420
Beef tripe.

503
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,530
I don't eat beef tripe. Duck blood.

504
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,690
- I don't eat blood.
- I don't eat blood.

505
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,100
Forget it.

506
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,340
That's enough for now.

507
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,100
Should we

508
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,290
talk about the division of labor?

509
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,900
Siqi.

510
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,940
Applied Electronics.

511
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,690
You'll be in charge
of the application guarantee.

512
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,450
Shu Lan.

513
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,050
Mathematics.

514
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,620
You'll be in charge
of encryption and decoding.

515
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,050
Feifei and I

516
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,490
major in Software Engineering.

517
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,140
We'll be in charge of the offense.

518
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,580
So the defense…

519
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,860
Math is the foundation of everything.

520
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,970
I should be the offender.

521
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,660
Pretty sure

522
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,490
I beat you

523
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,490
in Firewall and Intrusion Detection class

524
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,770
last semester.

525
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,050
But I also took

526
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,820
that course.

527
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,450
Didn't I score

528
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,180
the highest?

529
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,900
Ladies.

530
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,580
Ladies.

531
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,380
Let's talk over food.

532
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,010
We don't have three-grid pots.
How about a nine-grid one?

533
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,940
Alright.

534
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,420
I don't want to settle.

535
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,820
Wait, Shu Lan.

536
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,180
Wait, Feifei.

537
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,380
Siqi. Don't.

538
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,420
Wenbo.

539
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,340
I'd better ask Lin Jiadong

540
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,660
if I can go back.

541
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,580
Wait.

542
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,860
Wenbo.

543
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,420
Excuse me.

544
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,900
Can I refund these?

545
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,760
[No refunds after meals are served]

546
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,010
Fine, I can do it.

547
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,860
I'll eat.

548
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,490
I can help.

549
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,580
You come

550
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,380
with free Flash?

551
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,210
Since you dashed away,

552
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,140
I'm flashing to chase.

553
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,100
Your parents came to see you.

554
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,250
I told them everything.

555
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,290
About what?

556
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,970
My parents came to see me.

557
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,010
And you told them everything?

558
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,860
I haven't told them anything yet.

559
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,290
I asked you last month.

560
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,140
Didn't you say

561
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,290
that you had told them?

562
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,290
I was

563
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,660
being evasive

564
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,490
and got over it

565
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,420
with some excuses.

566
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:19,940
You…

567
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,970
You…

568
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,970
You misunderstood me.

569
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,180
We've been together for so long.

570
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,290
You still won't make it public?

571
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,900
But

572
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,770
I think

573
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,860
if my parents know,

574
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,530
all my relatives

575
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,010
and the whole world will know.

576
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,140
And I don't want

577
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,050
our schoolmates to think

578
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,210
that we're having a lab romance.

579
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,210
What's wrong?

580
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,860

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,010
Then how did I

774
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,770
get these wounds?

775
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,490
Professor.

776
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,100
Punish me if you want to.

777
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,730
You've always been

778
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,620
my academic role model.

779
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,050
I applied to this university

780
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,100
because of you.

781
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,690
But honestly, I'm very disappointed

782
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,940
at what Lin

783
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,900
has done.

784
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,210
What did I do?

785
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,620
Professor, I'm quitting, too.

786
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,420
I wanted to win a reward

787
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,100
and drop out.

788
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,690
But I didn't win any rewards

789
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,010
and might even be punished.

790
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,420
It's not worth it.

791
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,820
You kids are

792
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,100
quite honest.

793
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,530
Professor,

794
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,340
the power suddenly went out

795
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,290
last night.

796
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,940
Lin,

797
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,290
why did you try to scare us?

798
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,970
I was so scared.

799
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,530
It's alright, Feifei.

800
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,490
I'm here.

801
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,690
Don't be afraid.

802
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,340
Professor Tan.

803
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,010
Professor Tan, I'll take the punishment

804
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,180
with all of them.

805
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,530
Gu Xuejiao.

806
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,140
You may leave.

807
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,340
When will the meeting end?

808
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,900
It's hard to say.

809
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,290
Ms. Zheng is extremely busy.

810
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,250
You can leave her a message.

811
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,290
What happened to your face?

812
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,730
I came here because of this.

813
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,690
Alright.

814
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,250
That's it.

815
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,380
Where is Jiadong?

816
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,770
He just left.

817
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:07,900
I asked Jiadong

818
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,450
what Lin Zhihua

819
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,380
has been up to.

820
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,900
He said he wanted…

821
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,260
He is at the end of his rope

822
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,420
and is going

823
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,530
for the prize money.

824
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:20,970
Okay.

825
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,970
Let him know that

826
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,820
I won't even spare him

827
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,300
this petty money.

828
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,490
Isn't Jiadong

829
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,650
busy with the contest?

830
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,650
Why did he come here?

831
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,650
You don't need to worry about that.

832
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,050
Someone will take care of it.

833
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,130
I'm done.

834
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,820
The lab is yours now.

835
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,130
How is your team spirit burning?

836
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,780
What a group of passionate young people.

837
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,010
Just find the ignition point,

838
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,300
and there is no limit.

839
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,380
Congratulations.

840
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,050
It seems that I can't
have hot pot with you.

841
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,900
But I miss you very much.

842
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,090
Okay, that's it.

843
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,970
We'll work late

844
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,940
in the lab today.

845
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,820
Come and visit.

846
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,700
Okay.

847
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,010
So we're all good

848
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,610
on who's

849
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,570
doing what, right?

850
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,650
Let me repeat it.

851
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,220
Shu Lan…

852
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,860
Stop.

853
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,700
It's about to boil.

854
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,530
Come on,

855
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,260
ladies.

856
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,300
Cheers.

857
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,780
I mean,

858
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,130
go, leaders!

859
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,860
- Come on!
- Cheers!

860
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,380
It's still raw.

861
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,940
What did you get?

862
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,700
Beef tripe?

863
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,340
Yeah.

864
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,220
Not bad, Wenbo.

865
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,130
You're pretty reliable.

866
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,820
Having been here for so many years,

867
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,700
I've never known

868
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,900
about this small path.

869
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,420
Rest assured, leaders.

870
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,170
I'll get us

871
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,490
back to school

872
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,300
in record time.

873
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,650
I'll give you credit first.

874
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,260
Shall we

875
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,380
come up with a group name?

876
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,090
I think

877
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,940
an ordinary and unremarkable name

878
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,900
will highlight

879
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,130
our rich connotations.

880
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,570
"Am I right?"

881
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,570
Is it good?

882
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,900
You have to

883
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,050
tell us a name first.

884
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,130
'Am I Right' will be the name.

885
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,740
So not funny.

886
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,700
Gu Xuejiao.

887
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,380
What kind of members

888
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,530
did you recruit?

889
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,450
We should be grateful

890
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,490
as long as

891
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,220
we don't rank last.

892
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,050
How about

893
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,010
'Last-ranked Ace'?

894
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:31,970
I like it.

895
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,090
Me too.

896
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,090
"Last-ranked Ace."

897
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,530
It feels like an ant
trying to shake a giant tree.

898
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,740
I like it.

899
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,300
So that's the name.

900
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,700
Okay.

901
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,900
Hello.

902
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,420
Are you back?

903
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,820
We're on the way.

904
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,420
Wenbo

905
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,610
showed us a shortcut

906
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,860
outside the back gate.

907
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,130
You know what?

908
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,450
We almost

909
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,860
sorted out the code over dinner.

910
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,650
I've been curious.

911
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,170
Do you

912
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,300
have a boyfriend?

913
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,490
You vanish sometimes

914
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,780
and call him

915
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,740
behind our backs.

916
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,570
Gu Xuejiao.

917
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,420
You're very fishy.

918
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,900
I…

919
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,380
It's my brother.

920
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,530
Mingze.

921
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,700
Mingze.

922
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,700
Can you hear me?

923
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,340
My WeChat signature is what you said

924
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,170
in the interview.

925
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,260
"Don't let others

926
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,260
define your life."

927
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,970
Did you hear that?

928
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,940
He adores you.

929
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,940
W-What are you doing?

930
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,220
Hand over

931
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,450
everything you have.

932
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,700
Call the police.

933
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,940
Bro,

934
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,340
you have your gangster rules.

935
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,570
It's just for the money,

936
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,010
right?

937
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,820
Guys,

938
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,380
give them the money.

939
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,570
Let him take it.

940
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,260
Bro,

941
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,130
why don't you show me

942
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,970
your QR code?

943
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,260
I'll transfer money to you.

944
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,450
Are you kidding me?

945
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,610
The guy on the back.

946
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,220
Yeah, you.

947
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,900
You're carrying a laptop, huh?

948
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,820
Don't even think about it.

949
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,780
Alright.

950
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,170
You have quite a backbone.

951
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,300
Let's see what breaks first,

952
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,300
your bones

953
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,260
or my bat.

954
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,900
Get them!

955
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,220
No!

956
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,050
Don't!

957
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,050
No!

958
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,300
Don't take his bag!

959
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,170
Smash it!

960
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,940
Go!

961
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,780
My laptop.

962
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,530
My laptop.

963
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,570
You…

964
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,490
Xuejiao!

965
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,570
Are you okay?

966
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,340
Are you hurt?

967
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,380
The laptop.

968
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,970
Wait.

969
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,340
Wait.

970
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,780
What's your problem?

971
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,130
Huh?

972
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,300
Get him!

973
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,300
The laptop!

974
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:27,940
The laptop!

975
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,010
Watch out!

976
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,450
Sorry.

977
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,940
Be careful.

978
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,380
I dare you to come back.

979
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,970
I know kung fu. I'll…

980
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,760
[Inpatient Department]

981
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,220
I told you I'm fine.

982
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,420
How is this fine? Let me see.

983
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,700
Does it hurt?

984
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,940
Does it hurt?

985
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,570
Don't move.

986
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,650
Does it hurt?

987
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,700
Didn't they say they failed?

988
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,820
How is your head?

989
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,380
Is it okay?

990
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,700
Jiadong.

991
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,450
Zhihua.

992
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,900
How come you're so fast?

993
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,090
Gao Rui hasn't arrived yet.

994
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,170
I was nearby.

995
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,050
So I came fast.

996
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,340
How did you get hurt so badly?

997
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,300
Tell him.

998
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,700
Ask Wenbo.

999
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,450
Y-Your trousers are dirty.

1000
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,700
Your trousers are dirty.

1001
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,940
Auntie!

1002
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,010
Auntie!

1003
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,570
Jiadong.

1004
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,900
Jiadong, wait.

1005
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,570
Let me in.

1006
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,380
Let me see her.

1007
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,450
I'm not stopping you.

1008
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,530
But Ms. Zheng is out

1009
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,340
for business.

1010
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,700
I asked you to vent my anger.

1011
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,570
Why did you hurt Zhihua?

1012
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,820
No, we didn't.

1013
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,340
Minor bruises are enough.

1014
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,820
Why did you hurt his face?

1015
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,530
We wanted to teach him a lesson.

1016
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,170
Okay, calm down.

1017
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,940
We just taught him a lesson.

1018
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,420
Do you think

1019
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,450
Lin Jiadong asked someone

1020
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,220
to do this?

1021
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,420
Let me do it.

1022
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,740
It's okay.

1023
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,900
I got this.

1024
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,010
Do you remember Ms. Zheng
from B&C Motors?

1025
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,010
The one who tried to grope you

1026
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,010
at the dinner meeting.

1027
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,450
Right?

1028
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,450
She exploits the team's creativity

1029
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,570
and damages the industry.

1030
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,650
A cancer in the industry.

1031
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,010
She is Lin Jiadong's aunt.

1032
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,170
They have such similar taste.

1033
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,170
You knew about it all along.

1034
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,050
Why are you keeping

1035
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,740
Lin Jiadong?

1036
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,490
Aren't you scared

1037
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,490
that he'd sell you out?

1038
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,740
Lin Jiadong may like

1039
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,940
to play tricks,

1040
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,340
but I don't think

1041
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,340
he's behind this.

1042
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,380
He's just easily swayed

1043
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,570
and gets manipulated.

1044
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,780
