24
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,530
Mingze's got a point.

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,010
With scores like yours,

26
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,060
you could get into almost

00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,940
Thank God you're here.

388
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,620
Our presentation

389
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,290
to Professor Tan tomorrow

390
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,490
would've been toast.

391
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,140
He's got a meeting tomorrow afternoon.

392
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,250
Lab's off,

393
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,010
no need to come in.

394
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,180
Awesome!

395
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,730
Then

396
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,620
let's hang out

397
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,580
tomorrow afternoon!

398
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
I've got plans.

399
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,690
You go ahead.

400
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,050
You're acting weird!

401
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,690
Says the guy acting weirder!

402
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,730
Did you finish the slides?

403
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,250
You're going to present

404
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,100
the day after tomorrow.

405
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,580
Alright.

406
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,250
But wait...

407
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,380
Hurry up

408
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,290
so we can grab late-night snacks!

409
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,290
OK!

410
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,690
Get up, it's already noon!

411
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,620
Lazybones!

412
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,140
Come on,

413
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,490
aren't you going on a date?

414
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,940
What date?

415
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,530
Meet me at Capital University,

416
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,010
3 p.m. tomorrow.

417
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,290
You sure you wanna wear that?

418
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,380
It's not a date!

419
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,530
Was he really

420
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,940
asking me out on a date?

421
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,290
I washed my hair!

422
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,340
That's the highest level effort,

423
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,860
you know?

424
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,340
Lin,

425
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,290
your forum speech

426
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,900
was impressive!

427
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,450
Did you

428
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,140
ask me out today on purpose?

429
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,770
The industry's booming this year,

430
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,050
and I got tons of expos to attend.

431
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,730
I usually skip regular forums

432
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,940
if I can,

433
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,580
but not the ones

434
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,940
on campus.

435
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,970
Anything with

436
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,940
"Capital U" on it

437
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,860
just hits different.

438
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,940
Here,

439
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,970
officially introducing you

440
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,660
to Capital U's

441
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,010
Autonomous Driving Lab.

442
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,730
Reminds me of

443
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,340
Xintu's R&D lab.

444
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,250
So state-of-the-art

445
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,620
but still

446
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,580
full of history.

447
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,770
Impressive!

448
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,860
So heavy!

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,100
I didn't call you here

450
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,140
just to hang out.

451
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,490
You're my assistant today.

452
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,770
Assistant?

453
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,250
Look, I can't run

454
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,100
this lab alone,

455
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,820
can I?

456
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,660
I helped you catch up before,

457
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,940
now you help me

458
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,820
for a day.

459
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,490
Fair trade.

460
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,250
Lin,

461
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,100
only you

462
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,380
could make exploiting free labor

463
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,490
sound noble.

464
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,140
Sit.

465
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,900
Use this format

466
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,770
to write a literature review

467
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,100
on these books.

468
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,210
If you can pull this off...

469
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,180
Then

470
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,620
I'm Capital U material?

471
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,010
Let's see how you do first.

472
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,490
What does that mean?

473
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,340
Lin...

474
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,140
What are you asking about?

475
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,210
Right here.

476
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,450
Current autonomous driving systems

477
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,010
can operate in all weather conditions,

478
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,050
primarily using millimeter-wave radar.

479
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,450
It has two operational modes...

480
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,290
Hold that handle

481
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,250
so I can pull you back.

482
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,530
This chair's seriously high-tech.

483
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,340
Yeah.

484
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,250
Thanks to Gu Mingze stirring the pot,

485
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,050
now I'm seeing this as a date.

486
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,770
Master,

487
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,730
I'm here to keep you company.

488
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,210
Why's there a visitor?

489
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,180
She's my assistant.

490
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,900
By the way,

491
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,530
check this out.

492
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,940
I got BMC Motors' latest

493
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,770
self-driving

494
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,180
promo brochure.

495
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,420
Take a look!

496
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,290
It's absolutely groundbreaking.

497
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,880
[SELF-DRIVING CAR]

498
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,970
If by "groundbreaking"

499
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,530
you mean

500
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,100
flashy slides,

501
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,900
then sure.

502
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,620
However,

503
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,940
at their pace,

504
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,970
real autonomous driving

505
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,660
is at least

506
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,660
5–10 years away.

507
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,420
All talk.

508
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,490
Don't bother reading it.

509
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,050
Master...

510
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,250
Don't take it personal,

511
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,250
I was just stating facts.

512
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,620
Xuejiao,

513
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,450
you picked a major yet?

514
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,770
Nah.

515
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,100
How about AI?

516
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,140
What?

517
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,340
Trying to recruit me

518
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,450
for your program?

519
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,050
Would that be bad?

520
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,730
I'm just saying,

521
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,450
if you don't have a specific

522
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,140
preference in mind,

523
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,250
think about us.

524
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,140
The lab I just showed you

525
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,250
got the country's

526
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,140
top tech

527
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,100
and professionals.

528
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,250
You won't regret it.

529
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,250
Of course,

530
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,860
you have the final say.

531
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,580
Plus,

532
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,490
AI's a growing field.

533
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,250
Cover for me.

534
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,010
Thanks.

535
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,730
Why so jumpy?

536
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,970
Help me out.

537
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,250
What's there

538
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,900
to hide anyway?

539
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,660
Lin?

540
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,900
What are you doing here?

541
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,420
What a coincidence.

542
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,100
I was just

543
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,290
passing by.

544
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,420
Dude,

545
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,420
another bottle.

546
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,420
When are you coming to pick him up?

547
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,290
If I come,

548
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,860
there's a 99% chance

549
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,820
we'll end up fighting.

550
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,180
Sparing you the sibling drama.

551
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,580
You two guys

552
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,050
might actually bond

553
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,970
and understand each other.

554
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,660
But I don't want to get

555
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,820
too close to your brother.

556
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,420
Lin,

557
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,530
you're meant to be

558
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,210
a star in academia,

559
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,770
try to be smart

560
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,690
and kind, okay?

561
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,900
Not the "be kind" speech again.

562
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,290
Lin,

563
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,380
never thought

564
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,140
you'd be the one

565
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,490
who actually gets me.

566
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,140
Excuse me?

567
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,940
You think

568
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,820
I can be smart and kind

569
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,660
and make something of myself, right?

570
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,420
One of Capital U's elite

571
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,250
agrees I am

572
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,250
on the right track!

573
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,450
That's it!

574
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,100
We should embrace diversity.

575
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,580
Maybe in ten years

576
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,050
I'll bring honor to the country!

577
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,970
Never mind,

578
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,620
my parents

579
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,580
will never get it.

580
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,820
Just because I wanna be a

581
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,900
self-taught digital media designer,

582
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,010
Dad smashed my phone.

583
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,490
Xuejiao says

584
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,860
I'm stepping into a blue ocean field

585
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,290
or something...

586
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,250
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

587
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,140
Anyway, she said

588
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,340
you told her,

589
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,050
so it must be true.

590
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,580
Here.

591
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,970
Sometimes you gotta just

592
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,490

596

Let's say,

597
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,250
you're into a girl,

598
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,730
can you just blurt it out?

599
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,530
No way.

600

"Hey, I like you, wanna date?"

602
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,660
She'd probably slap you.

603
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,770
Is it really that bad?

604

607

608

610
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,340
Just give me a number,

611
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,970

612

614

615

616
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,180
No way, seriously?

617

Don't tell me you've never dated.

627

628
