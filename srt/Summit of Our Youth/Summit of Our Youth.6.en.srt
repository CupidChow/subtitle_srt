00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,770
Two dots.

582
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,100
Three bams.

583
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,450
Nine dots.

584
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,970
Yi, your turn.

585
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,210
What's the hold-up?

586
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,380
Son, help me out.

587
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,250
What should I play?

588
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,010
Little chick.

589
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:34,970
Okay.

590
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,290
Your luck's always golden.

591
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,100
I'm trusting you.

592
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,250
This round's in the bag.

593
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,250
There you go!

594
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,210
Kong!

595
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,580
Added Glory to a Kong!

596
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,420
Yi,

597
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,900
you just handed me a jackpot.

598
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,050
Guess today's my unlucky day.

599
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,420
Dear guest,

600
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,530
your service is complete.

601
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,860
Please remember

602
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,900
your belongings.

603
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,180
Wishing you a pleasant rest.

604
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,380
Son,

605
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,450
all thanks to you.

606
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,010
Those uncles

607
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,250
had a blast

608
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,210
because of that Added Glory.

609
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,660
Now, when I buy cement and sand from them,

610
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,420
they have to give me a discount.

611
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,530
Since when do we

612
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,900
have to mind just a few tons of sand?

613
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,210
Just a few?

614
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,140
I ordered a dozen truckloads.

615
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,450
That's the Yi family's style.

616
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,620
Win at everything.

617
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,690
Ace whatever we do.

618
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,860
Oh, your allowance

619
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,770
still good?

620
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,140
Here,

621
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,900
take some more.

622
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,860
Thank you, Dad.

623
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,730
Also, take this autographed photo

624
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,820
for Xuejiao.

625
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,100
What's wrong?

626
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,050
Not into celebs anymore?

627
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,730
Nah,

628
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,690
it's just…

629
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,940
Tang Jingjing…

630
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,900
This company is the main investor

631
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,690
of Tang Jingjing's movie, right?

632
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,420
This company

633
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,660
has so much bad news.

634
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,180
Aren't you worried

635
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,180
about losing your shirt?

636
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,820
Let me break it down.

637
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,420
See these movies

638
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,690
they invested in?

639
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,690
This, this, and this one.

640
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,380
All flopped. And these other three

641
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,180
hit.

642
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,900
What's the common factor?

643
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,100
Their bosses were all born

644
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,450
in the Year of the Tiger.

645
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:15,900
How about your dad?

646
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,620
Tiger.

647
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,970
So scientifically

648
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,140
or mystically,

649
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,290
your dad shouldn't touch this project.

650
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,010
Nonsense!

651
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,820
Since when

652
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,970
are you so superstitious?

653
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,770
It's not me.

654
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,210
This is

655
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,380
Xuejiao's analysis.

656
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,770
Well, if Xuejiao says it,

657
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,940
it must be legit.

658
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,340
Switched up fast.

659
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,690
Her input

660
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,180
is worth considering.

661
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,290
Dad,

662
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:53,820
maybe

663
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,900
we just skip Tang Jingjing's movie.

664
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,580
Listen, kid.

665
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,450
For girls,

666
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,450
being obedient is key.

667
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,290
But

668
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,730
what makes a man attractive

669
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,050
is having your own mind.

670
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,180
Don't worry about the investment.

671
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,580
I'll sign the contract
on my business trip next week.

672
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,290
This

673
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,140
is the Yi family's confidence.

674
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,490
1314?

675
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,860
817?

676
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,210
Right, it's me.

677
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,690
Come on.

678
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,900
Let me open it for you.

679
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

680
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,290
Please get in.

681
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,820
Watch out.

682
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,660
Pro move.

683
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,420
Hello, passenger.

684
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,210
I'm your ride-hailing driver.

685
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,010
You can call me Gu.

686
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,730
Happy to serve you.

687
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,730
Mr. Gu,

688
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,380
I'm catching a flight.

689
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,730
Try not to detour, okay?

690
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,860
No way.

691
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,100
These days,

692
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,050
the platform's

693
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,140
watching us in real-time.

694
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,690
We strictly follow the GPS.

695
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,620
Rest assured.

696
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,860
Honestly, this is my first time

697
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,140
using this ride-hail stuff.

698
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,530
My son booked it for me.

699
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,050
Tech's moving too fast.

700
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,730
Yeah.

701
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,970
My daughter told me,

702
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,100
"You can go online

703
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,420
and become a ride-hail driver."

704
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,730
I was totally clueless.

705
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,730
Honestly,

706
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,770
I miss those old days.

707
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,940
You can just

708
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,050
wave at a cab,

709
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,820
hop in, and off you go.

710
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,690
So simple.

711
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,660
But now, I can't even

712
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,580
use those apps.

713
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,770
Times change.

714
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,530
This is good, though.

715
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,290
It's at least legit,

716
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,770
right?

717
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,690
Better than driving unlicensed.

718
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,450
Exactly.

719
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,970
Right?

720
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,900
Now with this car

721
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,660
and holding this wheel,

722
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,180
I don't even worry

723
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,660
about the traffic police.

724
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,940
Accident ahead.

725
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,490
What's this car doing?

726
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,620
Move.

727
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,620
Mr. Gu,

728
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,210
my flight's tight.

729
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,250
Overtake if you can.

730
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,690
My daughter drills it into me,

731
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,050
"Passenger safety

732
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,420
always comes first."

733
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,620
You have a good girl.

734
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,770
Thanks.

735
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,450
I'm flattered.

736
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,450
Once we hit the airport,

737
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,450
you can just sprint ahead.

738
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,050
I'll haul your luggage

739
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,970
and chase after you.

740
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,010
You did load the luggage, right?

741
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,140
Luggage?

742
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,340
Uh… No.

743
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,900
You didn't?

744
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,860
Of course not!

745
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,140
How'd you miss the suitcase?

746
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,380
Turn around now!

747
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,820
Hurry.

748
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,010
Before it's gone.

749
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:57,860
My bad.

750
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,970
What a driver.

751
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,290
Hello.

752
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,660
Dear passenger,

753
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,490
we regret to inform you

754
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,770
that your flight, CA171,

755
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,940
to Shen City has been canceled.

756
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,770
Jeez.

757
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,690
What a day.

758
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,380
Why's

759
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,050
nothing going right?

760
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,770
Mr. Yi,

761
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,210
the master got back to us.

762
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,290
Your gut was right.

763
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,730
It's extremely

764
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,970
inauspicious.

765
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,490
1314?

766
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,860
817?

767
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,010
817.

768
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,380
1314.

769
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,010
1314817.

770
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,290
8171314.

771
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,900
1314.

772
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,340
8171314.

773
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,530
Don't go. Life or death.
[*A pun in Chinese]

774
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,660
Oh, it's heaven's will!

775
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,770
It must be.

776
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,210
My son warned me not to invest

777
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,770
in Tang Jingjing's movie.

778
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,340
He was right. Can't touch this.

779
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,900
Mr. Gu, no need

780
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,450
to rush now.

781
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,140
I'm

782
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:04,940
in no hurry now.

783
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,690
Take your time.

784
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,660
Okay.

785
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,380
But your suitcase…

786
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,420
Still gotta hurry for that.

787
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,290
Can't lose it.

788
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,100
Be quick.

789
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,730
Okay.

790
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,140
Shift to Sport mode.

791
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,450
This

792
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,620
burns more gas.

793
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,940
No worries. I'll cover it.

794
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,450
Okay.

795
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,140
Money's the last thing I lack.

796
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,660
Lin,

797
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,580
gotta take another leave today.

798
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,420
So you're waiting for Gu's update?

799
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,690
But seriously,

800
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,900
ever since

801
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,770
her celebration last time,

802
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,820
she's been on leave

803
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,660
for a whole week straight.

804
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,530
Is she sick?

805
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,490
And these other three

806
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,250
hit.

807
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,660
What's the common factor?

808
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,050
Their bosses were all born

809
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,140
in the Year of the Tiger.

810
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,770
How about your dad?

811
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,340
Tiger.

812
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,010
Right.

813
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,530
So scientifically

814
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,530
or mystically,

815
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,660
your dad shouldn't touch this project.

816
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,620
What's wrong?

817
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,100
I'm stress-testing right now.

818
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,770
Environmental parameters
are 10 times over the limit.

819
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,970
Alarm blaring is totally normal.

820
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,490
Why so tense?

821
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,050

825
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,140
to pull me to safety

826
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,420
did touch me.

827
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,340
Gotta post it to Moments

828
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,450
and give you a good shout-out.

829

yanking you back up.

832
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,690
Solid sentiment.

833
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,100
Lame wording.

834
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,420

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,900
Let me check.

967
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,700
Yi Tianyu,

968
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,820
you're up!

969
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,090
You skip class

970
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,780
to study tactics.

971
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,050
Now's your time to shine.

972
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,860
No way. I can't.

973
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,650
Coach!

974
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,940
I've got a sub here!

975
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,700
Gu Xuejiao again?

976
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,010
She's always hogging the spotlight.

977
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,050
Let me put her in her place.

978
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,570
Eight High's nemesis!

979
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,700
Seven High! Seven High!

980
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,380
Yi Tianyu,

981
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,090
how dare you

982
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,010
just sit and watch?

983
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,860
Get in!

984
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,530
Coach, I really can't.

985
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,300
No practice for ages. My hands are rusty.

986
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,340
Man up!

987
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,490
What's with the hesitation?

988
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,940
If you blow this chance,

989
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,220
you'll end up

990
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,380
a greasy, game-addicted loser!

991
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,570
Me?

992
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,650
A loser?

993
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,610
Are you kidding?

994
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,610
Go!

995
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,300
Hurry!

996
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,610
Change your clothes.

997
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,740
Get on the court!

998
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,940
Faster!

999
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,530
In life,

1000
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,450
everyone's chances

1001
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,300
are limited.

1002
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,260
Go.

1003
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,090
Already in jersey!

1004
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,220
Come here.

1005
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,530
Come on.

1006
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,860
Follow the tactics I taught you.

1007
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,420
Got it.

1008
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,860
Let's go.

1009
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,490
You confident?

1010
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,420
Yeah!

1011
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,380
Three, two, one.

1012
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,450
Go!

1013
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,940
Go!

1014
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,010
Go! Go! Go!

1015
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,530
Eight High! Eight High!

1016
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,940
Seven High!

1017
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,490
Eight High's nemesis!

1018
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,970
Go! Go!

1019
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,010
Turns out you shine brighter without me.

1020
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,090
Together, we're dump.

1021
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,610
Apart, we're stars.

1022
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,220
You gotta take a dump?

1023
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,300
I've got tissues!

1024
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,530
Thank you!

1025
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,530
No problem!

1026
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,840
[Restroom]

1027
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,570
The line's way too long.

1028
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,650
Has the second half started?

1029
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,220
Dean?

1030
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:44,610
Come with me.

1031
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,130
Shiyun, got tissues?

1032
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,970
Yeah.

1033
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,610
In my bag.

1034
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:56,700
Why's there…?

1035
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,340
Well…

1036
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,050
I found it on the street.

1037
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,050
No clue whose it was.

1038
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,970
Didn't wanna just leave it there,

1039
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,380
so I picked it up.

1040
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,220
Let me find it a good home.

1041
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,650
Go! Go!

1042
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,900
So satisfying.

1043
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,300
But…

1044
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,380
It doesn't feel proper.

1045
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,170
Shiyun,

1046
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,700
you're just too kind.

1047
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,090
That's why

1048
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,570
you got bullied by Gu Xuejiao
since childhood.

1049
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,970
And now she's showing off

1050
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,650
in front of Yi Tianyu.

1051
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,300
Who is it?

1052
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,380
Gu Xuejiao?

1053
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,010
Weren't you…?

1054
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,570
Dean.

1055
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,490
Mr. Fu.

1056
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,860
I'm so sorry.

1057
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,820
Hi,

1058
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,380
Senior Lin.

1059
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,220
Are you here to watch the game?

1060
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,220
Or looking for Xuejiao?

1061
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,860
She just went that way

1062
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,740
with a pack of cigarettes.

1063
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,340
Cigarettes?

1064
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,650
Where did you go?

1065
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,900
Lin,

1066
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,010
what brings you here?

1067
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,970
Not a cigarette.

1068
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,780
You think I smoke?

1069
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,530
Check your bag.

1070
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,050
Check again.

1071
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,970
It's not mine!

1072
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,530
It…

1073
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,380
Think who it could belong to.

1074
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,900
Nail polish? This color?

1075
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,130
Chen Xiao?

1076
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,300
Explain yourself.

1077
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,650
You're students

1078
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,820
from an elite class.

1079
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,900
How could you do this?

1080
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,970
Disgrace to Class One!

1081
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,780
Go back.

1082
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,010
Come on.

1083
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,780
Laugh if you want.

1084
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,490
Let's go.

1085
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,780
Do you think Mr. Fu

1086
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,010
will pull the ultimate move

1087
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,090
on Zhou Shiyun?

1088
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,970
Calling her parents?

1089
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,220
If that happens,

1090
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,340
her house

1091
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,490
will be chaos.

1092
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,010
You reminded me.

1093
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,090
I…?

1094
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,650
Hello, Lin.

1095
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,010
Hello, Mr. Fu.

1096
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,490
Xuejiao

1097
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,650
wants to beg for Shiyun.

1098
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,650
She says it's just a small thing,

1099
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,260
and there's no need to involve parents.

1100
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,530
Thanks to your tip-off.

1101
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,940
Framing a classmate is never small!

1102
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,260
Listen,

1103
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,970
this time, I'll handle it strictly.

1104
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,380
Their parents will be notified!

1105
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,420
Fine.

1106
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,900
Guess we have to listen to you.

1107
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,010
You…

1108
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,700
You're talented to be

1109
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,570
a shady bitch.

1110
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,700
What are you talking about?

1111
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,170
I don't understand.

1112
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,260
Of course!

1113
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,090
Though I

1114
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,300
was framed,

1115
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,050
it's a fact that smoking's
bad for health,

1116
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,780
especially for high school students.

1117
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,780
You were just

1118
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,650
looking out

1119
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,860
for us.

1120
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,420
By the way,

1121
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,010
why did you

1122
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,300
drop by today?

1123
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,090
I'm here to catch someone, too.

1124
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,740
