You've met him?

196
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,740
Met his driver,

197
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,370
strutting around.

198
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,540
Do you know this man?

199
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,370
In 2017,

200
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,300
he bought cryptocurrency

201
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,130
at $730

202
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,130
and sold it

203
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,500
at $20,000 by year's end.

204
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,620
In 2018,

205
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,740
before the stock market crashed,

206
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,100
he cleared out all his US stocks.

207
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,940
His properties doubled in price,

208
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,690
and he sold them off, too.

209
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:19,980
In 2019,

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,860
he jumped into tech stocks

211
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,210
and caught the biggest wave.

212
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,890
In 2020,

213
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,100
he switched to gold as a safe haven,

214
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,810
and it immediately hit a record high.

215
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,180
Sounds like he's got a crystal ball.

216
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,860
Who is he?

217
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,300
That's Mr. Yi.

218
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,060
He should be over

219
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,450
in Finance right now.

220
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,810
Later, I want you

221
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,420
to receive him.

222
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,090
I don't need it!

223
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,140
Why

224
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,490
is Lin Jiadong so angry?

225
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,450
I don't know.

226
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,540
What's got into him?

227
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,570
Don't forget who you are!

228
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,490
When you were starting out,

229
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,330
who was the one who stuck

230
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,090
with you through it all?

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,690
How many people have left?

232
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,330
The ones who stayed…

233
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,610
I calmed them down for you!

234
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,020
Talk about burning bridges.

235
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,450
You just kicked me to the curb!

236
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,140
Capitalists are all rotten!

237
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,060
Who are you?

238
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,690
Throw it away.

239
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,380
Thanks.

240
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,180
Not all capitalists

241
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,180
are bad.

242
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,180
Mr. Yi, this way.

243
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,020
I've never really

244
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,780
seen them as 'competitors'.

245
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,380
The market makes its choice.

246
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,330
The fittest survive.

247
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,660
With B&C's era ending,

248
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,380
another brand

249
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,660
will rise to replace it soon.

250
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,570
And hopefully, they'll set

251
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,180
a new, healthy standard

252
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,610
for competition in our industry.

253
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,970
Pretty good.

254
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,330
Alright, let me brief you

255
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,260
on our progress.

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,450
Currently, the most critical V2X module

257
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,940
for C3 is in trial operation.

258
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,730
Everything's stable.

259
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,330
But the trial operation

260
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,380
and real-world scenarios

261
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,300
are different.

262
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,900
Theoretically, it can handle

263
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,610
all the complex conditions

264
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,180
in simulated road tests,

265
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,900
but once it hits the road,

266
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,090
can it perfectly

267
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,420
avoid obstacles?

268
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,020
That's the number one challenge

269
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,260
you need to crack next.

270
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,540
Yes.

271
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,300
Gu Xuejiao, what do you mean?

272
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,780
Exactly what you saw.

273
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,060
Emotions expressed

274
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,940
loud and clear.

275
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,490
We're all used

276
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,660
to the daily battles

277
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,780
between Tech Dept One and Two.

278
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,140
Show her the meeting minutes.

279
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,970
You don't say.

280
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,380
It's like a No. 7 High reunion.

281
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,420
Dodging responsibility.

282
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,450
You're just like a schoolkid.

283
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,850
Who are you calling a schoolkid?

284
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,690
Whoever I feel like.

285
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,260
Did you record the meeting?

286
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,490
Put together a work document

287
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,060
and show it to her.

288
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,260
Who dares put

289
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,330
non-work-related things in the report?

290
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,450
Don't try to confuse matters.

291
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,660
When did I do that?

292
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,140
My apologies.

293
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,940
It's been a busy day.

294
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,780
How's the tour going?

295
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,180
Good.

296
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,140
How come you're alone?

297
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,940
Where's your assistant?

298
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,690
I fired him.

299
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,140
Just like that?

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,690
Go on,

301
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,660
continue with the tour.

302
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,300
Mr. Yi,

303
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,850
this way.

304
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,810
Focus on the business, okay?

305
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,330
Who's not focusing?

306
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,140
Mr. Lin,

307
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,780
you're right on time.

308
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,570
You weigh in!

309
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,690
Starting today,

310
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,330
we'll combine Tech Dept One

311
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,180
and Tech Dept Two.

312
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,180
The fight over the V2X protocol's

313
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,300
conversion efficiency
and reproducibility

314
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,300
is way too intense.

315
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,540
You should be working together.

316
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,260
Not happening.

317
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,450
I think you can work together

318
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,810
pretty well.

319
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,330
Now you're all united.

320
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,300
United against me.

321
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,850
This is coming from the board.

322
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,260
To my drinking buddy.

323
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,210
To my drinking buddy.

324
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,020
Weren't you

325
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,020
a bit too much today?

326
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,490
Coming to my turf to argue with me.

327
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,330
If anyone's being too much, it's you.

328
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,260
What does

329
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,540
'my own little patch' even mean?

330
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,490
Fine.

331
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,180
Let's make a deal.

332
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,810
Anything work-related

333
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,140
is just work.

334
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,850
Don't make it personal.

335
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,490
Okay?

336
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,690
I'll try.

337
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,540
Don't try.

338
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,380
You must.

339
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,330
I must try.

340
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,730
I'm late.

341
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,140
I'll take three shots.

342
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,940
You're just thirsty, aren't you?

343
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,210
You call yourselves

344
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,540
'the hope of No. 7 High'?

345
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,540
What on earth are you drinking?

346
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,850
Jackie,

347
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,140
I have two nice bottles stashed away.

348
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,090
Bring them up.

349
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,780
Okay.

350
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,060
Thank you, Ms. Sun.

351
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,260
No biggie.

352
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,380
I just sat down to rest a bit,

353
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,020
but the phone won't stop ringing.

354
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,570
Like the world's gonna end without me.

355
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,850
Maybe it will.

356
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,180
Go take the call.

357
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,810
Don't let a drink

358
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,020
get in the way of your business.

359
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,730
Yeah.

360
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,020
Fine.

361
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,730
You guys drink up.

362
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,850
Don't save any for me.

363
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,210
But save the gossip for me.

364
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,490
Hello?

365
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,020
Come on.

366
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,690
To Ms. Sun.

367
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,780
You have a business trip again?

368
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,810
Unlike somebody,

369
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,180
there's not only work

370
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,380
in my life,

371
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,690
but also a man.

372
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,090
Oh, please.

373
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,380
Don't bring that up.

374
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,450
I'm gonna move in

375
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,690
with Lin Zhihua for a while.

376
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,690
My parents worry that

377
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,020
we're gonna fight all the time

378
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,300
like his parents.

379
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,660
They told me,

380
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,730
"If you've got guts, just try it."

381
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,140
So I'm trying.

382
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,570
Why are you

383
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,900
wasting your time with me here?

384
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,850
Go.

385
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,090
Now that you asked me.

386

It's getting late.

580
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,820
I still have work to do.

581
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,100
We're old classmates.

582
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,450
I'll organize a class reunion.

583
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,580
We can catch up then.

584
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,450
Gu Xuejiao,

585
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,820
what are you afraid of?

586
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,970
Yi Tianyu,

587
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,050
let go of me.

588
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,100
Yi Tianyu.

589
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,010
Gu Xuejiao.

590
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,140
I used to think

591
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,050
I could be like you,

592
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,940
pretending I didn't know anything.

593
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,290
But later, I realized

594
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,940
I couldn't.

595
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,180
I'm not as cold-hearted as you.

596
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,420
Yes.

597
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,380
I came back here for you.

598
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,100
And you know that.

599
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,900
That's why you're avoiding me, isn't it?

600
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,620
We were classmates after all.

601
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,820
I was trying

602
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,180
not to embarrass you.

603
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,010
I have a boyfriend,

604
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,140
and we're happy together.

605
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,530
If you don't know

606
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,210
how to keep

607
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,290
the right distance,

608
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,250
then we shouldn't

609
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,210
see each other again.

610
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,100
I just want you to know

611
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,450
I'm your best choice.

612
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,340
You and I

613
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,660
have only

614
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,530
ever been

615
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,180
just classmates.

616
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,580
Let go.

617
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,290
Gu Xuejiao.

618
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,530
For you, I gave up basketball.

619
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,100
I stopped being lazy.

620
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,010
I changed everything

621
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,050
you didn't like about me.

622
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,970
But there's one thing

623
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,860
that has never changed.

624
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,820
Stop.

625
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,770
I've become the kind of person you like.

626
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,490
Why can't we at least

627
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,290
give it a try?

628
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,770
Don't romanticize a road

629
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,050
you've never walked on.

630
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,340
I have someone I love.

631
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,100
In the past,

632
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,250
present,

633
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,250
or future,

634
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,250
we'll never be together.

635
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,770
Why?

636
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,970
Because I've tried.

637
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,860
How do you know

638
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,180
Yi Tianyu was my ex last time?

639
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,050
This time,

640
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,250
we are really

641
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,210
just friends.

642
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,050
Do you think Yi Tianyu

643
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,730
will be different this time?

644
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,620
What if

645
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,820
he's changed?

646
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,730
Xuejiao,

647
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,690
I'm taking back the life
that belongs to me,

648
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,660
the life that belongs to us.

649
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,490
You're back?

650
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,490
I'm cooking.

651
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,940
I just saw a monkey.

652
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,210
Too agile.

653
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,620
Surprise.

654
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,180
Thank you.

655
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,250
Lin, enough already.

656
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,180
Come and sit down.

657
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,690
We've got more than enough food here.

658
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,420
Lin,

659
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,580
you're a busy man.

660
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,660
No need to cook yourself.

661
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,530
Not really.

662
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,340
This is the last dish.

663
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,770
He doesn't often show off
his cooking skills.

664
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,420
Let him have his moment.

665
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,690
Sit.

666
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,580
Uncle, Auntie.

667
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,530
I invited you today

668
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,900
to apologize for what happened last time.

669
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,050
I'm so sorry.

670
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,730
It wasn't your fault.

671
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,940
It was just an accident,

672
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,580
right?

673
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,180
Yeah.

674
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,450
Nothing to do with you.

675
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,940
Xuejiao told us,

676
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,100
in your family,

677
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,860
your mom 'disciplines' your dad.

678
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,770
That put our minds halfway at ease.

679
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,340
We were a little worried at first.

680
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,690
You're both young.

681
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,050
What if you wanna lay hands on Xuejiao

682
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,530
when you have some conflict?

683
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,210
Wait, no…

684
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,580
What we mean is,

685
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,340
what if Xuejiao

686
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,140
wants to 'discipline' you…

687
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,620
What do you think?

688
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,380
That's fine by me.

689
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,010
Uncle,

690
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,140
a toast to you.

691
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,900
Okay.

692
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,490
Here.

693
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,620
I'm happy

694
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,940
to have a drink with my

695
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,580
future son-in-law.

696
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,250
We'll be family soon.

697
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,860
No need for apologies.

698
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,340
Come on!

699
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,900
Yes…

700
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,420
Okay.

701
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,420
This afternoon,

702
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,580
a traffic accident occurred

703
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,900
in the High-Tech Zone of Jinghai City.

704
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,730
The driver was seriously injured.

705
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,100
According to witnesses,

706
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:33,970
the vehicle involved

707
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,970
was a Huachuang C2 model.

708
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,770
There appeared to be
signs of brake failure.

709
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,530
We will be speaking to industry experts

710
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,420
to bring you a special report.

711
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,620
Is Mr. Yi here?

712
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,050
Please wait a moment.

713
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,900
How's Mr. Yi?

714
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,210
We're here to apologize

715
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,860
on behalf of Huachuang.

716
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,730
How do you have the nerve to show up?

717
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,620
Tianyu refuses

718
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,340
to see anyone from Huachuang.

719
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,860
I understand how he feels right now.

720
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,380
The car he was driving

721
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,530
was the C2 we gifted

722
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,290
to Blue Mountain Capital.

723
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,290
The investigation isn't complete yet,

724
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,770
but we are the primary party responsible.

725
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,490
So we came to apologize

726
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,380
on behalf of Huachuang.

727
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,140
Whenever Mr. Yi

728
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,860
is ready to see us,

729
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,940
we'll come back.

730
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,900
Qi Lei.

731
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,660
I'm not just representing Huachuang.

732
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,010
I'm here as myself.

733
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,860
We were classmates.

734
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,210
I'm just as worried

735
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,580
about Yi Tianyu as you are.

736
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,050
If he doesn't want to see us,

737
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,250
we'll leave right away.

738
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,490
But

739
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,180
can you at least tell me

740
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,450
how he's doing?

741
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,380
Qi Lei!

742
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,490
Wait here.

743
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,900
Tianyu said

744
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,530
he'll only see you.

745
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,860
Let me.

746
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,690
You just stand there without a word?

747
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,770
It's not my funeral.

748
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:53,730
Have some water.

749
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,140
No.

750
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,940
Drinking makes it worse.

751
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,530
I came here to…

752
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,380
I forgive you.

753
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,210
After all,

754
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,940
we've been friends

755
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,820
for so many years.

756
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,660
As a friend,

757
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,730
I need to apologize to you.

758
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,970
As a member of the C2 technical team,

759
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,380
I owe you an even bigger apology.

760
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,340
When the investigation is complete,

761
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,860
I promise you'll have an answer.

762
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,940
I'm tired.

763
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,290
You may leave.

764
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,380
Feels even more like a funeral now.

765
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,900
And shouldn't

766
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,140
Lin Zhihua be the one bowing?

767
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,580
Can that

768
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,660
even be delegated?

769
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,450
Please believe me.

770
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,660

00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,490
is all restricted now.

964
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,420
We can only count

965
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,530
on your Shiyun now.

966
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,860
Yeah.

967
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,260
Luckily, you two

968
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,530
always fight at work,

969
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,220
or Blue Mountain

970
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,420
wouldn't have agreed to let Shiyun

971
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,340
continue the software investigation.

972
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,170
Wait, Lin.

973
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,170
Did you anticipate that

974
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,820
Blue Mountain

975
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,940
would limit our team?

976
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,450
You're disturbing Shiyun.

977
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,820
No.

978
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,530
I found a new lead.

979
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,420
Look here.

980
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,820
I compiled simulation data

981
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,340
of the driving trajectories of us

982
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:28,940
and discovered

983
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,780
something interesting.

984
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,570
None

985
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,650
of the simulated trajectories

986
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,260
matched

987
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,340
the actual driving path

988
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,260
of Yi Tianyu.

989
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,820
Why is his trajectory

990
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,900
so straight?

991
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,820
Because he didn't

992
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,220
make the instinctive steering move

993
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,820
most people do in emergencies.

994
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,780
Exactly.

995
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,130
Usually, when we

996
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,130
encounter danger

997
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,780
on the road,

998
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,300
especially experienced drivers,

999
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,420
we first hit the brakes.

1000
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,740
If the brakes fail,

1001
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,380
we instinctively steer

1002
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,130
to avoid the hazard.

1003
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,570
But his driving path

1004
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,570
is so straight.

1005
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,740
Only two possibilities.

1006
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,610
Either

1007
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,130
he was too stunned

1008
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,130
to react in time.

1009
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,380
- Or…
- Or

1010
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,300
he knew the car

1011
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,130
would lose control.

1012
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,530
How is that possible?

1013
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,130
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

1014
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,050
The vehicle's onboard system

1015
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,940
logs all operations.

1016
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,530
If we analyze them, it'll be clear.

1017
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,610
This part is

1018
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,650
even more suspicious.

1019
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,530
The company's server

1020
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,900
was undergoing maintenance

1021
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,650
during that exact period.

1022
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,700
So the program logs

1023
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,220
from Yi Tianyu's accident vehicle

1024
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,170
have been lost.
