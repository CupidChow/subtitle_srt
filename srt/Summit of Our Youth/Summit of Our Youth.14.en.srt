Have you checked the school forum?

18
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,250
About you...

19
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,890

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,170
that I was reborn?

Oh no!

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,140

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,570

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,810
Three.

96
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,780

make it three per person
for all four of us!

99
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,410
Three per person...

100
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,570
So that's

101
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,500
one, two...

102
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,340
Hang on a sec!

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,860

104
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,940
count that far?

105
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,010

106
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,620
everyone!

Come early tomorrow!

109
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,210
Really sorry about this.

110
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,060
Our bad!

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,940
So sorry!

112
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,450
We waited forever... Let's go.

113
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,300
Sorry!

114
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,500
Hold on, Tiantian!

115
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,010
We've been waiting forever too!

116
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,250
Don't worry!

117
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,330
Of course I've

118
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,250
saved some for my friends!

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,500

No exceptions.

122
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,100

for my girl Xuejiao!

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,940
Consider this my friendship discount.

126
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,740
Good, right?

127
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,690
Awesome!

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,370
Worth the hype?

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,940
Girl,

130
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,660
if you

131
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,450
sold this off-campus,

132
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,690
you'd crush every boba shop out there.

133
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,450
No kidding.

134
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,100
Some guy in line

135
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,010
said he's

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,210
an investor

137
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,980
and wants to fund me.

138
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,500
That's great! What'd you say?

139
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,300
Said

140
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,450
he'd choose between me

141
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,740
and some shop

142
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,690
called "HiTea"...

143
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,130
But he was really into my stuff.

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,620
So,

145
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,690
what'd you say?

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,180
I straight-up told him:

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,300
if you want milk tea,

148
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,010
you're welcome.

149
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,890
Try to scam me? Dream on.

150
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,540
There're scammers everywhere.

151
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,010
Like I'm gonna fall for that!

152
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,770
That's rich.

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,660
Learned

154
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,860
from your drunk kiss disaster,

155
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,740
appreciate it!

156
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,060
Totally, right?

157
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,330
Too many

158
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,980
con artists these days.

159
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,540
My goodness.

160
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,810
You made the right choice!

161
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,940
We're way too sharp

162
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,980
for that nonsense.

With 90% of the votes in,

164
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,810
the results show...

165
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,500
Wonder what Xuejiao's doing.

166
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,810
What's on her mind?

167
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,980
Maybe she's remembering

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,500
what she said?

169
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,100
Last life,

170
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,660
I was her boss, and she hated me.

171
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,330
This time,

172
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm the senior she looks up to.

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,770
So,

174
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,660
I'll stay in this role

175
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,370
to get along with her.

176
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,370
It's better this way,

177
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,130
for both of us.

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,250
Ever since Lin left,

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,330
the lab's felt too quiet.

180
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,660
Wonder how he's doing now.

181
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,010
Work's going well?

182
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,860
We barely talk anymore.

183
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,740
He keeps his distance too.

184
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,690
Grown-ups, you know.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,540
We move on.

186
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,420
Whatever happened that farewell night

187
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,300
has gone

188
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,690
with the wind.

189
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,980
This is the vibe you're giving off

190
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,770
as part of the Capital U lab?

191
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,210
You...

192
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,450
What's the deal?

193
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,210
Lin Zhihua,

194
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,210
what's the deal?

195
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,770
Why

196
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,250
are you guys back already?

197
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,810
Did the B&C Motors deal fall apart?

198
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,940
Actually,

199
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,100
quite the opposite.

200
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,250
This trip to Germany

201
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,980
wasn't about securing

202
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,540
an offer.

203
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,300
We wanted B&C Motors

204
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,890
to invest

205
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,740
in our

206
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,420
C1 project.

207
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,450
At first,
they acted all high and mighty,

208
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,420
saying there's no precedent.

209
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,860
Now they've caved.

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,570
I'm telling you, kid,

211
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,660
that was a huge gamble.

212
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,330
What if they didn't agree?

213
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,010
Professor,

214
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,770
Lin went all in this time,

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,570
and it paid off.

216
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,500
Even I was almost fooled.

217
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,940
Honestly, I never wanted

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,100
to work for them.

219
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,980
Even if it didn't work out,

220
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,300
we had Junlian

221
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,890
and Mr. Zhao's funding as plan B.

222
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,010
Now B&C's feeling the heat,

223
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,060
and they're scrambling.

224
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,740
They've caved in

225
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,130
on a bunch of our terms.

226
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,570
We don't need to go overseas

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,370
to work for them.

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,210
We can stay right here

229
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,770
and build our own

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,210
startup team.

231
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,900
You always take the riskiest path!

232
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,490
Feint east, strike west,

233
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,490
you fooled everyone!

234
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,730
Even pulled off that

235
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,090
crowdfunded farewell party?

236
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,690
Once B&C Motors' funding lands,

237
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,060
we'll pay it back ten times over.

238
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,300
Not enough!

239
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,140
Gotta leave the school

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,210
a decent investment share.

241
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,380
Don't worry, Professor Tan.

242
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,940
I'll stay on

243
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,180
to lead the lab.

244
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,420
But besides

245
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,690
the original C1 crew,

246
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,730
I'll need an assistant.

247
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,260
An assistant?

248
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,690
Professor Tan!

249
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,570
How about me?

250
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,900
Professor, I can do it!

251
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,660
Professor, I'm your guy!

252
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,730
All of you, shut up!

253
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,810
More excited to work for Lin

254
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,780
than for me, huh?

Zhihua...

257
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,810
Get back to work.

258
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,210
I've already got someone in mind.

259
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,210
What?

260
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm just a freshman!

261
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,020
How can I be your assistant?

262
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,450
You're the only one besides me

263
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,090
who cracked

264
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,380
Professor Tan's virus code.

265
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,020
Who else could it be?

266
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,900
Alright, fine.

267
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,610
Give me something to do.

268
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,940
Gao Rui and I

269
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,210
just wrapped up the C1 code.

270
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,260
We need you to proofread it.

271
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,540
How many lines?

272
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,690
Over ten thousand.

273
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,540
Are you guys

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,730
even human?

275
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,060
Efficiency is key.

Your face

277
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,730
is bad news, day or night.

278
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,970
What's that?

279
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,730
Nothing.

280
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,900
You sure you don't remember anything

281
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,020
from the day we saw you off?

282
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,690
I do.

283
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,420
You didn't want me to leave and...

284
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,900
Stop!

285
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,490
I officially

286
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,420
deny everything

287
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,060
from that night.

288

Pure drunk talk.

289
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,610
Anyway, once you're done proofreading,

290
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,380
load it into the simulator.

291
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,780
We're testing tomorrow.

292
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,540
Got it.

293
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,900
I'll grab an external drive.

294
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,540
No need.

295
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,570
Use this.

297
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,380
since I was Xuejiao's

first tutor,

299
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,780
that makes me your senior, yeah?

300
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,780
Got any tips for me?

301
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,490
She's not into you.

302
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,780
If she were really into you,

303
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,690
no way

304
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,940
she'd drop off a drive

305
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,940
and leave without a word.

306
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,380

Lin,

309
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,300
maybe you should get back to work?

310
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,490
I can't concentrate with you

311
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,420
staring like that.

312
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,570

around Capital U,

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,180
I haven't seen you

388
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,380
look this lost in years.

389
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,610
So there's this girl,

390
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,850
she kissed one of my roommates.

391
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,090
Now, my roommate

392
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,180
has a thing for her.

393
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,940
But...

394
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,780
But?

395
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,660
But this girl,

396
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,660
because of stuff in her past,

397
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,690
she doesn't want

398
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,940
to start anything new romantically.

399
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,570
What's she like?

400
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,610
Exactly like you.

401
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,850
Career-first,

402
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,380
laser-focused,

403
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,730
no time for guys.

404
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,730
A career-driven ice queen?

405
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,730
Once someone
shuts out romance like that,

406
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,940
it's really tough

407
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,300
to open up again.

408
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,300
So for you

409
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,180
career-driven girls,

410
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,490
are all guys just like

411
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,540
throwaway rags,

412
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,260
totally not worth your time?

413
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,610
Besides,

414
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,940
my career isn't bad either!

415
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,330
Let me tell you,

416
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,090
to girls who are all about love,

417
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,540
every guy starts at a perfect score.

418
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,380
Mess up and the score drops,

419
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,450
down to zero.

420
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,300
But career-driven girls?

421
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,900
You start at zero.

422
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,570
But if you impress her,

423
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,420
the points go up,

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,900
all the way to 100.

425
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,380
Only then will she say yes.

426
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,570
So if I hit 100,

427
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,570
I've got a chance?

428
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,140
Harder than flying to the moon.

429
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,730
But humans

430
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,850
did make it to the moon in the end.

431
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,090
Bye then. Enjoy your drink.

432
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,380
Hold on,

433
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,210
so you're done with younger girls

434
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,060
and into older women now?

435
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,810
What about Xuejiao?

436
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,420
Don't twist it.

437
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,610
She's the only one.

438
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,970
Weirdo.

439
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,290
Gao.

440
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,250
Wrong person!

441
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,050
Why are you running away?

442
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,860
Am I really that scary?

443
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,100
Boys these days, huh?

444
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,660
Alright, that's it for today.

445
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,340
Dismissed!

446
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,010
Thanks, Coach!

447
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,660
See you.

448
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,490
Bye!

449
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,450
Hit BBQ tonight?

450
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,690
I'll pass.

451
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,730
Got stuff to do.

452
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,100
So committed?

453
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,210
Intercollegiate games

454
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,900
are starting soon.

455
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,660
Gotta train more.

456
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,450
You guys go ahead.

457
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,340
See you.

458
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,210
Bye.

459
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,100
Anyone here?

460
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,660
Xuejiao.

461
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,770
I...

462
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,050
I...

463
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,100
I... I... I...

464
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,820
God, I'm pathetic.

465
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,100
How hard can

466
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,940
"I like you" be?

467
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,530
Xuejiao,

468
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,250
I like you.

469
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,250
Ugh, too cheesy, dude.

470
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,140
Xuejiao,

471
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,250
I like you.

472
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,970
Be my girlfriend.

473
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,210
Way too pushy?

474
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,530
No way.

475
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,050
I gotta go all out.

476
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,100
Xuejiao.

477
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,450
We made it

478
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,580
to the city college league finals!

479
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,010
I'm in the starting lineup!

480
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,250
I'm inviting you to watch...

481
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,860
No,

482
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,770
you have to come cheer for me!

483
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,580
What's this?

484
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,860
Give them back.

485
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,050
Final tickets?

486
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,760
City College Basketball League

487
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,820
These are for me and Xuejiao,

488
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,140
right?

489
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,660
Thanks.

490
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,050
I'll deliver it myself. Give 'em back!

491
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,940
She's buried in lab work.

492
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,900
You won't even catch her.

493
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,580
Hand them over!

494
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,050
No take-backs!

495
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,290
My delivery now.

496
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm heading to the kitchen.

497
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,050
Just tell her, okay?

498
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,620
Bye.

499
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,340
Remember to give it to her!

500
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,580
Bye!

501
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,050
For self-driving,

502
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,530
besides replacing

503
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,820
preset routes with AI,

504
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,770
it's vital

505
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,420
to have real-time monitoring

506
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,450
of unexpected situations,

507
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,100
like if the driver passes out.

508
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,210
In that case,

509
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,380
the AI

510
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,340
has to take over,

511
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,530
pull the car over safely,

512
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,490
and call their family

513
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,140
and emergency services.

514
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,210
I can really relate

515
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,620
to that scenario.

516
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,660
Even, say,

517
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,580
if the driver

518
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,210
is drunk,

519
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,210
we should prevent

520
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,970
the car from starting

521
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,970
so they don't break the law.

522
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,420
To make that happen,

523
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,660
we need

524
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,900
real-time

525
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,900
heart rate monitoring.

526
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,340
That means

527
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,140
every driver would have to

528
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,210
wear a heart rate tracker,

529
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,620
which isn't

530
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,250
exactly practical.

531
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,290
So at C1,

532
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,490
we worked with medical companies

533
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,290
to build heart rate sensors

534
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,900
into the seatbelt.

535
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,420
You're probably wondering,

536
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,290
"It's worn over clothes,

537
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,660
and drivers are bound

538
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,010
to adjust their seating position,

539
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,180
how could it get

540
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,940
an accurate reading?"

541
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,340
Gao,

542
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,180
you two sound like

543
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,250
you're selling something on TV.

544
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,180
The monitoring program

545
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,180
is designed to detect

546
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,010
a heart rate change

547
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,050
of up to 5%

548
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,530
in less than 20 seconds.

549
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,340
So for today's test,

550
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,380
we've got these two seats

551
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,420
and two testers.

552
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,660
I'll take this one.

553
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,820
And that one...

554
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,660
Gu Xuejiao.

555
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,580
Why?

556
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,970
Gao,

557
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,660
aren't you the testing expert?

558
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,100
Lab rule.

559
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,340
Whoever built the part

560
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,210
tests it first.

561
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,140
Plus, you're Lin's assistant.

562
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,770
So...

563
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,180
Go ahead.

564
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,730
Whatever.

565
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,820
Not like it's an electric chair.

566
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,340
Here, one for each of you.

567
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,900
Let's simulate a real-life situation.

568
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,380
Start the test.

569
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,420
You think

570
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,660
this strap is reliable?

571
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,340
It is.

572
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,690
Xuejiao's heart rate

573
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,620
is already going up.

574
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,050
If I were sitting across from Zhihua,

575
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,380
mine would spike too.

576
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,420
This is just

577
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,940
a heart rate monitor.

578
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,340
Piece of cake.

579
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,820
Anyway,

580
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,770
just don't
