00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,180
He has an algorithm model

194
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,090
that can analyze market trends.

195
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,540

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,140
there are agencies

386
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,540
that help you haggle.

387
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,610
You pay them

388
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,420
500 yuan,

389
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,780
and they can talk prices down

390
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,260
by tens of thousand.

391
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,210
That sounds unlikely…

392
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,180
We actually know that landlord

393
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,020
pretty well.

394
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,210
Been friends for years.

395
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,850
He won't…

396
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,690
How much do they even want?

397
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,850
That place isn't

398
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,180
worth much.

399
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,810
It's dark and rundown.

400
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,260
Couldn't even

401
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,380
give it away for free.

402
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,090
Think about it again.

403
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,780
These days,

404
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,940
when buying a place,

405
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,140
it's not about money

406
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,540
but about negotiation skills.

407
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,300
Don't let your landlord

408
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,450
fool you.

409
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,300
Coming.

410
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,570
Hi,

411
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,490
Mingze.

412
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,300
Come on in…

413
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,850
Auntie.

414
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,260
Haven't heard from you for a while.

415
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,730
How are you?

416
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,940
Still prepping for the exam?

417
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,940
Yeah, right.

418
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,570
Still at it.

419
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,020
Look at

420
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,450
this poor boy.

421
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,690
How many years has it been?

422
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,330
Honestly,

423
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,140
you might as well get a job.

424
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,260
If it's hard to find one,

425
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,970
just tell me.

426
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,380
My husband can help set you up.

427
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,540
That won't be necessary.

428
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,940
This kid's

429
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,610
grown up

430
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,610
and got ambition.

431
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,300
He doesn't come home

432
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,180
right away after school.

433
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,490

434
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,970
tutoring sessions,

435
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,810
right?

436
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,780
Yeah…

437
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,330
It's only four.

438
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,420
Why did you come here?

439
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,850
Shouldn't you be in class?

440
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,380
Gu Xuejiao asked me to drop this off

441
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,180
for you.

442
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,300
For me?

443
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,180
That's… a lot of cash.

444
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,290
Where'd you get it?

445
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,290
Actually, Xuejiao and I…

446
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,730
It's Dad, he bought the dip

447
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,210
after tracking the recent

448
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,970
moving average.

449
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,690
Gu Xuejiao,

450
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,940
these lines are way too hard
to memorize.

451
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,860
Yeah.

452
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,180
That's roughly it.

453
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,450
Dad told me

454
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,530
I must sell today

455
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,970
and bring you the cash.

456
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,900
Oh,

457
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,380
the rest of the compensation money

458
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,140
is also here.

459
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,340
These two bags of cash

460
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,180
are heavy as hell.

461
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,180
Perfect.

462
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,340
Let me drink that.

463
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,620
That…

464
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,290
Why does it taste so bad?

465
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,860
It's expired.

466
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,970
How much money have you got there?

467
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,210
You…

468
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,140
made it all from stocks?

469
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,180
Anyway, it's enough.

470
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,340
Wanjun,

471
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,450
thank you so much.

We'll be off then.

476

Bye-bye, Auntie.

477
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,050
Boy,

478
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,660
hold it.

479
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,530
What are you showing off for?

480
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,530
Mock me with all that cash?

481
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,380
A bunch of stupid, broke relatives.

482
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,450
Hurry up.

483
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,660
Mom,

484
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,340
I only skipped one

485
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,730
college prep rally.

486
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,250
But I swear

487
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,660
I've been through that every year.

488
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,530
I've even memorized every line

489
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,860
the teacher says.

490
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,770
You sold all our stocks?

491
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,970
But that's our

492
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,900
golden goose!

493
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,900
You're mad about that?

494
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,340
Xuejiao said it was Lin's idea.

495
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,290
Lin ran his algorithm model

496
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,050
and found that

497
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,730
a market crash is highly likely next year.

498
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,620
Thousands of stocks will hit limit down.

499

501
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,140
So, it's science?

502
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,620
Then we'd better follow.

503
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,530
What's a 'bag holder'?

504
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,730
No idea.

The mock exam's near.

509

She rushed off after class

510
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,970
to study with Lin.

511
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,860
The tutoring money

512
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,770
is really well spent.

I gotta carry it back home safely.

Fine.

521
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,690
But it's safer with me.

522
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,420
Don't swing it around.

523
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,100
Give it to me.

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,360
High school life is coming to an end.

579
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,690
The college entrance exam
is also imminent.

580
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,820
Now,

581
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,530
it's up to you

582
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,210
to race against time.

583
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,820
Make every second count!

584
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,010
Make the most of your time.

585
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,420
Don't waste a single moment

586
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,450
of your lives.

587
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,770
Stay grounded.

588
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,820
Don't miss a single opportunity

589
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,140
in the final sprint.

590
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,250
To rise and shine, you gotta grind.

591
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,290
Don't look back, stay on track.

592
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,660
No perm,

593
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,210
no wave,

594
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,050
until college is saved.

595
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,180
Left foot to Tsinghua,

596
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,860
right to Capital U.

597
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,620
The sword of destiny

598
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,050
is in your own hands.

599
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,530
Let's go!

600
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,860
Draw your swords of victory

601
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,100
and fight bravely!

602
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,180
Go, college entrance exam!

603
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,490
Go! Go! Go!

604
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,160
[26 Days Till College Entrance Exam
12 May, 2015]

605
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,900
Have you heard?

606
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,860
You've heard it, too?

607
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,450
Yeah.

608
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,690
What have you heard?

609
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,940
You tell him.

610
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,580
No, you.

611
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,340
You.

612
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,730
Wait, anyone is fine.

613
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,450
Just tell me.

614
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,490
Hurry.

615
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,450
Xuejiao!

616
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,420
Xuejiao!

617
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,900
Have you heard?

618
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,970
Yes!

619
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,180
Wait, you've all heard?

620
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,050
Why am I left out?

621
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,180
Tell me now.

622
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,820
What is it?

623
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,580
We've heard…

624
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,250
Ms. Yin's here.

625
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,970
Ms. Yin's here.

626
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:53,970
Class begins.

627
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,010
Stand up.

628
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,730
Good morning, teacher.

629
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,450
Good morning, everyone.

630
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,140
Sit down.

631
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,970
Sorry!

632
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,140
Ms. Yin.

633
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,940
Sorry, I'm late.

634
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,290
Hold on.

635
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,860
Don't go to your seat yet.

636
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,730
Stand there.

637
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:11,970
Come on.

638
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,290
Hear my sigh?

639
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,010
Why?

640
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,770
Your results this time

641
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,340
were generally not very good.

642
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,180
In such a terrible situation,

643
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,970
some of you are still not

644
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,210
focused on your studies.

645
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,770
Some were already
at the bottom of our class,

646
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,380
and their results have even

647
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,290
dropped by many points.

648
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,900
I won't name your names.

649
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,770
Reflect on it yourselves.

650
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,660
Don't just lower your head.

651
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,050
Do take it to heart.

652
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,580
I hope

653
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,380
you can

654
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,660
do some serious thinking.

655
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,530
But there are some students

656
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,820
who did make progress.

657
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,660
Come up here.

658
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,970
No way.

659
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,420
This is my only time
being late this semester.

660
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,420
And I'm gonna be made an example?

661
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,900
You ungrateful bastards.

662
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,900
I worked so hard

663
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,100
helping with your studies.

664
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,580
Now I'm in trouble,

665
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,660
and you all just laugh at me.

666
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,450
In this mock exam,

667
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,180
all students in our class

668
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
have significantly improved.

669
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,340
Some raised their score
by a dozen points,

670
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,180
some even a hundred!

671
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,380
I am very happy

672
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,380
for you.

673
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,380
In contrast,

674
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,690
some students

675
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,250
who had previously performed well

676
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,820
were overtaken.

677
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,140
This time,

678
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,420
a dark horse

679
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,770
charged into

680
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,660
the top ten in the grade.

681
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,970
Guess who it is.

682
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,050
Gu Xuejiao.

683
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,620
Tell me,

684
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,860
how did you manage

685
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,380
to rank tenth in the entire grade

686
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,050
without a word?

687
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,660
Hear the cheers?

688
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,940
That is Gu Xuejiao

689
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,820
from Class 8.

690
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,180
Guys,

691
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,290
that's Class 8.

692
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,100
You are Class 1.

693
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,820
I'll save

694
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,450
the harsh words.

695
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,010
You know how you've done.

696
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,660
Alright,

697
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,530
that's all I'm gonna say.

698
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:24,970
Now,

699
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,100
I'll read out the results.

700
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,100
Okay.

701
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,970
No. 11 in the grade,

702
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,900
Zhou Shiyun.

703
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,340
Keep up the good work.

704
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,210
Yes, sir.

705
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,490
Huang Xiaojia.

706
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,580
No. 149.

707
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,620
What happened?

708
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,140
Huh?

709
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,690
Skipped a major question?

710
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,490
Xue Chenyu, No. 231.

711
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,940
An elite class student

712
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,900
falls out of the first 200.

713
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,140
Where were you last time?

714
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,100
I mean, guys,

715
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,690
honestly,

716
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,730
I really don't wanna read it.

717
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,210
Why?

718
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,010
Because I just…

719
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,580
Your results are so worrying.

720
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,660
It's giving me ulcers.

721
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,210
I'm telling you…

722
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,100
Xuejiao.

723
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,900
Once classmates, lifelong friends.

724
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,730
What's your secret?

725
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,380
Share with us.

726
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,250
Yeah, Xuejiao.

727
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,210
In just a few weeks,

728
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,490
your scores have

729
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,290
skyrocketed.

730
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,420
So impressive.

731
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,730
Xuejiao really helped us

732
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,580
a lot.

733
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,290
Tianyu.

734
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,900
Tell them how much you scored.

735
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,900
Not much.

736
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,180
Just 369.

737
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,660
Scram!

738
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,940
But I can get in UFE now.

739
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,690
Yes…

740
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,290
Boss.

741
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,340
Can you tutor me a bit?

742
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,660
- Please?
- I want in, too.

743
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,210
Me, too.

744
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,490
- And me.
- And me.

745
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,620
Then let's start from

746
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,620
where we left off last time.

747
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,420
It was…

748
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,860
Twenty-one.

749
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,530
Yes, question 21.

750
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:53,940
Okay.

751
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,820
The key

752
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,140
to solving this question is

753
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,140
examining the topic.

754
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,820
Look.

755
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,490
The function f(x) is equal to e

756
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,380
to the power of x,

757
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,290
minus one, minus x, minus a

758
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,450
times x squared.

759
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,900
Let's look at the first question.

760
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,140
If a equals zero,

761
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,580
find the monotonic interval of f(x).

762
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,210
What is a monotonic interval?

763
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,050
Yi Tianyu?

764
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,380
Well,

765
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,180
in this question,

766
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,290
x is the open interval

767
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,690
from negative infinity

768
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,100
to zero.

769
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,450
Shiyun!

770
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,340
Shiyun!
