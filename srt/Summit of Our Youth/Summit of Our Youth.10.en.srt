I'll go this way.

69

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,300
take the girls to the hotel.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,090
I'm not going to the hotel,

74
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,900
I'll help search.

172

174
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,060
Are you hurt?

175
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,210

176
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,540
Slipped and fell, but I'm fine.

177
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,210
Did you get hurt?

178
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm fine, really.

179
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,940

in the woods

184
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,020

185
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,810

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,140
you should apologize to Xuejiao.

193
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,730
I don't need to.

194
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,850
You don't have to make excuses for me.

195
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,660
Go ahead and change your clothes first.

196
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,020
I grabbed these from your bag

197
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,940
while you were out searching.

198
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,610
They're clean.

199
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,330
Don't catch a cold.

200
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,850
Your ankle's swollen!

201
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,850
I'm okay.

202
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,090
Sir, here's what you asked for.

203
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,970
You're hopeless with this.

204
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,660
Let me do it.

205
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,850
Xuejiao, talk about bad luck.

206
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,060
You got lost in the rain,

207
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,570
and it stopped the second you got back.

208
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,780
Wasted all Lin's effort
setting up that tent.

209
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,300
Here,

210
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,730
got rooms for you.

211
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,540
Go take a shower.

212
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,660
Thanks, Lin.

213
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,660
Maybe I should

214
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,490
book you a nicer suite.

215
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,810
Wait til you're making your own money.

216
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,800
[Dr. Cai]

217
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,090
Hello, Dr. Cai?

218
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,090
Aren't you also a student too?

219
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,940
Too cold?

220
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,020
No, it's fine.

221
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,090
Shiyun.

222
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,780
Shiyun!

223
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,330
Let's head back.

224
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,730
You told me to leave, remember?

225
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,690
Stop it.

226
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,330
It's dark and the road's slippery.

227
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,420
What if you get hurt?

228
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,730
Stay out of this!

229
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,060
I said leave me alone!

230
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,140
Let go!

231
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,900
You...

232
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,730
Gu Mingze!

233
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,610
Gu Mingze!

234
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,940
Put me down!

235
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,210
Let me go!

236
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,970
Put me down!

237
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,720
[Lin]

238
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,140
Sorry, sir.

239
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,730
If the room is locked from inside,

240
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,140
we can't open it

241
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,330
unless there's a fire.

242
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,140
Well,

243
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,330
just book me another room.

244
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,260
I really need a shower.

245
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,490
I'll need your ID,

246
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,300
please.

247
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,970
My ID

248
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,260
is in that locked room.

249
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,020
Lin!

250
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,540
Lin!

251
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,420
Thanks.

252
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,450
Use Mingze's room,

253
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,060
take a shower

254
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,810
and get some rest.

255
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,780
Thanks.

256
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,420
Here, this is for you.

257
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,660
Huh?

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,210
Just take it.

259
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,900
We found Xuejiao all thanks to you.

260
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,900
You earned it.

261
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,300
I'll grab these

262
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,090
to cheer

263
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,380
Xuejiao up.

264
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,570
Thanks.

265
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,780
Shiyun,

266
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,850
it's getting late.

267
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,690
Wanna

268
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,850
head back?

269
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,380
I'd rather just go home.

270
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,540
Okay, forget it.

271
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,380
I'm with you wherever you want to go.

272
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,490
How about I just take you home?

273
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,570
Home?

274
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,020
No.

275
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,490
I don't wanna go back there.

276
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,780
I'd rather just be

277
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,020
sitting here alone.

278
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,810
You know,

279
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,610
Xuejiao told us

280
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,180
that you didn't mean it.

281
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,540
Shiyun,

282
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,900
everyone screws up

283
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,540
sometimes.

284
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,140
Why not just

285
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,940
apologize to Xuejiao?

286
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,380
She'll forgive you, for sure.

287
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,090
No!

288
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,260
I don't need her

289
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,260
playing the saint.

290
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,810
I don't need it!

291
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,330
I meant what I did!

292
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,330
I saw her heading for trouble

293
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,060
and I let her!

294
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,060
That's me!

295
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,020
But...

296
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,380
But why?

297
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,140
You and Xuejiao

298
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,090
used to be so close.

299
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,730
You two were inseparable,

300
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,260
like you shared everything.

301
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,660
How did things get

302
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,490
this ugly,

303
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,330
all of a sudden?

304
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,140
You want the truth?

305
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,780
I...

306
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,810
I was jealous.

307
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,490
Always have been,

308
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,060
since we were kids.

309
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,420
So jealous

310
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,570
it was eating me up inside.

311
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,180
You?

312
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,810
Jealous of her?

313
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,380
Wait, is it...

314
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,210
because of me?

315
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,610
Is it because of me?

316
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,970
You?

317
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,210
So it is because of me...

318
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,900
No.

319
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,060
Gu Mingze, are you nuts?

320
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,450
Why would this be about you?

321
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,820
Unbelievable.

322
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,480
[Mom]

323
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,320
[Mom]

324
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,050
You're not picking up?

325
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,730
I thought good girls

326
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,420
always answered their moms' calls.

327
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,210
Guess all I am is a good girl.

328
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,050
Hungry?

329
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,580
I'll go find you something to eat.

330
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,860
Come on, you're the hungry one.

331
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,250
Gu Mingze!

332
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,490
Where'd you get that bread?

333
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,180
Leftovers.

334
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:42,970
You...

335
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,140
Hang on a sec.

336
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,140
Wait, what?

337
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,420
Why is it a sad face?

338
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,580
See? Now it looks like a smile.

339
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,250
That's creepy!

340
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,100
No thanks.

341
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,940
That's more like it.

342
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,140
If you don't like someone,

343
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,970
be straight with them.

344
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,770
If you like someone,

345
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,250
own it.

346
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,940
Just be honest like you said.

347
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,860
This is who you are.

348
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,530
If they vibe with you, cool.

349
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,490
If not? Their loss.

350
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,210
Someone

351
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,620
will love the real you eventually.

352
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,820
What's wrong?

353
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,180
Nothing.

354
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,580
I just realized

355
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,340
you're not as clueless

356
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,820
as I thought you were.

357
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,050
Wait,

358
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,050
just how clueless

359
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,100
did you think I was?

360
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,340
Zhou Shiyun,

361
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,290
be honest with me.

362
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,100
Not that much.

363
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,450
Be nice!

364
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,490
Tell me or I'll smear this on your face!

365
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,140
Seriously,

366
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,010
not that clueless!

367
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,380
Just a tiny bit.

368
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,690
A tiny bit?

369
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,450
Not even a tiny bit!

370
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,380
I'm super smart.

371
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,050
Put down the bread first!

372
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,580
Honestly,

373
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,420
I feel like a genius.

374
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,420
No!

375
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,340
Stop!

376
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,490
This is for you

377
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:32,940
anyway!

378
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,450
No!

379
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,970
Thought you

380
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,580
promised me a real treat.

381
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,730
But all we get is instant noodles?

382
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,820
Got a problem with noodles?

383
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,250
It's got everything—broth,

384
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,730
greens, meat, noodles.

385
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,690
Perfectly balanced meal!

386
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,380
Could use

387
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,140
more meat.

388
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,900
So, good or not?

389
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,730
Amazing.

390
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,530
Warming me up from the inside.

391
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,340
I was freezing just now,

392
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,940
and all I craved was this.

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,210
Told you I get you.

394
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,340
Excuse me, are you Ms. Gu Xuejiao?

395
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,290
I am.

396
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,660
Mr. Lin sent these meds for you.

397
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,970
He's tied up,

398
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,380
but asked me to deliver them

399
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,140
as soon as I see you.

400
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,970
Thank you.

401
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,450
You're welcome.

402
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,940
Thanks.

403
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,580
Take a look.

404
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,380
He thought of everything.

405
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,140
Older guys are so thoughtful, huh?

406
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,530
Not only meds,

407
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,860
he even remembered chocolate.

408
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,010
Unlike Tianyu,

409
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,660
his ice pack felt like
a weapon ready to kill.

410
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,820
You know,

411
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,660
Lin literally carried you back today.

412
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,340
Were you nervous?

413
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,690
Why would I be nervous?

414
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,140
No big deal at all.

415
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,050
Nothing to be nervous about.

416
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,140
Come on,

417
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,100
be honest okay?

418
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,770
Check your phone.

419
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,010
You got a ton of texts.

420
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,250
Is something up?

421
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,100
[Class 8 Group Chat]
Qi Lei just said in the group chat

422
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,970
[Qi Lei: My school just ]
that his school just

423
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,250
[dropped cutoff scores!!]
dropped cutoff scores!

424
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,690
What about Capital University?

425
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,530
Let me check.

426
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,860
Capital...

427
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,050
Nah.

428
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,660
Ugh, why can't they

429
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,100
release their scores all at once?

430
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,490
This waiting game

431
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,900
is torture.

432
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,860
Right,

433
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,620
my throat's

434
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,250
parched

435
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,450
from stress.

436
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,530
Tiantian,

437
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,100
I could use an ice-cold Coke.

438
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,100
Let's go grab one.

439
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,050
Coke

440
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,450
can wait.

441
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,380
I've got something urgent to deal with.

442
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,050
Gotta run to my room.

443
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,450
So,

444
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,210
replacement keys for Mingze

445
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,210
and Shiyun,

446
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,770
make sure they get these.

447
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,210
Yours and mine.

448
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,340
I'm heading up.

449
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,770
Okay.

450
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,180
Hey, Mom.

451
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,250
Xuejiao,

452
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,820
Capital University just dropped

453
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,620
their cutoff scores!

454
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,530
Sun Tiantian,

455
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,340
with a giant stash

456
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,580
of snacks

457
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,340
and you fed just me instant noodles?

458
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,450
Oh, showering?

459
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm still starving.

460
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,490
How's the shower?

461
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,820
Mind if I come in to wash my hands?

462
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,340
Gotta raid your snack stash.

463
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,420
You locked the door?

464
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,140
That hurts.

465
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,660
I'm so happy right now.

466
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,180
I can't hold it in!

467
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,420
Let me just say this—

468
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,290
I was going to

469
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,860
tell Lin first.

470
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,620
I finally did it!

471
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,660
I got into Capital University!

472
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,580
Screw everything else right now,

473
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,940
I just want an ice-cold Coke.

474
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,250
Hurry up and finish your shower

475
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,180
so we can go get one together.

476
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,450
Actually, never mind,

477
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,180
I'll call Lin real quick

478
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,620
and share the good news with him.

479
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,690
Sorry,

480
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,580
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

481
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,450
Sorry,

482
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,660
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

483
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,770
Busy, I guess.

484
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,450
Tiantian,

485
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,730
earlier you asked

486
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,690
if I

487
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,100
get nervous, right?

488
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,860
Truth is,

489
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,900
the moment I saw him

490
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,250
in the woods earlier,

491
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,450
I really hoped I'd

492
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,380
keep seeing him in college.

493
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,380
Tiantian?

494
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,580
Why so quiet?

495
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,730
Tiantian?

496
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,860
You okay in there?

497
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,050
Tiantian?

498
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,970
Did you pass out?

499
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,580
Say something

500
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,660
or I'm breaking in!

501
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,660
Tiantian!

502
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,210
Why are you here?

503
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,580
This is Gu Mingze's room.

504
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,940
You

505
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,730
got lost, right?

506
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,490
Well, enjoy your shower. Bye.

507
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,450
Tiantian.

508
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,140
How was I supposed to know

509
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,250
Lin was showering?

510
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,940
Relax, don't worry.

511
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,690
My fault, I bolted too fast

512
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,620
and messed up the keys.

513
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,250
You were the first person

514
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,210
I wanted to share

515
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,250
my good news with,

516
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,490
and you set me up like this?

517
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,940
So, how was the view?

518
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,490
This is Gu Mingze's room.

519
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,100
You

520
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,620
His...

521
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,940
got lost, right?

522
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,490
I didn't see anything!

523
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,420
Come on, you totally did.

524
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,050
No, I really didn't.

525
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,730
You definitely did!

526
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,450
That's

527
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,340
your guilty face!

528
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,140
I can always tell

529
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,970
when you lie.

530
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,970
I swear, I didn't see a thing.

531
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,580
Come on, tell me!

532
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,340
Eight-pack abs?

533
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,140
Six-pack? Right?

534
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,180
Six or eight, did you count?

535
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,940
Did you?

536
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,100
-Just one! -Did you count?

537
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,730
No way...

538
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,490
I really didn't see!

539
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,580
You totally did!

540
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,660
Xuejiao,

541
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,530
first, my apologies

542
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,620
for today's chaos.

543
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,860
But weirdly, that made me

544
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,940
the first person

545
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,690
you shared your good news

546
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,730
about getting into

547
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,580
Capital University.

548
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,290
Dr. Cai, take a look.

549
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,490
Least I can do

550
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,660
is get you

551
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,620
this Coke.

552
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,900
And lastly,

553
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,050
I wish you all the best

554
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,340
at Capital University.

555
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,450
Lin Zhihua.

556
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,380
Why couldn't you
get into Capital University

557
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,860
like Gu Xuejiao?

558
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,250
You're such a disappointment.

559
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,450
All three years of high school,

560
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,180
think about how much

561
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,250
time and money

562
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,050
I spent on you, Shiyun.

563
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,180
Go ahead, do the math for me.

564
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,970
Is this how you thank me?

565
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,470
[Mom]

566
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,100
My daughter

567
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,770
lost to Li Sitong's!

568
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,820
You know how humiliating that is?

569
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,380
How am I supposed to

570
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,340
hold my head up in front of others?

571
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,690
What good are you anyway?

572
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,490
You're nothing

573
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,530
but an embarrassment!

574
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,620
Say something.

575
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,010
What, now?

576
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,580
You can't even

577
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,620
make a sound?

578
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,100
All you care about now

579
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,690
is your pride?

580
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,420
She's your daughter,

581
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:23,970
not some

582
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,970
trophy to show off!

583
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,010
What's wrong with you?

584
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,450
What's wrong with you?

585
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,450
Who do you think you are?

586
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,010
Who are you to judge me?

587
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,580
Put Zhou Shiyun on!

588
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,290
I'm just...

589
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,860
someone who can't stand this crap.

590
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,770
Where is she?

591
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,600
[Mom]

592
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,970
Shiyun.

593
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,380
So your mom

594
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,050
has always treated you like this?

595
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,940
After that day,

596
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,140
none of us

597
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,290
saw Zhou Shiyun again.

598
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,450
Word is, she didn't get into
the Veritas University—

599
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,770
too many applied.

600
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,970
Nobody knew where she ended up.

601
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,490
For Auntie Wanjun,

602
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,580
this must be

603
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,530
the ultimate shame.

604
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,490
Yi Tianyu

605
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,340
got into UFE

606
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,860
thanks to his athletic skills.

607
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,340
Sun Tiantian

608
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,900
didn't bother repeating a year

609
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,050
and started working
as a pastry apprentice

610
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,690
with her parents' support.

611
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,860
Gu Mingze,

612
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,770
unsurprisingly, also didn't get in.

613
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,140
But over the summer,

614
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,180
he gathered a team

615
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,450
of like-minded people

616
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,010
to create

617
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,900
an AAA game,

618
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,450
going totally

619
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,340
off-script.

620
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,450
Qi Lei

621
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,660
headed off happily

622
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,250
to a technical college out of town.

623
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,180
And me,

624
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,010
Gu Xuejiao,

625
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm going to Capital University!

626
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,940
Two.

627
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,380
One.

628
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,690
Two.

629
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,050
Halt.

630
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,180
Everyone.

631
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,490
Eyes left!

632
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,490
Pick up those feet! Move it!

633
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,900
What are you doing?

634
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,530
Sorry.

635
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,250
Couldn't brake!

636
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,620
Blind

637
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,530
or just uncoordinated?

638
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,290
You still

639
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,900
got energy to yap?

640
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,290
Chatty Cathys,

641
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,620
step forward!

642
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,770
Don't make me

643
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,970
ask twice.

644
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,490
Otherwise, everyone here

645
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,340
will be doing extra drills with you.

646
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,180
Alright.

647
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,450
You four,

648
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,490
stand at attention.

649
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,450
So loyal!

650
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,940
The rest of you,

651
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,580
dismissed!

652
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,180
Worst luck ever.

653
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,660
Day one and we're already

654
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,940
doing double extra drills.

655
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,010
Thanks to you.

656
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,820
That's your own fault.

657
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,380
What?

658
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,580
You wanna keep going?

659
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,660
Attention!

660
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,690
See you.

661
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,620
Bye.

662
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,450
It's boiling out there.

663
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,730
Finally made it back.

664
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,340
Does this count

665
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,420
as our first

666
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,250
roommate dinner?

667
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,660
Of course not.

668
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,690
Once training's over,

669
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,820
we're going out for a proper meal.

670
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,530
I'm in.

671
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,770
You're on diet or what?

672
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,970
You're gonna crash!

673
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,340
Here,

674
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,340
have a drumstick.

675
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,900
I'm good.

676
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,970
Thanks.

677
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,250
What is that?

678
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,450
Extra stinky luosifen!

679
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,690
Shu Lan,

680
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,730
I'm so sorry.

681
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,770
Stay away from me.

682
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,860
New rule: no more smelly food

683
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,860
in the dorm.

684
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,050
The AC's on,

685
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,210
why are you opening the window?

686
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,940
Come on!

687
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,970
It's so freaking hot.

688
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,380
Please don't turn off the AC.

689
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,450
I get cold easily, okay?

690
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,940
It's 36 degrees out today.

691
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,420
Are you sure you're cold?

692
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,180
AC's bad for you.

693
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,180
You'll get

694
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,530
chilled to the bone.

695
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,970
Ever heard of that?

696
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,340
Whatever.

697
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,770
I'm fine.

698
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,620
This dorm feels like

699
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,820
a giant steamer, right?

700
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,620
We're just buns waiting to be cooked.

701
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,730
You'll stop being cold

702
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,340
when we're medium-rare.

703
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,420
Today,

704
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,290
I'm just gonna

705
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,530
skip the common sense for once.

706
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,820
You guys don't believe me, huh?

707
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,730
Fine, let's see some numbers.

708
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,660
Check out these stats,

709
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,120
[Air Conditioner Use by Major Cities]

710
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,530
cities with AC have

711
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,970
way more people with cold symptoms.

712
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,380
Case closed.

713
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,940
Numbers don't lie.

714
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,100
So I'm telling you,

715
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,380
no AC today.

716
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,580
Save yourself the embarrassment.

717
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,290
I won first in the math olympiad,

718
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,140
scored perfect on
all my major math exams,

719
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,100
even five of you combined

720
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,900
couldn't out-calculate me.

721
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,530
Just like you said,

722
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,970
numbers

723
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,050
don't lie.

724
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,100
In every city,

725
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,730
the figure on the left is lower
than the one on the right,

726
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,100
but when you look at the overall total,

727
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,010
the left is actually higher.

728
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,530
Which means

729
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,090
your whole

730
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,050
"AC makes you cold" theory

731
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,090
is totally wrong.

732
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,860
Yeah, Shu Lan,

733
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,860
what if we just messed up the math?

734
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,700
You're the math whiz,

735
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,900
why don't you check?

736
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,340
And besides,

737
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,050
the sample sizes

738
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,780
are all over the place.

739
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,860
No clue if they

740
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,610
controlled for anything.

741
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,170
This data's basically useless.

742
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,010
Shu Lan,

743
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,650
math whiz or not,

744
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,380
you can't just treat us

745
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,820
like we're clueless.

746
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,380
I mean,

747
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,380
we all got into Capital University,

748
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,130
clearly we're not bad at math.

749
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,740
Whatever.

750
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,420
Run the AC if you want.

751
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,860
Don't blame me

752
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,490
if you get sick.

753
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,260
Won't happen.

754
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,090
Thanks for the warning.

755
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,650
How about

756
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,170
we crack the window

757
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,530
for some fresh air?

758
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,050
It'll help the air

759
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,940
circulate—

760
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,900
won't feel so stuffy.

761
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,740
Works for me.

762
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,570
No problem.

763
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,610
Whatever.

764
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,340
Guess the internet wasn't kidding.

765
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,090
Dorm drama in university

766
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,260
is totally normal.

767
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,380
Guess that was

768
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,170
our very first battle.

769
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,340
We made a pretty good team just now.

770
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,420
Fist bump.

771
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,130
You know,

772
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,220
your name sounded so familiar.

773
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,420
Wait, aren't you

774

Zhao Feifei,

that genius girl from No.7 High

776
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,010
who skipped grades
and aced the college entrance exam?

777
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,260
How'd you know?

778
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,050
We went to the same school.

779
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,900
I'm the one who

780
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,420
stood up in front of the whole school

781
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,940
and swore I'd get into Capital U.

782
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,970
I know who you are.

783
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,940
Gu Xuejiao,

784
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,610
the ultimate rebel queen,

785
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,130
somehow top of both

786
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,610
the honor roll and the detention list!

787
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:08,780
Wow,

788
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,170
am I really

789
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,420
that infamous?

790
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,300
Guess word gets around.

791
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,970
Half that's exaggerated.

792
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,300
After seeing how you handled Shu Lan?

793
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,450
I kinda buy it.

794
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,940
Looking forward to working with you!

795
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,860
And if you find good food
or fun stuff,

796
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,420

797
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:21,940

798
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,900
I'm so wiped out.

799
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,300
Barely awake,

800
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,530
and we're getting more drills?

801
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,570
It's only day one,

802
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,740
how are we going to survive the rest?

803
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,380
Just keep calm and carry on!

804
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,970
Calm how?

805
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,740
Sir, that's her.

806
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,220
We were just wondering

807
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,220
where you'd gone.

808
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,260
I went to talk to the instructor

809
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,090
so he could sort things out.

964
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,900
dessert counter,

965
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,220
figured I'd show off

966
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,090
and make

967
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,820
the whole menu.

968
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,900
I heard

969
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,130
one of the security guards here

970
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,780
got into college.

971
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,170
Sun Tiantian,

972
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,570
you're not planning
on pulling the same move, are you?

973
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,300
Not that wishy-washy.

974
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,650
I've always wanted

975
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,650
to be a pastry chef.

976
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,860
That's great,

977
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,570
a girl with ambition!

978
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,610
How about you? Any goals?

979
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,420
Come on,

980
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,970
Xuejiao swore back in senior year

981
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,130
she'd get into Capital University.

982
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,610
Now she's living her dream.

983
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,340
Isn't that right?

984
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,860
Keep it low‑key!

985
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,940
No, brag about it!

986
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,220
When I told my parents

987
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,860
I was going to apprentice
at Capital University,

988
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,420
they said yes without hesitation.

989
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,740
"Capital University", those two words

990
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,900
carry a ton of weight

991
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,090
all across China.

992
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,570
Just flash your student ID,

993
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,860
and people treat you with respect.

994
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,900
For real?

995
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,130
Then before

996
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,610
classes start,

997
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,090
I'm totally taking my student ID

998
00:42:59,110 --> 00:42:59,970
out for a spin.

999
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,260
Just the thought makes me happy.

1000
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,740
Be even better with a boyfriend

1001
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,420
to carry your shopping bags!

1002
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,530
That...

1003
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,260
Word of warning,

1004
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,970
for first-year girls,

1005
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,490
the top three dangers are:

1006
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,010
fire, theft, and boys.

1007
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,530
Date someone you really know,

1008
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,900
like...

1009
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,490
