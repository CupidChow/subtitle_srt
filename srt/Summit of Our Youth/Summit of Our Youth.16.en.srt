We totally

94
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,300
clicked right away, Ms. Zheng.

95
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,570
If we finish this,

96
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,940
we're sworn siblings.

Let's go…

98
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:02,970
Seriously.

99
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,780
Ms. Zheng.

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,370
Let's go.

101
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,130
Let's get hammered!

102
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,900
I've paid the bill.

103
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,570
Why'd you stop drinking?

104
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,570
No one's leaving.

105
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,530
Don't stop.

106
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,460
The bill's paid.

107
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,410
Don't you stop!

108
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,410
Let's get wasted…

109
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,570
Your role model?

110
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,130
You're pretty good
at the drinking games.

111
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,810
Of course, she's my role model.

112
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,250
Leaning right on

113
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,420
this cutie's shoulder.

114
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,940
I wanna lean, too.

115
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,100
You're drunk. Sit still.

116
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,690
I already took the first hit for you.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,660
How's Mr. Lin gonna repay me?

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,370
Repay you?

119
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,010
Guess you're not that drunk.

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,060
Are you such a good drinker?

121
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,660
Of course.

122
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,740
Back then, I…

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,130
What?

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,450
Got a wine glass
at your fortune-telling grab,

125
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,100
huh?

126
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,500
That's right.

127
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,770
My dad used to dip chopsticks

128
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,180
in booze and gave me a taste.

129
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,180
So growing up,

130
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,330
I never feared a drunk.

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,330
I could drink

132
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,980
with the best of them.

133
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,500
Yeah, right.

134
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,540
Who was the one I carried home

135
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,010
from karaoke last time?

136
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,060
That was different.

137
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,450
Different how?

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,210
At karaoke,

139
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,770
I wasn't drunk on booze.

140
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,540
I was drunk on

141
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,660
Mr. Lin's handsome face.

142
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,860
And ever since that night,

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,060
I carry hangover pills everywhere.

144
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,770
Gotta be prepared.

145
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,210
In case…

146
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,770
In case you lose control again.

147
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,060
Dizzy.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,860
Let me fix that for you.

149
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,660
No, let me fix it for you.

150
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,740
Didn't you

151
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,890
just visit here last week?

152
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,130
Why again?

153
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,060
You don't get it.

154
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,420
I came back to recharge my energy.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,740
You have no idea

156
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,250
how stressful

157
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,810

158
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,500
Why do you reek of alcohol?

159
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,370
Had a work dinner last night.

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,540
Still dizzy now.

161
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,770
You still gotta network

162
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,770
even working

163
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,690
in your fancy lab?

164
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,540
And today you're networking again?

165
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,450
I saw you ordered a cake,

166
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,660
making a pretty big deal of it.

167
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,010
This isn't networking today.

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,860
Today's…

169
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,660
I got it!

170
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,250
A job interview, right?

171
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,570
Xuejiao,

172
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,740
you're always one step ahead.

173
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,300
Starting interviews in junior year?

174
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,660
To bribe the interviewer,

175
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,940
you gotta make

176
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,940
a killer first impression.

177
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,810
Wait.

178
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,540
Let me, the founder,

179
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,370
bake the prettiest cake

180
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,940
for my biggest

181
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,860
idea investor.

182
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,810
Hang on.

183
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,730
Look at this cake.

184
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,660
The cream, the colors.

185
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,730
I had it custom-made

186
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,090
to celebrate your contract-signing.

187
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,140
What a pretty cake.

188
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,730
Is it for me

189
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,020
or for you?

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,850
Both.

191
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,730
Actually, Tiantian insisted
on giving it to me.

192
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,900
But since you didn't look too excited

193
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,970
about signing the contract,

194
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,540
I thought I'd give it to you

195
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,260
to cheer you up.

196
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,970
Thank you.

197
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,210
It's just not the final victory

198
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,540
for me yet.

199
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,060
But that's fine.

200
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,300
We can celebrate early.

201
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,810
What's wrong?

202
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,330
You look weighed down.

203
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,610
Don't worry.

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,450
It'll work out.

205
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,690
Thank you.

206
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,180
Surprise!

207
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,810
Xuejiao?

208
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,850
How did you…?

209
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,610
I…

210
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,850
Xuejiao, you're just in time.

211
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,140
You even brought a cake.

212
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,420
Let's celebrate the signing

213
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,690
together tonight.

214
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,090
Great!

215
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,380
Drink more water.

216
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,020
Alright, I'm leaving.

217
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,180
Petal,

218
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,970
take her back

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,300
to campus safe and sound.

220
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,690
Don't worry.

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,690
I'll go with you.

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,540
Actually, I might get another ride.

223
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,610
I'm not busy

224
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,180
these days.

225
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,020
I wanna go home for a bit.

226
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,090
Lin,

227
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,020
you go back to school

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,780
with Gao.

229
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,420
I just remembered

230
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,060
I need to stop by the office.

231
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,540
It's on the way to your school.

232
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,180
How about

233
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,140
I give you a ride?

234
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,090
Me?

235
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,940
Is that okay?

236
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,850
Why wouldn't it be?

237
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,570
Get in.

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,970
She's all yours.

239
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,330
You didn't notice?

240
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,780
Notice what?

241
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,940
Those two…

242
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,210
If I hadn't pretended to be drunk,

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,420
they'd have found another way

244
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,210
to send you off.

245
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,450
I might as well help them out.

246
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,180
With my usual tolerance,

247
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,810
you three would be down,

248
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,450
and I'd still be sober enough

249
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,540
to get you home safe.

250
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,780
Love between two young people

251
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,810
is…

252
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,380
so tangled,

253
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,810
yet so sweet.

254
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,970
Such secret ops

255
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,810
are exhausting.

256
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,450
Almost got caught by your sister

257
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,300
and Gao Rui today.

258
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,490
What are you scared of?

259
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,970
You can talk your way

260
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,730
out of anything.

261
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,540
Easy for you to say.

262
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,180
You swore no one was home.

263
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,490
I didn't know
Gao Rui's 'something to do'

264
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,060
was giving me a surprise?

265
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,660
That wasn't a surprise.

266
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,020
It was a scare.

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,540
My heart almost jumped out.

268
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,140
I thought it was racing

269
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,090
because of me.

270
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,180
That's not wrong, though.

271
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,450
Just a shame that

272
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,450
the vibe got killed.

273
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,810
So… How you gonna

274
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,140
make it up to me?

275
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,900
Young people these days…

276
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,690
Seriously.

277
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,450
If it were my Xuejiao,

278
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,900
I'd break her legs.

279
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,330
Youth. So good.

280
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,660
So good.

281
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,060
Why are all our dates

282
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,300
a total mess?

283
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,780
Still feel messy now?

284
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,780
What's that smell?

285
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,060
What smell?

286
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,970
Whipped cream.

287
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,060
Here, have some water.

288
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,570
Thanks, Uncle.

289
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,330
Don't mention it.

290
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,810
Drink up.

291
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,940
Got more in the car.

292
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,570
Man…

293
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,540
Look at me.

294
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,540
I used to work

295
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,260
nonstop every day.

296
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,660
Now

297
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,940
I sit at home

298
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,690
bored outta my mind.

299
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,300
Heh.

300
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,330
So I just drive around for fun.

301
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,610
Chat with passengers

302
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,540
from everywhere.

303
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,810
Makes me happy.

304
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,490
But I did not expect

305
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,490
to run into you today.

306
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,690
What a coincidence.

307
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,780
Such a coincidence.

308
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,900
Xuejiao talks about you all the time.

309
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,810
Says you're amazing.

310
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,850
Today I was just thinking

311
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,260
I should stay in front of my house.

312
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,970
At this hour,

313
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,610
this late,

314
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,970
nobody's gonna call a ride.

315
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,300
And then you showed up.

316
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,730
The house? The new one?

317
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,090
Yeah…

318
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,140
You haven't been there, right?

319
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,730
Guess Xuejiao

320
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,780
didn't tell you.

321
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,060
Come and visit when you have time.

322
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,970
Been busy lately?

323
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,330
Yeah… Just worked till this hour.

324
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,610
Really?

325
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,260
Gentle…

326
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,380
Let's start, sir.

327
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,810
Wait, I'll get some water.

328
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,900
Get up!

329
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,570
That's your sister's masseur.

330
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,850
Mom.

331
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,380
Seriously?

332
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,260
Gu Xuejiao isn't here yet.

333
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,380
She'll be here soon.

334
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,730
She's at home now,

335
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,610
having a Zoom meeting

336
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,570
with the lab.

337
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,810
Let her relax

338
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,090
when she gets here.

339
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,940
She deserves it.

340
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,570
Besides,

341
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,810
you're a designer.

342
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,780
You don't need foot massages.

343
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,450
Hello,

344
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,970
give him a massage ball.

345
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,970
Let him roll it in his hand.

346
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,260
There are four of us

347
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,140
and only three massage therapists.

348
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,090
So no one thought of me.

349
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,090
Look at you…

350
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,780
Son, don't even bring up

351
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,330
such problems.

352
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,780
It's pointless.

353
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,850
You have no idea.

354
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,570
Guess who I just picked up.

355
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,850
Celebrity?

356
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,900
An internet fugitive?

357
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,210
- Don't wanna tell us?
- Whatever.

358
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,450
Wait, I'll tell you.

359
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,330
Seriously,

360
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,330
I didn't expect it.

361
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,210
I actually picked up Lin.

362
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,490
Several years ago,

363
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,540
he tutored Xuejiao for a while.

364
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,260
I picked him up

365
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,810
near our place.

366
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,330
I knew I have seen

367
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,180
that guy somewhere.

368
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,300
Lin shows up

369
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,090
near our house

370
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,970
more often than you think.

371
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,380
Are they…?

372
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,780
It's exactly

373
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,690
what you think.

374
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,380
When's Xuejiao coming?

375
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,690
What…

376
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,090
I'm gonna

377
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,730
ask her about that later.

378
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,180
Phone.

379
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,060
She says she's not coming.

380
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,050
Why's she so willful?

381
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,340
We had plans.

382
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,660
Lin's so excellent.

383
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,580
How does he

384
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,490
even put up with her?

385
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,380
Shame.

386
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,770
Such a shame.

387
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,900
This kid…

388
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,210
Xuejiao's amazing, too.

389
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,730
Here.

390
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
Shut your mouth!

391
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,620
Lin,

392
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,660
the next deal will be done

393
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,140
later.

394
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,860
You wanna go

395
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,620
celebrate tonight?

396
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,250
Call your sister, too.

397
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,450
It's probably not that easy.

398
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,730
It's a done deal.

399
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,730
What's there to worry about?

400
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,620
So

401
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,690
that's the situation.

402
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,820
C1 didn't pass

403
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,940
our tech department's inspection.

404
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,860
I'm really sorry about that.

405
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,530
Can we see

406
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,450
the acceptance report?

407
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,900
I guess Ms. Zheng will say

408
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,450
it's internal.

409
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,290
She doesn't have the authority.

410
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,730
Ms. Zheng,

411
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,010
C1 is a sophisticated technology

412
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,010
that's been approved

413
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,380
many times by our lab.

414
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,490
We already gave

415
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,100
full solutions

416
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,690
to the technical issues

417
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,970
you raised last time.

418
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,010
Using acceptance failure

419
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,140
as an excuse is ridiculous.

420
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,940
Excuse?

421
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,490
Lin…

422
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,860
Ms. Zheng.

423
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,290
How about this?

424
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,940
Could you arrange a meeting

425
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,180
with the technical engineers?

426
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,210
We can discuss this in person.

427
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,340
Even if there's

428
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,290
disagreement,

429
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,940
it's probably

430
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,380
a misunderstanding.

431
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,210
We'll work on it.

432
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,900
I've done my best

433
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,770
to fight for you.

434
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,580
But this is the result.

435
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,180
I have to consider

436
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,860
the group's interests.

437
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,340
With a decision like that?

438
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,970
Yeah, Ms. Zheng.

439
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,180
You can't give up

440
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,450
on such a promising project.

441
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,450
I never said I'd give up.

442
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,050
C1 is indeed

443
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,290
a promising project.

444
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,690
No doubt about that.

445
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,490
But the problem is,

446
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,100
you breached the contract first.

447
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,100
You didn't pass

448
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,690
the technical acceptance as agreed.

449
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,690
So, B&C Motors

450
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,210
will take over all of

451
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,660
your team's patents and technology.

452
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,140
We'll continue the project

453
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,100
with our internal R&D team.

454
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,340
What did you say?

455
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,180
I think

456
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,820
I've made it clear.

457
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,290
You can't just claim it

458
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,050
and make the decision for us.

459
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,860
You can't take away

460
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,490
the patents and tech

461
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,860
that we worked hard on.

462
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,380
You can keep them

463
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,970
if you want.

464
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,050
It's the notice of contract violation.

465
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,140
See if you can

466
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,250
accept the amount.

467
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,900
Let's go.

468
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,690
The discussion's over.

469
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,620
Wait.

470
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,970
How can we just leave?

471
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,490
Who hasn't been

472
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,180
beaten down by life
when they were young?

473
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,530
Get used to it.

474
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:43,940
Young man.

475
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,180
Let's go, Gao Rui.

476
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,860
They just wanna
get something for nothing.

477
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,820
B&C Motors was aiming

478
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,340
for our tech patents

479
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,250
from the start.

480
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,860
My boyfriend's

481
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,820
at the International Law School.

482
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,490
I'll ask him

483
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,420
if there's any way

484
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,050
to deal with her.

485
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,900
Where's Lin?

486
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,940
You can't find Lin?

487
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,380
None of us can

488
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,180
reach him.

489
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,450
Especially Lin Jiadong.

490
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,140
He has called over ten times in a row.

491
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,860
And now his precious senior

492
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,250
has turned off the phone.

493
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,730
Where's my phone?

494
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,980
[How was your trip to B&C?]

495
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,880
[You didn't text me back.]

496
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,870
[Did you turn in your phone?

497
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,720
[You're not in the lab?]

498
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,620
A man hit hard in his career

499
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,690
is the most fragile.

500
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,290
Everyone's trying to

501
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,530
comfort him now.

502
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,210
No way.

503
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,970
He must be working on

504
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,580
a solution.

505
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,380
You know him well.

506
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,450
I…

507
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,660
I've been in the lab

508
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,860
for years before you.

509
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,010
You know.

510
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,580
So what can he do?

511
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,050
He…

512
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,820
He…

513
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,340
Honestly, I don't know.

514
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,360
[You might've known it. Need some peace.
Location: Café bookstore]

515
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,970
Every time I see

516
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,210
coffee foam poured in,

517
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,180
I think of Olympic

518
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,970
diving.

519
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,770
Angle, precision, and strength.

520
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,820
All are keys.

521
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,340
Only then can a simple sport

522
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,660
become an art.

523
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,690
Impressive.

524
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,380
So what's your plan

525
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,010
now?

526
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,380
How do we artistically fight back

527
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,210
against B&C?

528
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,820
No plan.

529
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,860
One step at a time.

530
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,770
Yeah.

531
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,900
So, what's your

532
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,010
next step?

533
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,380
Isn't going back to the bookstore

534
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,180
part of your plan?

535
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,900
It's just because

536
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,820
they're short-handed today.

537
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,580
You really have no plan?

538
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,380
People in the lab

539
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,490
are checking the faults

540
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,970
and reaching out to law students for you.

541
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,530
And you're here acting cool.

542
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,690
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

543
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,730
One latte.

544
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:27,970
Okay.

545
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,180
I'm busy, too.

546
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,010
C1 is

547
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,140
your years of hard work.

548
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,620
Failing this acceptance test

549
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,530
could waste

550
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,250
all your effort.

551
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,210
And worst of all,

552
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,970
the morale is low.

553
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,250
The whole team could fall apart.

554
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,660
We were all stressed out

555
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,530
during R&D.

556
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,140
Now's a good time

557
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,010
to rest up,

558
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,490
including you.

559
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,210
I don't want to rest.

560
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,050
This is not the time to kick back.

561
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,660
You…

562
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,770
Get back to the lab,

563
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,250
okay?

564
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,100
I'll cover here.

565
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,530
Back to the lab.

566
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,140
Give me your apron.

567
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,860
Too many customers.

568
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,380
Can't leave.

569
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,420
Hi, Shu Lan?

570
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,840
[Data Center]

571
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,050
Xuejiao,

572
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,770
this is Lawyer Zhang.

573
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,050
Also an alumnus of Capital University.

574
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,340
My boyfriend says

575
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,580
he's got a ton of experience

576
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,340
with cases like this.

577
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,420
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhang.

578
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,010
Nice to meet you, too.

579
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,290
I already

580
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,140
filled him in

581
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,690
on the basics.

582
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,770
You talk about the rest.

583
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,900
Mr. Zhang, have a seat.

584
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,820
So, based on the current situation,

585
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,490
do we stand

586
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,380
a good chance?

587
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,970
Sounds like

588
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,580
B&C's bet-on agreement

589
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,010
has some nasty clauses.

590
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,970
If we push from that angle,

591
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,010
we might have a shot.

592
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,420
Great.

593
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,210
But their legal team

594
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,180
is pretty tough.

595
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,050
It could get messy.

596
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,420
And going to court

597
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,730
won't be cheap.

598
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,290
I understand.

599
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,010
May I ask,

600
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,970
how do you charge?

601
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,050
For corporate

602
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,180
commercial disputes,

603
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,140
we usually charge

604
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,250
a percentage

605
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,140
of the claim amount.

606
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,820
Since my junior referred you,

607
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,140
I'll cut you a little slack.

608
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,770
But probably

609
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,420
not under five percent.

610
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,900
Five percent…

611
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,820
That's fine.

612
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,010
You can think it over.

613
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,290
Wait a sec.

614
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,940
Tiantian.

615
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,490
Your idea investor

616
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,380
needs cash now.

617
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,380
No problem.

618
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,730
We're taking this to court.

619
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,770
Last time,

620
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,620
Ms. Zheng from B&C

621
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,140
took C1 from me.

622
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,970
This time,

623
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm fighting back.

624
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,380
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

625
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,250
Thank you for waiting.

626
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,180
No worries.

627
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,420
I just invested

628
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,620
in a new mobile game.

629
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,580
It's pretty fun.

630
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,900
Level 88 in one swing.

631
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,970
If you're my bro, come slash me.

632
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,210
Kinda entertaining.

633
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,730
Is it?

634
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,050
Interesting.

635
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,940
Lin,

636
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,900
I heard your C1 project

637
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,180
with B&C hasn't been going too smoothly.

638
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,620
Mr. Zhao, do you remember

639
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,660
B&C's very first locally-developed model

640
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,210
when they

641
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,340
made a high-profile entry

642
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,620
into the Chinese market

643
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,730
20 years ago?

644
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,490
It's been too long.

645
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,770
Can't really recall. Sorry.

646
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,100
I do.

647
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,250
I remember it

648
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,210
because it was developed

649
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,770
by one of

650
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,970
our Capital University alumni

651
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,860
leading an on-campus

652
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,660
R&D team.

653
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,860
You checked my background?

654
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,860
I only just found out.

655
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,940
Turns out you're

656
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,900
a cautionary tale for my cooperation

657
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,940
with B&C.

658
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,420
Senior Zhao.

659
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,970
Lin,

660
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,490
I told you,

661
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,690
if it's not about making money,

662
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,420
I'm not interested.

663
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,860
So let's

664
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,620
call it a day.

665
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,380
Mr. Zhao,

666
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,580
that model you built

667
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,770
got its funding cut

668
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,770
before delivery.

669
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,730
Do you still have dreams?

670
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,940
At this age,

671
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,860
isn't it kinda corny to have dreams?

672
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,490
But you keep going to

673
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,100
automotive industry
investment conferences.

674
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,900
It's pretty obvious.

675
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,180
Otherwise, we wouldn't have met.

676
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,010
I was the first one

677
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,900
to show interest in your C1 project.

678
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,690
But you?

679
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,490
You turned

680
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,860
your back

681
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,100
on my Junlian Company

682
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,010
and shook hands with B&C.

683
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,340
It's hard to explain my beef

684
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,380
with B&C for now.

685
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,730
But C1's failing delivery

686
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,210
was part of my plan all along.

687
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,450
What are you doing?

688
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,010
Who told you

689
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,210
to move our lab's equipment?

690
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,660
Hey, I'm talking to you!

691
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,900
Did you hear me?

692
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,450
Dude,

693
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,250
what are you talking about?

694
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:27,970
Since when

695
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,450
are they yours?

696
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,730
They belong to

697
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,690
B&C Motors now.

698
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,690
We can sponsor you.

699
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,210
And we can take it back, too.

700
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,210
Right?

701
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,050
Even if B&C Motors sponsored it,

702
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,690
we're just fulfilling

703
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,940
the terms of our contract.

704
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,770
Can you at least

705
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,900
honor the contract?

706
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,420
You can't just take it back
whenever you want.

707
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,940
That contract is off now.

708
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,050
Ms. Zheng only recognizes

709
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,010
the notice of contract violation.

710
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,900
Okay. Enough talk.

711
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,820
Sign it.

712
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,820
Hurry.

713
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,580
They…

714
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,970
they basically moved everything.

715
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,920
Jinghai University-Huachuang Project Team

716
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,620
What's your plan against B&C?

717
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,420
I want them gone

718
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,050
from China for good.

719
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,210
You?

720
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,900
What a surprise.

721
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,380
College kids today are crazier

722
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,010
than we used to be.

723
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,530
Lin,

724
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,770
working with B&C Motors

725
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,820
isn't some kid's play.

726
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,340
This is against investor ethics,

727
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,490
but I gotta remind you.

728
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,140
No tech team

729
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,490
working with B&C Motors

730
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,770
ever ends well.

731
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,660
So I'm here today

732
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,340
to ask for

733
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,340
your original contract

734
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,380
and the termination agreement.

735
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,770
On my way home.

736
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,010
Stop making coffee

737
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,580
and just gonna stay in, huh?

738
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,900
Lin Zhihua,

739
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,530
wait till I come over and get you.

740
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,280
[At the Summit. Today's Reading]

741
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,940
Do you know how long

742
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,770
we waited for you today?

743
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,770
Even the lab gear

744
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,860
got taken by B&C Motors.

745
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,530
Sit down first. Don't be mad.

746
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,250
I know.

747
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,580
I'm just trying

748
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,900
to chill a bit.

749
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,580
Mr. Zhao told me about this game.

750
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,380
It's fun.

751
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,620
Very addictive. Look.

752
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,730
Are you seriously

753
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,940
playing games at a time like this?

754
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,210
I asked you to meet with the lawyer.

755
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,050
Why didn't you come?

756
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,660
I was gaming.

757
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,940
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

758
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,580
Come with me to see the lawyer.

759
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,010
I already paid the fees.

760
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,050
If you don't,

761
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,050
you're gonna get it.

762
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,210
Get what?

763
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,970
Stop joking around.

764
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,250
First things first.

765
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,140
I know this is tough,

766
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,490
but running away won't help.

767
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,050
Don't worry.

768
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,450
No matter how hard it is,

769
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,530
I'll be with you through it all.

770
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,420
Okay.

771
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,010
If you say so.

772
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,530
When?

773
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,530
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

774
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,860
Gao Rui?

775
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,860
What a coincidence. You're off work?

776
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,010
I'm just taking a walk nearby.

777
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,140
Happened to walk by.

778
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,970
Yeah.

779
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,530
You walked here all the way

780
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,380
from Capital University?

781
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,450
That's a long walk.

782
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,140
Right.

783
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,450
Are you available later?

784
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,970
Let me buy you dinner.

785
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,660
You want one more bottle?

786
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,770
Okay.

787
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,900
Are you still not gonna tell me?

788
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,860
You were here

789
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,730
to see me, right?

790
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,690
Just say what you want to say.

791
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,180
I…

792
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,210
I do have something to tell you.

793
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,690
I…

794
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,730
I…

795
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,730
Excuse me!

796
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,180
Yes?

797
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,820
Another bottle, please.

798
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,820
Coming right up.

799
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,690
I want you to be my investor.

800
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,490
Here's the thing.

801
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,420
Lin and I stopped

802
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,210
working with B&C Motors.

803
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,010
But now,

804
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,180
we can't find new investors.

805
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,900
We've been struggling

806
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,210
these last few days.

807
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,340
I know it might

808
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,730
be better

809
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,450
if Lin told you this.

810
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,450
But you know

811
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,340
how he is.

812
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,770
He's too embarrassed

813
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,620
to ask you.

814
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,250
But I don't mind.

815
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,450
I've got thick skin.

816
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,770
So,

817
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,100
with that being said,

818
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,900
if you're not okay with it,

819
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,140
just tell me straight.

820
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,660
I can handle it.

821
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,730
You just started the business

822
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,970
and already ran into things like this?

823
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,420
Big companies like B&C Motors

824
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,180
will never let

825
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,210
startups like you

826
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:03,940
get ahead.

827
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,900
Since you came to me,

828
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,300
I'll be straight with you.

829
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,420
Okay.

830
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,490
If they steal

831
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,780
your core patents,

832
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,700
your company will be worthless.

833
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,380
Even if I try

834
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,420
to raise funds then,

835
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,420
the chances won't be good.

836
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,050
No investor wants

837
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,220
to throw money

838
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,970
at a company

839
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,050
that has lost value.

840
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,900
I understand.

841
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,610
Unless…

842
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,260
Unless the big boss
insists on investing.

843
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,090
But even if that happens,

844
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,130
who knows

845
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,530
if Lin Zhihua will accept it.

846
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,860
He won't dare say no.

847
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,450
Don't worry.

848
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,860
If you can get your boss onboard,

849
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,090
I'll make sure

850
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,300
to drag Lin over to thank you.

851
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,340
Hold on to that thought.

852
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,900
Get him into

853
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,900
Lin Qi Capital first.

854
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,820
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

855
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,940
Here's a toast to you.

856
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,130
I'll drink first.

857
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,820
Take it slow…

858
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,700
I'm fine…

859
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,130
This wine tonight

860
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,940
tastes good.

861
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,740
Where am I?

862
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,530
What does she take me for?

863
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,450
I'm never letting C1

864
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,650
go to Lin Qi.

865
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,130
Dad.

866
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,090
If B&C takes away

867
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,260
C1's core tech,

868
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,530
the company's just a shell.

869
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,340
You can't be blind to that,

870
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,740
Dad.

871
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,740
Your mom and I want to do this.

872
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,340
We are family.

873
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,900
We should stick together

874
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,090
and support each other,

875
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,050
right?

876
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,530
Look, your mom and I

877
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,170
got both career and love going strong.

878
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,700
Dad, that show

879
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,700
doesn't work for me.

880
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,570
You haven't divorced yet

881
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,490
because you're tied up

882
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,490
in too many ways.

883
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,220
I don't want to be tied up.

884
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,940
I definitely don't want

885
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,650
to keep pretending

886
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,780
after taking your money.

887
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,130
Also,

888
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,970
drink less, Dad.

889
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,340
Get a checkup.

890
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,610
Or your liver will be in trouble soon.

891
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,420
Okay.

892
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,610
Got it, son.

893
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,490
What did he say?

894
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,050
I can't stand it.

895
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,900
What?

896
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,420
I just talked to him.

897
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,340
He has his own idea.

898
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,530
Let's drop it.

899
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,530
Just let him.

900
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,050
So you're just gonna watch him

901
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,900
do it on his own?

902
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,090
I don't want to argue with you today.

903
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,050
What's that attitude?

904
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,450
That's your own son!

905
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,740
You're just a coward.

906
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,530
Am I wrong?

907
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,420
You're just afraid.

908
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,490
Afraid you'll lose money

909
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,260
and can't shut up

910
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,260
the board.

911
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,300
It was your son who shut me up first.

912
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,860
Qi Rui,

913
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,570
he's a grown-up.

914
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,340
He's figured us out

915
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,340
long ago.

916
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,420
It's not that he won't accept

917
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,450
investment from Linqi.

918
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,970
He just won't watch us

919
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,970
keep acting in front of him.

920
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,170
We've been

921
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,010
acting all our lives.

922
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,050
Do we have to drag him in, too?

923
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,570
Don't you feel tired?

924
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,480
[Come to the lab. The lawyer's here.]

925
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,130
Xuejiao,

926
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,260
if Lin Zhihua can't make it today,

927
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,490
we can reschedule.

928
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,700
My legal consultations

929
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,860
are charged by the hour.

930
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,900
You are

931
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,740
wasting my time.

932
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,340
Sorry, Mr. Zhang,

933
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,650
please wait a bit longer.

934
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,650
I'll go out to check.

935
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,220
What took you so long?

936
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,300
Don't you know what time we scheduled?

937
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,260
Something held me up.

938
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,130
I need to give you a heads-up.

939
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,900
B&C is a huge company.

940
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,260
They must have a very professional

941
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,970
legal team.

942
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,170
If they dared to screw me over,

943
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,050
they must've got their legal reasons.

944
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,530
So when we go in there,

945
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,220
stay calm.

946
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,130
Keep a cool head.

947
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,450
But you can't just give up.

948
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,900
I'm not giving up.

949
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,420
Actually, yesterday,

950
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,450
I found out

951
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,530
about B&C's dirty tricks

952
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,740
through my contacts.

953
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,820
And I just got

954
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,220
some evidence of

955
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,010
their unethical business.

956
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,340
I'll keep collecting more

957
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,170
from other teams

958
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,420
they've screwed over.

959
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,780
So,

960
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,780
you have your own plan?

961
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,940
How long have you known me?

962
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,220
I never give up.

963
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,780
B&C has been acting cocky

964
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,610
all these years.

965
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,130
They've pissed off way more

966
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,700
than just my small startup.

967
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,610
So my plan is

968
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,260
to unite all their enemies

969
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,090
and work together to take B&C down.

970
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,900
It's called

971
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,490
'To subdue the enemy

972
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,940
without fighting is best.'

973
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,340
I got inspired

974
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,170
by that game yesterday.

975
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,740
How did you come up

976
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,010
with a plan while gaming?

977
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,050
Why didn't you

978
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,090
tell me earlier?

979
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,010
I wasn't

980
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,220
100% sure at first.

981
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,970
Plus, B&C

982
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,450
sent someone to watch me.

983
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,970
If I didn't act the part,

984
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,420
they'd never let their guard down.

985
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,820
Then the lawyer…?

986
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,900
We can still hire him.

987
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,780
You've been through all that trouble.

988
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,420
We might as well make good use of it.

989
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,260
You two…

990
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,450
Don't you have a watch?

991
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,450
Do you know what time it is?

992
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,900
My bad.

993
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,090
So sorry.

994
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,740
Let's get started.

995
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,490
That pose

996
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,260
doesn't look slack enough.

997
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,650
Let me show you how it's done.

998
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,450
Legs like this.

999
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,170
Yes.

1000
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,090
That's the spirit.

1001
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,050
That's how you

1002
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,450
slack off right.

1003
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,260
You know a lot

1004
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,260
about slack guys, huh?

1005
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,970
I've never driven the car,

1006
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,340
but I've been in the back seat.

1007
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,170
I kinda know the drill.

1008
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,650
Yeah?

1009
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,340
Doesn't your brother
act like this a lot?

1010
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:31,490
Yes.

1011
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,420
My brother.

1012
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,490
He likes doing this.

1013
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,610
Acting like he doesn't care

1014
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,610
about anything.

1015
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,380
But really,

1016
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,260
he's just running away from reality.
