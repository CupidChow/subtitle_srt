00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,980
My dear sister!

194
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,940
Gross! Just call me

195
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,100
by my name!

196
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,500
Thanks for such an awesome gift.

197
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,210
The latest smartphone!

198
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,980
Reward from

199
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,130
the stock exchange?

200
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,060
Good for you.

201
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,740
Thanks a ton!

202
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,860
This is weird...

203
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,980
Since when does the stock exchange

204
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,010
give out fancy gifts

205
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,810
to small investors?

206
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,250
What's up?

207
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,180
Mingze got a phone

208
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,370
from the stock exchange.

209
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,210
Feeling jealous?

210
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,570
Not really,

211
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,810
it's just a phone.

212
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,540
I've got bigger dreams!

213
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,660
Keep your feet on the ground for now.

214
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,300
Sit down.

215
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,570
A bunch of wrongs again?

216
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,450
Sorry.

217
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,810
Hurry and fix your mistakes.

218
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,850
Today we're starting

219
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,090
the next phase of your study plan.

220
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,690
Is A the right answer here?

221
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,570
Xuejiao,

222
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,690
even your brother could get this one.

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,450
Mock exam goals

224
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,380
and study plan:

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,210
second,

226
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,690
apply what you learn

227
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,900
and strengthen your memory.

228
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,420
Relative molecular mass.

229
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,610
Xuejiao.

230
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,140
Starch, polysaccharide,

231
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,330
polymer compound.

232
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,850
Chemical formula:

233
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,540
(C6H10O5)n.

234
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,210
It can be converted by the liver

235
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,940
into glycogen and triglycerides.

236
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,810
Eat too much starch,

237
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,450
you risk

238
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,660
heart disease,

239
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,490
and gaining weight.

240
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,970
Then eat this.

241
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,540
Fructose, monosaccharide.

242
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,780
It has the same formula as glucose.

243
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,690
Both are C6H12O6.

244
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,330
They're isomers of each other.

245
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,300
Moderate intake helps you think better.

246
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,060
Here, eat up.

247
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,380
How do you know so much

248
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,260
about health and nutrition?

249
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,420
Trying to make the world a better place.

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,570
You're seriously impressive.

251
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,210
If I had to memorize all this,

252
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,810
my brain would explode.

253
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,970
Xuejiao!

254
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,900
Snacks!

255
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,780
Thanks!

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,300
That's the last bag of this flavor.

257
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,780
I'll restock for you.

258
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,300
What's up with them?

259
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,810
Go get them!

260
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,690
Hey, you two! Just wait!

261
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,660
Stop!

262
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,970
Hello? Lin?

263
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,690
What time is

264
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,420
our tutorial tonight?

265
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,660
The tutorial is canceled.

266
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,690
Gao Rui just woke up.

267
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,300
Gao!

268
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,060
Thank God.

269
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,490
You are...

270
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,260
You don't recognize me?

271
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,780
Oh, sorry, we'll

272
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,660
get out of your way then.

273
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,610
Just kidding.

274
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,090
Come on, man.

275
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,570
Still got

276
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,540
no sense of humor, huh?

277
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,210
Ma'am,

278
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,450
are there any post-op

279
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,540
side effects we should be aware of?

280
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,090
What should we

281
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,900
watch out for during his recovery?

282
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,940
And when will he be able to go home?

283
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,660
Why not just ask her

284
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,450
to write you up a

285
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,300
full post-op care

286
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,180
slideshow?

287
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,300
You really think she

288
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,260
has time for that?

289
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,380
How are you feeling?

290
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,090
I'm fine, feeling much better.

291
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,660
Three, two, three, four.

292
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,970
Five, six, seven, eight.

293
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,940
Gao, just focus on getting better.

294
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,140
Make yourself at home in the hospital.

295
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,690
Three, four, five, six...

296
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,780
Most people

297
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,900
want patients to

298
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,300
get out of here quickly,

299
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,690
right?

300
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,900
I really need to get discharged,

301
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,260
so I can get back to tutoring you two.

302
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,140
That would be the real disaster.

303
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,020
Gao,

304
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,380
can you maybe stay

305
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,260
in the hospital a little longer?

306
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,900
I get it.

307
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,730
You're worried if I get discharged,

308
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,690
Lin won't

309
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,610
keep tutoring you.

310
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,940
My number one client's

311
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,490
getting poached!

312
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,570
Relax.

313
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,900
I'm just an occasional

314
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,810
drop-in student.

315
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,610
At best, a potential client.

316
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,780
Your loyal customer Gu Mingze

317
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,970
is and will always
be your ball and chain.

318
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,810
Massage

319
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,420
the Sibai acupuncture point.

320
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,490
One, two, three, four.

321
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,490
Five, six, seven, eight.

322
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,020
So, um,

323
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,540
after class today...

324
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,210
I've got plans.

325
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,380
With who?

326
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,900
Do I have to tell you everything?

327
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,140
I wanna come too.

328
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,380
You sure about that?

329
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,780
I got a tutorial.

330
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,570
You wanna join?

331
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,210
I'm in.

332
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,730
Finish this then.

333
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,730
Just end me now.

334
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,780
Tell me the truth,

335
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,490
were you worried I'd never wake up?

336
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,570
Just sitting home every single day,

337
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,020
drowning your sorrows in joke books?

338
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,490
But with all these hospital visits,

339
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,780
do you even have time for experiments?

340
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,020
Fried chicken!

341
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,900
That's not for you.

342
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,850
You just had surgery,

343
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,450
stick to bland diet for now.

344
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,810
I'm fed up with

345
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,210
rice porridge and pickles.

346
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,780
I've been in here for ages.

347
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,490
Did you guys

348
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,780
pay the bills for me?

349
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,490
Relax.

350
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,690
Your bills won't break me.

351
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,380
I won the lottery.

352
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,900
No joke.

353
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,810
That's

354
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,850
too wild

355
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,540
even for you.

356
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,690
Nobody's buying that.

357
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,900
Never stop talking

358
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,180
even when you're eating, huh?

359
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,780
But honestly, seeing you this energetic

360
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,610
is a relief.

361
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,940
Gotta run to tutoring.

362
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,180
See you tomorrow.

363
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,780
Wait,

364
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,420
something's off.

365
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,690
Since when do you like fried chicken?

366
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,690
Who's it for, then?

367
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,660
Your hopeless tutee's little sis.

368
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,140
Why does she get fried chicken

369
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,900
and I don't?

370
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,610
Are you secretly
charging her or something?

371
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,450
Shouldn't he

372
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,660
go to the lab?

373
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,330
Rui,

374
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,780
forget the lab for now.

375
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,940
Just focus on getting better,

376
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,660
we'll be waiting for you to bounce back.

377
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,540
Does "we"

378
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,690
include Lin Zhihua?

379
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,850
Professor Tan,

380
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,140
your researcher

381
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,450
is turning into a top-notch tutor!

382
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,450
Hey, Gao.

383
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,490
I just found out

384
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,210
Professor Tan

385
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,020

00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,290
Better not.

771
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,490
I am

772
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,900
bottom-ten material for now.

773
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,530
If I actually use it,

774
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,290
I'll inherit your "dead last" title.

775
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,770
Life

776
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,010
ain't just dreams.

777
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,730
Your future won't fight for itself.

778
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,580
You're hopeless.

779
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,530
Coming through!

780
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
[5F Neurosurgery]

781
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,490
Can't believe it,

782
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,010
you'd come to tell Gao

783
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,730
after getting your scores.

784
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,660
Of course,

785
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,580
he is

786
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,530
our matchmaker.

787
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,690
What?

788
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,380
M...

789
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,770
M...

790
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,340
M...

791
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,140
Middleman,

792
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,820
right.

793
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,820
Watch your wording.

794
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:48,860
Excuse me.

795
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,580
That patient...

796
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,180
Three, two, one.

797
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,690
Don't know.

798
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,820
Hello?

799
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,620
What?

800
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,490
What's up?

801
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,010
Gao Rui went out for a test drive.

802
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,420
What's going on?

803
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,250
Gao...

804
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:21,970
Sir,

805
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,820
Gao insisted on testing to see

806
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,970
if the last accident would happen again.

807
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,180
So you've been his sidekick

808
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,820
since college,

809
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,530
Mr. Lin?

810
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,690
Gao!

811
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,100
The system's still buggy!

812
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,580
Trying to crash twice?

813
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,490
That was just a freak accident.

814
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,900
I'm not backing down.

815
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,180
One-in-ten-thousand chance,

816
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,100
it won't happen again.

817
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,580
Gao, listen to me...

818
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,290
You're off the team.

819
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,690
What gives you the right to stop me?

820
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,340
I don't wanna watch you die!

821
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:51,820
I've been

822
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,940
reviewing what happened.

823
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,140
It's not probability.

824
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,820
Our test system's compatibility with

825
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,490
the environmental simulation settings

826
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,210
is really poor.

827
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,180
It led to a stack overflow,

828
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,900
which crashed the whole thing.

829
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,450
If you want back in,

830
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,860
wait until I've fixed the bugs,

831
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,380
deal?

832
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,530
How long will it take?

833
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,940
Lin,

834
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,290
I knew it,

835
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,180
you're stalling again.

836
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,970
The hospital just called,

837
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,770
I only have a 10% chance

838
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,730
of recovering through rehab.

839
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,530
Maybe

840
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,690
it would've been better

841
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,450
if I'd just died in that car.

842
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:23,970
Let's go.

843
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,010
He can debug

844
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,620
right now!

845
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,180
Who are you?

846
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,210
Hey!

847
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,210
You're asking me to debug

848
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,210
right here and now?

849
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,970
Whether you're helping Gao out

850
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,690
with the project

851
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,050
or tutoring me,

852
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,210
haven't you always been working

853
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,940
on your debug plans?

854
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,730
That's not true.

855
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,860
Then why glued

856
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,420
to your laptop?

857
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,490
Binge-watching TV shows?

858
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,820
Let's go, start the car.

859
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,340
Gao, don't do anything stupid!

860
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,340
Give me ten minutes.

861
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,860
Just ten minutes.

862
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,100
Hello.

863
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,770
I need your help.

864
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,860
Hi.

865
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,620
What are you working on?

866
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,420
Cut to the chase.

867
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,970
Don't stand so close.

868
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,580
Make a sentence with a conditional.

869
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,290
My amount of exercise

870
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,010
is at my limit.

871
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,180
Starch is?

872
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:49,770
Polysaccharide.

873
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,580
And monosaccharides?

874
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,420
Ribose, glucose,

875
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,730
fructose, and galactose.

876
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,340
All done.

877
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,180
But this is just a model for now.

878
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:03,970
It needs tons of

879
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,290
testing and experiments before...

880
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,180
Professor?

881
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,210
You guys...

882
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,010
Professor.

883
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,340
Your vacation

884
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,940
is about over.

885
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,250
Professor,

886
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,660
Lin Zhihua from C1 Lab,
Capital University,

887
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,820
requesting reinstatement.

888
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,940
Request

889
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,180
approved.

890
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,970
You tricked me!

891
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,420
I was overthinking before.

892
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,530
A new perspective cleared things up.

893
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,860
And it's all thanks to you, Professor,

894
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,940
for making me take a break

895
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,620
and do odd jobs.

896
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,250
It helped me find a new solution.

897
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,820
Lin!

898
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,820
You have no idea how hard I worked

899
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,180
to get you back on the team.

900
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,420
How are you going to thank me

901
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,420
for this huge favor?

902
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,820
I was already planning

903
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,970
to come back regardless.

904
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,180
How were we supposed to know?

905
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,900
Anyway,

906
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,770
I've been worrying

907
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,340
about you nonstop.

908
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,690
And I heard from Gao

909
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,940
that you hit the lottery.

910
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,100
Shouldn't you give me

911
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,860
a little something?

912
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,180
Doesn't have to be fancy.

913
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,250
Just

914
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,450
some nice

915
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,050
top-100 celebration gift,

916
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,490
how does that sound?

917
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,770
Sure.

918
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,140
Fifty sets of mock exams

919
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,530
from the last five years.

920
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,290
How does that sound?

921
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,530
Make it a hundred!

922
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,010
Pick something else!

923
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,450
Something else?

924
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,770
How about I give you a quiz?

925
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,010
That's even worse!

926
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,690
Gao, listen to me...

927
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,250
You're off the team.

928
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,620
What gives you the right to stop me?

929
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,860
I don't wanna watch you die!

930
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,700
You're asking me to debug

931
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,700
right here and now?

932
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,860
Whether you're helping Gao out

933
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,530
with the project

934
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,940
or tutoring me,

935
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,050
haven't you always been working

936
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,740
on your debug plans?

937
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,530
That's not true.

938
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,900
Then why glued

939
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,380
to your laptop?

940
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,490
Binge-watching TV shows?

941
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,860
What's happening?

942
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,450
Don't panic, just hit the call button!

943
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,130
I once believed

944
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,780
that I

945
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,260
controlled my own destiny.

946
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,570
As a child

947
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,700
commanding toy cars,

948
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,570
or effortlessly

949
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,650
mastering exams.

950
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,780
I could precisely score 59

951
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,820
in every subject, deliberately failing.

952
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,130
This control thrilled me

953
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,300
more than perfect scores.

954
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,010
In entrepreneurship,

955
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,940
victories came so easily.

956
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,170
What I valued most

957
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,700
were my brothers-in-arms.

958
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,220
No,

959
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,420
comrades.

960
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,340
But years later,

961
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,130
at my best friend's funeral,

962
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,170
I suddenly realized

963
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,420
destiny
