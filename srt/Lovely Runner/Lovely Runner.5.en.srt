1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,580
(Byeon Woo Seok)

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,309
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,480
(10 missed calls from CEO)

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,949
(Kim Hye Yoon)

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,929
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,199
By the way,

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,210
how did you know I would be here?

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,039
I saw you at the bus stop.

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,880
I saw that you fell asleep, so you didn't get off the bus stop.

10
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,879
Seriously. This is why...

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,688
you should be mindful of where and when you doze off.

12
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,450
You're always dozing off whenever or wherever.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,619
I mean, what would you have done if I didn't see you on the bus?

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,789
Okay. I'll never doze off from now on.

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,920
By the way,

16
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,859
have you seen me before the mock competition?

17
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,858
I was just wondering...

18
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,328
if we had met before since we're neighbours and all.

19
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,390
We had met.

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,730
Really?

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,129
You mistook me for a courier before.

22
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,700
You probably don't remember that.

23
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,500
When was that?

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,969
It was spring.

25
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,510
I had just moved into the house.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
I see.

27
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,849
It would've been great if I got to know you then.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,650
Is that so?

29
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,959
Then have you been to my mom's video rental shop?

30
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,120
I often managed the cash register in place of my mom.

31
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,159
("Basic Instincts")

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,599
Have you come to rent a DVD?

33
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,400
Why am I so sleepy?

34
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,069
Are you...

35
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,770
Are you asleep?

36
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,879
I'm so sleepy.

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,960
Go inside.

38
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,689
Okay.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,039
We live our lives as we miss out on many things.

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,649
To me, Sun Jae was like a star in the sky, unreachable...

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,650
and a universe away.

42
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,020
At the edge of my teens, filled with memories...

43
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,090
I'd rather not recall,

44
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:09,590
Sun Jae had been there all along, just a reach away.

45
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,229
He breathed the same air as me every day,

46
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,199
gazed at the same sky,

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,539
walked the same path,

48
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,509
knew my name...

49
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,479
Sol!

50
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,550
And saved me.

51
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,849
Yet, I didn't realize it then.

52
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,688
Only when I faced my past again,

53
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,620
did I realize how many moments of connection...

54
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,330
I had missed and lived through.

55
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,830
Why are you crying?

56
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,840
Perhaps the moments I must not miss...

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,069
could be somewhere,

58
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,479
sending me signals constantly as they shine brightly.

59
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,949
Not missing those signals.

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Perhaps, couldn't that be the reason...

61
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,419
why I came here and why you and I met again?

62
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,888
(Episode 5)

63
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,259
Sun Jae!

64
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,100
Sun Jae!

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,170
Sun Jae!

66
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,110
Sun Jae!

67
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,350
Sun Jae, come on out for a second.

68
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,910
What is it this time?

69
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,560
Sun Jae, look at the sky! There's a rainbow.

70
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,458
Isn't it pretty?

71
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,699
If I didn't wake you up, you would've missed it.

72
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,800
Make a wish now.

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,500
What rainbow?

74
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,470
What? You can't see it well?

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,139
No.

76
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,040
Wait.

77
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,720
Sun Jae.

78
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,240
How about now? You can see it now. Right?

79
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,740
Yes.

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,588
That's cold. What is this?

81
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,220
Is it raining again? What?

82
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,089
You brat!

83
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,059
You're too old to be playing with water!

84
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,430
That's cold. Hey!

85
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,800
You just wait there!

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,170
- Hey, what are you doing right now? - No.

87
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,599
- Hey! - Mom!

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,438
- Hey. What did you do? - Mom! Wait.

89
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,338
- I'll turn it off, Mom. - Come on.

90
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,439
- Calm down, Mom. - Stop right there!

91
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,508
- Mom! Wait! - I'm going to scold you today.

92
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,309
You're too old for this nonsense!

93
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,819
- Mom, listen. - Stop right there!

94
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Mom!

95
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,688
- Let me do it. - You!

96
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:59,159
- You're too old for this prank! - I'm sorry!

97
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,060
- Listen, Mom. - Stop right there!

98
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,170
Sun Jae.

99
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,509
Here.

100
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,040
What is this? It's too early for a present.

101
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,920
It flew over from your rooftop.

102
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,420
This isn't mine.

103
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,589
It's my grandma's.

104
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,589
My grandma likes pink.

105
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Whatever.

106
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:36,889
Hey, I didn't ask you whose it was.

107
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,399
Darn it.

108
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,670
Come on.

109
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,938
Actually, I was going to ask you to take the bus to school together.

110
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,399
There's something I have to do with you.

111
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,709
What is that?

112
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,670
You don't have to know.

113
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,279
Thank you, Sun Jae.

114
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,379
For what?

115
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,879
For saving my life.

116
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,990
And I'm sorry.

117
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,990
I should have thanked you sooner.

118
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,360
But it took me a long time.

119
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,730
You already thanked me yesterday.

120
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,459
I should still thank you properly.

121
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,370
By the way, you're not avoiding me.

122
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,299
You said you wouldn't be friends with a girl.

123
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,769
Who said I would be your friend?

124
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,638
You said you were just friends with those girls in the articles.

125
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,269
Then you must have dated all of them.

126
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,040
You had a lot of girlfriends.

127
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,379
Fine. Then you be my lifesaver.

128
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,079
I'll be the magpie, returning the kindness.

129
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:32,980
You mean a swallow?

130
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,590
Was it a swallow?

131
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,629
You could've been in danger.

132
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,899
Then should I be...

133
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,470
a swallow?

134
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,440
You didn't bring me a gourd seed.

135
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,080
You brought the gourd itself.

136
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,250
It's a time capsule.

137
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,120
I put your present in it.

138
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,490
In folktales, gold and jewels come out of a gourd. You know?

139
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,559
You said it was my present.

140
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,590
Just give it to me. Why bury it in the ground? It's a lot of work.

141
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,428
- Is this kimchi? - It's not a kimchi jar.

142
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:17,860
I told you it was a time capsule.

143
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,029
You should start digging too.

144
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,840
Then what's in it?

145
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,740
Real gold and jewels?

146
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,309
Something more precious and valuable is in it.

147
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,049
When you open it up later, you'll be so surprised.

148
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,409
Later when?

149
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,019
Around 2023.

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,049
Why would we leave a present buried that long?

151
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm giving you stocks.

152
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
They are blue-chip stocks.

153
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,519
So you must give them a lot of time. That's why we're burying them.

154
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,360
Really?

155
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,759
I was joking.

156
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,128
Then let's meet at midnight on January 1, 2023...

157
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,840
on the Hangang Bridge.

158
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,809
Let's open this up together.

159
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,539
Why that day?

160
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,580
(The unfortunate passing of Ryu Sun Jae from Eclipse)

161
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,149
That way, I can change your fate.

162
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,690
So please...

163
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,620
stay alive just for one more day.

164
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,190
The present will be meaningful only if I give it to you that day.

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,529
It will be an amazing present. So look forward to it.

166
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,730
Don't dig it out before then.

167
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,699
Midnight on January 1, 2023...

168
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,169
on the Hangang Bridge.

169
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,070
Don't forget that. Okay?

170
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,239
Midnight on January 1, 2023...

171
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,609
on the Hangang Bridge.

172
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,649
The Hangang Bridge.

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,350
Wait.

174
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,750
Does it mean you won't see me until then?

175
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,789
You never know what could happen in the future.

176
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,960
Even if we don't end up staying in touch,

177
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,059
please come to see me that day.

178
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,629
Treat it like going to a school reunion. Okay?

179
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,830
Just think of it as meeting an old friend.

180
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,600
Who said I would be your friend?

181
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,138
Hey, I told you I was busy.

182
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,878
If you run into Im Sol in front of your house,

183
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,178
look for any injuries on her.

184
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,149
Why would I do that? Tell Kim Tae Seong about that.

185
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,548
I hear he's dating Im Sol when he doesn't like her or anything.

186
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:21,590
Do you think he'll look after her?

187
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,749
- What? - There's a girl named Choi Ga Hyun.

188
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,259
She's been bothering him to go out with her.

189
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,320
He's dating any random girl to get rid of her.

190
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,789
By the way, you...

191
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,230
Forget it. Let's just go.

192
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,629
Seriously. She must be blind.

193
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,299
Hey.

194
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,799
Where are your eyes?

195
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,210
Right here.

196
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,110
Wait up!

197
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,518
Darn it. What's up with the student enforcers?

198
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,750
- They always inspect our uniforms. - Exactly.

199
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,049
Oh, no. My tie.

200
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,919
I'll end up running in the school friend this morning.

201
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,029
Wait.

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,349
Gosh. What about you?

203
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,779
I was an athlete.

204
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,750
I rarely wore my school uniform. So I won't get pulled over.

205
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,558
Look at your tie. Seriously.

206
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,889
Do you not wash your uniform?

207
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,899
Look at these punks.

208
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,860
You little...

209
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,069
Ryu Sun Jae.

210
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,969
You're no longer an athlete.

211
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,539
- Make sure to dress properly. - Yes, sir.

212
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,940
- Hello, sir. - Look who's here.

213
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,580
What a surprise.

214
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,939
You rats always weaselled your way out of this...

215
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,309
by climbing over the wall.

216
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,980
We are...

217
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,980
turning ourselves in.

218
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,450
You'll show leniency, right?

219
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,789
Of course.

220
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,590
Come here.

221
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,759
You guys are unbelievable.

222
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,659
Whoever comes in last will have to run seven more laps.

223
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,558
Why did you drag me into this, you jerk?

224
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,929
You need to exercise.

225
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,870
Come on.

226
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,639
Hey, there.

227
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,269
Not even a hello?

228
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
We're not exactly friends, are we?

229
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,009
Then what's your deal with my girlfriend?

230
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,080
Why are you putting up with this penalty for her?

231
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,320
Oh, right. Do you live across from Sol's house?

232
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,620
What do you want to know?

233
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,190
What do I want to know?

234
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,258
Which is faster for swimmers?

235
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,460
Swimming or running?

236
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,100
You know, turtles can swim fast underwater,

237
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,629
but they are so slow on land.

238
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,100
Are you like a turtle?

239
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:14,929
Quit smoking.

240
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,710
You startled me.

241
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,080
What's up with that gross gaze?

242
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,559
- I'm just checking. - Gosh, you crazy jerk.

243
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,428
Check for what?

244
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:23,529
I was right.

245
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,259
You like Im Sol for real, don't you?

246
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,470
- What? - Look how you've been lately.

247
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,469
You've been coming to school every day.

248
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,768
You stopped smoking.

249
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,000
I wanted to meet up with girls, but you just left.

250
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,339
You've been acting odd.

251
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,939
Hey. Put on some clothes.

252
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,539
You're assaulting my eyes with that gross body.

253
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,250
It's bringing tears to my eyes.

254
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,419
- Don't I look good? - Just put some clothes on.

255
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,349
- Didn't he lose to them? - Right.

256
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,288
So he's looking for a chance to get his revenge.

257
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,719
On the left, we have Park Tae Hwan of Korea.

258
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,019
On the right, the swimmer in the red cap...

259
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,960
A 300m freestyle race.

260
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,529
Ready.

261
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,570
What's up with this?

262
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,440
- Why can't I turn it off? - There they go.

263
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,570
Lane Four, Park Tae Hwan.

264
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,210
- Zhang is leading. Park is... - Darn it.

265
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,149
In my opinion, they will be testing the water until the 200m mark.

266
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,750
I'm home.

267
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,519
Hey, you're home.

268
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,389
What are you doing?

269
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,429
The TV is broken.

270
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,129
What happened to the floor?

271
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,370
There was a rat.

272
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,499
He's taking the lead.

273
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,339
Gosh, he's so handsome.

274
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,638
That swimmer's mother must be so lucky.

275
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,639
She's got a very successful and handsome son.

276
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,408
Gosh. What if Park Tae Hwan wins the gold medal tomorrow?

277
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,450
I think he will.

278
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,750
A Korean swimmer winning the gold medal?

279
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,649
Gosh, passing the preliminary round is a huge feat for Korea.

280
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,120
What? It's possible.

281
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,788
Not only did he win the gold medal,

282
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,820
he also won a silver medal. He won two medals.

283
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,659
Gosh, his hunches couldn't be more wrong.

284
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,900
No wonder why he lost all of his money with stocks.

285
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,970
Wait.

Let's watch a movie together.

What? A movie?

292
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,420
Yes, it's my treat.

00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,630
Well...

294
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,329
I already booked the tickets. I can't cancel them.

00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,329
Come on.

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,740
Is your boyfriend busy?

298
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,909
Why a movie all of a sudden?

299
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,309
Just because. There are so many things I must thank you for.

300
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:28,849
It's Park Tae Hwan.

I made you look.

304
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,789
Wasn't that funny?

305
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,130
Let's hurry now. Okay?

306
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,970
What was that?

307
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,220

Isn't this crazy?

311
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,480
I can roll them the other way around. Look.

312
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,980

Why? Did you think I would cry because I envy him?

365
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,329
Even if...

366
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,960
I had known I'd have to quit swimming at the age of 19,

367
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,230
I'd have started swimming anyway.

368
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,170
When I think about it,

369
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,509
I was really happy when I swam.

370
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,279
I wouldn't have known that happiness if I hadn't tried it.

371
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,650
That's why I don't regret...

372
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,680
that I started swimming...

373
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,650
even when I can't do it anymore now.

374
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,990
So,

375
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,660
I'm all right. That's what I'm saying.

377
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,629
I'm going to find him and...

378
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,069
Are you done with the acting class?

379
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Yes. Did you have a math class today?

380
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,710
No. I came to give you this.

381
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,210
Here. It's your shirt.

382
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,538
It's been so long since you said you would wash it,

383
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,480
so I thought you went all the way to India to wash it.

384
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,278
I'm super busy because I'm a senior.

385
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,419
Unlike you who kill time while fooling around.

386
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,720
Hey, being a senior doesn't make you special.

387
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,250
How dare you speak so rudely to me like that?

388
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,489
What? Did you buy a new one?

389
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,490
Hey. You are so considerate.

390
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,900
Gosh. How did you know my passion for the new items?

391
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,869
So, did you get a new front tooth?

392
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,839
Yes.

393
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,470
Your uncle is a skilled dentist.

394
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,210
Okay, then. I'll get going.

395
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,109
No!

396
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,880
Don't ride bicycles on the sidewalk!

397
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,619
Are you all right?

398
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,399
I... I...

399
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,240
I... I am all right.

400
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:02,869
What's wrong with her?

401
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,980
Why does my heart pound for a guy like him?

402
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,809
It's been a while since I watched a movie in the theater.

403
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
I'm sad we missed it.

404
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,018
- I guess you like movies. - Yes.

405
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,450
I used to watch 2 to 3 movies a day.

406
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,390
I wanted to become a movie director.

407
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,759
Why do you speak in the past tense?

408
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:25,129
Now, my goal is to go and take the college entrance exam...

409
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,930
with these two healthy legs.

410
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,529
I also have to take the exam all of a sudden.

411
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,500
Do you?

412
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,410
I want to apply for early admission as a physical education major.

413
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,180
Really? My brother majored in physical education too.

414
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,048
Are you going to be a PE teacher?

415
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:43,410
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

416
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,819
I can't imagine myself yet...

417
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,788
doing something other than swimming.

418
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,449
What are you talking about?

419
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,889
You look good in a doctor's gown, a judge's gown,

420
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,758
military uniform, hanbok, and everything.

421
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,189
You're a man of a thousand faces.

422
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,759
You speak as if you've already seen it.

423
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,759
No. Well...

424
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,399
If you are applying for the early admission,

425
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,798
you only need to get the minimum grade, right?

426
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:04,899
You should start studying.

427
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,039
Do you want me to help you with it?

428
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,739
Are you really going to help me?

429
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,410
Why not? Sure.

430
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,609
- I mean... - You promised me.

431
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,549
- What? - What?

432
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,450
Hello.

433
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,220
Quiet.

434
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,799
Why?

435
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,440
What do I do now?

436
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,960
What are you doing right now?

437
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,788
Go away.

438
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,098
What are you doing?

439
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,160
Go away, I said.

443
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:19,838
Yes, she is.

444
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,839
Is she?

445
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,609
Gosh. I'm glad to hear that.

446
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,319
It's so scary up here.

447
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,819
I think I set the foot all right.

448
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,058
Oh, no! Sun Jae!

449
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,159
- What should I do? - It's all right.

450
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,230
Goodness. I didn't mean to step on your head.

451
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,430
Gosh. What should I do, Sun Jae?

452
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,768
I'm so sorry, but I'm having a leg cramp.

453
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,798
Hold on.

454
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,139

465
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,900

466

What are you talking about?

468
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,569
I didn't watch anything.

469
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,069
The antenna is poking out from your pocket.

470
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,778
I heard a vein of water is flowing underneath our house.

471
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,349
The antenna is to find the water vein.

472
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,349
Stop worrying about upsetting me and watch it comfortably.

473
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,518
This is only making me more uncomfortable.

474
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,589
I'm not worried about upsetting you. I'm too old for that.

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,969
Hey. That's not a question to ask...

545
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,710
on the anniversary of your dad's death.

546
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,509
Anyway, if there's a good guy, date him.

547
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,979
You're still young.

548
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,008
You're in your prime.

549
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,349
That's ridiculous.

550
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,919
In the 2008 Beijing Olympics,

551
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,989
- Jang Mi Ran aims for gold... - She should win...

552
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,619
- in women's weightlifting. - the gold medal.

553
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,490
For her first clean-and-jerk attempt,

554
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,829
she will try 175kg.

555
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,730
Step one.

556
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:14,529
She has lifted it confidently.

557
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,768
Now for the clean.

558
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,569
She succeeds without a problem.

559
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,499
Korea's Jang Mi Ran...

560
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,338
- won the gold medal. - It's the gold medal!

561
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:23,309
Jang Mi Ran is catching her breath.

562
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,769
It's her second clean-and-jerk attempt.

563
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,979
- She applied for 183kg. - I'm nervous.

564
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,049
She has added 8kg.

565
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,380
Okay. Step one.

566
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,349
It's important she uses elasticity for the clean.

567
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,949
She successfully lifts it!

568
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,119
- It's a gold medal! - Gold medal!

569
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,058
Jang Mi Ran has made a new world record.

570
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,890
For the 3rd attempt, she goes for 186kg.

571
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,430
With a shout, she gets ready.

572
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,299
Korea's Jang Mi Ran continues to battle against her own limitation.

573
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,808
At the moment, everyone has become one...

574
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,869
to root for Jang Mi Ran.

575
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,210
Step one.

576
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,278
She successfully stands up.

577
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,650
- Lift it. - Now for the clean.

578
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,819
Jang Mi Ran does it!

579
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,989
She goes beyond the gold medal and makes a new world record!

580
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:16,960
Our Jang Mi Ran broke all the records!

581
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,260
It's a new world record!

582
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,130
- A new world record. - A new world record.

583
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,070
A new...

584
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,309
You're the guy, aren't you?

585
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,110
Excuse me?

586
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,940
You're the one who got my sister drunk.

587
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,849
Hey. I saw you bringing Im Sol home when she got tipsy.

588
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,320
When did I...

589
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,250
This is nothing.

590
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,590
- Back then? - Do you remember it now?

591
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,559
Parade rest.

592
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,159
Attention.

593
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,960
Parade rest.

594
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,559
Attention.

595
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,629
I really didn't make her drink.

596
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,340
Are you even lying to me now?

597
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,039
Sit down.

598
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,139
Stand up.

599
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:06,210
Sit down.

600
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,150
Into the push-up position.

601
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:11,848
I can't do it because I had shoulder surgery.

602
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:13,819
Don't get into the push-up position.

603
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,880
Stand up.

604
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,320
Are you Sol's boyfriend?

605
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,689
No.

606
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,289
- Not yet. - "Not yet?"

607
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,098
Goodness. Sol is popular,

608
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,659
just like her brother.

609
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,530
Who is her boyfriend, then?

610
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,840
- Someone else. - Someone who?

611
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,510
Is it the guy who put out the fire in our house?

612
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,210
Right. He looked like a fine guy.

613
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,109
- Based on what? - He was handsome and well-dressed.

614
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,249
He seemed like a popular guy.

615
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,549
He was brave and manly when he put out the fire.

616
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,320
You're a horrible judge of character.

617
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,179
What? What did you say?

618
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,289
Attention.

619
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,089
Attention!

620
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,219
Im Geum!

621
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,800
How dare you force military discipline on Sun Jae?

622
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,230
You learned useless things while you were in the military!

623
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,669
How dare you say such a thing to your brother?

624
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,109
- You need to be punished. - Wait.

625
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,110
You brats, here!

626
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,579
Mom, did you used to play volleyball?

627
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,308
Why do you keep hitting spikes all the time?

628
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,379
Be quiet.

629
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,919
Hey. When your father comes for food at the memorial ceremony,

630
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,079
he will hold back of his neck and return after seeing you two.

631
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,448
Come here.

632
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,749
You're in trouble.

633
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,419
Go and make Jeon. Go!

634
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,889
- Wait. - Mom.

635
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,889
- For goodness' sake. Go! - Let it go.

636
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,259
- You... - Mom, let it go.

637
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,759
- I will kill you. - Let go of me.

638
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,869
- Mom. - I'm serious.

639
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,979
He was handsome and well-dressed.

640
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,280
He seemed like a popular guy.

641
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,710
He's not handsome.

642
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,519
No.

643
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,659
Don't look at it.

644
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,730
Sun Jae, don't do it.

645
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
(Kim Tae Seong)

646
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,099
(Congratulations on becoming the 100,000th visitor)

647
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,469
(Kim Tae Seong has sent you 30 ginkgo nuts as a gift.)

648
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,070
Did you enjoy looking at my page?

649
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,239
No!

650
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,579
- He's Kim Tae Seong, right? - I think it's him.

651
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,018
(The 100,000th visitor, Ryu Sun Jae)

652
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,880
- Where? - I can't believe this.

653
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,189
He's cute.

654
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,650
- He's so hot. - I know.

655
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,159
(Contacts, Im Sol)

656
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,269
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

657
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,440
I really can't get a grasp on her.

658
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,480
He's really good-looking.

659
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,510
Where are you?

660
00:37:58,949 --> 00:37:59,980
In your heart?

661
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:02,178
Stop talking gibberish and come here at once.

662
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,218
What?

663
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,419
I thought we were done with the practice yesterday.

664
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,658
You just memorized the codes. We're not done at all.

665
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,119
We're performing tomorrow. What are you going to do?

666
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,389
Come within 15 minutes.

667
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Hey.

668
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:17,269
I have to leave soon.

669
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,969
My mom thinks I'm in a study hall, so she will come pick me up.

670
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,538
In that case,

671
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,909
let's practice your vocal without the bass guitar.

672
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,429
I love you

673
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,360
We are probably

674
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,159
Stop.

675
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,269
Dong Seob,

676
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:54,969
that's not the right pitch.

677
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,510
Right. Sorry.

678
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,739
I started out too high, didn't I?

679
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,138
No.

680
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,809
You started out too low.

681
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,380
He's a terrible vocalist.

682
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,860
Should I drag Sun Jae into our band?

683
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,869
Dad, to be honest,

684
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,630
I'm a little scared...

685
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:01,500
that I won't be able to save both Sun Jae and me.

686
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,679
So, please help me.

687
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:24,929
Do you ride bicycles well?

688
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,500
Yes. You can't ride bicycles?

689
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,699
You're right.

690
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,900
Dad taught me every weekend when I was young.

691
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,468
But back then,

692
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,440
I couldn't learn it because I was too scared.

693
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,309
It was my dad's wish to see me ride bicycles.

694
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,808
I didn't get to show him.

695
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,079
You should learn to ride them now.

696
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,380
You said he would be watching you from the sky.

697
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,050
What?

698
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,590
Sun Jae.

699
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,730
- Get off for a moment. - What?

700
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:33,699
Oh, okay.

701
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,840
This is why it's not stable.

702
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,609
If the saddle is too high,

703
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,969
you'll be injured badly when you fall.

704
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,550
- Get on the bike again. - Okay.

705
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,348
- Gosh. - It's comfortable, isn't it?

706
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,349
Yes.

707
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:00,059
I'll be holding it in the back. Try going slowly.

708
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,460
Are you going to teach me?

709
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,038
You could see if I'm capable...

710
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,139
of becoming a P.E. teacher or not.

711
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:19,238
Are you going to scold me severely if I'm bad?

712
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,909
Are you going to yell at me?

713
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,579
Do you know what my strength was when I was an athlete?

714
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,979
- What was it? - Composure.

715
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,519
(Composure)

716
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,948
Listen to me and grab the handlebars properly!

717
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,260
Grab them properly and pedal with your left foot, then right foot.

718
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,888
Left foot. No. Right foot.

719
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,630
Right foot. Left foot.

720
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:41,699
Oh, gosh.

721
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,130
Okay. Look.

722
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,968
As soon as you pedal with your left foot, move your right foot.

723
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,868
And keep your balance with the handlebars. Can't you do that?

724
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,669
Why do you think I'm learning it from you at this age...

725
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,940
if I can do that?

726
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,239
You're mad at me.

727
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,909
I guess you sold your composure!

728
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,219
Okay. Let's do it again.

729
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:07,559
Here I go.

730
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,190
Left foot. Right foot.

731
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,099
Did you sell your athleticism?

732
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,699
I'm not learning it.

733
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,069
What? I guess you sold your endurance too.

734
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,968
You can't become a P.E. teacher if you do this.

735
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,569
You lack the qualities.

736
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,039
I do better with compliments!

737
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,769
You do?

738
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,309
Do you want to try again?

739
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,948
You're doing good.

740
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,820
Good job.

741
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,518
Yes. There you go.

742
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,289
You're doing well.

743
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:38,989
You're doing...

744
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:42,690
You fell. That's a good...

745
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,760
Yes. That's a good fall.

746
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:55,569
There you go. Just keep doing like this.

747
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,840
- Like this? - Yes.

748
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:58,869
You're doing well.

749
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,340
You didn't let go of it, right?

750
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,710
Don't you dare let go of it.

751
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,349
I didn't.

752
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,280
You let go of it, didn't you?

753
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,519
You're doing great.

754
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,159
- You let go of it? - Keep your eyes on the road.

755
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:18,429
Oh, yes.

756
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,630
- Try going faster. - Okay.

757
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:31,369
Gosh, look at me.

758
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,079
This very moment.

759
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,820
The moment...

760
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,920
I shouldn't probably miss.

761
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:03,909
Be careful.

762
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,510
You made it.

763
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,250
Great job.

764
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:20,590
I want to ride it again.

765
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,089
Will you be okay? You might not be able to walk tomorrow.

766
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,130
That's why.

767
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,300
It's because I might not be able to walk tomorrow.

768
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:35,070
Hey. You should be careful at the corner.

769
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:37,309
Do you want to compete with me?

770
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,170
- When you're on a bike? - Yes.

771
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,679
You have no conscience.

772
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,480
(Chunghyang Reading Room)

773
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:57,190
Let's try to remember it. I can do it.

774
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,529
As the report card of 2009 College Scholastic Ability Test...

775
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,328
are distributed this morning,

776
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,569
there's a heated controversy...

777
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,269
over the difficulty level of the math section.

778
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,939
According to the students who received the report cards,

779
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,769
the CSAT was exceptionally difficult.

780
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,039
The math section. Hopeless.

781
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,610
Give up math quickly.

782
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,150
Focus on other subjects.

783
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,650
(Key summary)

784
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,328
Are you crazy? Why do you keep thinking about it?

785
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,860
Forget it.

786
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,570
Hey, what's the matter?

787
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,969
How about we don't study today?

788
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,210
No. Be gone.

789
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,210
Did something happen?

790
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,510
I need to change my mood.

791
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,309
What?

792
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,780
Hi, girlfriend.

793
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,689
Who do you want to look good for? Why are you buying clothes?

794
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,059
You always wear sportswear.

795
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,198
Hey, young man. Come here.

796
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,199
- Don't answer them. - Hey.

797
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,698
- Why didn't you come for so long? - Don't even make eye contact.

798
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:09,868
- Didn't you come to my store? - Keep walking straight...

799
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,929
until you find a store you like.

800
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,099
Even if you want to buy something, don't let them know it.

801
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,468
- Or they will rip you off. - Take a look.

802
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:16,510
What are you looking for?

803
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,050
- Wait. - I want to get this.

804
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:26,849
Hey, did you not hear me?

805
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,348
Both the top and the bottom?

806
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:30,089
Gosh, you're not hesitating at all.

807
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,118
It's 170 dollars, but I'll give it to you for 150 dollars.

808
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,989
Come here.

809
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,529
Sun Jae. I'll come back after looking around.

810
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,460
- Okay. - I think...

811
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,399
this is perfect for you.

812
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,269
Your boyfriend has a gig.

813
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,900
You should come, of course. Don't you think?

814
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,169
I came because Hyun Ju wanted to come today.

815
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,839
So don't ask Sol to come out...

816
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,538
before the CSAT.

817
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,039
Okay, ma'am.

818
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,010
You're playing hard to get.

819
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:57,679
What?

820
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,250
Sun Jae.

821
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,590
Are you here for the gig too?

822
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,630
Yes.

823
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,670
Darn it.

824
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,269
People might think we're dating.

825
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,480
Why don't you get changed?

826
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
Why would I?

827
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,489
What kind of confidence is this?

828
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,920
You'll be compared to me.

829
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,558
Aren't you embarrassed to say something like that?

830
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,690
Here are your drinks. Enjoy it.

831
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,960
Thank you.

832
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,570
Here.

833
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
What are you doing?

834
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Take a seat.

835
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:10,919
There are so many good-looking guys.

836
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,989
I can't be satisfied with Im Geum.

837
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,190
Hi.

838
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,730
I'm Lee Hyun Ju, Sol's friend.

839
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,589
- It's nice to meet you. - "Hyun Ju?"

840
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,359
She spoke as if she had a short tongue...

841
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,098
when she saw a good-looking guy in the past as well.

842
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,300
- Okay. - Wait.

843
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,869
Drink this. You don't like something sweet.

844
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:32,570
Thanks.

845
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,550
Where is Baek In Hyuk? Didn't you come with him?

846
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:39,849
He must be busy buying clothes.

847
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,550
Oh, right. Did you receive my gift?

848
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:44,449
(Kim Tae Seong sent you a gift.)

849
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,519
Did you take a good look?

850
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,360
A gift?

851
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,789
It's for my fan.

852
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,159
It seems he's very interested in me.

853
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,400
I refused the gift.

854
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,730
- I guess you didn't check. - Oh, my.

855
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,570
You got something on your lips.

856
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,610
It's sad to be single.

857
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,949
Do you have a girlfriend?

858
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
No.

859
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,320
I see.

860
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,960
Do you like someone then?

861
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,039
I guess you don't want to answer.

862
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,110
Okay.

863
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,920
By the way,

864
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,260
why aren't In Hyuk and Dong Seob coming?

865
00:50:58,659 --> 00:50:59,760
I know.

866
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,630
- Guys. - My goodness.

867
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,170
We're in trouble.

868
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,130
Your clothes are trouble.

869
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,038
What kind of fashion is this?

870
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,239
Are you going to be on a comedy show?

871
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:10,269
No, that's not it.

872
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:12,439
Dong Seob can't come.

873
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,479
- What? - What?

874
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,840
That mama's boy.

875
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,379
His mother isn't letting him go out,

876
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,809
saying a senior in high school shouldn't perform.

877
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,010
What do we do?

878
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,280
It's driving me crazy. What do we do?

879
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,348
Oh, right. Should I go up and sing?

880
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,960
Do you want to be humiliated on stage?

881
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,259
Just say we can't perform as our vocalist can't make it.

882
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,329
Darn it.

883
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,960
Wait.

884
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,769
Hello? Where are you?

885
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:44,269
In front of a mirror

886
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,309
I smile a little

887
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,420
Please wait

888
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:58,550
Until you meet me

889
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:01,920
- Where is Sun Jae? - Make some noise!

890
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,598
It was Black Tetra's passionate performance.

891
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,368
Let's keep going and move on to the next performance.

892
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,129
- The next performers are... - Gosh.

893
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,339
It's their turn soon. Where is he?

894
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,710
It's Eclipse.

895
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,179
What is he doing? It's Sun Jae.

896
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,869
I'm so lonely

897
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,099
I'm so lonely

898
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:53,808
After the day

899
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:57,380
When you left me

900
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:01,880
Even after countless nights

901
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,420
And sorrowful pain

902
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:10,659
I couldn't forget you

903
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,130
So I'm alone

904
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,239
I'll be there

905
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,839
You're the only one for me

906
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,979
I always live

00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,618
Dreaming about you only

908
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:37,750
What a feeling, I feel love

909
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:41,819
You know it too

910
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,328
Even after many days pass

911
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:48,429
I'll be there

912
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:54,000
And wait for you

913
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,169
I'll be there, for me

914
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:03,079
You're the only one

915

916
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,780
Your song is amazing.

917
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,550
- You're handsome. - You're a good-looking guy.

918
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:14,190
Did she leave already?

919
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:17,260
We met last time, didn't we?

920
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,099
In front of the school.

921
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:22,229
Sun Jae has an amazing voice.

922
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,500
In Hyuk was incredible too.

923
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,369
Can we talk for a moment?

924
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,439
- What? - It won't take long.

925
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,369
Why is Mr. Kim here?

926
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,769
With the revelation that the deceased suffered...

927
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,480
No.

928
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,610
Sol.

929
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,579

What is this? Were you waiting for me?

932
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,078
Why are you coming only now? Who did you meet?

933
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,518
I was with In Hyuk, thinking that you left.

934
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,050
The man who gave you his business card in front of the school.

935
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,549
You met him, didn't you?

936
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,619
How did you know?

937
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,058
What did he say? Did he say he would make you début?

938
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,090
Do you want to do it?

939
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:23,629
What are you talking about?

940
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,929
He asked for my number, but I didn't give it to him.

941
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,230
Why do you want to know?

942
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,369
It's just that there are many weird people.

943
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,809
Many of them are scammers.

944
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,440
I was worried.

945
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,779
Am I a kid?

946
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,550
Why were you worried about a useless thing like that?

947
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:52,789
Here.

948
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,590
It's the prize I received.

949
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,269
Did you sing because of this?

950
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,538
- Yes. - Why did you sing...

951
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:12,539
in front of so many people for something like this?

952
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,739
I've done nothing for you. Why would you do that?

953
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,908
I thought it'd be uncomfortable if you don't have a cell phone.

954
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,509
Why do you care?

955
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,650
You're the one who was worried about a useless thing.

956
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,750
Why?

957
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,619
- Can I not worry about you? - No, you can't.

958
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:30,590
Don't worry about other people. Don't care about them either.

959
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,530
You'll endure without telling others that you're struggling.

960
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,400
Even if you're hurt by others here and there, you'll endure it again.

961
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,069
You'll be suffering to the point where you can't even sleep,

962
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,840
then you'll let go of everything.

963
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,368
So don't do that.

964
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:44,869
What on earth are you talking about?

965
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,909
This is nothing. Why are you doing this?

966
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:48,940
I hope...

967
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,980
you're selfish.

I hope...

969
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,488
you think about how you can be happier and live a better life...

970
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:59,519
at times like this.

971
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,530
You want me to think about myself only?

972
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:07,800
Should I do that?

973
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:09,699
Yes.

974
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,039
Never mind. I should've not done this.

975
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,480
Throw this away or do whatever you want.

You're the one who was worried about a useless thing.

Why? Can I not worry about you?

982
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,179
It's all good.

986

- It's still here? - You're talking too.

987
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:55,939
I guess you came out from the commercial.

988
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,639
You're alive and moving.

Why would someone so dazzling like me?

1002
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,599
So how do you feel?

Let's talk.

1004

- She doesn't want to. - You should leave her alone.
