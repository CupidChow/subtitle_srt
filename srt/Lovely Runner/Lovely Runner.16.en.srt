1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,540
(Byeon Woo Seok)

2
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,250
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,349
(10 missed calls from CEO)

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,890
(Kim Hye Yoon)

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,859
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,399
Sol!

7
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,390
Move over, you idiot!

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Get lost!

9
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,769
I think he fainted.

10
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,439
Sun Jae!

11
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,750
Sun Jae.

12
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,780
Please come to your senses.

13
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,150
Sun Jae.

14
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,819
- Check on him. - Okay.

15
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,969
Kim Young Soo, you're arrested for attempted serial kidnapping.

16
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,569
Kim Young Soo!

17
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,240
Sun Jae.

18
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,270
Sun Jae.

19
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,169
Don't you think you should wake up?

20
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,469
Wake up.

21
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,409
I like you.

22
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I thought I would regret it...

23
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,819
if I left again without telling you how I felt.

24
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,919
I like you, Sun Jae.

25
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,499
Sol.

26
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,539
Snow will fall across the capital area until tomorrow morning.

27
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,310
Please drive in the snow safely.

28
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,979
This is the next breaking news.

29
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,649
The suspect in the Gangnam Serial Kidnapping Attempt case...

30
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,979
has just died while trying to escape during the apprehension.

31
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,818
The suspect had a previous conviction...

32
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,750
for attempted murder...

33
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,918
at Juyang Reservoir in 2008 and served 6 years...

34
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,388
- in prison. - Juyang Reservoir?

35
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,089
Being chased by the police in the heart of Seoul,

36
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,729
- Is he perhaps... - he rushed onto the road...

37
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,828
and was hit and killed on the spot by an oncoming dump truck.

38
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,898
- Kim Young Soo is dead? - The police went to...

39
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,670
- the taxi company he worked for. - Sun Jae.

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,939
- What about Sun Jae? - He ran away after seeing them.

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,139
And the police chased him after that.

42
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,579
(Sun Jae is hit by a car! The road is closed because of the accident.)

43
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,509
A car accident?

44
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,078
(Oh, my gosh, what's going on?)

45
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,420
(My poor Sun Jae)

46
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,778
- Gosh, Sun Jae is hit by a car. - Was he really hit by a car?

47
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,849
- This is horrible. - I...

48
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,349
I went to the Wooshin University Hospital emergency room...

49
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,419
and saw Ryu Sun Jae being brought in.

50
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,490
"Wooshin University Hospital?"

51
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,029
Let me get out here.

52
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,009
Sun Jae!

53
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:16,819
(Wooshin University Hospital)

54
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,399
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,160
He's not hurt.

56
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,060
What a relief.

57
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,199
Why were you running like that?

58
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
Sun Jae, now,

59
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,370
it seems everything is over.

60
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:41,709
Did you perhaps come to see me,

61
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,680
thinking that I was involved in a car accident?

62
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,209
No, I was just passing by.

63
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,850
If you didn't,

64
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,990
why are you crying?

65
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,220
I wasn't crying.

66
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,529
I'll get going.

67
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,100
Did you cry like that every day...

68
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,759
when you were alone?

69
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,129
Missing the person...

70
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,399
who forgot everything about you?

71
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,810
I was right.

72
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,050
I told you it'd be a sad ending.

73
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,850
Do you still not want to change the ending?

74
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,660
- What are you talking about? - But what do we do?

75
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,089
I think it has changed already.

76
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
Sol.

77
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:03,819
I remember everything.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What?

79
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,740
I remember everything.

80
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,439
It's impossible. How?

81
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,379
Why did you do that?

82
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,350
How could you erase yourself from my memory?

83
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,949
How could you let me live without you?

84
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,920
Did you think it would be possible?

85
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,919
Sun Jae.

86
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,379
Don't cry. Okay?

87
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:03,679
I'm sorry I'm late.

88
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,850
I'm sorry...

89
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,019
I forgot.

90
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,820
(The final episode)

91
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,029
Until when are you going to do this?

92
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:54,970
Just a little more.

93
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,899
- Do you want to stay up all night? - Yes.

94
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,299
I can stay up all night long.

95
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,179
You're not a baby. Don't act like one.

96
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,679
I don't want to spend a single moment without you from now on...

97
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,190
because it was so wasteful to live forgetting you.

98
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,960
Let's do it then.

99
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,590
Let's stay together even in our dreams.

100
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,730
I will not forget...

101
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,000
anything about you from now on.

102
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,639
Even if you try to erase my memories again,

103
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,740
I'll remember again like that no matter what it takes.

104
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,720
I'll never do that again.

105
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,029
When I think about it,

106
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,230
it seems like I never forgot you.

107
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,399
I never forgot you.

108
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,070
Sun Jae, the shooting is beginning soon.

109
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,710
Are you crying?

110
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,279
We're not filming any crying scenes today.

111
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,009
Sun Jae!

112
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,480
You cried?

113
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,590
It means my heart remembered you...

114
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,750
even if my brain forgot you.

115
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,159
This is what my grandmother said.

116
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,899
"Memories don't disappear."

117
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,860
"They're smeared into your soul."

118
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,269
Is that true?

119
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,220
It came back to its place now.

120
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,600
By the way,

121
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,668
I guess you've been putting necklaces...

122
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,399
on many women for 15 years.

123
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,599
You were fumbling last time,

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,210
but you can do it at once now.

125
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,980
I told you. I'm an expert at romance dramas.

126
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,049
I did it many times for dramas.

127
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,450
I'm dumb if I still can't put a necklace on you properly.

128
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,320
It's okay.

129
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,389
You forgot me for so many years.

130
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,559
I understand if you met someone else.

131
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,659
What are you doing? You get jealous too?

132
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,159
I said I wasn't.

133
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,699
You had so many dating rumors.

134
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,570
After doing it several times, you become good at...

135
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,070
You're doing this because you have nothing to say.

136
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,080
You said men and women...

137
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,009
can't be friends.

138
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,580
Go on.

139
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,490
I don't know. I forgot.

140
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,970
I love you.

141
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,700
I love you, Sun Jae.

142
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,888
(Wonbook, the safest city, Wonbook Police, the respected force)

143
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,159
Why the long face?

144
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,230
What are you doing in our station?

145
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,360
I came to see you, punk.

146
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,970
The case you're in charge of is the talk of the town.

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,340
Dozens of murder weapons were found in the trunk of his cab.

148
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,669
Murder was his intention.

149
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,340
I knew it.

150
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,109
When I arrested and sent him to the court in 2008,

151
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,279
I said he would recommit a crime when he was released...

152
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,919
so many times.

153
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,690
You can't reform a jerk like him.

154
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:08,950
He's evil.

155
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,460
Don't call him evil and try to make it seem like he's something special.

156
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,990
He's a social misfit and a loser. Not a monster to be afraid of.

157
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,729
You experience all sorts of things when you work...

158
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,799
as a detective for a long time.

159
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm saying this just in case.

160
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,470
It's not your fault.

161
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,399
It was his fate to die.

162
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,610
Someone who was destined to die might be alive thanks to his death.

163
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,149
That would be the case, right?

164
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,049
(Sweet Coffee)

165
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,788
Darn it.

166
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,559
(One month later)

167
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,298
(She lost something precious...)

168
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,340
(in return for changing a lot of things.)

169
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,809
When are you finished?

170
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,250
I don't know.

171
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,148
I don't think I'll be able to finish it today.

172
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,149
What?

173
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,589
(My Destiny)

174
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,590
Does it mean we can't meet today either?

175
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,659
Gosh.

176
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,759
(Does it mean we can't meet today either?)

177
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,929
I should send it by tomorrow. I'm busy.

178
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,870
I'll contact you when I'm done.

179
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,340
See you tomorrow.

180
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,169
I miss you too, Sun Jae,

181
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,139
but I have no choice.

182
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,080
He won't be upset, right?

183
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,259
- Isn't he Sun Jae? - Sun Jae?

184
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,059
- It's Sun Jae. - Hey, it's Sun Jae.

185
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,159
- Oh, my gosh. - It's really him.

186
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,470
- It's Sun Jae. - He's here.

187
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,870
He winked at me.

188
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,279
He has a small face.

189
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,649
I came because I wanted to see you.

190
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,279
He must be crazy.

191
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
I'd like to order.

192
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,940
I didn't order this.

193
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,309
- Sun Jae... - Sorry?

194
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,870
I told him not to make it obvious.

195
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,940
Paid for this for everyone.

196
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Pardon?

197
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,950
Sun Jae is so sweet to his fans.

198
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,379
Take a picture of this for proof.

199
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,529
Are you really going to do this?

200
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,729
I thought you might need some sugar.

201
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,730
Eat while you're working.

202
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,930
Do you think I can work?

203
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,710
Do you want to play with me instead of working then?

204
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,279
He's killing me.

205
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,089
How can I work?

206
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,639
- Sun Jae. - Thank you.

207
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,170
- Me too. - Sun Jae, please.

208
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,639
- I love you. - It was so delicious.

209
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,910
I love you.

210
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,420
(Sweet Coffee)

211
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,858
Why did you come all the way here?

212
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,289
You won't meet me because you're busy.

213
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,759
So I had to come and see you.

214
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,858
What if someone recognizes you?

215
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,569
I covered my face completely. Who will recognize me?

216
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,900
Be quiet. Go back to your work.

217
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,240
I'll be reading a book quietly.

218
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,589
You said you would be quiet.

219
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,829
By the way, doing this feels like...

220
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,599
when we were in college.

221
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
What?

222
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:51,769
That's true, though.

223
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:54,769
Having a secret relationship isn't so bad, is it?

224
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,470
Do you think this is a set?

225
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,509
If you want to have a secret relationship,

226
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,210
would you please go outside?

227
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,450
Mr. Ryu Sun Jae.

228
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,089
He's not Ryu Sun Jae.

229
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,890
He's my older brother.

230
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,220
I'm Im Sol, and he's Im Geum.

231
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,559
Many people say my brother and Ryu Sun Jae look alike.

232
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,029
Brother, let's go.

233
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,609
Put the book back, brother.

234
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,019
Here. Let me carry it for you.

235
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,589
Where should I work now?

236
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,559
I can't work because of my cute nephew and niece.

237
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,659
Take your time when you write it.

238
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,490
I'm going to say I want to take a break this year...

239
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,429
and film the movie next year.

240
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,700
That's impossible.

241
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,140
I promised to submit the script by tomorrow.

242
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,809
Someone might see you again. You should go right now.

243
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,180
Do you want to go to a quiet place...

244
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,450
where you can focus with your brother then?

245
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,750
What?

246
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:14,819
Where?

247
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,329
What? The place where I can focus on my work...

248
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,298
is your house?

249
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,900
Of course. There's no place that is quieter than my house.

250
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,609
I knew it.

251
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,269
He wants to stick with me whenever he can.

252
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,180
Aren't you coming?

253
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,579
Why is he in a rush?

254
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,819
He's ridiculous.

255
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,419
Attention!

256
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,729
Actor Im Geum's debut drama...

257
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,299
is starting soon!

258
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,499
Are you overreacting again...

259
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,268
about being an extra?

260
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,568
I know.

261
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:08,508
His senior said he would cast him in a legal drama, but it's canceled.

262
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,469
- Is it? - This time,

263
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,440
there's nothing to be ashamed of. I had an audition and was cast.

264
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,140
I played the role of the lead's husband,

265
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,849
the son of a rich family.

266
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,549
Oh, my. Are you serious?

267
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,250
You're the husband of the lead of the daily drama?

268
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,689
My honey, how come you played such a big role?

269
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,759
All right. Check it with your eyes.

270
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,959
- It's starting. - Let's watch.

271
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
("While My Husband Is Sleeping")

272
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,430
("While My Husband Is Sleeping")

273
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,470
- It's him. - What?

274
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,940
It's him.

275
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,769
That guy over there? The one who is lying on the bed?

276
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,079
You're right. He's my son.

277
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,880
You're right.

278
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,380
This is wonderful, honey.

279
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,180
It was worth having the dream of becoming an actor for over a decade.

280
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,849
I told you.

281
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,549
I said I would make it one day.

282
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:00,219
I know. This is why you should live long.

283
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,029
I can't believe I'm watching my son starring in a drama.

284
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,660
Be quiet. Let me watch the show.

285
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,900
("While My Husband Is Sleeping")

286
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,609
Can we do this?

287
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:19,839
Don't worry.

288
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,079
My husband will be sleeping for the rest of his life.

289
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,618
How dare you meet someone else...

290
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,720
when my son is alive?

291
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,390
You should admit it.

292
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,700
Look. My husband, your son,

293
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,670
is no better than a dead person.

294
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,200
You evil witch!

295
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,970
She's horrible.

296
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,670
- What? - Gosh.

297
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,608
That's it?

298
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,740
You didn't wake up even once.

299
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,848
Being wrapped up in bandages like that,

300
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,318
I can't tell if it's you or someone else.

301
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,150
- When are you taking them off? - I'm not.

302
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,990
I'll be lying like that until I die in the last episode.

303
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,558
Look at the title. "While My Husband Is Sleeping."

304
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,919
The drama ends when the husband wakes up.

305
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,059
- What? - Why?

306
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,460
Why?

307
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,639
Right.

308
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,598
It's your very first drama in your life.

309
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,308
That's quite amazing.

310
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,338
Right?

311
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,139
This is the beginning. If he works hard,

312
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,179
- he'll have another opportunity. - Yes.

313
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,278
But honey, how could you make it look so real...

314
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,979
when you were lying like a corpse?

315
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,118
I was acting like I was in a deep sleep...

316
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,119
until I was splashed with water.

317
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,490
Then I tried to make it look like I was in REM sleep.

318
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,758
Did you notice the subtle change?

319
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,129
Of course, I did.

320
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,659
I saw your eyelids twitching...

321
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,700
- slightly. - That's what I'm saying.

322
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,399
You looked amazing on TV.

323
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,470
Your nose looked good even when you were wrapped in bandages.

324
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Really?

325
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,209
No wonder why the director said...

326
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,739
he liked my look the most.

327
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,079
Really?

328
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,480
Gosh, you guys are a perfect match.

329
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,359
What's going on?

330
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,200
I thought he might bother me so much as he took me home.

331
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,730
Why is he doing nothing?

332
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,640
I knew it.

333
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,210
Should I play with him even for a moment?

334
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:50,759
Eat while you're working. I won't bother you.

335
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,930
Hurry up and go back to your work.

336
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:00,269
What?

337
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,240
He really wants me to work.

338
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,309
(This is the first draft of "The Time of Walking Memories.")

339
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:16,690
What? Where did he go?

340
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,230
Oh, my gosh, I'm done!

341
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,769
Yes! It's finally over!

342
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,839
What's going on?

343
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,859
Sun Jae.

344
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:03,829
Why? Are you finished?

345
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,069
What?

346
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,839
- Yes. - See?

347
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,910
You could finish it today because you were focused.

348
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,269
You're right. I thought I had to stay up all night.

349
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,119
I knew it.

350
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,220
It's finally happening.

351
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,329
I guess you liked the bread.

352
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,539
Let's go. I'll drop you off.

353
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,740
"Let's go?"

354
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,279
Already?

355
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,089
Why does he act like that suddenly after clinging to me all day?

356
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,220
Did you get all your stuff?

357
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:05,059
Let's go. It's late.

358
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,970
"It's late," my foot. It's only 11pm.

359
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,269
Does he think we're 19-year-olds?

360
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,970
Gosh. My goodness.

361
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,210
Everything fell out.

362
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,279
Right. My car key.

363
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,779
Put back your stuff. I'll be back.

364
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:39,299
He intends to drop me off even when the world ends.

365
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,299
I'm done with my work, though.

366
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,769
I can stay longer.

367
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,539
How about leaving tomorrow after sleeping here tonight?

368
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,809
- What? - Sleep here tonight...

369
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,079
and leave tomorrow.

370
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,509
I knew it.

371
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,720
Okay. If you insist.

372
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,390
I'll spend the night here.

373
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,588
Hey. What do you mean...

374
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,890
you'll come here tomorrow after getting some sleep?

375
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,430
Everyone's here.

376
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,829
Come at once.

377
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,098
Well... I...

378
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,500
There was a misunderstanding.

379
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,539
I'll just grab a cab.

380
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,420
Where are you going?

381
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,480
I said you'd spend the night here.

382
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,489
Well... I thought...

383
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,189
you were talking to me.

384
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,389
If I was talking to you,

385
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,460
were you going to stay here tonight?

386
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,660
What I meant by that was...

387
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:43,960
Right.

388
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,359
Since we couldn't go on a date because I've been busy,

389
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,329
we could have something delicious, watch a movie,

390
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,699
and have some fun.

391
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,769
And then?

392
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
After that, we can...

393
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,140
Right. Yes.

394
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,940
We can catch up on the variety shows we missed.

395
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,539
We can talk a little too.

396
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,749
And then?

397
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,349
And then it must be late.

398
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,650
Instead of going home that late,

399
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,519
I'd get a good night's sleep here. That was what I meant.

400
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:12,789
So, that means...

401
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,258
you'll sleep here tonight.

402
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,630
What I said "sleep," it means...

403
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,529
Okay.

404
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,859
Do everything you want to do.

405
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,729
Eat something delicious, watch the movie,

406
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,470
catch up on the variety shows, and what was it?

407
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,039
- Talk? - Yes. We talk.

408
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,269
Sure. Let's do them all.

409
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,369
- But... - What?

410
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:30,670
First things first.

411
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,779
Sun Jae.

412
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,230
I love you too.

413
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Are you up?

414
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,769
No, I'm still sleeping.

415
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:41,339
Come on. You're already up.

416
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,970
You said you'd go tomorrow. Go back to sleep.

417
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,509
Tomorrow has come already.

418
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,220
Not before we open our eyes.

419
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,289
I know you're using a shallow trick...

420
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,049
to stay like this for longer.

421
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,518
Stop it. I'm up.

422
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,258
I surrender. It tickles.

423
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,589
I surrender.

424
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,980
Why are you staring at me like that?

425
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,380
Do I have something in my eyes?

426
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,950
Yes.

427
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,859
What?

428
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,529
I was kidding.

429
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,730
You're unbelievable.

430
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,339
I stared at you because you were pretty.

431
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,849
It doesn't feel real.

432
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,750
Can it be...

433
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:04,490
a dream?

434
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,789
I feel the same.

435
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,359
Sometimes, it scares me.

436
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,099
That...

437
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,230
you'll leave for another timeline again.

438
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,970
That...

439
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,970
I'll...

440
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:20,599
forget about you again.

441
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,950
That won't happen again.

442
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,548
Are you sure?

443
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,589
I'm sure.

444
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,420
I can't go back even if I wanted to.

445
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,660
I don't have the watch anymore.

446
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
That's right.

447
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:43,960
By the way, where's that electronic watch?

448
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,190
I don't know.

449
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,029
I think I lost it a long time ago. I don't know where it is.

450
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,670
It's abandoned somewhere,

451
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,269
or someone must have picked it up.

452
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,769
Gosh. It's a shame when I think I bought it for 3,000 dollars.

453
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,269
I should have picked it up.

454
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,609
You don't need it anymore anyway.

455
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,839
We'll be glued together like this.

456
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,250
- I'll be glued to you all right. - Yes.

457
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,519
But don't we really have to get up now?

458
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,820
No. Just five more minutes.

459
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,719
No. Ten more minutes.

460
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,460
No. Thirty more minutes.

461
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,749
Mom.

462
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,150
Why are you standing over there? Let's go.

463
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:40,679
Okay.

464
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,349
Wait for me, sister.

465
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,940
I'm going to take a shower. Get out.

466
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,610
Okay.

467
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Should we shower together?

468
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,550
Get out!

469
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,219
- Get out. - I get scared when I'm alone.

470
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,590
- Okay? - Okay.

471
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,059
Sun Jae, I'll get going.

472
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,260
Without having breakfast?

473
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,158
Ms. Lee wants to see me in the morning,

474
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,558
so I have to go now. I'm sorry. Bye.

475
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,630
Hold on.

476
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,739
- Here. Eat this on your way. - Okay.

477
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,369
I said I can drop you off.

478
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,639
The neighbors will find out again if we go out together.

479
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,139
- Bye. - Wait.

480
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,578
What is it?

481
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:44,610
You're not going to keep it on, are you?

482
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,280
You're right.

483
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,090
I'm really going this time.

484
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,119
Wait.

485
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,150
What?

486
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,590
Didn't you forget something?

487
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,489
You good?

488
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,259
By the way,

489
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
we look like newlyweds, don't we?

490
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:03,969
I'll get going.

491
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,170
Bye.

492
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,440
"Newlyweds?"

493
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,750
What? I can't tell how she looks.

494
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,119
"A date in the library?"

495
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,750
She must be a right-minded, smart woman.

496
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,359
If he took her home,

497
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,230
Sun Jae must be madly in love with her.

498
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't know who she is,

499
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,440
but her beauty pierces through the screen...

500
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,469
though she was blurred out.

501
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,539
I can see why Sun Jae is crazy about her.

502
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,949
I was told he never even fell for the beautiful women of the century.

503
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,289
I can tell she's not pretty just by looking at her silhouette.

504
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,889
Goodness. He has a bad taste in women.

505
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,929
Did he go crazy over an odd woman?

506
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,469
Sun Jae, until when do we have to do this?

507
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,039
My fingers are falling asleep.

508
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:19,280
It's because nothing fits perfectly with my Sol's image.

509
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,150
What on earth is your Sol's image?

510
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,780
Look.

511
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,260
You might be blinded by her glow.

512
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,659
Watch your eyes.

513
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,059
Here we go.

514
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,829
What? Hey.

515
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,500
Your girlfriend looks familiar to me.

516
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:48,570
It feels like I saw her before.

517
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,469
How could you meet someone as shiny as her?

518
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,539
Let me see.

519
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,440
How dare you? Don't touch her.

520
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,019
This one is nice.

521
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,319
- I'll get this one. - Okay.

522
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,590
Please wait a second.

523
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,090
But Sun Jae.

524
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,089
About the gift for your girlfriend,

525
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,690
I don't care what you buy for her.

526
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,399
The rumor about you seeing someone was published today.

527
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,329
So, you can't be doing this right now.

528
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,369
Do you want them to start a rumor that you're about to get married?

529
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,439
- What if it won't be a rumor? - Right.

530
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,499
What?

531
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
What do you mean?

532
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,969
Are you really planning to announce that you're going to get married?

533
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,638
Does Mr. Kim know about this?

534
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,739
He'll know about it...

535
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:28,280
- when you tell him. - Right.

536
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,880
Are you serious?

537
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,089
Are you really going to get married?

538
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,848
I don't want to stay away from Sol even for a moment.

539
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:39,959
That's what you think.

540
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,018
Dating is one thing, but marriage is another thing.

541
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,829
I know that. I'm not an idiot.

542
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,030
That's why I'm going to propose to her properly.

543
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,929
Do you think everything will go well once you proposed?

544
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,329
Did you get the families' approval?

545
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,869
No.

546
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,570
For goodness' sake.

547
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,309
Hey.

548
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,280
How are you going to live without me?

549
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,449
Have you gotten married before?

550
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,150
You haven't even done it yourself.

551
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,690
- Yes, Sol. - Where are you?

552
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,960
Me? I'm here for the...

553
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,789
Recording! At the recording studio.

554
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,699
In Hyuk's studio.

555
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,530
I'm here to help with In Hyuk's recording.

556
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,030
Can you hear it?

557
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,469
I'm running to you

558
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,179
- You are... - I need to see you right now.

559
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,549
(Ryu Sun Jae on a Library-Home Date with a Mysterious Woman)

560
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,050
What are we going to do?

561
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,679
Gosh. They should have touched up the photo more nicely.

562
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,380
They just blurred everything out.

563
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,860
- Does the touch-up matter now? - No one will know it's you.

564
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,718
They covered your pretty face.

565
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,760
That's not important right now.

566
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,359
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

567
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,869
How are you going to take care of it?

568
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,238
- Of course, I'll... - Do you know...

569
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,800
what's the most important part of proposing?

570
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Keeping the secret.

571
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:04,670
Once she finds out you are about to propose,

572
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,309
the moment is ruined.

573
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,808
So, before you propose to her,

574
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,780
keep your mouth tightly shut even though you don't want to.

575
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,010
Keep this in mind.

576
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,820
Keep it a secret.

577
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,820
Well, I'll try this and that.

578
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,719
I'll make sure you won't take a hit.

579
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,889
It's not about me.

580
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,099
I'm worried this will be bad for you.

581
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:28,059
Did you rush here because you were worried about me?

582
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,670
Yes.

583
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,300
Gosh. Should I make you worry from time to time?

584
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,570
Forget it. We might get photographed again.

585
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Go now.

586
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,920
Don't get out.

587
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,829
You're going home now?

588
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,730
What? Tae Seong!

589
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,599
What brought you to my place?

590
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,510
I heard Jae A's first birthday party is tomorrow.

591
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,238
I just dropped off his gift.

592
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:14,409
I see. I bet the kids were thrilled to see you after a while.

593
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,550
Why do you care about your friend's nephew's first birthday?

594
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,619
I'm friends with Sol's sister-in-law too.

595
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,989
I took care of my friend's son's birthday.

596
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,018
Gosh.

597
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,130
What are you doing here, Mr. Ryu?

598
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,400
What a coincidence!

599
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,599
I can tell that you're acting.

600
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,670
The article about the dating rumors was on the news this morning.

601
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,368
- It was you, wasn't it? - How did you know?

602
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,170
How come I found out about my friend's boyfriend on the news?

603
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,380
Aren't you going to introduce him to me?

604
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,579
What kind of a top-star dates in public like this,

605
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,150
spreading the rumors all over the neighborhood?

606
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,988
Don't tell me you're jealous.

607
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:00,059
I'm worried.

608
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,058
I'm not saying this because you worry me,

609
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,190
so don't get me wrong.

610
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,400
You're just...

611
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,868
her ex-boyfriend who briefly passed her by. Got it?

612
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:10,869
What?

613
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,699
I don't want you to cling to her...

614
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,969
after dating her for a mere two weeks a long, long time ago.

615
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,170
Ex-boyfriend.

616
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,880
Current boyfriend.

617
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,510
Current boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend.

618
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Okay?

619
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,949
What are you talking about?

620
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,848
I've never dated Sol.

621
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,550
You've never dated Sol?

622
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,320
Did she say I dated her?

623
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,590
What?

624
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,159
Right.

625
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,230
What is it?

626
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,469
Are you losing it?

627
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:51,908
Why are you laughing?

628
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:53,539
No. It's nothing.

629
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,809
I'm glad that was changed.

630
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,250
I'm so relieved!

631
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,690
What did you talk about that made you laugh like that?

632
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,928
- Come and sit. - Yes.

633
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:11,989
I have no idea.

634
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,429
Is your boyfriend crazy?

635
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,630
What?

636
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,468
I told you to put this on. Why did you take it off?

637
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:22,539
It's okay. Everyone in Korea knows that I'm seeing someone.

638
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:23,969
Still.

639
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,479
There's no one here.

640
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,679
No one's watching.

641
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,210
Gosh.

642
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,650
Here.

643
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,780
Let me pour you a drink.

644
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,619
How long have you been seeing each other?

645
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,260
- It's been 15 years. - It hasn't been long.

646
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,719
What?

647
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,530
Actually, we've known each other for a long time.

648
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,070
He used to live right across from my house.

649
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:51,969
Is that so?

650
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,670
Then...

651
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:57,269
the one you can't forget until you die.

652
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:01,309
Is it him?

653
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,219
- Yes. - I thought so.

654
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,949
When she got drunk,

655
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,320
she called your name desperately.

656
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,699
Be good to my Sol.

657
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,000
She's a friend I deeply care about.

658
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,400
By the way,

659
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,400
when are you going to stop calling her "My Sol?"

660
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,039
I thought so the last time too,

661
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,480
but Mr. Ryu tends to be very jealous.

662
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:35,880
I get more than jealous.

663
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,610
Be more sensitive from now on.

664
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,949
By the way, we've never drunken like this before, right?

665
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:49,459
Don't go

666
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,559
I wish it was me

667
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,760
No way.

668
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,460
We didn't even know each other before.

669
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,230
That's true.

670
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,139
Do you drink well?

671
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,078
Tell me in advance if you can't handle it.

672
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,308
I don't drink makgeolli because my body can't handle it.

673
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,780
Other than that, I drink it very well.

674
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:14,920
I've never gotten tipsy.

675
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:17,019
Why?

676
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,888
Does the detective get surprisingly drunk?

677
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:20,889
No way.

678
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,329
Then...

679
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,730
should we drink with this?

680
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,179
Is he terribly drunk?

681
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,650
- Will you take him already? - Okay.

682
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,988
Sun Jae. Come on. Let's go.

683
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:52,419
- I'm sorry. - Bye.

684
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,189
Sun Jae. Let's hurry. You're so tall.

685
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,260
Let go of me.

686
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:56,929
Hey, Kim Tae Seong!

687
00:45:58,329 --> 00:45:59,460
"Hey, Kim Tae Seong?"

688
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,739
Excuse me, Mr. Ryu.

689
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,769
You can't do this right here.

690
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:15,610
Thank you.

691
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:27,860
Thank you...

692
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,889
for catching the perp,

693
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,159
Kim Young Soo.

694
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,730
Well, it's my job, so you don't have to thank me.

695
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,369
Sol said the same thing too. What's with you two?

696
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:41,940
You put an end...

697
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:44,070
to the ill-fated relations.

698
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,780
I sincerely...

699
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:51,349
want to thank you.

700
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,488
- Oh, no. - Sun Jae.

701
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:01,760
I'm sorry.

702
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,130
Let's hurry.

703
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,829
Why are you so tall?

704
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:07,699
Hey. Don't let your boyfriend drink.

705
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,500
Okay. I'll get going. Thanks.

706
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:13,400
Yes. Goodbye.

707
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,219
Gosh. You haven't changed all these years.

708
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,230
You can't even drink that much.

709
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,030
I'm not drunk.

710
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,730
If you're not drunk, get up.

711
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,840
Let's say that I'm drunk, then.

712
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:48,900
Gosh. I'm tipsy.

713
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,070
For goodness' sake.

714
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:56,510
So, your nephew's first birthday party is tomorrow.

715
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,679
Why didn't you tell me?

716
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,349
Didn't I tell you?

717
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,789
Even if I told you, so what?

718
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,820
Do you think everything will go well once you propose?

719
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,760
Did you get the families' approval?

720
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:11,959
I should be there.

721
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,158
It's not even a party.

722
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,960
My family will just get together and eat.

723
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,429
In that case, I have to be there.

724
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,329
What?

725
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,799
- Let's go. We're here. - Let's go.

726
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,569
- Gosh. What is it? - Get out now.

727
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,669
What is that?

728
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,139
Let's take a look.

729
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,809
Okay. Come here.

730
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,480
Come on. Why are you wearing sunglasses?

731
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:36,689
Gosh. You're totally overreacting by wearing the sunglasses.

732
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,488
You were in bed, wrapped in a bandage.

733
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,789
No one would recognize you.

734
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,760
Some old women with keen eyes did recognize me.

735
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,089
Is this where we're holding his first birthday party?

736
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,759
You said it was a galbi restaurant in Seowol-dong.

737
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,198
It's Seowol-dong, isn't it?

738
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:49,499
Hey, Geum.

739
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,098
Of all places, why did you book this place?

740
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,570
You said the owner lived across from our house back then.

741
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,469
He'll treat us better if we used to be neighbors, right?

742
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,109
Darn it.

743
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,569
Your family is on their way, right?

744
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,179
They'll be a little late because of the traffic.

745
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,078
- Let's go. - Let's go.

746
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:04,879
- Come on. - Let's go.

747
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,078
Let's go and have...

748
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,279
- your first birthday party. - Let's go.

749
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,280
Go.

750
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,750
I'm in Seowol-dong. Which restaurant is it?

751
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,090
Don't come here.

752
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:14,788
What? Why not all of a sudden?

753
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:16,530
Just don't come here when I told you not to.

754
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,929
I'll let you meet my family some other time. Okay?

755
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,030
Gosh.

756
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,268
Everything is ready, right?

757
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:27,969
The silk thread, the stethoscope...

758
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,199
Why is water dropwort here?

759
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,368
For them to grow healthy and well,

760
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,139
they put it on the table for the first birthday.

761
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,408
- This is the judge's gavel. - They're here.

762
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,879
- Hello. - They are here.

763
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,948
- Gosh. Welcome. - Hello.

764
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:40,849
We've just finished setting up the table.

765
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,618
The ones hosting the first birthday of their baby is...

766
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:46,690
Hello.

767
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,618
Don't you remember me?

768
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,030
I'm Im Geum from Gold Videos across from your house.

769
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,630
I vaguely remember you.

770
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,400
Yes. Thanks for coming here on your happy day.

771
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:00,198
Please check if anything is missing from the table.

772
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,199
Okay.

773
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:02,400
Thank you.

774
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,670
- Let's take a look. - Gosh.

775
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,808
Now that you're dressed up like this, you're so...

776
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:10,449
So...

777
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,250
Forget it.

778
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,618
I know I look good in hanbok.

779
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,049
Thank you.

780
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,150
Sure.

781
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,489
Gosh.

782
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,360
She must be your sweet, drop-dead gorgeous daughter.

783
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,289
- Hello. - Yes.

784
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,429
I might have seen you back then,

785
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:31,899
but it strangely feels like I saw you yesterday.

786
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,929
Right?

787
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,299
Because she looks so nice,

788
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,169
many people say that.

789
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:41,109
Now that you see her in person, it's a shame you missed her, right?

790
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,980
"It's a shame," my foot.

791
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,380
Did you read the articles on my son's date?

792
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,789
I'm about to have a beautiful daughter-in-law.

793
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,389
Well, my daughter's boyfriend...

794
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:55,919
is coming here too.

795
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,159
He wants to come to our family's occasion.

796
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,399
That means she'll also get married soon.

797
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,170
- No, I won't, Mom. - What?

798
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,000
I see.

799
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,538
It seems our kids found their partners.

800
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:10,808
You're right.

801
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,739
- Excuse me, then. - Okay.

802
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,340
My husband!

803
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,519
My son!

804
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,629
What's going on?

805
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,690
Are you here to see me?

806
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,799
My goodness.

807
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,499
What brings you here?

808
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,839
Oh, my.

809
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,699
You know, about the other night...

810
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,110
I'm so sorry. But thank you for bringing my mother home.

811
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,840
How silly of me for not recognizing such a famous actor.

812
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,579
Oh, my. I'm a huge fan.

813
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,610
My goodness. Ryu Sun Jae? The famous actor?

814
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,619
- It's Ryu Sun Jae! - Hey.

815
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,119
- I saw him on TV. - Okay.

816
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,989
What took you so long?

817
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,218
- Wait. Ma'am. - Gosh.

818
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,488
Ma'am, you can't just hug him...

819
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:04,959
- like that without his consent. - Mom.

820
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,659
- Mom, come here. - Okay.

821
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,359
I'll make sure you guys get autographs later.

822
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,399
Please go ahead...

823
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,769
- and start your birthday party. - Okay.

824
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,969
Gosh. Let's go.

825
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:13,900
Here.

826
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,199
What? For me?

827
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,440
Hello, Mother.

828
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,079
What?

829
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,510
- What? - What?

830
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,079
- "Mother?" - "Mother?"

831
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,388
Gosh. I told you not to come. Why did you show up?

832
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:33,049
You surprised everyone here.

833
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,989
Why? It's nice. Your family and my family get to meet this way.

834
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,590
But still.

835
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,229
Then the mysterious girl...

836
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,530
in this picture is my daughter, Sol?

837
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,800
Yes.

838
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,839
Gosh, Mom. This is Sol.

839
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,500
- How pretty. - That's Sol.

840
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,879
Oh, my. This is too bad, sir.

841
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,940
Your son is completely...

842
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,409
head over heels for my daughter.

843
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,949
I guess so.

844
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,989
Then when did you two start dating?

845
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:08,019
I had a huge crush on her...

846
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,690
since high school.

847
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:11,860
What?

848
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,299
You guys have been dating since then?

849
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,400
I don't remember you telling me about him.

850
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,229
Don't tell me...

851
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,230
this was one-sided love!

852
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:19,099
I can't believe this!

853
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,269
Back then, I was so nervous that I couldn't even talk to her.

854
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,709
As you know, Sol is so stunning.

855
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,039
Come on.

856
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,010
You look pretty especially today.

857
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,779
- He's already blinded by love. - By the way,

858
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,920
because both of our families are sitting together like this,

859
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:37,888
it feels like we're here to discuss their wedding.

860
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:38,989
Right?

861
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,888
Why don't we just talk about their wedding since we're at it?

862
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:45,989
I'm all for it!

863
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,468
Oh, my. That love-blinded fool.

864
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:52,868
We're going to begin...

865
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:53,869
- What could they be doing... - the doljabi...

866
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,000
- to have this much fun? - for the baby prince.

867
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,339
All right. Take a close look at these items.

868
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,368
A gavel, a stethoscope,

869
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,879
a soccer ball, a microphone,

870
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,280
a pencil, a book, and a ball of thread.

871
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,178
We're missing one item here.

872
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,448
- Yes. - What could that be?

873
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:07,519
- Me! - Cash!

874
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,218
That's right! Cash is missing here.

875
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:12,349
Is there anyone who would like to be the first person...

876
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,159
to give Prince Jae A an allowance?

877
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,090
- Over here! I got 50 dollars! - Me!

878
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:18,659
- Hold on! - Over here.

879
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh, my. He took out a check!

880
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,570
Goodness. That's 1,000 dollars!

881
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,199
- He took out a 1,000-dollar check. - A 1,000-dollar check?

882
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,439
- That's crazy. - Give a round of applause...

883
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,909
to his future uncle-in-law.

884
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:35,939
I knew it. He's indeed a generous man.

885
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,110
"Future uncle-in-law?"

886
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,578
- He's already part of her family. - Let's see.

887
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:43,149
We will begin the doljabi in earnest.

888
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,650
All right. Let's begin with a big round of applause!

889
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,558
All right. Let's see which one Jae A will choose.

890
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,260
Okay. Will he choose the microphone?

891
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,659
Let's see.

892
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:59,129
- He got the cash! - Prince Jae A chose...

893
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,500
the check as expected.

894
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,768
Next, we will play a quiz.

895
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:05,869
Please actively participate in the quiz.

896
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,380
Great. Let's start right away.

897
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,550
Here's the first question.

898
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,678
How much did Prince Jae A weigh...

899
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,320
when he was born?

900
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,690
- It's 3.4kg! - I got it!

901
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:17,949
- It's 2.8kg! - Wrong!

902
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:19,019
It's 3.5kg!

903
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,859
- I got it! - Yes. Mr. Future Uncle-in-Law.

904
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,889
It's 3.48kg.

905
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,019
Correct!

906
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,759
How did I get this right?

907
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,860
I'll give a box of bay salt to his future uncle-in-law.

908
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,070
Gosh.

909
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:33,539
He's having a blast.

910
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,969
- Great. - Yes, bay salt!

911
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,739
Thank you.

912
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:42,209
I can see why my son is head over heels for that girl.

913
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,808
Here's the second question.

914
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:45,649
- He has high standards for women... - What's the animal...

915
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,179
- because he's just like me. - in his conception dream?

916
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,320
- Sir. - Gosh, you startled me.

917
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,920
- I guess you like... - Number one, dragon.

918
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:53,119
- your son's girlfriend. - Number two, tiger.

919
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,319
I thought no one could be good enough for your boy.

920
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,829
- Number four, eagle. - This is better than living alone.

921
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:00,799
- Whoever gets it right first... - It's been a long time since...

922
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,428
will get the gift card!

923
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:04,099
- I last saw him smile that big. - Yes, you.

924
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:05,500
Number two, tiger?

925
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,369
- That's wrong! - Let's go.

926
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,269
Number 3? What was number 3?

927
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,420
Gosh. What are you guys doing here?

928
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:25,749
Are you here to have a meal?

929
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,789
No.

930
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:28,618
We're here...

931
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:29,659
to perform.

932
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,230
Perfume?

933
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,900
Why did you bring perfume to a barbecue restaurant?

934
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,900
Perform at Sol's nephew's first birthday party.

935
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,630
Has he really gone mad?

936
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,070
Hey, just ignore that.

937
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,940
Performing at birthday parties is beneath us now.

938
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,409
I'll renovate your studio if you perform at the party.

939
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:47,579
Hey.

940
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,249
He said he'd renovate our studio if we performed.

941
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,908
I'll get you brand-new instruments...

942
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:52,980
- and equipment. - No way.

943
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,750
He'll get us brand-new instruments and equipment too.

944
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,719
Where is this birthday party...

945
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,650
taking place?

946
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,089
Only the performance to celebrate his birthday remains now.

947
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,090
Hold on.

948
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,130
They will perform here?

949
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,759
This is amazing.

950
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,260
They came to wish Prince Jae A a happy birthday.

951
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,429
Here's Eclipse! Give them a big round of applause.

952
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,320
Four, two, nine.

953
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:28,619
Start.

954
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:39,860
Happy birthday, dear our handsome prince

955
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:44,469
Happy birthday, dear our beautiful prince

956
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:49,639
Everyone is wishing you a happy birthday

957
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:54,280
Thank you so much for coming to us

958
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,420
Getting Eclipse to perform at the party was too much.

959
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,719
Their concert ticket is so expensive.

960
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,719
How could you make them sing with the karaoke machine?

961
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,690
I wanted to win some brownie points.

962
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,559
So did you?

963
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:14,730
Whenever I saw you on TV, I always felt this bond with you.

964
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,500
I guess it was because we were going to be a family.

965
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,399
Mom, come on.

966
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,869
- What? - Gosh.

967
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,670
I haven't done much for my sister.

968
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,069
But I will say this...

969
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,579
on behalf of my father who must be watching over us.

970
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:30,679
I will be watching you very closely.

971
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:33,750
If you make my sister cry, I'm going to...

972
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,919
You're taking this too far.

973
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,989
Understood?

974
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,489
Yes, don't worry.

975
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,789
I heard that you just started an acting career.

976
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,590
Hopefully, we'll get a chance to work together.

977
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:49,030
Brother, I had always been a fan.

978
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,900
Let's work together next time. Okay?

979
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,070
Yes.

980
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:53,699
Promise me.

981
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:56,539
He even promised me.

982
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,309
Hey, Jae A is crying. Let's go.

983
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:02,709
- Okay. Gosh. - Let's hurry.

984
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,078
- Bye. - Goodnight.

985
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,178
- Wait. - Let's go.

986
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,250
Can I get your number at least?

987
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,920
Ma'am.

988
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,090
You can now have a long life with her.

989
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,159
Be happy together.

990
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,639
With a lot of smiles.

991
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,250
Thank you.

992
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,099
Probably?

993
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,380
By the way, why did you suddenly want to get on the ferry?

994
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,578
Just because.

995
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,989
We have a lot of memories on the Han River.

996
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,820
That's true.

997
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,099
It's time.

998
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,800
Well, Sol.

999
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,139
I want to...

1000
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:39,209
"Propose..."

1001
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,780
- Strike a pose there. - Propose?

1002
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,610
- What? - What?

1003
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:45,510
A pose...

1004
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,719
A pose?

1005
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,320
Which pose?

1006
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,690
A heart?

1007
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,889
Yes.

1008
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,768
Is it because it's night?

1009
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:04,928
- Are you that dumb? - It didn't come out well.

1010
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,329
Are you an idiot?

1011
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,139
Why are you laughing?

1012
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,420
By the way,

1013
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,260
you're not planning to propose here, right?

1014
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:28,719
What?

1015
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,989
Do you know what's the most important part of proposing?

1016
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,159
Keeping the secret.

1017
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,029
- No. - Come on.

1018
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,698
Just like in the dramas, did you rent out the entire ferry...

1019
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:40,968
and order fireworks?

1020
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,399
Did you ask Dong Seok to push out the three-tier cake...

1021
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,170
and In Hyuk to throw flower petals? Are you sure this isn't that?

1022
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,380
Dong Seok, come on out.

1023
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,178
In Hyuk! Come on out!

1024
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:51,209
Dong Seok!

1025
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,780
- In Hyuk! - In Hyuk! Come out!

1026
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,679
In Hyuk!

1027
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,380
By the way,

1028
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,118
you really got it wrong. I feel bad now.

1029
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,888
Gosh. I was joking.

1030
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,090
Don't look so flustered.

1031
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,420
Were you joking?

1032
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,230
That was funny.

1033
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,800
This one was really funny.

1034
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,400
You know, I wanted to talk to you about something.

1035
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:18,809
It will start soon. What do I do?

1036
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,510
Yes. I should propose to her before she gets wind of this.

1037
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,980
Sol.

1038
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,849
- Will you... - I want to make a movie.

1039
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,880
What? What did you say?

1040
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,219
I want to try out...

1041
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:32,190
becoming a movie director.

1042
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:34,159
- A movie? - Yes.

1043
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,618
I'm thinking about entering the short film festival...

1044
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:36,960
that will take place in spring.

1045
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,230
I quit my job and tried to finish writing the scenario quickly...

1046
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:42,130
for this, to tell you the truth.

1047
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,658
I was excited to watch a movie in a theater...

1048
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:44,730
since it had been a while.

1049
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,969
I'm sad we missed it.

1050
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:47,940
- I guess you like movies. - Yes.

1051
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,909
I used to watch 2 to 3 movies a day.

1052
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,440
I wanted to become a movie director.

1053
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,179
Is that so?

1054
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,979
I'm worried that I might be too late to try out a new career.

1055
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,409
And I don't feel so confident either.

1056
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,619
But remember what you told me?

1057
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,349
That you were happy when you were a swimmer.

1058
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,989
That you couldn't have known that joy without trying it out.

1059
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,420
So I want to try it out too.

1060
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,260
Regardless of the results,

1061
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:14,829
it might bring me joy.

1062
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,139
As long as it makes you happy,

1063
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,539
I'm fine with everything.

1064
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,909
I'll be super busy again.

1065
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,510
We won't be able to meet often.

1066
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,780
Then I'll go and see you.

1067
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,949
I'll support your dream.

1068
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,849
Thank you.

1069
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:38,389
I think I will be very busy for the time being.

1070
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,419
Wait a bit.

1071
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,789
Of course. I can wait for you as long as you need.

1072
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,959
By the way, what were you going to tell me?

1073
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,159
- Me? - Yes.

1074
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:58,639
No.

1075
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:00,369
This isn't the right time.

1076
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,630
Aren't your ears cold?

1077
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,900
I'm fine.

1078
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,069
No. It's cold tonight.

1079
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,500
It's very cold here.

1080
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,079
Go away.

1081
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,749
Go away.

1082
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:38,909
No?

1083
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:47,389
Pull out.

1084
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:50,829
Pull out. Don't come here. Go.

1085
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:57,969
I'm not cold.

1086
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,099
Gosh, what?

1087
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:02,670
It feels like Siberia here. You'll catch a cold.

1088
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,409
Sun Jae. By the way,

1089
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:08,809
I think I'm hearing explosions or something.

1090
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,610
What?

1091
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:13,449
That's my heart exploding!

1092
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,489
(Will you marry me?)

1093
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,429
What?

1094
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:40,809
Today...

1095
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,380
isn't the right time.

1096
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,179
Not yet.

1097
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,849
(Filming a short movie, "Wish")

1098
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:51,590
Let's go. On standby!

1099
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:54,059
Take 1 for Scene 23.

1100
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,360
Ready!

1101
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:58,630
Action!

1102
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:04,599
The weather is amazing. Isn't it?

1103
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,869
Earlier, you were...

1104
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,500
Director Im.

1105
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:11,909
A coffee truck arrived for you.

1106
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:13,969
A coffee truck?

1107
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,309
(Superstar Sun Jae is here to root for Director Im Sol.)

1108
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:18,110
What's all this?

1109
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,799
What is this?

1110
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,530
You didn't even call ahead. What are you doing here?

1111
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,070
I'm here to surprise you with my support.

1112
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,110
Actually,

1113
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:48,610
I wanted to use this as an excuse and see you.

1114
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:52,980
Thank you.

1115
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,380
Thank you! We'll enjoy the coffee.

1116
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,320
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1117
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,388
All right. Let's start again with this part...

1118
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:02,089
where you didn't recognize him.

1119
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,260
Ready.

1120
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,598
- It's raining. - No!

1121
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,658
- It's raining. - Cover that.

1122
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:10,360
- The camera! - Cover that up!

1123
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:18,710
Over there!

1124
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:46,900
Hey, I'm still in the editing studio.

1125
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,539
It's late. Should I go and pick you up?

1126
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,098
What?

1127
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,210
(My Fate)

1128
01:07:51,269 --> 01:07:53,239
No. I'll order a taxi. It will come quickly.

1129
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:54,809
Don't you have a shoot tomorrow?

1130
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,110
Go to sleep now.

1131
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,780
Don't come here. Okay?

1132
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,280
Okay.

1133
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,920
Call me when you're done.

1134
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,750
Okay.

1135
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,260
Surprise.

1136
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,030
Aren't you cold?

1137
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:19,369
Why did you come here? I told you to go to sleep.

1138
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,239
Should I just kidnap you now and run away?

1139
01:08:23,569 --> 01:08:24,609
What?

1140
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,310
Let's go!

1141
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,819
We're here.

1142
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,619
("Wish")

1143
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,079
(Upload your movie)

1144
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,920
(Your movie has been submitted successfully. Thank you.)

1145
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:18,960
Yes!

1146
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,359
I'm done!

1147
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:28,340
Im Sol. You finally did it!

1148
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,710
Sol, good job.

1149
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,978
It's been a while...

1150
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:36,140
since we got to walk like this while holding hands.

1151
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,680
You've gotten more handsome while I've been busy.

1152
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:43,479
When I was waiting for my busy girlfriend,

1153
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,819
my heart was in so much pain.

1154
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,390
Really? Let me see.

1155
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:50,489
I can't show it to you here.

1156
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,630
I'll show it to you later.

1157
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:54,060
Gosh, you.

1158
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:59,199
I can't remember the last time we got to spend time like this.

1159
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,970
When will they announce the results?

1160
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,340
Next month.

1161
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,510
I'm sure it will turn out well.

1162
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:09,380
I really wasn't going to have any expectations.

1163
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,349
But our heart is a fickle thing. Now that I submitted my work,

1164
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,979
I'm sort of hoping I would win something.

1165
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:15,850
I shouldn't, though.

1166
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:19,720
Then...

1167
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,520
why don't you make a wish?

1168
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,090
Like we did before.

1169
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:26,689
- Shall we? - Yes.

1170
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,439
You should close your eyes.

1171
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:14,069
Okay.

1172
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,630
What did you wish for?

1173
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:40,670
I...

1174
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,649
Sun Jae...

1175
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,229
From now on,

1176
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:13,369
I want to spend every waking moment with you.

1177
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,800
Will you, Sol?

1178
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,890
Won't you give me your answer?

1179
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,939
Yes.

1180
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,140
I will.

1181
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,840
I'll stay by your side for the rest of my life.

1182
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:15,060
- Did you just... - Just now...

1183
01:15:05,569 --> 01:15:08,210
(Lovely Runner)

1184
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:48,739
(Thank you for watching Lovely Runner.)
