13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,279
The incident took place at a five-star hotel.

14

So it's difficult for unregistered guests to enter.

15

from an employee and broke into the suite Ryu was staying in.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,819

Moreover, based on the DNA analysis of the weapon found at the scene,

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,238
the suspect had been imprisoned for murder in 2009...

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,040

24

60

Sun Jae looked for it everywhere to find that too.

61
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,629
But he couldn't find it in the end.

62

68
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,288

- After investigating the suspect, - What's this all about?

73
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,198
- right after Kim... - I thought the culprit...

74
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,459
- was caught before that. - was released from prison,

75
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,128
- he purchased a black sedan... - How could Sun Jae help them...

76
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,329

- according to the police. - Mom.

78
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,909
- Was I abducted in 2009? - On top of that, Kim already...

79
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,508
- knew that Ryu was... - Yes. It happened not long after...

80
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,910
- at the hotel. - you started college.

81
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,980
Because I came back to the present, there was no report about him.

82
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,050
Then does it mean Kim Young Soo came to me again in 2009?

83
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,219
If Sun Jae witnessed the crime and saved me in 2009...

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,489
The police treated it...

85
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,790
as a premeditated crime with a clear intention to kill.

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,889
Sol. Oh, no.

184
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,039
Am I going to die the moment I come back?

185
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,870
I can't die like this.

186
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,679
I must save Sun Jae at least before I die.

187
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,279
Nice catch.

188
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,600
Thank you!

189
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,899
Ryu Sun Jae?

190
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,278
Hey, where are you going?

191
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,379
Thank you!

192
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,350
If you run away alone, it will be more embarrassing.

193
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,808
Hey, wait up.

194
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,779
(Orientation for 2009 Freshmen)

195
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,450
Why did I fall into his arms of everyone's?

196
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,690
Hey.

197
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,720
You didn't even thank Ryu Sun Jae before you ran away.

198
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,190
He saved you from crashing onto the ground.

199
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,330
Right. Why do I do that to him all the time?

200
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,399
By the way, what's Sun Jae doing here?

201
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,969
He's majoring in physical education...

202
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,269
just like Geum.

203
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,970
I thought you knew.

204
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,070
What?

205
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,109
He signed with the agency before our high school graduation,

206
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,379
so he didn't go to college before.

207
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,049
When you are auditioning, don't take him with you.

208
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,820
My focus had been completely off all this time.

209
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,419
I ended up wasting my precious time.

210
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,119
This is a great coincidence.

211
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,519
- Why don't you... - No.

212
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,259
I can't face him...

213
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,129
because I feel so sorry.

214
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,360
Wait. Is this about dumping him before?

215
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,769
No way.

216
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,628
Last year, you suddenly stopped coming to the study room...

217
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,768
and avoided him so visibly. Are you still on that?

218
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,669
Yes. I should be.

219
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,039
Nothing good will come to him if he gets mixed up with me.

220
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,408
Don't get too big-headed.

221
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:32,638
There are so many beautiful girls.

222
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,809
Why would he want to get mixed up with you who already rejected him?

223
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,679
I wouldn't want anything else.

224
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,749
I'll see you later. I have somewhere to be.

225
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,990
Now? Wait.

226
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,120
Here.

227
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,759
Make sure to bring it tomorrow.

228
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,429
But...

229
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,100
we have our major class coming up next.

230
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,798
Is she ditching the class?

231
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,330
Darn it. She's been diligent lately. Why is she acting like this again?

232
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,340
(March 17, 2009)

233
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,450
(Date of Incident: May 10, 2009)

234
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,250
I need to catch Kim Young Soo before he comes for me.

235
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,919
Then nothing will happen to Sun Jae.

236
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,960
So on September 1, 2008,

237
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,258
you were abducted by a taxi driver in front of your house.

238
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,799
- Correct? - Yes.

239
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,528
But why didn't you report this then?

240
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,129
It's been several months since then. I don't understand...

241
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,798
why it took you this long.

242
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,970
Back then, because of the shock, I had lost my memory.

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,509
But my memory came back.

244
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,470
All of a sudden?

245
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,940
Is that even possible?

246
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,679
The culprit who abducted me...

247
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,378
is the culprit...

248
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,719
- of the Juyang Reservoir Incident. - What?

249
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,219
I know who the culprit is. I remembered it.

250
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,820
I know his face, name, and job.

251
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,629
These are...

252
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:57,960
his car keys.

253
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,529
(Self Defense)

254
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,369
I shared all the information about the culprit with the police.

255
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,440
They'll catch him soon, right?

256
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,379
Yes, they will.

257
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,279
But just in case,

258
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,879
I should protect myself.

259
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,899
Hey, let go of his hand!

260
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:41,909
Kim Tae Seong?

261
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,169
My ex-girlfriend?

262
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,878
You!

263
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,979
What are you doing here?

264
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,249
Gosh. You pathetic fool.

265
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,249
- Haven't you grown up? - What are you doing?

266
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,278
I told you many times to get your act straight.

267
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,489
You're 20 now.

268
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,989
How could you extort money from a kid? Unbelievable.

269
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,559
Thank you for helping me find my money.

270
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,660
"Thank you?"

271
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Give that to me.

272
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

273
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,308
I wonder how you think of me.

274
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,979
You always treat me like I don't know any better.

275
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,778
I'm just worried about your life.

276
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,619
You were going to throw away your life, you know?

277
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,220
Did you graduate?

278
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,029
That's a funny way of asking to see my graduation picture.

279
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,799
My goodness! You really graduated.

280
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,799
Oh, my.

281
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,669
My dear. Good job.

282
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,240
I'm so proud of you, Kim Tae Seong.

283
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,839
You turned over a new leaf.

284
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,940
What's this?

285
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,039
I see. I know what this is.

286
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,309
What?

287
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,180
You haven't seen me for a while. Do you find me attractive?

288
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,779
- What? - You're doing this on purpose.

289
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,788
So you can make our reencountering moment...

290
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,950
memorable.

291
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,689
Do you want me to turn this into a teaching moment?

292
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,690
Wait.

293
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,159
Why do I get the feeling that...

294
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,259
Sol with the mature ego has come back?

295
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,299
Now that I know that, something seems a bit off.

296
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,338
He's so sharp.

297
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,539
Did he figure it out?

298
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,139
What? What do you mean?

299
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,440
Why are you staring at me like that?

300
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,980
My ex-girlfriend has gotten prettier.

301
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,979
Gosh. You haven't changed one bit.

302
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,049
I bet you say that to every woman you see.

303
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,089
So what have you been up to after the graduation?

304
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,159
Gosh.

305
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,328
Judging by your outfit,

306
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,859
I bet you're drinking every night with your friends.

307
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,559
What about my outfit?

308
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,230
This outfit had the highest sales this season.

309
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,400
Sales?

310
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,740
- Do you run a business? - All right.

311
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,470
Look up Today's Member Kim Tae Seong's clothing website.

312
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,710
(Today's Member Kim Tae Seong's clothing website)

313
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,349
He looks so hip.

314
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,750
Today's Member...

315
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,480
I need to get going now.

316
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,190
If you wanted a memorable reunion, you've succeeded.

317
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,789
See you around.

318
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,099
I'm glad that he's living a good life.

319
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,130
Why did she run away as if she saw a ghost?

320
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,400
What are you mumbling about?

321
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,630
What? Did Im Sol run away when she saw you?

322
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,900
Yes. When we ran into each other before,

323
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,970
she just ignored and avoided me.

324
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,009
But this time, she ran away so quickly.

325
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,109
All right.

326
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:07,809
Could you tell me how that's supposed to be different?

327
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,079
It was definitely different.

328
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,079
I sensed it in that split second she ran away.

329
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,180
I could tell there was...

330
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,789
some kind of emotion, observing her from behind.

331
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,420
I think her face was slightly red too.

332
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,259
What do you think?

333
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,660
All right. Let me go over this once and for all.

334
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,829
She ignored and avoided you...

335
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,430
because she hated you.

336
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,739
But she quickly ran away from you...

337
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,900
Is it because seeing me stirred up her emotion or something?

338
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,509
It meant she was sick and tired of seeing you.

339
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,380
Darn it.

340
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,579
Move. Don't get on my nerves.

341
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,420
I would have done the same if I were her.

342
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,719
The guy she dumped still couldn't move on with his life.

343
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,490
Seeing how he's attending the same university as her,

344
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,690
she must be appalled.

345
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,259
Don't you even have pride?

346
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,390
No, there's no such thing as pride with me.

347
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,569
What's this?

348
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,940
Hey, now that I taught you a few chords, you wrote a song.

349
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,048
Darn it. Give it to me.

350
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,509
What's up with the lyrics?

351
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,680
"Sonaki?"

352
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,420
Did you write this while thinking about Im Sol?

353
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,690
No.

354
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,259
I just wrote it while watching the rain.

355
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,630
Oh, stop it.

356
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,289
That happened ages ago.

357
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,829
Gosh.

358
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,799
Why are you so annoying especially today?

359
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,409
I don't think you can move on from Im Sol because...

360
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,940
you keep seeing her at school.

361
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,740
"Out of sight, out of mind," you know?

362
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,549
Take a semester off and join our band.

363
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,180
Be our vocalist instead of Dong Seob.

364
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,789
That's a sudden change of subject.

365
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,390
I'll get going.

366

Hey. Get yourself sorted.

367
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,930
Stop writing pathetic songs like this, you idiot.

368

It's spring here.

369
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,650
By the time spring is over,

370
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,849
I won't be here, will I?

371
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,759

380
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,269
Sol, can I get your autograph?

381
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,980
My autograph? What are you talking about?

382
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,078
The photo of you hanging over the statue after getting drunk.

383
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,808
It was posted on the school board.

384
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,149
It has created a big buzz.

385
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,779
Hey. You're a star now.

386
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,950
You do have more star potential than I do.

387
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,519
- I give you that. - What? On the school board?

388
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,989
My goodness.

389
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,329
Gosh. Well done.

390
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,159
How are you going to survive four years of college now?

391
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,599
Mind your own business.

392
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,940
Did you return to school?

393
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,598
- Yes. Why? - It's about Sun Jae.

394
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,608
I heard he's majoring in PE. Have you run into him before?

395
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,380
Hey. I started my college years in 2004.

396
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,880
Why would I run into a new student like him?

397
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,149
Right?

398
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,278
Even if you do see him,

399
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,919
don't harass him or try to discipline him.

400
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,490
You're the one who shouldn't act like you know me at school.

401

Sol. Look at me.

402
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:50,589
- How do I look? - Lame.

403
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,329
Gosh. That means I look nice.

404
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,230
Okay.

410
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,539

412
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,049
Do you remember what I told you before?

413
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,578
- About what? - About getting a rehab...

415
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,990
Did you think about it?

416
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,289
Isn't it a false hope, though?

425
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,179
But after getting a rehab there,

426
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,989
he was able to return the next season...

427
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,519

How about taking a semester off and going there right away?

Right. Okay.

433
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,339

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,970
It's spicy.

546
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,809
What are you doing? I swallowed the mouthwash.

547
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,279
Hey. I'm warning you.

548
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,249
- Don't develop feelings for me. - I'm sorry.

549
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,549
Hush.

550
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,440
I just need to hide until we reach the cabin.

551
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,508
- We'll unpack first... - What?

552
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,480
And meet back here.

553
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,409
PE students, we'll gather here after unpacking.

554
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,848
Are we staying in the same cabin?

555
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,950
(New students of 2009 welcome party and field trip)

556
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,119
There's Geum.

557
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,819
He must have come on a different train.

558
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,950
What? What's wrong with his clothes?

559
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,259
- Is he a bum or what? - I know.

560
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,160
You should stop drinking.

561
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,430
I'll drink later, then.

562
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
She came.

563
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,099
Why didn't I...

564
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,599
see her on the train, though?

565
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:20,569
You.

566
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,809
Do you know about Yeonseo University's myth?

567
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,679
- Yes. I know. - Don't you dare...

568
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,209
to try anything for my sister based on the myth.

569
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,808
Watch where your lips go.

570
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,249
You're already removed permanently

571
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,078
from my list of brother-in-law candidates.

572
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,379
If you care about your sister so much,

573
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,750
you should be nice to her at ordinary times.

574
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,319
Why are you talking back to me?

575
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,959
Hey, Hyun Ju. This place is huge.

576
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,759
I'm glad we chose here based on your recommendation.

577
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,429
What? Did you choose this place?

578
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,630
- Yes. - Gosh.

579
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,969
You're driving me crazy.

580
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,430
You hide your lips too.

581
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,339
- Hello, Geum. - Hi, Geum.

582
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,799
- You rolled in your lips. - Yes.

583
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:56,410
Is she running away because she doesn't want to run into me?

584
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,250
Hey!

585
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,680
I swallowed the mouthwash again.

586
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,619
Gosh. My stomach is upset.

587
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,190
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,888
Why do you keep holding the mouthwash in your mouth?

589
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,119
By the way, Ms. Underclassman.

590
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,030
Don't tell me you were going to run away.

591
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,730
That's not okay.

592
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,000
Darn it.

593
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,130
(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

594
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,170
Captain.

595
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,638
The victim of an attempted kidnap said her perp is the murderer...

596
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,210
of Juyang Reservoir homicide case, so her case got transferred here.

597
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,510
"An attempted kidnap?"

598
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,979
The victim said she met you...

599
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,679
- on the day of the kidnap. - What?

600
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,619
She had a temporary memory loss back then due to the trauma.

601
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,219
"Im Sol?"

602
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,090
Hey. Are you all right?

603
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,129
Where am I?

604
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,059
In that case, was that day...

605
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,369
She did act strangely on that day for some reason.

606
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,400
I've looked into this guy, Kim Young Soo.

607
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,099
It matches perfectly with what's written in her statement.

608
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:04,739
I put that key...

609
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,409
into the taxi that he drives, and it matched perfectly.

610
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,550
I got goosebumps.

611
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,480
Can he really be the perp of the Juyang Reservoir's murder?

612
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,948
Where is Kim Young Soo right now?

613
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,349
Since the attempted kidnap, he is in the wind.

614
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,689
He left the taxi company.

615
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,789
He canceled his phone too.

616
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:23,989
Here.

617
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,130
This is where the victim said the crime scene is.

618
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,428
She said it'd be hard to find...

619
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,969
because its address isn't registered, so she drew a map.

620
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,869
If we find evidence here,

621
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,510
she's spoon-feeding us so that we can catch him.

622
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,239
Hello, everyone!

623
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,949
United Yeonseo!

624
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,679
Righteous Mass Comm!

625
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,619
In the world's best Mass Comm major,

626
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,388
I'm the bob-hair fairy of Yeonseo University.

627
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,658
- I'm Kang... - Kang!

628
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:53,788
- Soo... - Soo!

629
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:55,359
- Ji! - Ji!

630
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,760
I'm not in the mood to enjoy the trip.

631
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,800
Hello, everyone!

632
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,840
United Yeonseo!

633
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,369
Righteous Mass Comm!

634
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,969
I'm the talented girl from our major.

635
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,408
- I'm Kim... - Kim!

636
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:13,638
- Hwa... - Hwa!

637
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,808
- Sol! - Sol!

638
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,309
Nice to meet you.

639
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,949
Let's get out of here.

640
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,250
Where is it?

641
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,328
Okay. Now, let's go inside...

642
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,569
and play games while drinking.

643
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,630
Come in.

644
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,328
What's wrong with her?

645
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,469
Has she passed out from drinking already?

646
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,038
- Come in and set up the place. - Righteous Mass Comm!

647
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,538
- Okay. - Righteous Mass Comm!

648
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:45,109
New students, we'll mix up the drinks.

649
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,109
The random game that Jin Sang likes.

650
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,509
- Which game is it? - Which game is it?

651
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,779
- Start the game! - Start the game!

652
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,920
I need to get out of here quietly without getting noticed.

653
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,750
I'll do 2 and 3?

654
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,750
The ice cream 31.

655
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,259
I'll do 25, 26.

656
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,090
- I'll do 27, 28. - I'll do 29.

657
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,260
I'll do 30!

658
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,499
- Chug. - Chug.

659
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,899
The alcohol is going in.

660
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,499
- Chug. - Chug.

661
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,840
Until when do I have to dance?

662
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:17,670
Drink up.

663
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:21,479
It's 0, 0, 7...

664
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,510
- Bang! - No!

665
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,449
It's 0, 0, 7...

666
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,718
- Bang! - No!

667
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,949
It's 0, 0, 7, bang!

668
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,959
- Chug. - Chug.

669
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,288
Alcohol is going in.

670
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,259
- Chug. - Chug.

671
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,300
The black knight!

672
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,039
Here comes the rabbit from the moon.

673
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,339
- Boom, boom. - Boom, boom

674
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,839
- Bunny, Bunny. - Bunny, Bunny.

675
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,050
- Carrot, carrot. - Carrot, carrot.

676
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,979
Alcohol is going in.

677
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,788
- Chug. - Chug.

678
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:05,319
Until when do I have to dance?

679
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,019
Look at my shoulders. They are dislocated.

680
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,159
Just a little more.

681
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,500
I'm almost there.

682
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,170
I got you.

683
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,940
I thought you blacked out.

684
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,639
Did you pretend you were asleep because you didn't want to drink?

685
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:25,840
No.

686
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:30,110
Of course not. That can't be possible.

687
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,119
You're right. That can't be possible.

688
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,619
Darn it.

689
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:37,319
Okay.

690
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,649
Let's change the vibe.

691
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,118
From now on, whoever loses...

692
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,329
has to drink and do a penalty mission.

693
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,960
Okay. The first penalty mission is...

694
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,029
to go to the PE students' lodging next door...

695
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,900
- Drum roll. - Drum roll.

696
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,070
And dance!

697
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,510
I just cannot lose this.

698
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,079
The game starts now.

699
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,150
Four strawberries.

700
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,849
Strawberry, strawberry.

701
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,780
Two grapes.

702
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,650
Grape, grape.

703
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,360
Four lemons.

704
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,829
Lemon, lemon.

705
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:19,928
- Eight grapefruits. - Grapefruit, grapefruit,

706
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:21,960
grapefruit, grapefruit.

707
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,630
Five strawberries.

708
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,969
Strawberry, strawberry.

709
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:29,869
Three grapefruits.

710
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,039
Grapefruit, grapefruit.

711
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,638
- Eight strawberries. - Strawberry, strawberry,

712
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,980
strawberry, strawberry.

713
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,279
- Seven grapefruits. - Grapefruit, grapefruit,

714
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,820
grapefruit, grapefruit.

715
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,590
One strawberry!

716
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,159
Strawberry, straw...

717
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,428
Yes!

718
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:52,859
Alcohol is going in.

719
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,599
- Chug. - Chug.

720
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,170
Until when do I have to dance?

721
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,109
Okay. Hello, everyone!

722
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,569
The new student from our major...

723
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,308
will put on a show for you.

724
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:08,440
Give her a big hand!

725
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,579
Gosh. She's running away.

726
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,420
Sun Jae isn't here. Let's get it over with it quickly.

727
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,230
- Do it 1 more time! - Do it 1 more time!

728
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:07,940
Gosh. Hey.

729
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,808
You can't stop in the middle of it.

730
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,308
You have to finish your penalty mission.

731
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:12,710
I told you I was leaving!

732
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,579
How dare you tell me what to do when you're 1 or 2 years older?

733
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,109
If you were born a few years later,

734
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,118
you would have socially buried after getting posted...

735
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,980
on school boards and social media.

736
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,618
Also, penalty drink?

737
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,118
Did anyone do anything to get penalized?

738
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,288
Are you going to take responsibility if someone dies after drinking this?

739
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,630
You young prick doesn't even know how dangerous alcohol is!

740
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,730
Got it?

741
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:41,138
I'm leaving.

742
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,639
Don't let them drink too much and let them sleep early. Understood?

743
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,039
- Answer me! - Okay.

744
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,250
- Hey. Let's play foot volleyball. - Okay.

745
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:53,319
Hey. I love playing foot volleyball.

746
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,619
- Let go of me. - You can't beat me.

747
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,420
- Hey. - Be careful.

748
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,319
- I'm confident I'll win. - Hey, listen.

749
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,960
- Come here. - Stop it.

750
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,000
(Watch out for boars while tracking at dawn or night.)

751
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,599
Should we share a cab?

752
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,969
Mom will be...

753
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,440
Guys, I'm sorry.

754
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,969
I have to leave early because I have a TOEIC class.

755
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:20,538
Nice work today.

756
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,610
Eclipse, peace!

757
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,079
That prick!

758
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,920
We might lose a gig because of him.

759
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,219
And he studies for TOEIC?

760
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,320
The boss said he'd fire us if we can't fill up the venue this month.

761
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:32,519
What should we do?

762
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,960
Should we make a promotional video?

763
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,159
Darn it.

764
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,730
Hey. Should we enter this?

765
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:40,899
(Come on out if you can die for singing.)

766
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,959
(Superstar K, The audition to discover stars)

767
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,030
"Superstar K?"

768
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,469
Where is the trail?

769
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,139
Let me see the map.

770
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,109
Right.

771
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,719
This is not a smartphone.

772
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,500
Sun Jae!

773
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,199
What do I do? Sun Jae!

774
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,099
Sun Jae, come to your senses!

775
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,139
Excuse me! Is there anybody out there?

776
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,849
Oh, no. I have no reception.

777
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,349
(Out of service area)

778
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,059
- Oh, my goodness! - Oh, gosh!

779
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,199
Please just go.

780
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,750
Hold me tight.

781
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,150
Okay.

782
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:46,489
I'm going to untie it.

783
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,460
All right.

784
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,219
Why would they set something like this?

785
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,389
Isn't it illegal?

786
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,900
Here.

787
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:38,969
If you're going to carry it around to defend yourself,

788
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,840
you should put batteries in it.

789
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,149
Didn't you pass out from the electric shock?

790
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,349
I just fell.

791
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,719
You hit the vital spot with that.

792
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,250
Sorry.

793
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:54,559
So?

794
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,329
Why did you enter the wild boar habitat at night?

795
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,630
Well,

796
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,570
I was going home as I couldn't get used to the field trip.

797
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,039
You were running away from me.

798
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:10,869
I saw it.

799
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,570
You've been avoiding me all day.

800
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,340
Do you really have to do this to run away?

801
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,050
There's no walking trail here. Follow me.

802
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Hey.

803
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:31,190
Do you hate me that much?

804
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,399
Are you doing this because you don't even want to see me?

805
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,300
How can I hate you?

806
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,699
It's because you might die because of me.

807
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,340
It's late.

808
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,710
Let's go.

809
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,979
The person you have reached is unavailable.

810
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,719
- Please leave a message... - It's weird.

811
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,218
- after the tone. - Is Chae Won's phone...

812
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,519
broken?

813
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,319
(Wild Boar Area: Be cautious when hiking at dawn or at night)

814
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,360
Gosh.

815
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,960
What? What's going on?

816
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,860
Why are you coming out of the dark forest?

817
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,099
Hey.

818
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:18,409
Hey, Ryu.

819
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,609
You didn't put your lips on my sister's...

820
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,340
in the forest did you?

821
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,780
Never mind.

822
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,420
Looking at your long face, it seems you failed miserably.

823
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,320
Gosh, you look capable, but...

824
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,690
It's not something like that.

825
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,219
Hey.

826
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,190
I see why Sol doesn't like you.

827
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,929
- Do you need my advice? - No.

828
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,129
Hey. A woman's heart...

829
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,598
isn't simple like a straight road.

830
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,738
It's like a complex off-road course. If you step on the pedal...

831
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:51,238
and go straight,

832
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,268
do you know what happens?

833
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,908
You'll just crash.

834
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,348
When you hit on her, step on the pedal.

835
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,609
When you have to step back, you should slow down.

836
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,679
Slow down, speed up.

837
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,589
You should control your speed.

838
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,649
Women go crazy...

839
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,489
because I'm good at it.

840
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:11,530
This is ridiculous.

841
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,529
Hey. Especially,

842
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,899
I don't cling to them and am cool about it.

843
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,928
That's my style.

844
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:19,299
When you're dumped or break up with someone,

845
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,300
you should turn away without hesitation.

846
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,539
"What's gotten into him?"

847
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,380
It makes her curious. Got it?

848
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,409
Yes.

849
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,650
Hey, Ryu. Let me borrow your phone.

850
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,849
Will you let me go if I do that?

851
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,050
Give me your phone first.

852
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:38,989
Thanks.

853
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,729
- Hello? - Chae Won!

854
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,460
My princess, I haven't heard your voice for so long.

855
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,328
I couldn't reach you for the past few days.

856
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:54,538
I thought your phone was broken.

857
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:57,969
But it was my phone that was broken.

858
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,909
Geum, my phone isn't broken.

859
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,750
I avoided your calls.

860
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,980
What? You avoided my calls? Why?

861
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:09,449
I like someone else now.

862
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,618
- I'm sorry. - Someone else?

863
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:13,159
Who? What are you talking about?

864
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:16,018
Wait. Don't hang up.

865
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,689
Are you saying you want to break up with me?

866
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,759
Tell me again. Chae Won!

867
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,730

Are you going to start dating Jin Sang today?

870
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,439
He had mouthwash in his mouth all day.

871
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,049
He's determined to tell his feelings to you and kiss you.

872
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,309
What?

873
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,650
I don't like public confession.

874
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,159
Hey. Do you hate me that much?

875
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,360
Are you doing this because you don't even want to see me?

876
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,000
Sol. Why are you drinking alone miserably?

877
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,440
Come here. Drink with us.

878
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,639
No, I'm fine.

879
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,539
Did something happen?

880
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:08,340
We finished the snack.

881
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:10,150
Let me bring more.

884
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:24,590
You can't end it like this.

885
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,459
Don't abandon me.

886
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,599
He's so clingy.

887
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:34,739
Give me your phone now.

888
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,710
Hey, Ryu. I'm in pain.

889
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,110
You smell like alcohol.

890
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:46,949
Why do you think she doesn't like me anymore?

891
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,550
How can I change a woman's heart?

892
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:57,059
I wonder.

893
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,199
My heart hurts so much.

894
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,329
It's like I was hit by a bullet.

895
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,610
I can't stay still like this.

896
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:15,579
I'm going to see Chae Won now.

897
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,409
Right now!

898
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:20,719

Where are you going, Geum?

902
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,300
Wild boars might appear in that area!

903
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,800
Where did he go?

904
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:51,179

906

908
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,619
- with me? - Go out.

909
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,459
- My goodness. - You should go out.

910
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,828
- It's embarrassing. - Please go out with me!

911
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:06,658
- Where are you? - Oh, my.

912
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:09,399
- Don't make me wait for too long! - How do I look?

913
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
You look so pretty.

914
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:12,229
Come out, Eun Ji!

916
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,400
Eun...

917
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,840
Gosh, why isn't she coming out? Something else is about to come out.

918
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:20,780
My stomach hurts.

919
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,750
Is it because I swallowed the mouthwash a lot?

920
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,519
Eun Ji... This won't do.

921
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:45,469
Hey.

922
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:48,340
You're a Physical Education major. We attend the same school.

923
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,539
Can you please help me just once? Please hold the door for me.

924
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,280
What a mess.

925
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,710
Thank you so much.

926
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,179
Please hold the door for me.

927
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,050
- Okay. - Thank you.

928
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,860
So he's the guy.

(Yeonseo University)

930
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:25,070
Hey, where are you going?

931
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:26,739
Hey.

932
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,849
I'm here.

933
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,750
- What the heck? - Oh, gosh.

934
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,460
Gosh, it's quiet now.

935
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,269
Sol?

936
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:57,969
Why is the ground coming up?

937
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:08,980
Is she drunk?

938
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,460
I would have done the same if I were her.

939
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,960
The guy she dumped...

940
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,658
still couldn't move on with his life.

941
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:23,499
Seeing how he's attending the same university as her,

942
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,269
she must be appalled.

943
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,139
It's pretty.

944
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,650
Should we just meet up now?

945
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:40,549
- What? - Just tell me...

946
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,618
that you want to see me.

947
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,619
I'll quit everything and go to you.

948
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:46,619
Get back to work now.

949
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,460
At that time,

950
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,889
I should've told him that I wanted to see him.

951
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:56,360
Would nothing have happened then?

952
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,139
Geum!

953
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:07,239
I'm sure he was going this way. Where is he?

954
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,780
Chae Won.

955
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,880
Geum!

956
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,179
Geum!

957
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,118
Oh, no. What's this?

958
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,618
Oh, my. Are you okay?

959
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:19,690
Oh, no.

960
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,860
What do I do?

961
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,058
- Chae Won. - My gosh!

962
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:26,699
How can your love change?

963
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,300
Do you like that guy that much?

964
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:32,869
Did you guys break up?

965
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,099
Did she really...

966
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,538
cheat on you?

967
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:39,538
Don't abandon me,

968
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:43,308
Chae Won.

969
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,808
Stop calling her.

970
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:46,609
She dumped you for another guy.

971
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,118
- Why do you keep calling her name? - Chae Won.

972
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,888
I told you to stop calling her.

973
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,348
Do you not have pride?

974
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,960
Princess Chae Won.

975
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,118
You call her Princess even now?

976
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,659
- Princess Chae Won. - Don't call her name!

977
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,328
Don't you dare call her name once again.

978
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:02,760
Chae Won.

979
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,170
What?

980
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:41,739
No!

981
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:07,659
You almost fell.

982
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,670
Why are you here?

983
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:16,499
You shouldn't have passed out here like this.

984
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,969
Why did you come?

985
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,738
Don't make me worry about you then.

986
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,440
Why did you follow me?

987
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,780
Why do you keep coming?

988
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,619
I was so mean to you.

989
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,690
Why are you worried about me?

990
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,690
Are you a fool?

991
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,500
Are you really a fool?

992
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:46,199
I said you should think about yourself only.

993
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,939
You should curse me as a bad girl...

994
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,739
and get me out of your mind.

995
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:59,909
Why did you act like a fool and let something like that happen to you?

996
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,980
"Something like that?"

997
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,550
Please.

998
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,889
Please, Sun Jae.

999
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:23,869
Okay, fine.

1000
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,210
I'm sorry about everything. So...

1001
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,280
don't cry. Okay?

1002
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,380
Don't.

1003
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:35,980
Just act like you don't know me.

1004
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:39,650
Don't even worry about me.

1005
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:44,289
Whatever I do, whatever happens to me, please...

1006
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,599
Please just leave me alone.

I'm here.

1009
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,960
You came. Did you have fun during the field trip?

1010
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,170
I don't know.

1011
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,440
Sun Jae.

1012
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,079
Was it "Boseulbi" or "Sonaki?" The song you made.

1013
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,110
Should we go there with the song?

1014
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,280
You said you didn't like it.

1015
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:50,760
Have you let anyone listen to the song?

1016
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,158
What? Who?

1017
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,900
Whoever it is. Have you let anyone listen to it?

1018
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,570
Hey, I listened to the song just a few days ago.

1019
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,329
Who would I let someone else hear it?

1020
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,969
So you haven't.

1021
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,710
That's why I'm saying this. Let's participate in the show...

1022
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,440
and let everyone in the country hear it. How about that?

1023
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,059
What's this?

1024
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,829
Hey.

1025
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,900
This darn guy.

1026
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,329
- Call 119. - Okay.

1027
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,868
My goodness.

1028
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,909
There's a fire here. Please come.

1029
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,610
There's a deserted house on the right side...

1030
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,408
if you cross the bridge and come up...

1031
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:45,050
near the bus stop at Juyang Reservoir.

1032
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,820
Please hurry up.

1033
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:57,829
Yes. I'm calling as I want to know how the investigation is going.

1034
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:00,429
We are currently trying to locate Kim Young Soo's whereabouts.

1035
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,099
We went to the crime scene you talked about,

1036
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,469
but it was already burnt down.

1037
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:07,699
What? It was burnt down?

1038
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,969
No. The investigation record didn't mention it.

1039
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:13,170
The evidence should be found there.

1040
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,110
There's no way.

1041
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,110
Did you not find any evidence?

1042
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,380
Not yet.

1043
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,150
I think he knows he was reported.

1044
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,699
Is he going to find me?

1045
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,670
What if he bumps into Sun Jae?

1048
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,860
I was waiting for you because I have something to check.

1049
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,759
I should go somewhere quickly.

1050
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,829
How did you...

1051
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,300
know the song and sing it?

1052
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:13,630
"The song?"

1053
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,039
I've never let anyone hear it except In Hyuk.

1054
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:18,909
How do you know the song?

1055

1058

Where did you...

1059
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,860
hear the song?

1060
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,900
I'll change it this time.

1061
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,769
Before I go back, I'll make sure to do that.

1062
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,170
Are you going somewhere?

1063
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:51,909
To the future.

1064
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,309
To my time.

Where are you going?

1067
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,658
Well, that's...

1068
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,090
Are you going back to your time?

1069
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,070
Who are you?

1070
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,869
Did you really...

1071
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:26,710
come from the future?

1072
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,089
Let's go now. Get on my back.

1074
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:58,570
I said get on my back.

(Lovely Runner)

1076
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,649
What would you do if someone you like says she came from the future?

1077
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,718
What kind of stupid refusal is that?

1078
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,119
It's good to see you.

1079
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:44,449
Look at what she's doing. I think she likes Sun Jae.

1080
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:45,848
Sun Jae, would you like to go out with me?

1081
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:48,389
Did you like it?

1082
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,629
Don't waste your energy, getting jealous of me for no reason.

1083
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:53,928
Just protect yourself.

1084
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:55,329
Let me ask you one last question.

1085
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,670
In all your times, have you ever liked me?

1086
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,130
No, I haven't.

1087
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,199
I'll leave so that you don't feel uncomfortable.

1088
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,038
Don't come.

1089
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,610
I said don't come!
