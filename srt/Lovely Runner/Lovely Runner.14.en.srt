Have I ever asked you to look out for me?

40

I'll be honest. With the way you treat me,

41
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,679
it's embarrassing and awkward because I feel like...

00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,519
I'll try to find one.

185
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,928
Would there be anyone?

186
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,230
Well...

187
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,500
If we...

188
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,528
How about Ryu Sun Jae?

189
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,500
Sun Jae? Not him.

190
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,940
Ryu Sun Jae?

191
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,409
Do you think he would want to replace Park Do Jun?

192
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,120
Why don't we send him the script at least?

193
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,388
When he turned down our casting offer for "Hero" last time,

194
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,419
he said he wanted to work with us next time.

195
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,759
He must've just said it to be polite.

196
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,398
But if he says yes,

197
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,700
the investors would like it more.

198
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,100
- Yes. - Yes.

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,970
Hurry up and send him the script for "I Want a Kiss," then.

200
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,509
I'll contact him separately.

201
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,039
Producer Im, did you revise the proposal?

202
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,009
Producer Im.

203
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Pardon?

204
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,018
Oh, yes. I sent an email to the team.

205
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,159
I'll read it.

206
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,720
Yes.

207
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,090
- Okay. - There's no way...

208
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,398
he will say yes, right?

209
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,700
- Thank you. - Thank you.

210
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,500
(We're sending the script to offer him a role in our movie.)

211
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,470
Hello.

212
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,870
Yes. I'm sorry.

213
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,839
I'm at work right now.

214
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,839
I'll tell my husband to go right away.

215
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,579
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,279
Okay. Bye.

217
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,480
(The mail was sent.)

218
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,070
I don't think this was the title.

219
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,768
(Synopsis)

220
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,138
(Logline)

221
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,710
"The story of a man who meets a tragic end..."

222
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,750
"and a woman who travels back in time 15 years to save him."

223
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,850
"A fantasy romantic film where they meet again..."

224
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,819
"in the time of destiny,"

225
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,490
"falling in love as they move between the past and the present."

226
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,059
"When I found out that I would never be able to walk again,"

227
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,700
"every time I went to bed at night,"

228
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,399
"I prayed..."

229
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,899
"that morning would never come."

230
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,499
"That day, the morning sunlight..."

231
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,469
"streaming through the window in the rehabilitation hospital..."

232
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,070
"made me unbearably sad as always."

233
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,139
"And the man on a radio show who happened to call me..."

234
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,740
"said this."

235
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,509
You should live your life...

236
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,750
today...

237
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,620
because it's a great day.

238
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,149
"It will rain tomorrow."

239
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,918
"Then as you wait until the rain stops,"

240
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,019
"live another day."

241
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,360
"If you keep this up,"

242
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,289
"there might come a day when life doesn't seem so miserable."

243
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,159
"When I was shivering in the pouring snow..."

244
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,169
"on a bridge over the Han River,"

245
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,139
"he strode over to me..."

246
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,309
"and held an umbrella over my head."

247
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,320
"There are choices you make..."

248
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,720
"even though you know the consequences."

249
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,620
"Because you like it."

250
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,190
I love you.

251
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,559
"Falling off the cliff,"

252
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,600
"the man dies once again while trying to save the woman..."

253
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
"in the past, in the year 2009."

254
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,769
"Perhaps,"

255
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,409
"we should have never met in the first place."

256
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,409
"Yes. We should've never met."

257
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,649
"Realizing that the man died..."

258
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:47,220
"because of her,"

259
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,889
"the woman decides to sever the link with him."

260
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,490
"She decides to remove herself..."

261
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,490
"from his life."

262
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,100
"Losing all the memories about her,"

263
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,899
"the man is living his life."

264
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,539
"Looking at the man who is shining from afar,"

265
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,539
"the woman thinks..."

266
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:11,639
"that things are in the right place now..."

267
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,350
"and that they were not meant to meet in the first place."

268
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,120
"The song that exists only in her memory,"

269
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,620
"'Sonaki, '"

270
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,258
"is playing quietly."

271
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,489
(I didn't want it to stop. On the day you first came to me, )

272
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,559
(I didn't want you to be the rain that soaks me wet only momentarily.)

273
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,299
What's this?

274
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,009
Hey, they sent us the wrong script. This is what they sent again.

275
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,679
- Sun Jae. - Dong Seok.

276
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Yes?

277
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,210
Am I...

278
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,419
crying?

279
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,820
I think you are.

280
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,190
These are tears, right?

281
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,259
It's coming out of your eyes.

282
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,529
So it can't be snot.

283
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,130
I can't stop crying.

284
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,529
Dong Seok.

285
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,880
Are you going to treat me to lunch at an expensive place like this?

286
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,240
Is it a special day?

287
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,450
Is someone else coming?

288
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,919
Actually, he received your proposal...

289
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,690
instead of the script of "I Want a Kiss."

290
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:31,789
What?

291
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,959
And then?

292
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,660
Sun Jae saw it and said he was interested.

293
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
What?

294
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,269
What is this? She wrote the proposal?

295
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:47,969
Do you know her?

296
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,410
"Sensible, savvy, and on top of everything."

297
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,970
She wrote the resignation letter.

298
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,440
She did?

299
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,338
Oh, gosh. Let's go inside quickly.

300
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,249
- I'm not doing the movie. - You're declining all of a sudden?

301
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,649
Yes. I don't want to do it all of a sudden.

302
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,078
No matter how upset you are,

303
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,949
you can't decide that based on personal feelings.

304
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,589
"Personal feelings?" That's not the reason.

305
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,920
This movie won't be successful. I don't like it.

306
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,490
Wait.

307
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,259
No.

308
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,630
I should say I won't do it myself.

309
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,069
She should pay for humiliating me. Don't you think so?

310
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,038
- Oh, my. You've come, Sun Jae. - No.

311
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,740
- It's been a while. - We can't meet like this.

312
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,109
Take a seat.

313
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,180
Take a seat.

314
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,089
It's nice to meet you.

315
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,990
No. We've met before.

316
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,960
Oh, my. You guys have met before?

317
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,559
Where?

318
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,930
Have we not? I guess I was mistaken.

319
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,799
Sun Jae, I guess...

320
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,970
you really liked the proposal.

321
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:57,609
You even got a basket of flowers for us.

322
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,279
I think there were miscommunications.

323
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,008
I actually came to decline...

324
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,019
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,750
I hope you decline the movie.

326
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,049
Pardon?

327
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,319
- I'm sorry. - What kind of joke is that?

328
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,099
- Sun Jae, were you surprised? - It's not a joke.

329
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,740
He's a little far from the main character I had in mind.

330
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,170
The proposal wasn't supposed to be sent anyway.

331
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,910
So please forget about it.

332
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,109
Are you...

333
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,920
rejecting me?

334
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:47,019
Yes. I'm sorry if I offended you.

335
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,390
Are you out of your mind?

336
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,460
I'm not offended.

337
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:57,069
I came here to refuse the offer anyway.

338
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,038
I prepared these flowers...

339
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,308
as an apology for my refusal too.

340
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,670
I'm relieved that we're on the same page.

341
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,880
I hope you refuse all the proposals...

342
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,950
with my name on it from now on.

343
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,819
Are you saying you don't want to work with me?

344
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,190
If you think that way and feel offended again,

345
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,130
that's even better.

346
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,460
Because you would never...

347
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,369
want to be associated with me...

348
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,329
again.

349
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,980
I'll get going first then.

350
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,250
I have some work to do.

351
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,619
Oh, my gosh. She's...

352
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,548
My goodness.

353
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,819
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

354
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,559
It won't take long, Sun Jae.

355
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,358
Please give me a minute.

356
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,258
Sol.

357
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,900
Sol.

358
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:02,700
What was that?

359
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,099
I think she turned you down.

360
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:09,339
Let's go.

361
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,250
It must have hurt his pride.

362
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,220
It probably hurt his feelings too.

363
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,950
But...

364
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,190
it's for the better. I did the right thing.

365
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,690
I'll never see him again anyway.

366
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,068
Sun Jae, you've never been turned down...

367
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,640
like this since your rookie years, right?

368
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,199
No. I don't think you got turned down...

369
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,568
this harshly even in your rookie years.

370
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,209
Take this as an opportunity to return to the basics...

371
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,839
and think seriously about it.

372
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,848
You might have been in a rut unknowingly.

373
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,518
What? "In a rut?"

374
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,420
Also, it's understandable that she rejected you.

375
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,088
It's a romantic movie, right?

376
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,989
I've seen you for years.

377
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,960
Unlike how you look, you're a dummy at dating.

378
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,890
You're weak in that field.

379
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,190
"Weak?"

380
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,559
What are you talking about?

381
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,759
Hey, what do you know about my dating history?

382
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,869
- Keep your eyes forward! - Right. Yes.

383
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,799
Are you going to stay rejected, though?

384
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,339
I didn't get rejected. Inwardly,

385
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,240
I turned it down first.

386
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,379
I think she decided to turn you down millions of years ago.

387
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,449
- What? - It's been a while...

388
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,210
since a proposal won your interest like this one.

389
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,548
If you're unhappy about how it turned out, talk her into it.

390
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:28,990
"Talk her into it," my foot.

391
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,960
Do I have no work to do other than that?

392
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,459
Why would I lower myself...

393
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,960
to someone who doesn't like me?

394
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,700
Let's talk for a second.

395
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,140
I have nothing to talk about.

396
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,470
I think you do.

397
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,709
If it's about the movie, I already told you everything,

398
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,410
so you should talk to my boss.

399
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,710
"Sensible, savvy, and on top of everything."

400
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,849
"You told me that's who I am."

401
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,518
"If that's the kind of employee I am,"

402
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,019
"how could you do this to me?"

403
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,490
"That is such an ick."

404
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,818
What does that mean?

405
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,460
What? That's my letter of resignation.

406
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,930
Is it really okay that I talk to Ms. Lee?

407
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,769
Make sure to cover your face when you leave just in case.

408
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,980
I'll contact you.

409
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,979
Why here of all places?

410
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,210
You got out of work late.

411
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,479
Are you sure you're an employee...

412
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,990
who is sensible, savvy, and on top of everything?

413
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,819
Just tell me what you want to tell me. I'm busy.

414
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,029
I want to know why you're against me so much.

415
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:48,400
Did you wait until I got out of work just for that?

416
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,400
I wouldn't have waited for you to drink tea at the bar, would I?

417
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:53,539
Who are we to do that?

418
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:57,640
Is it because...

419
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,039
I mistook you as a thief at the award ceremony?

420
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,509
That's unfair, though.

421
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,950
Because of you, I caused an accident on air.

422
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,990
The envelopes got swapped by mistake.

423
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,519
I'm sorry.

424
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,660
Apology accepted.

425
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,130
I'm sorry for mistaking you for a thief.

426
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,900
Okay. Well...

427
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,069
Good.

428
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,539
You no longer have a reason not to cast me.

429
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,640
You're wrong.

430
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,379
That's another story.

431
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,910
I have many reasons not to cast you.

432
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,909
Tell me those reasons.

433
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,249
Like I said,

434
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,920
you don't have the image of the main character that I had.

435
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,719
If it wasn't me, who did you consider?

436
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,759
What?

437
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:48,829
Well, it was...

438
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,130
Well...

439
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,670
Seong Jae Gyeong.

440
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,569
What? "Seong Jae Gyeong?"

441
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,539
You're just saying whatever comes to your mind.

442
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,740
How can he portray young romance when he's about to turn 50?

443
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,579
Is there a rule forbidding him from doing it because he's 50?

444
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,210
He has to go back 15 years and play a high school student too.

445
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,250
Didn't you write the proposal?

446
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,890
Computer graphics technology is superb these days.

447
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,288
Also, Seong Jae Gyeong still looks young.

448
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,129
If we touch up his wrinkles a bit,

449
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,630
he can even pull off a middle school student.

450
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,329
Let's say that's true.

451
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:32,099
What are the other reasons?

452
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,709
Honestly,

453
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,079
I prefer someone who does romantic acts better than you.

454
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:44,650
Are there more?

455
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,180
I'm going to find an actor with a fresh image.

456
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,919
- And I look stale? - In fact,

457
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,490
you're less fresh.

458
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,460
Are you picking a fish at a grocery store?

459
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,619
- You keep looking for freshness. - More than anything,

460
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,689
the sky is against it.

461
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,359
It says it will never allow you to do it.

462
00:25:58,829 --> 00:25:59,959
Who says so?

463
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,059
Grandma Celestial says so.

464
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,799
She's good with something like this.

465
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:03,999
My fate says if I get involved with a guy...

466
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,199
who was born in the Year of the Horse,

467
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,500
my family will decline for three generations.

468
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,470
Of course, that guy's family too.

469
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,679
You were born in the Year of the Horse.

470
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,980
"The Year of the Horse?"

471
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,710
The compatibility of zodiac signs? Are we getting married?

472
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,720
Compatibility is crucial in this business.

473
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,618
Ms. Im,

474
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,490
do you believe in things like fate?

475
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,960
Yes. I do believe in fate.

476
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm not going to do anything that fate doesn't allow.

477
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,140
I believe that you fully understand the reasons now.

478
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,970
I'll get going.

479
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,480
It's so ridiculous that it's driving me crazy.

480
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,430
Ms. Im, do you believe in things like fate?

481
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,430
Yes. I do believe in fate.

482
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,569
I'm not going to do anything that fate doesn't allow.

483
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,779
What kind of dream was that?

484
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,029
I guess she despises you.

485
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,469
What?

486
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,798
She wouldn't reject it like that...

487
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,240
unless she hated Ryu Sun Jae as a whole.

488
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,910
Why would she hate me when we just met?

489
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,180
Why would she like you when she just met you?

490
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,449
My friend, let go of the idea...

491
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,990
that everyone in the world will like you.

492
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,819
Anyone can hate us.

493
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
Gosh.

494
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,569
Bringing it up the Year of the Horse was petty, indeed.

495
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,869
Seong Jae Gyeong was born in the Year of the Horse too.

496
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,568
What?

497
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,410
- He was born then? - Yes.

498
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,809
He was born in 1978, the Year of the Horse.

499
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,849
Gosh. I knew the reason was random.

500
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,650
Is this how she's going to play?

501
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,608
Yes, hello?

502
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,410
This is Ryu Sun Jae. Can we talk...

503
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,079
Why did he call me?

504
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,048
What was that?

505
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,750
"What was that?" She heard you but ignored you.

506
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,819
How can she ignore you after hearing your name?

507
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,490
She is completely ignoring you.

508
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,390
Dong Seok.

509
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,890
You call her.

510
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,960
"Production investment?"

511
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,729
He must be swimming in money.

512
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,028
Yes, he must be.

513
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,199
No thanks.

514
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,640
I think we can make the film with our own capability.

515
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:34,299
It's not even a blockbuster.

516
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,910
She declined your offer.

517
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,740
She can pay me half as much.

518
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,049
- You can pay him... - No.

519
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,309
Tell her I'll be in the movie for free.

520
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,250
He says he'll do it for free.

521
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,349
I'll decline that offer too.

522
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,059
Tell him that it makes us uncomfortable if he goes that far.

523
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,920
I did.

524
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,758
I won't go on a vacation, and I'll hold my schedule...

525
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,059
just to focus on the movie.

526
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,899
Tell her that.

527
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,528
Please tell him...

528
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,240
to enjoy his vacation and fulfill his schedule.

529
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,239
- Let's meet and talk. - Gosh.

530
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,569
I have a meeting to attend. Bye.

531
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,269
She hung up.

532
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,680
- Gosh, Sun Jae. - Why?

533
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,849
Why does she hate me so much?

534
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,979
Is it because you were born in the Year of the Horse?

535
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,420
That's not it. Also,

536
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,190
don't you dare talk about the Year of the Horse in front of me.

537
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,829
Hey, Sun Jae.

538
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,028
Give it up before you get humiliated more.

539
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,469
Sometimes, you get turned down too.

540
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,970
Why do you insist and humiliate yourself...

541
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,470
There must be a good reason.

542
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,579
Your makeup looks good today.

543
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,079
Hey, stop right there!

544
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:51,779
Darn it.

545
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:53,579
Hey!

546
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,589
When did she sneak in again?

547
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:00,619
Gosh.

548
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,939
Let's go. Be careful.

549
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,379
Mom. Stay right here, okay?

550
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,249
Stay here. I'll be right back after throwing these away.

551
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,250
Yes, ma'am.

552
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,750
Gosh.

553
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:40,829
What?

554
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,799
Mal Ja?

555
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,470
Mal Ja?

556
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,338
I'll head home now.

557
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,568
- Bye. - Get home safely.

558
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,609
Okay.

559
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,779
(Mom)

560
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,508
Yes, Mom.

561
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:01,179
Sol, your grandma went missing in a blink.

562
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,289
What should I do?

(General Civil Services, Traffic Investigation)

564
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,000
You're here. This way.

565
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,970
- Grandma! - Grandma.

566
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,909
- Grandma! - Grandma.

567
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,309
Grandma!

568
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,209
Grandma!

(Ryu Geun Duk Galbi)

571
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,949
Mr. Ryu, the grandma by herself at Table Five...

572
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,859
is eating five servings of food alone, and it's strange.

573
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,919
I don't think she's in her sound mind.

574
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,429
Okay. I'll check.

575
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,630
- Take care of the counter. - Okay.

576
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:54,368
Ma'am, do you find the food okay?

577
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:57,139
How would I tell you when I just had a bite?

578
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,979
I'll have to eat some more to find out.

579
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,579
Yes, of course.

580
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,220
Goodness. You had five servings of meat by yourself.

581
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,579
Do you need anything else?

582
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:12,090
For me? Gosh. Thank you.

583
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,230
Nice.

584
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,559

585
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,260
Pardon?

586
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,029
That's right. You lived across from my place.

587
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,238
I'm from Gold Videos.

588
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,010
Don't you remember it?

589
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,280
Goodness.

590
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,280
You're the lady who lived across the street.

591
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,309
What a coincidence!

592
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,649
- Gosh. Have you been well? - Goodness.

593
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,348
My goodness.

594
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:44,319
So, your son has become that successful?

595
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,460
Usually, I hate boasting about my son.

596
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,658
But out of 10 Korean people, about 9 of them...

597
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,198
About 11 of them would know my son.

598
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,869
He's just a little successful like that.

599
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,368
Gosh. He can even beat Na Hoon A in his heyday.

600
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,940
Come on.

601
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,808
Tes!

602
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,079
He has a long way to go to catch up with Na Hoon A.

603
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,479
For my son's recent concert,

604
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,789
I heard about 50,000 people showed up.

605
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,289
That's a mere talent show in a small town.

606
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,360
Since it's been a while since I saw you, let's toast.

607
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,360

608
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,459
good health and longevity!

609
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,099
- Gosh. - Thank you.

610
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,769
Gosh. Speaking of which, look who's here.

611
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,010
My son is here. Son!

612
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,239
Come on, Son!

613
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,839
How much did you drink, Dad? Gosh.

614
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,649
Hey. I'm not drunk.

615
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,050
Also, I still have the food you brought me last time.

616
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,779
Why do I have to come and take more?

617
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,119
- How dare you. - Gosh.

618
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,989
Hey! Say hello.

619
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:53,420
You remember the video rental shop across your childhood home, right?

620
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:55,689
She used to live there.

621
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,130
- Say hello. - What?

622
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,030
- Hello. - He's my son.

623
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,039
Husband!

624
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,409
Hush and stand tall.

625
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:15,209
Hey. Where did you go last night?

626
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,610
Did you go and gamble again?

627
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,678
- Dad. - Ma'am, please let him go.

628
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,719
I can smell the face powder. You must have gone to a teahouse,

629
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,819
not the gamble joint.

630
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,289
Which teahouse waitress were you with? Was it Kkot Bun?

631
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,229
Was it that Cho Hee? Which one was it?

632
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,428
- Ma'am. - My goodness.

633
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,269
I was such a fool...

634
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:40,669
to marry you when I was 18 because of this sleek face.

635
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,209
My goodness.

637
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:48,639
- I think she has dementia. - Gosh.

638
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,480
Ma'am.

(Traffic Division 1)

640
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,489
Wait. Did she get on the bus?

641
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,690
Hold on.

642
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,229
You're right. It's bus number 72.

643
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,799
Check the security cameras on its route...

644
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,630
- to see where she got off. - Okay.

645
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,110
Yes, Mom.

646
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:20,179
I asked Tae Seong, so we're looking at the security camera footage.

647
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:22,179
Sol, we found your grandmother.

648
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,179
What? You found her?

649
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,480
Where?

650
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,549
Someone saw her contact info and called us.

651
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,219
Apparently, she ate at a restaurant without paying.

652
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,658
The owner of the restaurant is bringing her home right now.

653
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,719
So hurry home.

654
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,960
What a relief!

655
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,099
Sol.

656
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,210
Thanks for helping me today when you must have been busy.

657
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,750
I have enough time to drop you off.

658
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,679
Also, drive whenever you can.

659
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,388
- It's dangerous these days. - Did something happen?

660
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:06,320
Someone attempted to abduct a woman.

661
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,519
Because there's no evidence, we don't even have a suspect.

662
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:12,260
So, go home right away when it becomes dark.

663
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,500
When you're working late, call me.

664
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,030
I'll drop you off if I can.

665
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,698
Forget it. Be this nice to your girlfriend, not me.

666
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,099
I thought you were my girlfriend.

667
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,038
I'm not your girlfriend.

668
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,170
You're not my guy friend, are you?

669
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,449
You can't see your friend as a woman.

670
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,449
Yes, Captain.

671
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,789
- Right now? - Go ahead.

672
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,019
I'll be right there.

673
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:41,559
Get in.

674
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,289
And tell me how your grandmother is doing.

675
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,259
- Drive safely. - Bye.

676
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,300
Okay.

677
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,760
Bye.

678
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,239
He must be your boyfriend.

679
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:03,149
How did you find out about my house?

680
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,349
Your boyfriend is a sweet guy.

681
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,719
He's not.

682
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:08,779
Also, I'm taken aback that you're here...

683
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,749
after looking into my address.

684
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,250
Is that so?

685
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,230
What?

686
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,030
What are you doing?

687
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,969
I'm not going to get in that car.

688
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,800
I have nothing more to say.

689
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:28,039
Just go back.

690
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,639
Are you really going to let me go?

691
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,609
Aren't you going to regret it?

692
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,739
Of course not.

693
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,440
I already turned you down.

694
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,550
We have no business seeing each other again.

695
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,550
I said I won't get in the car.

696
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,590
What? Are you going to threaten me again with the resignation letter?

697
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:45,420
Is this funny to you?

698
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,190
Yes, it's funny.

699
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,130
Is it fun to play around with my livelihood?

700
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Go ahead and tell my boss about everything.

701
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,198
I can't take it anymore because you keep looking for me.

702
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,599
I'll just get fired instead.

703
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,199
Even his personality has changed completely.

704
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:08,239
Let go of me. I'm not a pushover.

705
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,408
Even if you grab and beg me like this,

706
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,579
it just won't work!

707
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,920
Sister, where are you going?

708
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:22,359
I heard the restaurant owner would drop her off.

709
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,630
My father owns a restaurant.

710
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,489
I guess you're shocked.

711
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:28,360
I went to my father's house after a while.

712
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,969
And I was shocked to find this.

713
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,809
Gosh. You're here.

714
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,439
I should have picked her up.

715
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,179
Thank you for dropping her off.

716
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,709
Hold on. I should treat you before you go.

717
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,808
Do you want to go upstairs?

718
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,619
It's all right. You can head back.

719
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,948
Hey. I want to pee.

720
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,119
Okay.

721
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,058
Still, it won't be right to send you off like this.

722
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:56,189
My bladder is about to explode.

723
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,729
Okay, Mom. Hold it for a second, Mal Ja. Yes.

724
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,658
Sol. Buy him a cup of hot tea...

725
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,799
before he leaves. Okay?

726
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,198
We'll get going. Thank you, sir.

727
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,638
- Thank you. - Yes.

728
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,209
Let's go, Mal Ja.

729
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,268
- Let's go. - It's exploding.

730
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,880
No, hold it.

731
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,110
Here.

732
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,449
I took you wrong.

733
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,920
Thanks for dropping her off.

734
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,789
You have to buy me a cup of tea.

735
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,099
There is your tea.

736
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:40,468
Is this how you treat a person you want to thank?

737
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:43,009
Cafes around here are all closed at this hour.

738
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,570
If a rumor between us cooks up because we're in an open space,

739
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,039
are you going to take care of it?

740
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,980
- But there's no one around. - We have to be careful.

741
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,380
Such rumor can be detrimental...

742
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:56,590
because I'm an actor specializing in romance.

743
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,260
Since when?

744
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,320
(Sweet Coffee)

745
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,360
- What about it? - Listen.

746
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,730
Look me in the eyes.

747
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,099
People often tell me I'm a man of a romantic gaze.

748
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
What?

749
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,639
Look!

750
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,839
(Fresh, Early Morning Delivery)

751
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,869
It's right on time.

752
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,339
Did you see that? The advertiser acknowledged...

753
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,610
that I have a "fresh" image.

754
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,679
Are you trying...

755
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,549
to make yourself look good to join my project?

756
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,849
No. Not at all.

757
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:33,190
I was only pointing out a fact to you.

758
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,589
I still have a fresh image...

759
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,460
and would be a great actor in a romantic movie.

760
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,960
If you turn me down, it will be your loss.

761
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,730
I see. Is that so?

762
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,800
Come on. They must've recognized me right away.

763
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,269
Reporters might publish that we're dating.

764
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,840
- Act like you're my stylist. - What?

765
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,210
Well, although you're not so stylish.

766
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
Kids.

767
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,050
Don't be shy. Come here.

768
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,980
- Yes! - Nice!

769
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,989
What do you want? A photo? An autograph?

770
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:06,889
Mister,

771
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,019
- can you buy us some cigarettes? - Oh, dear.

772
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:13,230
Don't you recognize me?

773
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,860
- What's he talking about? - What is he on?

774
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,840
(Sweet Coffee)

775
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,280
I see. I get it!

776
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,079
You can buy some coffee for yourself with the change.

777
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,749
You know, for your trouble.

778
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,210
Kids! You shouldn't be smoking!

779
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,319
- Go away. - What?

780
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,449
- What was that? - Go away now.

781
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,050
What a boomer. Seriously.

782
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,719
- This is so annoying. Let's go. - What was that?

783
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,158
Is this funny to you?

784
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,599
Yes. It's funny.

785
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,400
I've never seen you laugh before.

786
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:03,409
- Are you done laughing? - Yes.

787
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,260
All right.

788
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,300
You should go now.

789
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,899
My father told me that...

790
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,300
we used to be neighbors.

791
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,199
You were the daughter of a video rental store.

792
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,110
I used to live across from your store.

793
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,280
Have you seen me all those years ago?

794
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,110
No.

795
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:37,880
I haven't.

796
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,579
Then have I seen you before?

797
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm wondering if that's why you look familiar to me.

798
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,760
I haven't seen you before. How could you have seen me then?

799
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:50,860
Is that so?

800
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,659
By the way, could the shaman be a quack?

801
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,900
Even if we hadn't met before, given that we were neighbors,

802
00:44:58,469 --> 00:44:59,670
isn't that fate?

803
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,369
It's just...

804
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,869
a coincidence.

805
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
A coincidence?

806
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,849
I won't change my mind just because you were my neighbor.

807
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:15,018
Even if...

808
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:17,389
my CEO offers you the role, please turn it down.

809
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,420
Please do that for me.

810
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,889
What if I tell her I want to join the movie despite the fact...

811
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,429
that you're against casting me?

812
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:25,530
What will happen then?

813
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,570
I hope you won't put us in that situation.

814
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,269
Then I'll get going.

815
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,289
Look me in the eyes.

816
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,960
- Is this funny to you? - Yes. It's funny.

817
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:11,439
Let go of me.

818
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,280
Even if you grab and beg me like this, it just won't work!

819
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,409
I'm home.

820
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,480
What? You're back so soon.

821
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,750
Did you send him home already?

822
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,779
Yes.

823
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,320
He said it was fine and left.

824
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,578
Geum and Hyun Ju are home too, right?

825
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,719
They're putting the kids to sleep.

826
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,219
Hey, he's not the owner of the restaurant, right?

827
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,719
He didn't sound like the guy on the phone.

828
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,888
He must be an employee or something.

829
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:06,799
No. He gave off some special aura.

830
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,960
His face, height, and voice too.

831
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,829
Besides, I swear I've seen his face somewhere.

832
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,239
Where did I see him?

833
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,769
Yes. That drama.

834
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,280
Ryu...

835
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,078
Sun...

836
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,710
Ryu Sun Jae. Yes. That must be him.

837
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,949
He can't be Ryu Sun Jae. That doesn't make sense.

838
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,550
I think it's him.

839
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,090
Mom, stay here for a bit.

840
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,619
I'm hungry.

841
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,730
Grandma.

842
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,829
You can't wander off all by yourself like that.

843
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,260
How did you know about the barbecue restaurant?

844
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,400
Don't go back there ever again. Okay?

845
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:47,639
Okay.

846
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,210
- But I did well, didn't I? - What?

847
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,909
You missed him.

848
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,949
Mom! Come inside.

849
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:02,550
Yes!

850
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,909
Yes. You're right, Grandma.

851
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,510
I missed him.

852
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,980
Given that we were neighbors, isn't that fate?

853
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:40,789
I know I shouldn't feel this way.

854
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:42,690
But I want to keep seeing him,

855
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:45,260
now that I've met him a few times.

856
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,738
She's a middle school student who ran away from home.

857
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:57,409
The method matches the method of the last attempted abduction.

858
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,739
I think it's the same culprit.

859
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,379
Luckily, before she got abducted, she asked a passer-by for help...

860
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,949
and managed to escape.

861
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,150
Do you feel calmer now?

862
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:12,389
Should we talk when your parents get here?

863
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,389
No.

864
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,329
I'll talk now.

865
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,289
Sure.

866
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,329
Did you happen to see his face?

867
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,639
Yes.

868
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,969
I know remembering what happened will be tough.

869
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:31,139
But could you tell me what happened in detail?

870
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,909
Honey!

871
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,909
Honey!

872
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:39,749
I already got Bo A ready for kindergarten.

873
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,150
Her braids look good, don't they?

874
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,518
Get my heart. Get my cheek heart.

875
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:44,820
Ta-da.

876
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:47,959
Should I massage your shoulders?

877
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,388
Gosh. You must be tired.

878
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:52,389
Bo A! You look beautiful.

879
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,399
Bo A. I'm busy today. Go to kindergarten with your dad.

880
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,630
- Okay? - Yes.

881
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,369
By the way, Dad,

882
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,269
I don't think Mom can see you.

883
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,839
That's because I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.

884
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,139
Only those who are pretty can see me.

885
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,049
Bo A. Let's go. Say goodbye to your mom.

886
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,649
- Bye. - Bye.

887
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,789
Give her a kiss.

888
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,689
Have a good day.

889
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,960
Let me give you a kiss too.

890
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:25,329
Honey, have a good day.

891
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,000
He's so frustrating.

892
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,670
Where's my scarf?

893
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,909
What's this?

894
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,239
He wasted money on this stupid lottery ticket again.

895
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,649
Hyun Ju. Shouldn't we go to work?

896
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,909
I'm coming.

897
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:49,380
What? Why?

898
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,219
"Why?"

899
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,420
Because Ryu Sun Jae wants to do it. Do you need a reason?

900
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,030
He liked your proposal for the movie.

901
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,559
Even so, he can't.

902
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,530
So what if you say no? What are you going to do?

903
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,400
Do you think finding a top star who would join a romantic movie is easy?

904
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,909
I heard you kept turning him down, saying you didn't want him.

905
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,280
What you did at the restaurant was one thing.

906
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:16,109
How could you keep calling the shots without running it by me first?

907
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,309
Do you think this is a joke?

908
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,880
Given what happened to Park Do Jun,

909
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,289
we must do whatever it takes to get Ryu Sun Jae to join.

910
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,050
It won't matter even if you're dead set against it.

911
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,619
Okay.

912
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,329
Then proceed with the movie.

913
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,800
I'll quit my job.

914
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,070
Gosh.

915
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,598
Is that a threat or something?

916
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,840
No, it's not.

917
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:43,469
I really can't work with Ryu Sun Jae.

918
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,869
No. I must not.

919
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:47,940
So I'll give up working on this movie...

920
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,739
and leave the company.

921
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:55,419
What?

922
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,549
Hey, are you serious?

923
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,590
Thank you...

924
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,960
for everything.

925
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,260
Hey.

926
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,530
Sol.

927
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,269
Sol.

928
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,839
What's gotten into you? You can't be thinking straight.

929
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,369
Yes, I'm thinking straight.

930
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:16,969
Why did you do it?

931
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,169
If you hadn't sent him my proposal by mistake,

932
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,980
this wouldn't have happened!

933
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,049
Hey. But all in all, didn't this work out better for you?

934
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,050
No.

935
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,578
You have no idea how it felt to cut him out of my life.

936
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,219
Cutting him out of my life had been crazy hard.

937
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:34,460
We can't meet like this again.

938
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,190
Sol.

939
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,730
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

940
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,340
Why are they filming the commercial outside in this cold winter?

941
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,570
Did the weather warm up today?

942
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:53,880
Hey.

943
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,639
Do you know a song called "Sonaki?"

944
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,750
That's a common title.

945
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,509
There are so many songs with that title.

946
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,519
How does it go?

947
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,849
Nothing.

948
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,689
Ms. Lee, the CEO of Bon Cinema, called earlier to set up a meeting.

949
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,460
But someone else will be joining the meeting as the producer,

950
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:13,299
- not Ms. Im. - Why?

951
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,359
I heard Ms. Im wouldn't be working on this movie.

952
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,499
But this was her idea.

953
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,829
- She's not going to work on this? - Right.

954
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,529
By the way, what's the movie about?

955
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,900
Why are you going this far to get a role in it?

956
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,510
It's about a woman...

957
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:32,610
who goes back 15 years in time to save a man she loves.

958
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:36,789
Nothing is so special about the plot.

959
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,090
Right. It's not that special.

960
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,460
It's odd.

961
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,360
Her phone is turned off too.

962
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,969
You don't think she's seriously quitting her job, right?

963
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,269
Gosh. No way.

964
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,269
I don't think Ms. Lee is taking this seriously either.

965
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,469
I'll talk to her when I see her at home.

966
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,308
She said her dream was to become a movie director.

967
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:02,440
It makes no sense that she'll just waste this golden opportunity.

968
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,980
This is odd.

969
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,719
Did something really happen between Ryu Sun Jae and her?

970
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,250
I mean, she wouldn't hate someone like this without a good reason.

971
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:13,489
What is it?

972
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:16,829
What is it?

973
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,199
That's...

974
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,010
This place hasn't changed one bit.

975
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,329
We can meet again in the future...

976
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,730
and come back here together.

977
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:08,079
It's a pity that I didn't even get to keep a picture.

978
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,909
How could I?

979
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,309
That's impossible.

980
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,869
Gosh.

981
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,340
How many hours did I stay here?

982
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,980
Sol.

983
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,289
Sun Jae.

984
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,759
- The shoot might be canceled today. - Why?

985
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,329
The actress in the commercial was in a fender bender on the way here.

986
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,630
- Is she okay? - Yes.

987
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:08,099
Well, there's nothing we can do.

988
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,809
It's cold today. Let me go and pull up the car first.

989
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,539
Give me that. I'll be back.

990
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,349
It's this jerk.

991
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,219
Tae Seong.

992
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,929
- I got his composite sketch. - Okay. Give me that.

993
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:37,599
It's him.

994
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:44,210
Yes. Wait here.

995
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:46,110
Okay. Go inside, please.

996
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:48,408
I'll close the door.

997
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,539
- I'm with her. - Okay.

998
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,788
What... How did you...

999
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,650
Don't tell me you're suspecting me of tailing you.

1000
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,058
I was going to film a commercial here.

1001
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:02,090
But it got canceled.

1002
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,329
I remembered the Ferris wheel scene from the proposal, so I came here.

1003
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,860
Funny running into you again.

1004
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,769
I told you that shaman was a quack.

1005
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,598
Given how many times we're running into each other,

1006
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,268
isn't the universe basically pushing us toward each other?

1007
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,639
Let's say you saw me by chance.

1008
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,269
Then you should have carried on. Why did you get in here with me?

1009
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,079
We're not on good enough terms to share a ride...

1010
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,179
on the Ferris wheel.

1011
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,219
I bet you want to run away, but you can't jump out of here.

1012
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,590
That's what you were thinking, right?

1013
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,329
You can't run away anyway until the ride is over.

1014
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:48,139
Do you hate me that much?

1015
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:52,440
I heard you wouldn't be part of the production for the movie.

1016
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,610
Right.

1017
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,879
But I quit my job, so...

1018
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,980
Why?

1019
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,480
I'd rather you didn't.

1020
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,550
Why do you care?

1021
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:07,690
Are you not well?

1022
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,590
It's not that. Let's stay quiet and get off when the ride is over.

1023
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,530
By the way,

1024
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,570
is that how it really ends?

1025
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,269
- What do you mean? - The end of the movie.

1026
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,809
Is the man...

1027
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,510
stuck in a life without any memories of the woman...

1028
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,440
he loved?

1029
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:32,750
Yes.

1030
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,550
That's a sad ending.

1031
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,320
It's a happy ending...

1032
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,989
for the woman.

1033
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,389
She saved the man.

1034
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,190
But she lost love.

1035
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:53,739
Can she still be happy after losing love?

1036
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:57,610
See? I told you it was a sad ending.

1037
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,309
I don't like the ending.

1038
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,280
Then don't join the project.

1039
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,849
Why are you being so stubborn?

1040
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,019
I was being stubborn at first, but I truly want it now.

1041
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,578
I genuinely want the role in this movie now.

1042
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,789
Why do you want to play in this movie so badly?

1043
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,618
I'm sure you get better proposals...

1044
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,190
and offers from better directors and writers.

1045
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,670
I've been...

1046
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:26,769
feeling weird lately.

1047
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,639
After reading your proposal,

1048
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,070
I started to experience weird symptoms.

1049
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,909
I suddenly find myself in tears.

1050
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,079
I even dream.

1051
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,980
A vivid dream as if I experienced it myself.

1052
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,719
And this place too.

1053
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,659
I've never been here before. But it feels familiar.

1054
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,389
Like I've been here before.

1055
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:26,860
Sun Jae.

1056
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,599
Maybe that's why.

1057
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,070
I'm especially drawn to this project more than any other project.

1058
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,039
Am I not allowed to feel this way?

1059
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,510
You might die.

1060
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:43,980
What if I tell you...

1061
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:47,219
getting mixed up with me might kill you?

1062
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,849
Would you still do it?

1063
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:52,449
Must I be prepared to face death...

1064
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,659
to get mixed up with you?

1065
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,960
What if that's the case?

1066
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,710
Why are you so quiet?

1067
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,079
This is so beautiful.

1068
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,179
It's so beautiful that I'm speechless.

1069
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,179
At this rate,

1070
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,449
you and I might end up dead here together.

1071
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,159
At that moment, this crossed my mind.

1072
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:13,469
That our fate was just going around in circles just like...

1073
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,400
this Ferris wheel.

1074
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:49,840
(Lovely Runner)

1075
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:52,138
Sun Jae.

1076
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:54,139
You'll get better soon. Get some sleep.

1077
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:56,309
The owner of this vehicle is super famous.

1078
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,879
So you're going to star in the movie my dear Sol came up with.

1079
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,980
Unbelievable. She said she didn't have a boyfriend.

1080
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:02,780
I stopped in the neighborhood... No.

1081
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:04,389
I stopped by since I was in the neighborhood.

1082
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,848
Ms. Im left the company.

1083
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,118
Mr. Ryu.

1084
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:10,090
Stay healthy and have a good life.

1085
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:12,190
Then, goodbye.

1086
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,130
I think this is the guy.

1087
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:17,469
Is there such a thing as predetermined fate?

1088
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,699
Sol!

1089
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,038
Like an inevitable fate that we can neither change...

1090
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,300
nor defy.
