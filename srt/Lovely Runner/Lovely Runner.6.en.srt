00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:05,666
(Byeon Woo Seok)

00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:08,395
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:09,496
(10 missed calls from CEO)

00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:14,035
(Kim Hye Yoon)

00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,945
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:30,285
(Summer of 2013)

7
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:48,476
This is DJ Ham's "10-10 Friend."

8
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,704
Part Two with Sun Jae...

9
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,515
will be starting soon.

10
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,244
It's the rainy season these days.

11
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:58,745
And it happens to be raining today as well.

12
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:03,586
That's why we're listening to "Sonaki" after a long time.

13
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:05,684
You know what? This song...

14
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,325
was chosen as the number-one song...

15
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:08,926
that reminds people of their first love.

16
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:11,694
I didn't know until recently, but you wrote this song...

17
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,736
before you debuted.

18
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,066
Yes.

19
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:18,506
Did you write the song, thinking about your first love?

20
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:20,006
Well...

21
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:23,476
I think I was right, judging from your reaction.

22
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:25,675
The upcoming movie...

23
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,444
- is about first love as well. - Yes.

24
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,915
Speaking of which, can you tell us about your first love?

25
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:32,685
I'll keep it a secret for sure.

26
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,555
My first love?

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,355
Well...

28
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,626
There was a rain shower...

29
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,325
on the day I saw her for the first time.

30
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:46,025
Sir!

31
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,135
She put a yellow umbrella over me with a smile.

32
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:54,376
I couldn't breathe because my heart was fluttering.

33
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:56,876
As if...

34
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,775
I forgot how to breathe.

35
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:02,645
- When was it? - When he just debuted,

36
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:03,944
he said his fans were his first love.

37
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:05,016
That's...

38
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,715
a secret.

39
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:10,725
- What? - I wonder who it is, though.

40
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,666
(Episode 6)

41
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,564
Why did you sing in front of so many people for something like this?

42
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:28,636
You're the one who was worried about a useless thing.

43
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,576
Hey.

44
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:35,916
Follow me.

45
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,285
Have you guys seen Tae Seong?

46
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:43,986
Ga Hyun dragged Sol along!

47
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:55,465
Hey, what is it?

48
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,236
He's good-looking. Why is he so tall?

49
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,336
Hey.

50
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:01,934
Let Tae Seong take care of it.

51
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,305
How can I stay still?

52
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,146
What if she's dragged somewhere and beaten up?

53
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:24,266
Why are you doing this out of nowhere?

54
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,494
Did I tell you not to hurt my dear Sol or not?

55
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:30,835
- What? - They say you're not dating me...

56
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,935
because you like me.

57
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,835
Ga Hyun was bothering you so much that you dated a random girl...

58
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:34,904
to chase her away,

59
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:36,136
and it happened...

60
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:37,505
(Im Sol)

61
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:38,646
to be me.

62
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,775
- Who said that? - That's not important.

63
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:43,214
I didn't know you were that much of a trash.

64
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,586
I'm very disappointed.

65
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,385
I'm glad I found out first.

66
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:51,225
Anyway, it's over with you now. You got it?

67
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,254
It's natural that you're immature at your age,

68
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,926
but don't live like that.

69
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:04,965
Oh, right.

70
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:09,305
I'm saying this just in case.

71
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:12,445
Even if I come back and tell you that I don't remember we broke up...

72
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:14,375
and beg you to get back together,

73
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:16,415
don't you ever say yes.

74
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,545
You little...

75
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,365
Right. This is actually better.

76
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,496
A senior in high school should study, not date.

77
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,305
This is my number one treasure.

78
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:42,336
Here you go again.

79
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:45,475
Let's go. It's late.

80
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:46,845
- What? - What?

81
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:48,516
- It's still here? - You're talking too.

82
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,645
I guess you came out from the commercial.

83
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,246
You're alive and moving.

84
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:56,155
This is funny. Sure it is.

85
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,756
How do I remove it?

86
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,066
Sun Jae.

87
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,306
You told me to think about myself only.

88
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,175
Do you want to break up with him?

89
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:26,545
Can you do that for me...

90
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:28,115
if I want?

91
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,056
I like you.

92
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,525
Break up with Tae Seong then.

93
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,396
I...

94
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:38,525
like you.

95
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:41,496
Why?

96
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:46,364
Why would he like me?

97
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,474
- Did you get hit? - No way.

98
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,905
Did someone hit you?

99
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:52,446
Oh, no.

100
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:54,376
Sol!

101
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,425
(Gold Videos and DVDs)

102
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,566
I like you.

103
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:15,436
I like you.

104
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,936
Why do I keep thinking about it?

105
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,274
What's wrong with me?

106
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,336
That's what I want to ask you. What's wrong with you?

107
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,205
- What? - Why are you doing that...

108
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:27,215
to the onion?

109
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,345
Why have you been like this since earlier? What's wrong?

110
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:33,956
No. It's nothing.

111
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,424
My eyes are burning.

112
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:42,425
It's because you're tearing the onion into pieces.

113
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:43,925
Bite on this.

114
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,234
They're still burning.

115
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,266
You're crying like a baby.

116
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,075
Stop peeling it.

117
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,376
Go to the grocery store and get makgeolli.

118
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:58,675
I forgot to bring it.

119
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:04,715
My eyes are burning.

120
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:10,186
I didn't know you were that much of a trash.

121
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,826
I'm very disappointed.

122
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,854
Anyway, it's over with you now.

123
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:15,855
You got it?

124
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,295
You're not eating. What are you thinking?

125
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,196
It's strange.

126
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,535
What's strange?

127
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:25,735
- Here. - There?

128
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:27,066
How should I put it?

129
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:30,674
Somehow, it...

130
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:32,175
- It? - hurts.

131
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:34,615
- Your heart? - My heart.

132
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:36,914
Hey, if you were head-butted, your head should hurt.

133
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,215
Why does your heart hurt?

134
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:39,446
I know.

135
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:43,885
I know what it is. Sol dumped you...

136
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:45,556
and it made you angry.

137
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:48,795
You're mad and furious.

138
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,025
- Do you have a death wish? - Gosh.

139
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,766
My gosh. You're thoughtless.

140
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,735
What are you to tell her to break up with him?

141
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,405
Should I just watch her dating a guy like him then?

142
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:06,044
You didn't even tell her about your feelings properly.

143
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:07,516
You can't tell her to break up first.

144
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,645
It's like gukbap.

145
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,816
You always burn your tongue when you eat it.

146
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,756
It's driving me nuts.

147
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,886
Hey. Stop with the long face.

148
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:21,495
Do you want me to set up a blind date for you?

149
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:22,524
Let's just go.

150
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:23,695
- I know a pretty girl. - Let go of me.

151
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:24,995
Let's just go.

152
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:26,025
A blind date?

153
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,335
- Darn it. - Why?

154
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,365
- Hey! - Are you thinking about Sol?

155
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,905
No way.

156
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,035
Do you want to go on a blind date then?

157
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:35,936
- Yes. Set the date. - Hold back.

158
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,945
Yes. When you're dumped, just forget about it...

159
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,206
and meet someone else.

160
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:40,276
I'll get going.

161
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,145
Oh, my.

162
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,186
What are you doing?

163
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:48,755
Were you dumped?

164
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,186
Are you mocking me?

165
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:58,696
- Gosh. - Good luck with the blind date.

166
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,495
You got this.

167
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,776
- He was dumped? - Hey.

168
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,975
Sun Jae.

169
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:14,446
- Hey. - Is he crazy?

170
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,715
That crazy guy.

171
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:44,845
How long have you been crying?

172
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:46,676
What?

173
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:49,416
Hold on.

174
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:56,186
Don't cry!

175
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:59,026
Why do you have to cry because of that jerk?

176
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,255
What?

177
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:03,855
What are you talking about? I'm crying because of an onion.

178
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,026
An onion?

179
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,495
Is Tae Seong an onion?

180
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:08,494
What?

181
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:09,495
(Makgeolli)

182
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,365
What's with the drink?

183
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,235
Are you trying to drink the pain away already?

184
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,005
You should just...

185
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:18,105
lean on me!

186
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,375
Why do you drink every time you're sad?

187
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:21,745
I mean...

188
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:24,585
This is not what you think, Sun Jae.

189
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:25,615
Give it to me.

190
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,955
What are you doing? Let go of it.

191
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:29,615
No. I can't bear to see you destroying yourself.

192
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:32,785
What do you mean I'm destroying myself? Give it to me.

193
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:34,696
No. No matter how hard it is, you shouldn't do this.

194
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,224
Give it to me, Sun Jae.

195
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,425
Give it to me.

196
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,565
Are you really going to do this?

197
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,265
- I mean... - Are you really going to do this?

198
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,165
What's wrong with you?

199
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,166
What's going on?

200
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:45,906
I'm going to throw this away.

201
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,234
What are you doing? I was doing an errand for my grandma!

202
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,505
That little...

203
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:53,046
Let go of it!

204
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,836
(Makgeolli)

205
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:25,975
How dare you harass my sister, you crazy punk?

206
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,446
Sun Jae.

207
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,615
Are you crazy?

208
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,046
My gosh.

209
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:34,855
Sun Jae.

210
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,686
Gosh.

211
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:44,895
You should've taken him to a hospital.

212
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,326
Hospital, my foot.

213
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,765
How can he pass out like that for drinking a few drops of makgeolli?

214
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,505
Hey. Be honest with me. He's a little dumb, isn't he?

215
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,206
It's all your fault.

216
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,105
He can't handle makgeolli well.

217
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:02,276
Just a sip of makgeolli can knock him out.

218
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,625
He must feel hot.

219
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,395
How can you sleep like a dead person?

220
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:30,135
I like you.

221
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,566
I...

222
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,306
like you.

223
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:49,355
What is it?

224
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,865
Where am I?

225
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:16,676
Gosh.

226
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:20,416
My goodness. It's driving me crazy.

227
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:49,015
Sorry.

228
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:54,046
What? Why are you...

229
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,885
The thing is...

230
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:04,995
I came in to turn on the fan for you.

231
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,176
Oh, no.

232
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:26,286
Why is the fan here again?

233
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:31,855
What? Did he fall off while sleeping?

234
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:33,786
I don't know.

235
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:52,276
My goodness. Why is it suddenly so cold?

236
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:01,816
He's strong even when he's sleeping.

237
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,115
My gosh.

238
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:49,965
Is he asleep?

239
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,216
What are you guys doing?

240
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,865
Why was I sleeping here?

241
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,966
Did I sleepwalk?

242
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,536
You punks.

243
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,466
Come here!

244
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,735
Hey, let go of me.

245
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:32,675
How dare you use a technique on me?

246
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:43,586
You should've come in if you had arrived. What's the matter?

247
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:45,185
Did someone say he likes you?

248
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:46,756
How did you know?

249
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,526
What? Is it real? Who said that?

250
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:50,996
Is it Sun Jae?

251
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,394
How can Sun Jae like me?

252
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:57,235
Why would someone so dazzling like me?

253
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:58,905
You chased him, girl.

254
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,405
Me? When?

255
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:03,736
Think about it.

256
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,006
You broke into the swimming pool and hugged him, saying you loved him.

257
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:10,344
You always skipped the self-study session to follow him around.

258
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,545
You went to a game to cheer for him.

259
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:14,486
You always packed food for him when he injured his shoulder.

260
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,185
There was a reason.

261
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:18,925
A reason, my foot.

262
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:21,525
Then why did you crawl into the room where he was sleeping yesterday?

263
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:22,826
You knew he liked you.

264
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,966
You're like an old fox.

265
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:26,595
I'm not a fox.

266
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,566
But it's true I'm older than a 19-year-old.

267
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,905
It seems...

268
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:34,006
he's never dated anyone as he was focused on exercising.

269
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,404
They're naturally weak to women who throw themselves into them...

270
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:37,875
like a bulldozer.

271
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:39,605
Is that so?

272
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,114
Anyway, those who shake other people's hearts are the problem.

273
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,245
Why would he care when someone is pooping?

274
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:45,414
Why did he take off his clothes?

275
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,685
He should've not shaken my heart if he wasn't going to like me.

276
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:51,155
"Pooping?" Who?

277
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,625
What?

278
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:57,355
Don't think about other things and just study. Come in.

279
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:06,266
Did I shake his heart for no reason when he did nothing?

280
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:15,115
It's noisy.

281
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,195
- Sun Jae. - What?

282
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:36,036
Be quiet.

283
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:43,776
What are you doing here?

284
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:45,775
- I just came to see you. - It will make her uncomfortable...

285
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:48,016
if you hit on her as soon as they broke up.

286
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:51,045
Don't make it too obvious. Don't cling to her either.

287
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:52,115
Act cool.

288
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:53,345
Did you believe it?

289
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:55,685
Of course, I came to study.

290
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:57,415
I see.

291
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,526
You should study indeed.

292
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:07,966
How come...

293
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:10,066
I got a desk right next to you?

294
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:12,665
What a coincidence.

295
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,036
I know.

296
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,345
Good luck with your study then.

297
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:23,915
Okay.

298
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:26,685
You too.

299
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,806
Are they here for a date?

300
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:47,634
- Lee Seung Yuop fielded the ball. - Run.

301
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:49,604
- A ground ball to the second base. - Gosh, it's a double play.

302
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,674
- He's out at the second base. - Why a double play?

303
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:52,705
He hit a double play.

304
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,015
Oh, right. She lost her phone.

305
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,115
(Im Sol)

306
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,145
My gosh.

307
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,445
Oh, right.

308
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,215
I heard it from the guys.

309
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,516
Ga Hyun has been harassing Sol.

310
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:05,154
She dragged her along before too.

311
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:07,486
What? Why are you telling me today?

312
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:08,996
Because I heard it today.

313
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,966
(Sol, Tae Seong)

314
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:14,966
Darn it.

315
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:17,066
Get off.

316
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:18,665
You little...

317
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:23,536
(Woori Snack Bar)

318
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:24,874
(Report Card)

319
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,506
(Grade 8)

320
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:29,515
If Lee Seung Yuop solves this problem...

321
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,716
How are you going to go to college?

322
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,316
You're in Grade Eight for everything.

323
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,016
How many grades are there?

324
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,056
Is my grade really low?

325
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,586
It's not just low. You're at the rock bottom.

326
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,026
Because I am a student with a special talent,

327
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:42,726
I just need to surpass the minimum grade.

328
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,194
What is the minimum grade you have to get?

329
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:46,226
Grade Five.

330
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:51,164
But you got Grade Eight.

331
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:52,204
They are already in the eighth inning.

332
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:54,535
- I wish they could hear the cheer. - Score some points.

333
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:56,935
Everything is in Grade Eight.

334
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,875
They are all Grade Eights.

335
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,875
Gosh. He's so energetic.

336
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,475
I think Lee Seung Yuop is in good condition.

337
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:05,845
Still,

338
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:09,556
don't you think the score is too low when the CSAT is so soon?

339
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,056
You said you'd help.

340
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,326
I did.

341
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:17,496
But it's been a while since I studied for CSAT.

342
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:22,466
I can barely remember the quadratic formula. What now?

343
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:27,705
Spit it out.

344
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:29,976
Hurry. You'll scald the roof of your mouth.

345
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:44,716
Isn't it hot?

346
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,125
Here.

347
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:50,826
It's all right.

348
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:54,466
Scored.

349
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:59,935
- What do you mean you scored? - It's looking good.

350
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:04,336
See? We scored.

351
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:10,845
- Lee Seung Yuop! - Lee Seung Yuop!

352
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:12,445
- We scored two points. - Lee Seung Yuop!

353
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,115
- Nice. - Go, Korea!

354
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,816
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

355
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:19,425
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

356
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:25,195
Is it starting to rain?

357
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,595
I have an umbrella. I brought it with me in the morning.

358
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:32,105
Wait. Where is it?

359
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:33,205
In the study room?

360
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:35,276
Did I leave it in the restaurant?

361
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,675
Where are you going?

362
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:37,875
You'll get rained on on the way.

363
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,966
I don't know who is shaking up who.

364
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:07,905
You almost smashed your head into it.

365
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:11,205
I'm totally tempted.

366
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:21,016
I think we won the game.

367
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:23,115
We probably did.

368
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,685
I didn't think we'd make it to the final.

369
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:31,966
What are you thinking right now?

370
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:35,066
Nothing.

371
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:38,665
Is she still sad...

372
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,466
because of Tae Seong?

373
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,435
Do you...

374
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:46,506
want to cheer for the final in the streets with me?

375
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:48,175
- Cheer in the streets? - Yes.

376
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:53,316
The one tempting others is the problem.

377
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:54,954
The CSAT is around the corner.

378
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:56,316
We have to study.

379
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:57,355
Hey.

380
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:01,056
We can't study in that tiny space all the time.

381
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:03,424
Once in a while, we should refresh ourselves...

382
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,655
and get some fresh air.

383
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,296
It's just for one day.

384
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:07,766
No?

385
00:25:09,296 --> 00:25:11,935
That English vocabulary book you were studying.

386
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,365
I'll go if you memorize all of it.

387
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:14,605
All of it?

388
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:17,175
That means you don't want to go.

389
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:19,306
You should study hard.

390
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,546
What if I memorize all of it?

391
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:25,286
You said you'd go if I memorized everything.

392
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:28,615
I'll memorize everything in one day.

393
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,226
Let's go.

394
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:47,036
I can't believe what he's doing.

395
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:48,476
What's wrong with him?

396
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:54,006
It has stopped raining already.

397
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:56,046
Why are you under the same umbrella...

398
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:57,375
side by side?

399
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:07,325
- Where have you been? - None of your business.

400
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:08,855
What brought you here?

401
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:10,955
We need to talk.

402
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,364
I have nothing to say to you.

403
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,425
I do.

404
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:14,625
You can just listen.

405
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:22,306
- She doesn't want to. - Get out of the way.

406
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,635
You're the one who got in the way first.

407
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,006
Did I have to turn on the turn signal?

408
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:31,375
Okay.

409
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:33,415
Let me hear what you have to say.

410
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:38,486
Wait a second.

411
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:41,425
What?

412
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:43,625
You have to act cool.

413
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,326
Have a nice talk.

414
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:50,895
I'll see you tomorrow.

415
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:57,205
Bye.

416
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:58,405
Sure.

417
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,015
You have to...

418
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,046
forget about me now.

419
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,216
What's that?

420
00:27:08,246 --> 00:27:09,414
Stop thinking about me.

421
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:10,855
How do I do that?

422
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:12,955
You're crazy.

423
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,326
Kim Tae Seong, this crazy guy,

424
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:20,395
is a sinner.

425
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,695
I'm a sinner who loved a girl to death.

426
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:24,865
Tae Seong!

427
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:29,306
If love is a sin,

428
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:31,135
I should be sentenced to life.

429
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:32,605
This is nuts.

430
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,006
Im Sol.

431
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:37,145
You're my star!

432
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,355
No way.

433
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:50,496
Gosh.

434
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:51,966
What do you want to tell me?

435
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:54,725
I'm a busy person, so tell me quickly.

436
00:27:54,726 --> 00:27:56,296
I heard Ga Hyun bullied you.

437
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:57,766
I didn't know.

438
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,205
Were you hurt a lot?

439
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:02,904
You cried a lot, didn't you?

440
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:05,175
No. I didn't cry at all.

441
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:06,704
You didn't? Why not?

442
00:28:06,705 --> 00:28:08,275
Did I have to cry...

443
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,414
because being used wasn't enough?

444
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:10,516
That's not right.

445
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,985
But why do I feel sad about you not crying?

446
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:14,285
Why would you feel sad about it?

447
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:15,316
Exactly.

448
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:18,415
Anyway, I'm sorry.

449
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:20,256
I came here to tell you that.

450
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:21,756
I'm so sorry.

451
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:24,955
You're not a complete jerk, I guess.

452
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:26,695
Also, I didn't use you.

453
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,664
Gosh. Why did you ask me out, then?

454
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,694
You said you liked me.

455
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:32,005
Do you go out with everyone that likes you?

456
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,035
No.

457
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:34,835
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

458
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,006
- What? - What?

459
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,306
Did I...

460
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:40,105
really like you?

461
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:42,915
- What kind of... - That's right.

462
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,476
I liked you.

463
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,384
Gosh. You're ridiculous.

464
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:50,455
What now?

465
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:52,586
I think I liked you a lot.

466
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:54,055
Whatever.

467
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:56,025
If you came to give the teddy bear back,

468
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,826
give it to me and beat it.

469
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,526
That's not it.

470
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,694
What? What else are you going to do?

471
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:03,765
Are you going to throw it away?

472
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:04,836
Give it to me.

473
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:06,806
Let go of it because that's not it.

474
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,035
It's my security teddy bear.

475
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:09,275
I take it with me everywhere I go.

476
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,076
Gosh. Stop talking nonsense and give it to me.

477
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:13,205
It's mine.

478
00:29:15,276 --> 00:29:18,685
Tae Seong, our love will last forever.

479
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:22,884
Tae Seong, our love will last forever.

480
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:25,726
Should we just stay together forever?

481
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:26,925
No.

482
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:31,296
I think the worst villain in my life...

483
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:32,966
is my past self.

484
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:44,576
What is it?

485
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,645
- My legs are asleep. - What?

486
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:50,246
Gosh.

487
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:52,815
For goodness' sake.

488
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:54,845
What a fine son you are!

489
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:57,055
You are weeding in a squat...

490
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:59,755
despite your long legs just to help your father.

491
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,796
Gosh. You are all mature now.

492
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:07,996
Son. Do you know that?

493
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,965
These plants have ears too.

494
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:13,665
When you pat them every day,

495
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:16,275
saying, "You're pretty,"

496
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:18,006
and say something nice,

497
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,844
- they grow healthier. - Why isn't she coming back?

498
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:22,045
What do they have to talk about?

499
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:24,415
From now on, I'll only say...

500
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,286
something nice to you.

501
00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:30,915
Gosh. My adorable son...

502
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,555
Son of a gun!

503
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:36,425
Does that look like weed to you?

504
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:40,226
Why did you pull out and shake the healthy chilli plant?

505
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:41,966
Get lost!

506
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:44,335
This prick. Are you helping me or distracting me?

507
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:45,966
That jerk. Gosh.

508
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:49,235
Gosh. My chilli. I'm sorry.

509
00:30:49,236 --> 00:30:50,935
Goodness. My babies.

510
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,805
- Gosh. I'm sorry. My goodness. - Come on, Dad.

511
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:55,516
It's your brother's fault.

512
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,854
Why do you fight all the time?

513
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:12,425
You should graduate high school, at least.

514
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,226
You're going to regret it terribly later.

515
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:19,036
Is it good?

516
00:31:21,665 --> 00:31:22,806
"Forever," my foot.

517
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:32,445
Wait!

518
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:41,286
Mom, are you going somewhere?

519
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:42,624
I told you...

520
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,594
that I'm going to Jeju Island with my friends.

521
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:45,895
- To Jeju Island? - Yes.

522
00:31:47,095 --> 00:31:50,296
This is the day when Mom went on a trip with the guy.

523
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,405
You're going to Jeju Island when your daughter is a senior?

524
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,535
You're going with the guy who dropped you off the other day.

525
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:55,576
Right?

526
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:56,905
It doesn't matter who I go with.

527
00:31:56,935 --> 00:31:59,076
Also, being a senior doesn't make you special.

528
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:01,944
I have worked my socks off to raise you two by myself.

529
00:32:01,945 --> 00:32:03,045
Can't I even go on a trip as I please?

530
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,776
I feel bad for Dad. That's why!

531
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:07,614
He had worried about you until the day he died.

532
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:10,316
I feel bad because he couldn't die comfortably because of you!

533
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:17,496
Handwash your school uniform every day.

534
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,525
Don't put it in the laundry basket, mixing it with coloured clothes.

535
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,365
You can't ask me to buy a new one after it gets coloured.

536
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,435
I get it.

537
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:28,605
Also, put the dishes in the water after eating.

538
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:31,904
Because you leave leftover food in them,

539
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:34,345
they are crowded with maggots and fruit flies. It's gross!

540
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,115
Tell your brother.

541
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:38,745
If he gets caught sleeping in the streets...

542
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,785
after drinking so much, I'll kick him out.

543
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:41,815
Don't forget to lock the doors.

544
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:43,786
Don't leave the windows open because it's hot.

545
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:45,485
Gosh. I got it.

546
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:47,384
Mom, we're not babies anymore.

547
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:49,624
You are old, but there's nothing you can do on your own.

548
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,795
It's because...

549
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:52,695
you always look after me and Geum.

550
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:54,265
Actually, we'd take better care of ourselves with you gone.

551
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,465
Is that so?

552
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,565
Since you're all grown up, you'll be fine without me.

553
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:58,695
You bet!

554
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:03,435
See? There's no point in raising the kids.

555
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:04,836
Did you realize that now?

556
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:07,246
When you get old and sick, a husband is better than your kids.

557
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:09,175
Why don't you hurry and find a new husband?

558
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:11,944
Hey. If I'm old and sick, I should die...

559
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:13,246
instead of finding a husband.

560
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:15,915
I'm done now. Stop talking nonsense and get back in.

561
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:17,756
I'll get going. Study hard!

562
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:20,925
Have fun, Mom!

563
00:34:27,926 --> 00:34:29,354
So, you're saying...

564
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:31,595
something might happen to you...

565
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:35,596
not today or tomorrow but on September 1?

566
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:39,265
You want to tell me what it is but you can't.

567
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,204
Yes. That's exactly right.

568
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,776
For goodness' sake. Hey.

569
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,144
If you think something might happen at the reservoir,

570
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:48,145
you can stay away from it that day, right?

571
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,244
That's true, but...

572
00:34:50,245 --> 00:34:51,415
Okay.

573
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:53,946
Here.

574
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:55,784
Take this...

575
00:34:55,785 --> 00:34:57,955
and get back home safely. Okay?

576
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:00,555
- Okay. - Yes.

577
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:01,825
Go on.

578
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,225
Don't come here because something might happen to you!

579
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:09,336
She looks perfectly normal, but...

580
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,796
Hello, Detective Kim.

581
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:13,605
What do you mean something might happen?

582
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:15,265
It's just gibberish.

583
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,006
What brought you here?

584
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:19,304
Can I take a look at last month's night patrol log...

585
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:20,676
by each time period?

586
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:22,945
Lee Seung Yuop hits the ball that came close to his body.

587
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:24,915
It's going deep to the right.

588
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:26,284
- It goes over the right fielder. - Gosh.

589
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:28,785
- We are going to win. - It goes over...

590
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:30,455
the fence!

591
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:36,796
Hello?

592
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:38,966
Lee Seung Yuop finally did it!

593
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,725
Hello?

594
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,966
Gosh. You should say something when you made a call.

595
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:47,705
I...

596
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:50,075
I found a cell phone.

597
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:53,875
Right. It's my granddaughter's phone.

598
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:56,575
You must have picked it up.

599
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:59,546
How can I give it back to her?

600
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:01,514
I'll go and pick it up.

601
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:02,656
Where do you want to meet?

602
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,515
It won't work.

603
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,185
I'm in the countryside.

604
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:10,156
Can you send it as a package, then?

605
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:12,665
I'll give you the address.

606
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:16,736
Should I do that?

607
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:44,696
(Mode Textbook, Math 1)

608
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:56,906
What's the point of studying?

609
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:45,926
When did she come?

610
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:20,386
This is my number one treasure.

611
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:46,245
I like you.

612
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:48,346
I...

613
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,656
like you.

614
00:39:00,926 --> 00:39:03,265
My friend is hardworking...

615
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,395
Hardworking...

616
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:17,616
I must be out of my mind!

617
00:39:18,515 --> 00:39:19,586
What do you mean?

618
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:27,926
It's nothing.

619
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,895
But then...

620
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:33,026
- why is your face so red? - What?

621
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:40,836
Because it's hot.

622
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:43,736
Do you...

623
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:47,305
- know about it? - What?

624
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:49,276
Did you find out?

625
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:51,846
About what?

626
00:39:54,986 --> 00:39:56,055
That I...

627
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:03,995
That I memorized all the vocabulary.

628
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:06,164
- What? - You said you'd go with me...

629
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:08,165
to cheer for the final baseball game if I memorize all the vocabulary.

630
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:10,696
You can test me if you can't believe me.

631
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:13,565
No. It's not that I don't believe you.

632
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:14,805
You're coming with me tomorrow, then.

633
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:18,975
It's because I have something to tell you.

634
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:24,875
Go, Korea!

635
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,915
Go, Korea!

636
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,954
- Go, Korea! - Yes. This place is heated...

637
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:35,285
with the people gathered to cheer for the national baseball team.

638
00:40:35,355 --> 00:40:36,554
They've won 8 games out of 8 games.

639
00:40:36,555 --> 00:40:39,995
Our baseball team has been writing history with each game.

640
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:42,764
- The male baseball team... - Go, Korea!

641
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:45,796
Will they continue to win the gold medal?

642
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,765
- Sol, here! - Go, Korea!

643
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:51,776
Go, Korea.

644
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:54,605
Go, Korea!

645
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:57,816
- Excuse me. Goodness. - Go, Korea!

646
00:40:58,116 --> 00:40:59,386
- Excuse me. - Go, Korea!

647
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:00,846
Excuse me.

648
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:01,886
Excuse me.

649
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:03,716
You came early.

650
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:06,486
Yes. I wanted to get a good spot.

651
00:41:07,055 --> 00:41:08,225
It'll be easy to watch it from here.

652
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:09,955
Really? Wasn't it hot?

653
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:22,466
I feel much better.

654
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:24,736
I nearly died from the heat.

655
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,346
I know. It's really hot.

656
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:49,225
It's better this way, isn't it?

657
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,705
Hyun Ju is here!

658
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:02,046
You're here.

659
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:04,846
You are here too.

660
00:42:07,145 --> 00:42:08,514
What about Sol? Did she go somewhere?

661
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:09,716
You know better than me.

662
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:21,125
Hyun Ju, you came with the chicken.

663
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:25,765
I bought it to eat with Sol while watching baseball.

664
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:27,165
If she's not here, I'm leaving.

665
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:29,605
Don't go.

666
00:42:38,116 --> 00:42:39,245
If you have to go,

667
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,256
leave the chicken behind.

668
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:54,525
The finale of baseball at the 2008 Beijing Olympics is here.

669
00:42:54,526 --> 00:42:56,164
The Korean baseball team is competing for the gold medal...

670
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:57,435
- for the first time. - Where did you get the octopus?

671
00:42:57,596 --> 00:42:59,196
- The final match is being held... - Oh, that?

672
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:03,575
Enough!

673
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:05,534
We've already seen dozens of guys doing Choi Min Sik's impression.

674
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:06,805
This is so unoriginal.

675
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,305
I get why you didn't get the role.

676
00:43:09,346 --> 00:43:10,514
Do you think your acting can be as moving as his...

677
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,116
just because you dress up like him?

678
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:14,846
Your acting has to be authentic.

679
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:16,716
You're right.

680
00:43:16,955 --> 00:43:18,715
I always get rejected at the auditions.

681
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:20,055
So I wanted to stand out with that.

682
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:22,455
You're right.

683
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:26,066
Why does he look so pathetic? It's making me want to protect him.

684
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,625
Get a grip. You can't fall for someone out of pity.

685
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:30,765
Yes. Swing that! Go for it.

686
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:33,236
- It went to the side. A strike. - Gosh. Come on.

687
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:36,875
Hey. Why aren't you eating?

688
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:44,946
Here you go. Eat.

689
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:49,185
He's unexpectedly sweet. It's making my heart flutter.

690
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:51,216
Get a grip.

691
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:52,715
You cannot fall for him. Never.

692
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:55,354
He barely managed to hit the ball, and it landed between...

693
00:43:55,355 --> 00:43:58,426
- Hyun Ju. Take a look. - Lee Hong Gu is on base now.

694
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:02,466
The third hitter, Kim Hyun Soo, now has a better chance.

695
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:04,934
He was the hero of yesterday's game.

696
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,066
- It's clean. - He showed a great comeback.

697
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:08,664
When someone sees a chicken bone,

698
00:44:08,665 --> 00:44:11,975
make sure that person can't tell the kind of chicken you had.

699
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:14,906
Why am I getting impressed by stuff like that?

700
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,616
People like Im Geum gross me out the most...

701
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:19,116
in the world.

702
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,546
Gosh. But still. He's cute.

703
00:44:24,055 --> 00:44:25,555
- The fourth hitter, Lee Seung Yuop. - No, don't fall for him.

704
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:28,255
- Lee hits it to the outer field. - Never fall for him.

705
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:30,025
That's a nice hit. It's travelling far to the left.

706
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:32,155
- Never. - It goes behind the left fielder.

707
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:34,764
Will it go over the fence?

708
00:44:34,765 --> 00:44:38,836
- No. - There it goes!

709
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:42,264
- It went over the fence. Yes! - Lee hits a home run.

710
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:45,205
Lee Seung Yuop hit a home run!

711
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:46,975
Hyun Ju!

712
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,216
We can totally win this game.

713
00:44:50,415 --> 00:44:53,785
Lee Seung Yuop hit a home run! This is crazy!

714
00:44:58,685 --> 00:44:59,724
I'm totally into him.

715
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:01,986
Yes. My sweetie pie.

716
00:45:04,026 --> 00:45:06,196
I'm watching baseball right now.

717
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:08,796
I heard that my princess was busy.

718
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:10,596
Yes.

719
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:12,836
Yes! See you tomorrow.

720
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:14,035
Here are my kisses.

721
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:16,705
Lee Seung Yuop brings the game to a nice start.

722
00:45:17,575 --> 00:45:20,175
He was able to overcome this crazy pressure of going fourth.

723
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,305
He's our superstar!

724
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:22,446
What?

725
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:24,545
Do you have a girlfriend?

726
00:45:24,546 --> 00:45:25,575
- Yes. - Our fourth hitter, Lee Seung Yuop!

727
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,285
- Why? - Gosh.

728
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:30,784
Am I not allowed to have a girlfriend?

729
00:45:30,785 --> 00:45:31,855
No!

730
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:33,785
Why did you tell me that just now?

731
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:37,526
Hey! Where are you going?

732
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:40,066
- Let's go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

733
00:45:40,995 --> 00:45:42,465
- Please! - Oh, no!

734
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:44,394
- That's a good hit. - No!

735
00:45:44,395 --> 00:45:46,165
- It keeps going! - Come on!

736
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:47,805
It's a home run.

737
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:50,236
- Seriously? - Oh, no.

738
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:52,236
The current score is 2 to 1.

739
00:45:52,676 --> 00:45:55,745
The Cuban team is not making this easy.

740
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:01,785
- Let's go! - Go!

741
00:46:02,546 --> 00:46:04,355
- Lee Yong Kyu! - Here's Lee Yong Kyu.

742
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:07,986
- Lee Yong Kyu! - Lee Yong Kyu!

743
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,725
That's a great hit by Lee. There it goes!

744
00:46:11,256 --> 00:46:12,395
Gosh!

745
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:16,095
Park makes it to the third base.

746
00:46:16,096 --> 00:46:18,466
- Lee Yong Kyu! - Nicely done.

747
00:46:18,995 --> 00:46:20,905
Thanks to Lee, Korea scores a point.

748
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:23,005
- Lee Yong Kyu! - The score is 3 to 2.

749
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:24,835
- Korea is pushing forward! - Lee Yong Kyu!

750
00:46:24,836 --> 00:46:27,545
(Sol hearts Tae Seong.)

751
00:46:27,546 --> 00:46:30,445
Hey, how busy is your dad exactly?

752
00:46:30,446 --> 00:46:32,144
- His son is hospitalized. - Korea is leading...

753
00:46:32,145 --> 00:46:34,215
by 1 point with a score of 3 to 2.

754
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:36,454
And there's so much heat coming from the cheers...

755
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:38,415
of the people on the street.

756
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:40,155
- Hey, - Their passion...

757
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:41,755
- weren't they Sol and Ryu Sun Jae? - for the Korean baseball team...

758
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:43,055
- has gone beyond the Peninsula. - Gosh.

759
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:46,155
It shows that she's a good student. That's a smart girl.

760
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:48,765
She pulled herself together and started dating a decent guy.

761
00:46:49,026 --> 00:46:50,035
Right?

762
00:46:50,336 --> 00:46:51,465
- Get out. - What?

763
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:52,764
- Just go home. Hey. - What are you doing?

764
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:54,164
- Wrap it up and eat it at home. - Hey.

765
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:56,235
- Get out of here. - What's wrong with you?

766
00:46:56,236 --> 00:46:58,704
- I told you to get out, you jerk. - Come on. What's the matter?

767
00:46:58,705 --> 00:47:01,505
- Why are you pushing me? - Get out. Leave already.

768
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:02,875
But I already came to see you.

769
00:47:03,415 --> 00:47:05,176
Seriously. The game isn't even over yet.

770
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:10,184
It's the 9th inning with 1 out.

771
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:11,656
Let's see what happens.

772
00:47:11,986 --> 00:47:13,285
On the mound, we have...

773
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:14,656
Chong Tae Hyon as our pitcher.

774
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:16,655
No bunt. Is it a strike? He hit the ball!

775
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:18,054
- He went for it head-on. - It's a double play.

776
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:19,425
To the shortstop! To the first base!

777
00:47:19,426 --> 00:47:22,295
With three outs, Korea wins the game!

778
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:23,796
- It's a gold medal! - Yes!

779
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,236
- Korea wins the gold medal! - Yes!

780
00:47:26,836 --> 00:47:29,506
Korea wins the game with the score of 3 to 2.

781
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:39,216
(Korean Baseball Team, Gold Medal)

782
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:01,765
- Let's go, Korea! - Let's go, Korea!

783
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:04,975
- Let's go, Korea! - Let's go, Korea!

784
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:07,304
- Let's go, Korea! - Let's go, Korea!

785
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:08,475
There's something I have to tell you.

786
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:11,245
- What did you say? - Let's go, Korea!

787
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,375
It's a historical day...

788
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:13,545
- for the Korean baseball team. - Let's go, Korea!

789
00:48:13,546 --> 00:48:15,446
That was an incredible game!

790
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:23,426
(Korean Baseball Team, Gold Medal)

791
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:31,295
- Let's go, Korea! - Team Korea...

792
00:48:31,296 --> 00:48:32,495
has won!

793
00:48:37,006 --> 00:48:38,035
What is it?

794
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:39,705
What's this about?

795
00:48:41,305 --> 00:48:42,875
I was going to wait a bit longer.

796
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:46,216
But I don't think I can hide it anymore.

797
00:48:46,645 --> 00:48:47,645
What?

798
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:51,415
Do you know what I despised the most?

799
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:56,225
The rain.

800
00:48:58,325 --> 00:49:00,325
After spending my entire day in the pool,

801
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:04,196
I would hate it and become irritated...

802
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:05,866
by the dampened air of the rain outside.

803
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:08,506
But...

804
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:11,776
it rained when I saw you for the first time.

805
00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:14,975
I liked it that day.

806
00:49:17,216 --> 00:49:19,546
I didn't think I could suddenly like something I hated my whole life.

807
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,285
I just thought that day was an exception.

808
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:24,386
But I was wrong.

809
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:27,026
I still don't hate them.

810
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:30,555
I don't think I'll ever hate them.

811
00:49:33,495 --> 00:49:34,596
The rain...

812
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:37,866
and you.

813
00:49:43,035 --> 00:49:44,075
Sol.

814
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,105
I like you...

815
00:49:50,716 --> 00:49:51,816
a lot.

816
00:50:05,656 --> 00:50:06,725
Well,

817
00:50:07,196 --> 00:50:09,894
I don't expect you to give me an answer right away.

818
00:50:09,895 --> 00:50:10,935
Sun Jae.

819
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:14,605
I...

820
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:24,316
Gosh. Darn it.

821
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:28,685
Answer it. It might be urgent.

822
00:50:37,355 --> 00:50:38,454
Hello.

823
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:39,625
This is Kim Tae Seong.

824
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:41,696
Are you with Sol right now?

825
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:43,296
Why are you suddenly calling me?

826
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:55,846
Let's go.

827
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:58,316
What? What's wrong?

828
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:01,446
Your mother...

829
00:51:02,546 --> 00:51:03,616
is in the hospital right now.

830
00:51:05,285 --> 00:51:06,316
What?

831
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:17,695
Doctor, there's a patient named...

832
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:19,395
Are you Sol?

833
00:51:19,636 --> 00:51:20,866
I almost didn't recognize you.

834
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:22,466
We met a few times when you were young.

835
00:51:22,765 --> 00:51:23,875
Do you not remember me?

836
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:35,086
We did a biopsy when we did a gastroscopy.

837
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:36,515
The result wasn't so good.

838
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:38,255
Luckily,

839
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:40,256
we caught it early, so she'll be okay with the surgery.

840
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:42,926
I really had no idea.

841
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:45,926
How come I didn't know about this?

842
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:47,994
Actually, we'd take better care of ourselves with you gone.

843
00:51:47,995 --> 00:51:50,034
We're too old to be babied by you.

844
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:52,195
Since you're all grown up, you'll be fine without me.

845
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:53,305
You bet!

846
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:58,475
I told her I would be fine without her.

847
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:01,375
I had no idea that she was sick.

848
00:52:14,225 --> 00:52:15,355
It's not your fault.

849
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:21,566
Don't beat yourself up.

850
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,145
Thank you for calling me.

851
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:37,676
If it weren't for you,

852
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:39,745
my mom would've gotten the surgery without any of her family.

853
00:52:40,216 --> 00:52:41,284
How is she?

854
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:43,915
She just went into the operating room. She'll be okay.

855
00:52:45,285 --> 00:52:46,585
By the way, what on earth did you do?

856
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:48,086
How did you end up breaking your arm?

857
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:49,784
You didn't get into a fight, did you?

858
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:50,855
I didn't.

859
00:52:51,196 --> 00:52:53,495
You must hold me in such low regard.

860
00:52:54,526 --> 00:52:55,825
I'm glad that you didn't.

861
00:53:06,136 --> 00:53:07,145
Tae Seong.

862
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:11,145
I don't know what kind of scars you have...

863
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:13,176
or the pain you have to face.

864
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,185
But I want you to spend the time you have now...

865
00:53:17,415 --> 00:53:20,386
in the best way possible, so you have no regrets later on.

866
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:24,156
This is all I can say to my first love.

867
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:26,125
So please.

868
00:53:26,796 --> 00:53:28,696
You should try to change your fate too.

869
00:53:29,825 --> 00:53:31,696
I'll pray for that with all of my heart.

870
00:53:33,736 --> 00:53:34,765
I'll get going now.

871
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,145
What's up with her?

872
00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:47,546
It's like she's saying goodbye.

873
00:53:49,586 --> 00:53:51,386
I'm injecting analgesics now.

874
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:53,486
Please tell me if you're still in a lot of pain.

875
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,955
Thank you.

876
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:02,325
How about your grandma?

877
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,335
I told Geum to take her home...

878
00:54:04,336 --> 00:54:05,736
and come back tomorrow after getting some sleep.

879
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:07,905
Don't worry. Get some sleep, Mom.

880
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:09,006
Well done.

881
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:26,986
Why did you come back?

882
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:31,495
What about her surgery?

883
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:33,625
Did it go well?

884
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:35,665
Yes.

885
00:54:37,435 --> 00:54:38,566
Did you get some sleep?

886
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:42,736
Look at your face.

887
00:54:43,836 --> 00:54:45,205
You might pass out if you keep this up.

888
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:47,846
I'm okay.

889
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:49,605
You didn't eat, did you?

890
00:54:49,846 --> 00:54:50,874
Should I get you some food?

891
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,915
I'm really okay.

892
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:54,685
You should go.

893
00:54:58,256 --> 00:55:00,785
Okay. I'll see you go inside.

894
00:55:01,055 --> 00:55:02,285
I'll come back tomorrow.

895
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:03,796
No.

896
00:55:04,756 --> 00:55:05,796
Don't come back.

897
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:09,796
Sun Jae.

898
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:12,935
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

899
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:19,236
Well,

900
00:55:20,406 --> 00:55:21,846
I didn't expect an answer.

901
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:23,744
Why are you acting so cold?

902
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:25,175
You're just mistaken with your feelings...

903
00:55:25,176 --> 00:55:27,244
- because I confused you. - That's not true.

904
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:29,785
I'm sorry for being nosy and getting your feelings confused.

905
00:55:29,886 --> 00:55:31,756
- That's not true. - You know what?

906
00:55:32,386 --> 00:55:34,656
Hearing this from you makes me feel uncomfortable and pressured.

907
00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:38,555
So...

908
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:40,966
don't have any feelings for me.

909
00:55:49,836 --> 00:55:51,506
I forgot to ask you the most important thing.

910
00:55:51,736 --> 00:55:53,135
So how do you feel about him?

911
00:55:53,136 --> 00:55:54,345
What's the point?

912
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:55,845
I'll have to leave soon anyway.

913
00:55:55,846 --> 00:55:56,875
To go where?

914
00:55:58,515 --> 00:56:01,045
Even if you end up at a college in the countryside or abroad,

915
00:56:01,046 --> 00:56:02,986
don't think about those excuses. Regardless of everything,

916
00:56:03,086 --> 00:56:04,316
what does your heart tell you?

917
00:56:50,765 --> 00:56:53,935
(The day of the accident)

918
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:56,034
My beautiful sister.

919
00:56:56,035 --> 00:56:58,475
Could you bring my phone charger?

920
00:56:58,506 --> 00:56:59,775
I forgot to bring it.

921
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:00,776
At this hour?

922
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:02,045
Isn't Mom getting discharged tomorrow?

923
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:03,375
Just get through the night without it.

924
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:04,775
I auditioned for a role in a movie.

925
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:07,015
They said they would call my phone. Please?

926
00:57:07,046 --> 00:57:08,485
Come on.

927
00:57:08,486 --> 00:57:10,485
You're staying home on the first day of school.

928
00:57:10,486 --> 00:57:11,656
Can't you even do me a favour?

929
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:12,816
I'm sorry.

930
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:15,185
But I can't go anywhere today.

931
00:57:15,325 --> 00:57:16,724
So you can come here and pick it up.

932
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,156
Or buy it at a store nearby. Figure it out on your own.

933
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:28,236
Yes. I just have to get through the last two hours...

934
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:31,935
safely without any accident.

935
00:58:17,216 --> 00:58:18,316
(A new message has arrived.)

936
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,895
Your umbrella is still at the study room.

937
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:30,836
Are you not...

938
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:32,895
coming to the study room because of me?

939
00:58:33,435 --> 00:58:35,665
I won't make you feel uncomfortable. Let's meet and talk.

940
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:37,435
It will only be a minute.

941
00:58:38,176 --> 00:58:39,605
I'll wait for you at the playground.

942
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:49,586
I'm sorry.

943
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:51,216
I can't come out today.

944
00:58:51,756 --> 00:58:52,756
Don't wait for me.

945
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:58,325
(Well done. You sent a message to Ryu Sun Jae.)

946
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:21,816
Where is he going?

947
00:59:22,346 --> 00:59:23,616
Did he not read my message?

948
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:07,625
He can't still be waiting for me.

949
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:58,046
Have you seen me before the mock competition?

950
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,116
We had met.

951
01:00:59,145 --> 01:01:02,245
You mistook me for a courier before.

952
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:03,855
You probably don't remember that.

953
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:06,756
Sir!

954
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:12,995
There was a rain shower...

955
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:14,725
on the day I saw her for the first time.

956
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:17,535
She put a yellow umbrella over me with a smile.

957
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:20,196
I couldn't breathe because my heart was fluttering.

958
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:22,966
No way.

959
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:24,705
It rained when I saw you for the first time.

960
01:01:25,906 --> 01:01:27,075
I liked it that day.

961
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:29,406
Sol.

962
01:01:30,176 --> 01:01:31,276
I like you...

963
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:35,015
a lot.

964
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:38,785
Ever since then...

965
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:32,495
(We'd like to thank Han Seung Yeon for the special appearance.)

966
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:45,515
(Lovely Runner)

967
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:48,015
She made a big fuss about not leaving the house today.

968
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:50,785
Since I know everything, I can change it.

969
01:03:51,886 --> 01:03:52,985
Over here.

970
01:03:52,986 --> 01:03:54,386
- Excuse me. Give me your name. - Just this once.

971
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,324
I knew it.

972
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:58,355
Determination can change anyone's fate. Right?

973
01:03:58,455 --> 01:03:59,725
What? What happened?

974
01:04:00,156 --> 01:04:02,065
Can you come quickly?

975
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:04,066
He won't be in the movie because of you. How will you fix it?

976
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,066
We must cast Ryu Sun Jae for this role no matter what. Okay?

977
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:07,804
Who is this?

978
01:04:07,805 --> 01:04:09,265
Do we know each other?

979
01:04:09,836 --> 01:04:10,935
Could it be...

980
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,336
It won't be.

981
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:15,475
Don't come, Sun Jae.
