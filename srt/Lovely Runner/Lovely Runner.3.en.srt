Have you...

7
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,119
ever been in a car accident before?

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,159
Yes.

9
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,960
It was 15 years ago.

10
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,899
But I don't remember how I got into that accident...

11
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,429
or how much pain I was in.

12
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:03,840
I don't remember a thing at all.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,939
In a way, it's a blessing.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm sorry about earlier.

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,950
About my misunderstanding with the swim pants.

16
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,819
Anyone would have misunderstood the situation.

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,359
You did it because you were worried about me.

18
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,060
I did.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,969
I know.

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,769
But I'm still going to compete.

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,170
I'll participate...

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,379
in the competition and win a medal no matter what.

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,980
But don't worry.

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,780
I'll make sure the opposite of your dream comes true.

25
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,450

- You got this! - Ryu Sun Jae!

31
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,409
Sun Jae, you're going to rock it!

32
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,509
Let's go!

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,919

- Be quiet. - Ryu Sun Jae!

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,060
Quiet down.

37
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,580

40
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,490
It was the first competition after my shoulder surgery.

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,460
That competition ended up being my last one.

42
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,689
I regretted, wondering if I had pushed myself too far...

43
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,959
out of ambition.

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Perhaps, it happened because I was destined...

45
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:45,259
to be a singer.

46
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,469
Is there such thing as a destiny in life?

47
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,809
Something we can neither change nor defy.

48
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,280
Something like inevitability.

49
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,609
Due to many groundless rumors and hate comments,

50
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,280
the late singer had a tough time.

51

By the way, she used to chase Kim Tae Seong around.

75

Are you okay with that?

76
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,829
She's been chasing me around these days.

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,930
She said she was my fan.

78

Hey, listen.

79
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,239
Being someone's fan...

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,800
and liking someone romantically are different. You know?

81
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,509
It's not like they're dating.

82
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,879
Gosh, you sound like a real man.

83
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,480

He thought...

88
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,990
I was walking down the aisle when I walked for the first time...

89
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,328
- because I was so good at it. - So what?

90
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,959
Even if I don't have experience, I can do a good job.

91
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,959
Just wait until I win the gold medal tomorrow.

92
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll tell her I like her.

93
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,769
Gosh. Hey.

94
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,800
You think telling a girl about your feelings is that easy?

95
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,339
Anyway,

96
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,069
make sure your timing is good.

I'm hungry too. What do you want to eat?

Pardon?

137

I get to have a meal with you.

"Otaku?" What does that mean?

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,729
It means something similar to a fan.

141
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,200
I told you I was your fan.

142
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,399

Are you his fan?

Or do you like him?

149
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,518

150

Not at all.

151

- Not at all? - Right.

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,059
But why are you asking me about that?

153
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,830
You were with him yesterday.

154
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,240
I was just curious.

155
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:34,870

Sure. I'll buy you a tastier meal next time.

By the way, this path is beautiful.

162
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,740
Wait. Why did you want us to meet in private?

163
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,039
Is it now?

164
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,850
I just...

165
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,649
felt bad that I misunderstood the situation last night.

166
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,919
No need to feel bad.

167
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,950
You get a free pass with everything.

168
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,019
It's now.

169
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,059
And I wanted to tell you...

170
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,429
how I felt. Like my feelings toward you.

171
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,369
- Do you have 50 cents? - Feeling cents?

172
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,029
- What? - What?

173
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,268
Fifty cents.

174
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,370
Yes. Feeling... Fifty... Fifty cents?

175
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,639
Oh, the coins. Fifty cents.

176
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,350
Why do you need 50 cents?

177
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,779
I want to do that.

178
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,950
What?

179
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,450
Isn't that for passport pictures?

180
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,789
Could you please take it with me?

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,730
Pretty please?

182
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,499
I was really envious of the fans...

183
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,639
who took selfies with you at the autograph signings.

184
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,669
Take it together?

185
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,840
Yes.

186
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,049
I don't like taking pictures.

187
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,080
I see.

188
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,288
I can't force you then.

189
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,450
The sun...

190
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,289
Gosh, it's scorching hot today.

191
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,820
Let's go in there for a second.

192
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,099
That's the path. Sun Jae!

193
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,929
(Passport Pictures, ID Pictures, You've chosen the passport picture.)

194
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,609
- Your picture will be taken now. - It's set.

195
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,740
It's going to start now.

196
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,779
- Look at the camera now. - One,

197
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,309
- two, - Where is it?

198
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,480
- three. - Over there?

199
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,980
No.

200
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,789
Look at the camera lens here.

201
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,820
- I see. There? - Yes.

202
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,859
One, two,

203
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,230
- Come on. Smile. - three.

204
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,940
He's the master of photo shoots. What's wrong with him?

205
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:22,769
Then do this at least.

206
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,009
What's that? A lump on your face?

207
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,879
A lump?

208
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,279
It's not a lump. It looks like a heart.

209
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,980
Gosh.

210
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,850
You want me to act all cute?

211
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,219
Gosh. I'm not doing it.

212
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,490
- Your picture will be taken now. - Hey, it's starting now.

213
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,419
- Come on. Try it. - One,

214

two, three.

215
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,000
Happy now?

216
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,139
Is it now?

217
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,980
Hey.

218
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,519
It's now.

219
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,080
I have something to tell you.

220
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,090
Okay.

221
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,690
I...

222
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,659
- like... - Your pictures are ready.

223
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,600
Our pictures must be ready. Wait.

224
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,639
So cute!

225
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,169
They came out nicely.

226
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,539
Where should I put them up?

227
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,519
Were you able to tell her?

228
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,820
As if.

229
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,970
Yes. Now isn't a bad time.

230
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,970
- Hey. - Don't even say a word.

231
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,110
What?

232
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,350
This is driving me crazy.

233
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,190
Is there an accident?

234
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,990
There's rarely a traffic jam here.

235
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,519
What?

236
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,419
What is it?

237
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,259
It's nothing. Never mind.

238
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,528
I can't open up about my bodily functions...

239
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,870
to my favorite idol star.

240
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,769
Mom. I need to pee.

241
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,070
Oh, no.

242
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,038
You can't hold it until the rest area?

243
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,909
I don't think I can.

244
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,210
Should I ask the driver to make a stop?

245
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,349
Yes!

246
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,479
Please tell the driver to make a stop for my sake.

247
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,778
Are you sure you can't hold it?

248
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,418
Tell her it's urgent. Come on.

249
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,419
Mom, I really have to go now.

250
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,789
I might pee here.

251
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,359
Wait.

252
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,860
Please.

253
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,299
Here.

254
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,929
Pee in here. I'll cover you.

255
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,740
Sir!

256
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,679
Please pull over.

257
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,409
Here?

258
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,580
Why all of a sudden?

259
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,480
I...

260
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,879
have an urgent business to take care of.

261
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
What?

262
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,888
You should have gone at the rest area earlier.

263
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,389
Please, sir.

264
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,330
(Jeonju, Seoul)

265
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:35,969
Thank you.

266
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,940
- Gosh. - Thank you.

267
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,580
Go ahead.

268
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,679
I'll go over there and get some cool air.

269
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,350
It's dangerous over there.

270
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,220
Go that way.

271
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,350
What?

272
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,888
Hurry up.

273
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:57,990
I'll keep an eye out...

274
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,559
right here for you.

275
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,830
Keep an eye out for me?

276
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,430
Darn it. I'm totally doomed.

277
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,109
Now...

278
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,109
can't be a good time.

279
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,609
No.

281
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,660
The toilet was completely fine before.

282
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,960
Why does it keep getting clogged?

283
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,429
- I... - Is there someone else?

284
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,500
You said you lived alone.

285
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,630
I mean...

286
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,500
You can't put wads of toilet paper in there.

287
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,069
I really didn't do that.

288
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,769
Did you perhaps put a lot of toilet paper in one go?

289
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,579
(Return Box)

290
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,919
Try to unclog it first.

291
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,519
We'll get a plumber to fix it another time.

292
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,690
Gosh. Is there a rat in our neighborhood?

293
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,769
What was that?

294
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,180
So it was him.

295
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,609
That guy is unbelievable.

296
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,769
We're here.

297
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,839
Good job today, Sun Jae.

298
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,839
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

299
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,299

Im Sol.

301
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,140
Thank you for coming today.

302
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,849
I can even travel halfway around the world for you.

303
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,420
No.

304
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,750
Even if you were to end up in a different time,

305
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,990
I would jump over time and space to see you.

306
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,059
I told you I was your fan.

307
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,240
So how much longer will you keep being my fan?

308
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,839
What?

309
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,099
I...

310
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,940
don't want you to be my fan anymore.

311
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,179
Why not?

312
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,240
What do I do?

313
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,379
I...

314
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,079
I need to stay by your side.

315
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,890
- I like... - Do you want to be friends?

316
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,250
Let's be friends!

317
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,910
What did you say? You didn't need experience to be good at it?

318
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,038
You didn't text me back. So I figured you couldn't tell her.

319
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,179
So your good friend here...

320
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,809
set a nice, romantic mood, so you could do your thing, man.

321
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,319
What? You don't want her to be your fan?

322
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,220
Seriously. Was that the best line you could think of?

323
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,588
That was so pathetic. It was the lamest...

324
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,618
Hey.

325
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,288
- Who said... - Hey, don't take it out on me.

326
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,328
you could spy on me?

327
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:56,859
- Who said... - She didn't dump you. Chill.

328
00:20:58,859 --> 00:20:59,960
She didn't?

329
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,799
Gosh. Come on.

330
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,599
You didn't do anything. You know?

331
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,440
You didn't even ask her out.

332
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,339
Gosh.

333
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,880
You're right.

334
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,750
Goodness.

335
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,680
Even if you were to end up in a different time,

336
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,960

339
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:01,690
He's going to make it.

340
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,029
Amazing! He'll break the record.

Granny, you're enjoying the view.

What?

346
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,769
I didn't know you had such a hobby.

347
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,369
I thought you came to see me.

348
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,279
Aren't you supposed to be in a class right now?

349
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,480
Stop ditching the class and go back in.

350
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,450
Let me tell you something since I have more life experience.

351

Some people can't come to school even if they want to.

When your life becomes rough later,

354
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,599
don't regret it, saying "I wished I lived diligently back then."

355
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,099
You couldn't even see me in the eyes when you asked me out, but now...

356

Even if you act like this, it won't work.

Sure. Thank you.

360
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,950
I'm so glad that I'm not your type.

361
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,509
Let me tell you something.

362
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,319
I cancel what I said about liking you.

363
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,450
I must have been out of my mind back then.

364
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,289
Sure. I refuse to accept the cancellation.

365
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,359
Don't refuse it when you're not even going to go out with me.

366
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,028

Tae Seong, why do you keep ignoring my calls?

369
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,809
Granny, how can I make someone go away and stop bothering me?

370
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,609
Give me some advice.

371
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,980
Right. Like this.

372
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,649
What? What exactly are you doing?

373
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,690
Not hanging out with you, boy!

374
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,689
Gosh. I don't know what I saw in him.

375
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,199
(Jagamgwan Gymnasium)

376
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,230
- What? - Hey.

377
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,029
Did you come to see Sun Jae again?

378
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,068
Yes. Where is he?

379
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,569
I wasn't in the training session.

380
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,339
Well, actually...

381
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,140
He was rushed to the hospital in the morning.

382
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,380
What?

383
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,979
The rotator cuff we operated has torn again.

384
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,980
It doesn't look good,

385
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,390
so we need to reoperate it as soon as possible.

386
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,759
I need reoperation?

387
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,390
There will be aftereffects from the operation,

388
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,058
but since it's your left arm,

389
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,329
you won't face serious problems in your daily life.

390
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,059
"In his daily life?"

391
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,299
What about his life as a swimmer?

392
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,199
As I told you before,

393
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,569
the reoperation requires at least 2 to 3 years of rehabilitation.

394
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,909
Even after the rehabilitation,

395
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,680
only about 80 percent of the rotator cuff will recover.

396
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,720
I think it will be impossible...

397
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,049
to regain...

398
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,349
the skills he used to have.

(Ryu Geun Duk, 35-1, Nuri-dong)

400
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,480
Is he not back yet when he went to the hospital in the morning?

401
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,890
(Ryu Geun Duk Galbi)

402
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:57,529

(Dad)

405
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,190
Look. The star of the party has arrived!

406
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,660
- Come! - Sun Jae!

407
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,358
- Our Sun Jae! - We have to celebrate!

408
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,028
- Yes, Sun Jae! - Attention!

409
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,529
Sun Jae, congratulations.

410
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,258
- You give it to him. - What?

411
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,629
- Yes, you should give it to him. - Yes.

412
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,329
Sun Jae, congratulations.

413
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:39,239
- Thank you. - I mean, my son...

414
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,768
hadn't competed in matches because he was in rehab.

415
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,440
But as soon as he got back in the game,

416
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,539
he won the gold medal.

417
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,210
And, he broke the record.

418
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,719
He turned the tournament upside down.

419
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,950
- Exactly. - Give him a round of applause.

420
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,318
Applaud.

421
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,818
Where will the Olympics be held after the one in Beijing this year?

422
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,389
- London! - That's right.

423
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,288
In four years, he will be in London...

424
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,088
to sweep the gold medals.

425
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,529
Get his autographs and photos beforehand.

426
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,199
- That's right. - I want his autograph.

427
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,798
- Let's do it. - Goodness.

428
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,839
Stand in line!

429
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,298
- Aunty, you should go first. - That's me.

430
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,808
You go first. Come on. Ladies should go first.

431
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,980
- Come on. - Sun Jae.

432
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,150
- Ryu Sun Jae! - Ryu Sun Jae!

433
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:25,150
- Goodness! - To who?

434
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,949
Of course, it's to Sun Jae.

435
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,689
- Yes, here's to Sun Jae! - To Sun Jae!

436
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,389
- Gold medalist, right? - Yes!

437
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,088
- Here. - Let me see the gold medal.

438
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,459
- I'll get it. - Sun Jae.

439
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,959
Isn't it awesome?

440
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,399
Of course, it is.

441
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,460
Take a seat for a second.

442
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,299
We can talk once everyone is gone.

443
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
I can't hold it any longer.

444
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:53,109
Son, I have good news.

445
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,710
Don't be too shocked when you hear it.

446
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,420
During the summer beak, you're going to Australia.

447
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,649
- What? - Coach Michael is there, you know.

448
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,619
He gave lessons to the national team.

449
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,720
I've booked his lessons for you.

450
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,459
You should get overseas training...

451
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,389
and get private lessons now...

452
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,130
like those famous swimmers.

453
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,529
Cancel it.

454
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,900
Why?

455
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:20,339
Gosh. Is it because of the money?

456
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,809
Don't worry about it.

457
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,639
You're the only son.

458
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,639
I've been saving up money.

459
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,379
For whom would I spend that money?

460
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,848
It's all for you.

461
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,380
Precisely. Don't do that.

462
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,219
Just cancel it.

463
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,618
What are you talking about?

464
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,588
I already paid for the lessons.

465
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,088
I already bought business-class flight tickets too.

466
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,720
Why did you decide everything on your own without asking me?

467
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,529
Well, it's because...

468
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,369
I thought you'd be happy.

469
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,299
I...

470
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,210
I'm going to quit swimming.

471
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,980
What?

472
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm going to quit swimming.

473
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,509
So,

474
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,480
cancel everything.

475
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,390
Wait.

476
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:11,789

479
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,130
I've been here once as part of the Sun Jae Tour.

480
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,430
It looks exactly the same.

481
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,440
Sun Jae!

482
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,170
For goodness' sake. What do you mean you're quitting swimming?

483
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,140
Why do you tell a joke in such a serious manner?

484
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,579
I'm not joking.

485
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,710
I'm not going to swim anymore.

486
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,818
Did you eat something wrong?

487
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,778
Are you talking in your right mind?

488
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,518
- Yes. - You can't say such a thing...

489
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,519
in your right mind!

490
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,629
Okay. I know it was tough...

491
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,630
to go through the rehab and the tournament.

492
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:53,329
You are protesting because you want to play around.

493
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,099
- That's not it. - Then what?

494
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,299
Why do you want to quit swimming?

495
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,768
Why are you being rebellious when it's long past your puberty?

496
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:03,970
Because I'm sick of it!

497
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,910
What? You are sick of it?

498
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,980
Yes.

499
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,279
The training is tough.

500
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,950
I'm tired of the frequent rehab. Now,

501
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,789
I'm fed up with swimming.

502
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,559
I want to quit gracefully...

503
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,089
when I made a new record.

504
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,059
No matter what, you can't quit.

505
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,568
It's such a crucial time.

506
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,869
You can't quit now with such a petty excuse.

507
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,368
Can't I do as I please when it's my life?

508
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:38,038
For the past decade, you did nothing but swim.

509
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,940
How are you going to make a living after quitting it?

510
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,640
I can do anything.

511
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,210
If there's nothing to do,

512
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,348
I can take it easy and work at your restaurant...

513
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,450
How dare you...

514
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,690
say such a thing?

515
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,089
If you are going to say that you'll quit swimming,

516
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,700
don't even think about coming home. Got it?

517
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:05,869
Well...

518
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,670

Stretch your arms forward.

522

(I can break the 1-minute-49-second barrier.)

527

The fate hasn't changed.

528
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,930
As if it's laughing at...

529
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:48,170
my desperateness and your endeavor,

530
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,970
it has turned out like this.

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,450
I can't stop the accident I had and can't save Sun Jae?

536
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,049
That's not fair.

537
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,190
If I can't change anything,

538
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,990
why am I even here?

539
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,269
Haven't you heard?

540
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,219
But we're at school.

541
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,119
- That's why I'm worried. - Don't be.

00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,679

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,550
You look better on screen.

546
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:36,809
What?

547
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,980
Technically, it's all his fault.

549
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,859
to attack Sun Jae with malicious comments and rumors.

550
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,189
They even tried to poison him too!

551
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,459
If it weren't for your fans,

552
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,690
Sun Jae wouldn't have suffered depression.

553
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,530
You have a murderous look in your eyes.

554
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,900
Forget it. You don't know anything about it right now.

555
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,869
Sun Jae stayed at your place last night, right?

556
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,269
How did you know?

557
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,669
How is he? Is he having a hard time?

558
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,840
Gosh. I don't know what he really thinks.

559
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,480
He won't speak about it.

560
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,780
If you don't want to regret it later, be nice to him.

561
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,348
Carefully look into his heart.

562
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,320
- Look behind carefully. - What?

563
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,159
Hey!

564
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,259
You're bleeding!

565
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,489
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

566
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,059
(So Bang Gwan)

567
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,469
What? I remember this.

568
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,400
Hey. Are you all right?

569
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,070
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

570
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,610
What? Our house is on fire?

571
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,219
Hey.

572
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,320
Hey! Are you all right?

573
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,500
Gosh. I'm hungry. It looks good.

574
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,238
- Hello? - Did you clean up the building?

575
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,839
Yes. I washed the stairs and windows clean.

576
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,539
Mom. I even scraped the gum off too.

577
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,139
Go to Unit 202 and unclog their toilet, then.

578
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,178
They complain that it keeps getting clogged.

579
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,908
They want us to redo the bathroom, but that's absurd.

580
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,980
Why isn't she picking up?

581
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,549
Mom. I know I'm no good,

582
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,388
but you can't ask me to unclog someone else's toilet.

583
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,649
I'm the owner of the building.

584
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,959
If I tell you to unclog it, unclog it.

585
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,089
Also, if the dishtowel is fully disinfected in boiling water,

586
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,488
turn the heat off and pour cold water into it.

587
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:30,789
Mom!

588
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,760
For goodness sake!

589
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,039
How can she force me to do this?

590
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,710
Gosh. It's disgusting.

591
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,849
For goodness' sake. Why is no one picking up?

592
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,488
Granny. Are you going for an excursion?

593
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:03,259
I'm glad you're here. Give me a ride.

594
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,058
I want to, but I'm extremely busy.

595
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,059
Sorry.

596
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,440
My house is on fire. Please.

597
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,638
Really?

598
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,239
If it's on fire, call 911.

599
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,369
Don't you know the number?

600
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,408
Now, jot it down.

601
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,839
It's 9, 1, 1.

602
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,679
I'm not sure if it's definitely on fire.

603
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,750
I have to stop it this time.

604
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:26,679
I have to stop it.

605
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,530
Hey. Isn't that Sol?

606
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,630
Sol!

607
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,670
Sol!

608
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,699
Sol!

609
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,039
Gosh.

610
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,479
Goodness. Where is she now?

611
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
We were going to go and study together.

612
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,320
Where are you after ditching the study hall?

613
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,619
I poured my heart and soul into it.

614
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,190
When did you come?

615
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,218
It stinks!

616
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,829
Did you poop in your pants?

617
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,059
Come on. I'm a grownup. I wouldn't crap in my pants.

618
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,800
Can't you see this?

619
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,169
It's disgusting. You should wash yourself.

620
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,900
You are the worst!

621
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,908
Hey. Why do you always treat me like a worm?

622
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,340
Tell me the reason while we're at it.

623
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,529
Don't you remember throwing up in my shoes after getting drunk?

624
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,530
It's a horrible trauma for me.

625
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,229
I remember it. So, I washed your shoes clean.

626
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,860
Do you still hold a grudge because of it?

627
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,070
Also,

628
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,669
there are five types of people I despise.

629
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,098
First, those who aren't clean.

630
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,768
Second, those lazy freeloaders.

631
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:56,968
Third, those who can't act their age.

632
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,238
Fourth, those with absurd dreams.

633
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,678
Fifth, all of the above, which is Im Geum.

634
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:03,779
What? Absurd dreams?

635
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,209
What do you know about my dreams?

636
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,549
I know you paid for acting lessons with your college tuition.

637
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,578
How did you know?

638
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,549
Because it's right in front of my math class.

639
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,590
By the way, your acting was terrible.

640
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:15,119
Hey, Were you the mole?

641
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,599
Gosh.

642
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,109
It smells like something is burning.

643
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,639
It's because my furious heart is on fire!

644
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,049
I cut you some slack because you are my sister's friend.

645
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,250
- How... - What?

646
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:43,690
What? Hyun Ju!

647
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,488
Fire!

648
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,690
Hyun Ju!

649
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,599
- Move. - Hyun Ju!

650
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,849
Hey. That's dangerous. Come here.

651
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,259
Hey. Hyun Ju.

652
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,599
Hyun Ju. Breathe.

653
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,000
Step aside.

654
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,110
Gosh. This is nuts!

655
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:41,639
I don't care now.

656
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,090
What are you doing?

657
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,739
My tooth!

658
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,119
I stopped it.

659
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,098
What's going on?

660
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,769
Gosh. Was there a fire?

661
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,570
What happened?

662
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,039
Mom!

663
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,010
Are you guys all right? Did you get hurt?

664
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,849
Thank you so much for today.

665
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,308
Thanks to you, I successfully changed the fate.

666
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,420
Come on. Fate is a big word.

667
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,049
Anyway, I will treat you big time soon.

668
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,559
You sneakily try to earn a date with me like this.

669
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,589
You're trying too hard.

670
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,059
Forget about it if you don't want it.

671
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,159
Bye.

672
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,070
- What? - Right there.

673
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,070
There's something next to your nose.

674
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,670
Where?

675
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,408
- Right here? - Here?

676
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,469
Right here.

677
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:19,980
Is it gone now?

678
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,610
Yes. It's clean now.

679
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,409
You're pretty.

680
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:27,718
What a ladies' man. You call everyone pretty.

681
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,719
(Acetaminophen)

682
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,550
You skipped school...

683
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,550
only to lie around here.

684
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,130
Dad.

685
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:33,920
Why did you hide such an important thing?

686
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,988
If you say you should undergo another surgery due to an injury,

687
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,618
who would curse...

688
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,460
or yell at you?

689
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,630
You stubborn fool.

690
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,029
You think you're all grown up...

691
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,929
just because you're taller than your father, don't you?

692
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,500
If you were in pain, you should've told your father immediately.

693
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,469
Why do you make me a bad father?

694
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,579
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,119
My gosh.

696
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,050
I invited all sorts of people and made a scene, knowing nothing.

697
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,730
They said your shoulder would hurt a lot.

698
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:27,800
Am I right?

699
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:38,010
You should've received treatment quickly then.

700
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:40,750
Do you want to live your whole life without using your arms?

701
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,859
I made a doctor's appointment for Monday.

702
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,559
Let's set the date for surgery first.

703
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,030
Let's fix your shoulder so that they don't hurt.

704
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,939
After that, you can receive rehabilitation or quit.

705
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,369
You can decide then.

706
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:04,969
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,550
Your heart is broken. Why are you saying you're sorry?

708
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,360
Let me see.

709
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,699
I don't see any bruises.

710
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,610
Well, you're weaker now.

711
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,840
I thought you were a cotton candy or something.

712
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,448
That's because...

713
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,610
I didn't use my wrist when I hit you.

714
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:47,848
If I had used my wrist,

715
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,789
you would've been hospitalized for eight weeks at least.

716
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,590
Gosh.

717
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:55,619
Let me pour it for you.

718
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,300
I returned the videotape.

719
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,170
If you want to watch something, borrow DVDs confidently.

720
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:14,579
You borrowed a videotape secretly. And the overdue fine is 15 dollars.

721
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,038
Father, that's not what it is.

722
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,949
That darn woman could make a movie...

723
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,179
with the overdue fine she collects.

724
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,888
- Seriously, I didn't watch it. - You punk.

725
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:27,919
(Hooseon University Medical Center)

726
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,389
The rotator cuff is stitched up well.

727
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,299
But more than 90 percent of your rotator cuff...

728
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,969

No. He should have a good rest.

755
