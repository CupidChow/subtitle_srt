00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,580
(Byeon Woo Seok)

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,279
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,380
(10 missed calls from CEO)

00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,890
(Kim Hye Yoon)

5
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,960
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,880
Why are you so quiet?

7
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:42,350
This is so beautiful.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,520
It's so beautiful that I'm speechless.

9
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,219
At this rate,

10
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,519
you and I might end up dead here together.

11
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,659
Dear passengers on the Ferris wheel, we're sorry.

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,359
Due to a problem with the electric power supply,

13
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,030
the Ferris wheel stopped operating for a moment.

14
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,799
We plan to resume the operation as quickly as possible.

15
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,030
We would appreciate your patience for the time being.

16
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:50,219
How much longer must we stay in here?

17
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,450
She must be so worry-free.

18
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,849
Look at her dozing off.

19
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,489
Luckily, we'll make it out of here alive today.

20
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,230
Ms. Im.

21
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,329
Wake up now.

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,900
Ms. Im?

23
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,740
Hey. Are you not well?

24
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,979
She's burning up.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,319
Ms. Im. Wake up.

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,280
Ms. Im!

27
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,090
(Episode 15)

28
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,629
What if I tell you...

29
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,099
getting mixed up with me might kill you?

30
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,740
Would you still do it?

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Seriously.

32
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,110
She's so odd.

33
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,409
Sun Jae.

34
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,150
Sun Jae...

35
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,199
Sun Jae.

36
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,970
You'll get better soon.

37
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,379
Get some sleep.

38
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,110
Sun Jae. I got the medicine.

39
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,439
What was that just now?

40
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,269
Men are only considerate to women they care about.

41
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,269
What are you talking about? I didn't want to wake her up.

42
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,709
Exactly.

43
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,980
You should wake her up and send her home. Why let her sleep here?

44
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
Why?

45
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,680
Don't tell me you plan to let her sleep here.

46
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,350
Do you expect me to wake up a sick woman at this late hour?

47
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,449
Then are you telling me...

48
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,250
you'll be alone with a woman at this late hour?

49
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,259
What on earth are you thinking?

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,589
- I'm not alone. You're here. - What is this?

51
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,290
- A woman? - A woman?

52
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,699
- Darn it. - Hey.

53
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,829
- Let's drink together. - Why are you guys here again?

54
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,829
We were drinking and decided to have our second round here.

55
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,029
To talk about our concert too.

56
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,399
Why do you think I have a doorbell?

57
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,000
My house isn't some dorm.

58
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,509
By the way, I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

59
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,810
When did you start dating her?

60
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,279
I thought you had feelings for me.

61
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,509
What? Who is she?

62
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,339
I thought no women were allowed in here.

63
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,149
Gosh, Sun Jae.

64
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,279
All right. Guys.

65
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,120
Why don't I drive you guys home? You had a few drinks tonight.

66
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,620
You should have introduced her to me first...

67
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,250
- when you got a girlfriend. - Be quiet!

68
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,360
- Who is she? - Hey, is she pretty?

69
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,660
Don't cause a scene here. Let's just go. Okay?

70
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,860
- Let's talk about this next time. - They're so exhausting.

71
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,430
- Let's go! - Who...

72
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,990
Am I at Sun Jae's house?

73
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,370
Are you okay?

74
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,410
How are you feeling?

75
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,120
What am I doing here?

76
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,550
Don't you remember?

77
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,389
You got sick and passed out.

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,750
No.

79
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,290
If I got sick and passed out,

80
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,319
why am I here?

81
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,360
You had to wait for hours at the ER.

82
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,129
You were burning up a fever.

83
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,930
You could've died if I didn't bring you here.

84
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,660
You should've just let me die then.

85
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,300
Then you should have brought me to my house.

86
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,670
You know where I live.

87
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,199
My house was closer.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,939
But still.

89
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,410
I had no choice but to bring you here.

90
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,680
I took care of you by calling my doctor friend...

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,980
at a late hour to get you treated as a big favor.

92
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,810
Are you scolding me right now?

93
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,420
No.

94
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,350
It sounds like you helped me a lot yesterday.

95
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,990
Thank you.

96
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,990
That's all?

97
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,930
I should pay you back.

98
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,959
I will.

99
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,959
Let's talk about this over some food.

100
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,759
I was so busy taking care of you...

101
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,699
that I didn't eat anything since last night.

102
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,970
I see.

103
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,810
I think I should go home for now.

104
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,639
I'll make sure to pay you back.

105
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,079
Please enjoy your meal.

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,579
Where are my shoes?

107
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,089
I was rushing here that I left your shoes in the van.

108
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,990
- I'll have my manager bring them. - What?

109
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,490
It will take about 30 minutes.

110
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,730
Let's have breakfast together...

111
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,560
unless you plan to go out barefoot.

112
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,980
It's still hot. Make sure to blow on it before you eat.

113
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,379
Make sure to blow on it.

114
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,680
What's this? Is this a deja vu?

115
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,500
Why are you staring at it instead of eating it?

116
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,500
Because you didn't eat a lot,

117
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,769
you passed out like that when you're a grown woman.

118
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,269
I eat a lot.

119
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,080
Are you not sick now?

120
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:05,720
Your fever is gone.

121
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,460
Why are you staring at me like that?

122
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,029
It's nothing.

123
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,129
Don't...

124
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,470
Don't tell me you cooked this yourself.

125
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,070
(Fresh Swift Delivery)

126
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,909
They delivered it all nice and fresh...

127
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,909
just like my image.

128
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,950
You like to hold a grudge, don't you?

129
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,019
You seemed to have a bad sleeping habit.

130
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,149
What?

131
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,350
Me?

132
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,360
Don't you remember...

133
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,059
what you did to me in your sleep?

134
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,159
I did something to you?

135
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,929
What did I do to you?

136
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,830
It was...

137
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,539
Never mind.

138
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,070
It might be better if you never find out about it.

139
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,570
Why?

140
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,740
Why is that?

141
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,940
Because I don't want you to die of embarrassment.

142
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,039
Gosh.

143
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,850
By the way, the necklace...

144
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,549
Never mind.

145
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,889
How will you pay me back?

146
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,059
Don't tell me you plan to buy me...

147
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
a mere cup of coffee at the convenience store like last time.

148
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,230
Then what do you want?

149
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,470
Don't quit your job.

150
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,299
If the company loses an employee...

151
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,700
who is sensible, savvy, and on top of everything,

152
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,139
won't that be a huge loss to the company?

153
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,250
I know that making your own movie is your dream.

154
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,179
That's what Ms. Lee said.

155
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,080
You know better than anyone...

156
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,679
there are thousands of excellent scenarios...

157
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,019
that never saw the light of day.

158
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,720
But you'll give up on this chance?

159
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,720
So your dream didn't mean that much to you?

160
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,059
I also have another dream.

161
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:01,870
What is it?

162
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,470
I want the person I love...

163
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,370
to live a long and healthy life.

164
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:12,809
Who...

165
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,110
is that?

166
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,580
It's a secret.

167
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,850
What does that...

168
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,750
have to do with quitting your job?

169
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,419
They are relevant to one another. So mind your own business.

170
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,980
Thank you for the food. When will your manager come...

171
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,480
I'll give you a ride. Let's go.

172
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,159
What? You said my shoes were in the van.

173
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,200
I hid them in case you decided to run away again. What?

174
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,970
Do you not want to leave?

175
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,730
Are you planning to live here?

176
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,899
I'm leaving.

177
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,679
Have you seen...

178
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,580
someone like this around here?

179
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,049
No.

180
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,779
We'll give you the security footage around the apartment.

181
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,289
But could you investigate as discreetly as possible?

182
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,759
The tenants will be sensitive about the news of abduction and so on.

183
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,289
I'm fine.

184
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,789
I said I would give you a ride.

185
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,429
I can go home alone.

186
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,330
What are you doing here?

187
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,600
Ryu Sun Jae?

188
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,970
Were you guys together?

189
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,039
Well...

190
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,470
Isn't that Ryu Sun Jae?

191
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,210
- That's Ryu Sun Jae. - He's so handsome.

192
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,409
- Last night... - I'm here...

193
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,080
because of work.

194
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,980
I stopped by this morning to have a serious conversation about work.

195
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,490
He's going to star in the movie I'm planning.

196
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,250
A movie?

197
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:07,289
I work at a movie production.

198
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,289
We're like business partners.

199
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,470
You can't get the wrong idea...

200
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,200
or spread weird rumors because I came out of his house.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,470
I'll end up losing my job.

202
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,440
It sounds like you won't be able to quit.

203
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,210
What about you? What are you doing here?

204
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,179
I'm here for work as well.

205
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,190
You're done here, right?

206
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,419
Let's go. I'll drive you to work.

207
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,159
Yes!

208
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,259
Please look over the proposal and give me a call.

209
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,629
Let's go.

210
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,200
I thought you were my girlfriend.

211
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,669
I'm not your girlfriend.

212
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,669
You're not my guy friend, are you?

213
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,179
He's got to be kidding me.

214
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,710
Is that him from the other night?

215
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:03,649
Unbelievable.

216
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,250
She said she didn't have a boyfriend.

217
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,179
I want the person I love...

218
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,090
to live a long and healthy life.

219
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,059
Come on.

220
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,269
Sun Jae.

221
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,309
Sun Jae...

222
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,909
She said my name so longingly.

223
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,509
She even gripped my hand...

224
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,850
so sorrowfully.

225
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,950
I should just wash the blanket.

226
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,620
(How to take the medicine correctly)

227
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,370
What is this? Why won't you eat the pizza crust?

228
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,570
Why are you making a pile of it? You're wasting food.

229
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,139
I'll stop forcing myself to eat something...

230
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,669
because I don't want to waste food.

231
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:06,580
I haven't been undervaluing myself all these years.

232
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,649
Starting now, I'll treat myself like a VIP.

233
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,809
Yes. From now on,

234
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,649
let's eat only the tasty middle part of the pizza.

235
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,549
Then we'll only eat the crispy edge of pancakes.

236
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,149
We'll only eat the red part of strawberries and watermelons...

237
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,620
for the sweet and sour flavors.

238
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,289
Let's live in luxury like that.

239
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,889
Let's only eat fried chicken from the tender thigh part.

240
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,159
Let's only dig up the soft part of the bread from now on.

241
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,129
You're unbelievable this morning. What's this nonsense?

242
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,970
Bo A.

243
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,370
Do you want some yogurt?

244
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,440
What's wrong with your parents?

245
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,809
Mom!

246
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,710
Seriously. Don't lick off the lid. That makes you look poor.

247
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,980
What is this? You guys aren't some rich people.

248
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,279
Even Melon Musk won't be this wasteful!

249
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,789
Honey, when will we cash out the lottery ticket?

250
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,549
The lottery ticket was bought a year ago.

251
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,059
Won't the prize collection period end soon?

252
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,590
Right. The cash prize.

253
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,460
We have to collect it soon.

254
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,730
You told me I was your role model.

255
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,740
You knew that I took a shine to you since you joined the company.

256
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,269
How could you do this to me?

257
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,080
I'm sorry about yesterday.

258
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,549
I shouldn't have been so emotional when I talked to you.

259
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,019
If you're truly sorry, withdraw your resignation.

260
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,830
(Im Sol)

261
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,129
I'll come to work until you find a replacement.

262
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,379
I watched the security footage from the apartment.

263
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,750
Right here. Check out the footage from the parking lot.

264
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,450
That's a match to the composite sketch.

265
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,980
But what's up with the taxi?

266
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,220
Is he a taxi driver?

267
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,320
I couldn't make out the license plate number.

268
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,159
I checked to see if the taxi showed up in different angles.

269
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,320
But no luck so far.

270
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,529
Right here.

271
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,569
The dashcam of this vehicle might've gotten the taxi's plate number.

272
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,700
Actually, I looked up the vehicle.

273
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,839
The owner of this vehicle is super famous.

274
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,900
Who is it?

275
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,019
Ryu Sun Jae?

276
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,029
Gosh, that hits the spot.

277
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,269
Bo A.

278
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,130
Are you happy that you came to the sauna with me?

279
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,970
- I'm happy. - I'm happy.

280
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,339
I'm happy too.

281
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,210
Gosh, he's so loud.

282
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,279
Goodness.

283
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,150
Mister. Excuse me.

284
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,420
You can't snore here.

285
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,220
Mister. Go home and snore away.

286
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,420
Gosh, seriously. He's such a heavy sleeper.

287
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,589
What was that? What's going on?

288
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,960
Gosh. I'm seeing stars right now. Oh, my.

289
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,599
What happened?

290
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,970
You can't snore that loudly here. This is a communal place.

291
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,440
Other people won't be able to sleep because of you.

292
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,039
I thought a tank was driving by.

293
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,769
- Did I snore that loudly? Sorry. - Yes.

294
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,210
Gosh, I've been tired lately.

295
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,079
Ma'am?

296
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm happy!

297
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,750
Wait.

298
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,849
You're the owner of Gold Videos.

299
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,349
(How to take the medicine correctly)

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,259
What are you staring at?

301
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,970
What do you mean? I'm not staring at anything.

302
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,940
Hold on a second.

303
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,299
- Wait. - What is it?

304
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,509
You were staring at this.

305
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,220
I wasn't.

306
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,819
Oh, no! She left her medicine.

307
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,059
She's sick. How could she forget her medicine?

308
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,529
This is a serious problem.

309
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
You're seriously acting so awkward.

310
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,630
Besides, it's not that big of a deal.

311
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,460
What? You don't think this is a big deal?

312
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,130
Don't you know the proper way of taking antibiotics?

313
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,730
Once you get the antibiotics prescribed,

314
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,170
you must take all of them without stopping halfway.

315
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,269
Even if you think you're all better,

316
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,640
you must take all of them without skipping any of them.

317
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,210
Is that so? No way.

318
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,210
If you stop as you please, you'll become immune to them.

319
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,250
If you do that and take them again next time, they won't be effective.

320
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,319
If something critical happens to Ms. Im,

321
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,289
I'll feel guilty, won't I?

322
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,390
That's absurd.

323
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,190
Skipping some antibiotics won't put her in critical condition.

324
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,289
No way.

325
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,029
Carelessness can be a dangerous thing.

326
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,059
I have no choice now.

327
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm very tired, so I don't want to go anywhere.

328
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,599
But I'll have to go and give the medicine to her.

329
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,500
Then rest up.

330
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,769
I'll deliver them to her...

331
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,309
- on my way home. - It's okay.

332
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,049
- Why should you go? - You said you were very tired.

333
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,779
No way. Your eyes are out of focus.

334
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:11,920
I'll go.

335
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,619
- Dong Seok. - Yes?

336
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,619
I don't want you to handle...

337
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,359
small errands like this for me.

338
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,630
Leave them here and go home.

339
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,359
No. It's not like this is the first time.

340
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,900
I'll do it.

341
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,259
Dong Seok.

342
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,400
What is it?

343
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,599
I'm trying to give you the 9-to-6 work hours.

344
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,200
It's already 8pm. What do you mean?

345
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,269
I'm done for the night.

346
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,509
Thank you, Sun Jae.

347
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,950
Yes! I knew it. He looked like Ryu Sun Jae.

348
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,549
Gosh. Had I known, when he came to drop off my mom,

349
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,420
I should have gotten his autograph.

350
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,720
Come to my galbi restaurant someday. I'll get you an autograph.

351
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,759
- Really? - Yes.

352
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,490
Thank you. I'll make sure to visit the restaurant.

353
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,529
By the way,

354
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:01,230
you must be so happy that your son is very famous.

355
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,670
Just the other day,

356
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,130
I read an article in the entertainment section.

357
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,799
It said that Sun Jae owned...

358
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,210
a ten-story building somewhere in Cheongdam-dong.

359
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,240
- A building in Cheongdam-dong? - Yes.

360
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,710
Gosh, no.

361
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,109
- No? - No.

362
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,779
So it was a rumor.

363
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,450
He has one in Seocho-dong, not Cheongdam-dong.

364
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,019
It's a 6-story building, not a 10-story building.

365
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,950
The basement has 4 floors.

366
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,289
So does that make a 10-story building?

367
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:24,890
Gosh. I'm not sure. I'm not good at math.

368
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,160
Starbucks came in on the first floor.

369
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:29,559
- Starbucks too? - Yes.

370
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,099
I'm so envious of you. Oh, my.

371
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,970
By the way, does your son...

372
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,630
have a girlfriend?

373
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,839
No.

374
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,839
Actually, I want him to find a girl and get married.

375
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,640
Is it because he's busy?

376
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,839
Does he not have any time to meet girls?

377
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,750
That's great. Actually,

378
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,279
I know this girl. She's so sweet and smart.

379
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,349
Do you want me...

380
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,619
- to fix him up with her? - What?

381
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,990
She's so sweet, kind, and smart.

382
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,319
On top of that, she works in the film industry.

383
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,089
I'm sure they'll see eye to eye on things.

384
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,059
On top of that, she's drop-dead gorgeous.

385
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,599
- Really? - Yes.

386
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,829
Who is she?

387
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,170
My daughter.

388
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:14,970
I see.

389
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm good.

390
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,410
You know, Sun Jae takes after me.

391
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,880
He has quite high standards.

392
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,349
You've never met my daughter, Sol.

393
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,450
I've seen her here and there...

394
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,049
when we lived across from each other.

395
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,420
She used to run around all day, looking utterly distracted.

396
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,589
If my memory serves me right,

397
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,130
I don't think she's drop-dead gorgeous.

398
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,430
Goodness.

399
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,069
Beauty is different for everyone.

400
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,769
Besides, who knows?

401
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,970
Your son might be head over heels for her.

402
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,799
That would only happen if my son were to lose his mind.

403
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,670
Anyway,

404
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,380
he worked with only the beautiful women of the century,

405
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,410
but he never fell for any of those women.

406
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,509
Goodbye then.

407
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,279
Guys like him always go crazy over one girl and become hopeless.

408
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Bye.

409
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,359
Darn it. How could a woman be so strong?

410
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,289
All my life,

411
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,099
there hadn't been a time my son pursued a woman one-sidedly.

412
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,900
There's no way he'd go crazy over her.

413
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,869
This is driving me crazy. Seriously.

414
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,539
Gosh. What should I tell her?

415
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,009
I stopped in the neighborhood... No.

416
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,240
I stopped by since I was in the neighborhood.

417
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,349
Am I an idiot or what?

418
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,880
The doctor told me to give the medicine to you,

419
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,390
so I had no choice but to come even though it's bothersome.

420
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,190
Gosh. Does that make me sound so rude?

421
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:41,859
Did I get overly groomed?

422
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:45,059
Someone will think I tried too hard to impress her.

423
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,799
What?

424
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,440
What? She has a child?

425
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,349
Jae A, isn't it nice to be out here with Auntie?

426
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,390
"Auntie?" That's her nephew, then?

427
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,359
What a relief.

428
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,430
What? What do I mean by "relief?"

429
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,529
You shouldn't be up till now.

430
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,630
You should sleep early and wake up early.

431
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,029
Why is she out here when she passed out...

432
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,569
- from sickness? - Peek-a-boo.

433
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,440
Why did she dress so lightly too?

434
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,309
Jae A, do you want Auntie to sing for you?

435
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,710
Three bears live in a house

436
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:39,720
Daddy Bear, Mommy Bear, and Baby Bear

437
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,549
Daddy Bear is chubby

438
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,019
Mommy Bear is

439
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,859
Jae A, when are you going to fall asleep?

440
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,700
Gosh. Why did I hide?

441
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,369
It'll be weirder if she catches me now.

442
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,250
I thought someone was here.

443
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,799
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

444
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:31,269
Excuse me. Your phone is here.

445
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,009
I'll pick it up.

446
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:39,940
You can go now.

447
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,980
What?

448
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,750
(Baek In Hyuk)

449
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
Sun Jae, where are you?

450
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,970
Darn it, In Hyuk.

451
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,470
Sun Jae. Ryu Sun Jae!

452
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,539
Why aren't you answering me?

453
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,009
Ryu Sun Jae!

454
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,740
- For goodness' sake. - Hey!

455
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,410
Gee.

456
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,450
Mr. Ryu Sun Jae?

457
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,359
What are you doing here?

458
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,539
Didn't you see?

459
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,579
I was riding the slide.

460
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,980
Exactly.

461
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,150
Why were you riding the slide?

462
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,920
Well. I enjoy going down the slide from time to time.

463
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,049
In the middle of the night?

464
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,450
I can't enjoy it during the day, can I?

465
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,119
As you know, I'm a well-known person.

466
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,130
Did you come to see me?

467
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:04,529
Yes.

468
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
No, I didn't.

469
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,470
Really?

470
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,299
In that case,

471
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,640
enjoy your ride until you leave.

472
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Hold on.

473
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,049
Actually, I came to give you this.

474
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,950
I heard you have to take medicine for a few days.

475
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,420
How could you leave it behind?

476
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,220
Of course, I didn't come out just to give you this.

477
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,490
I just got some time when I was on my way home after today's schedule.

478
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,059
And I dropped by because I was passing by.

479
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,829
Just in case you got me wrong.

480
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,769
Thank you.

481
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,400
I didn't get you wrong.

482
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,839
Also, why are you wandering around in this weather?

483
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,539
Who are you going to bother when you pass out again?

484
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,210
Well, he falls asleep...

485
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,549
only when he is in a stroller. What can I do?

486
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,750
He's not sleeping, though.

487
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,150
Gosh.

488
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,529
Jae A, don't cry. Stop crying.

489
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,700
This is insane.

490
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,109
If you are done, you should go now.

491
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,410
Haven't you soothed a child before?

492
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Give him to me.

493
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,980
- Goodness. - Well...

494
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,380
Goodness.

495
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,589
You have to cuddle him stably so that he feels comfortable.

496
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,859
Also, if you feel nervous,

497
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,190
the child can feel it too.

498
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,359
So,

499
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,730
even if he cries so much like this,

500
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,799
you have to keep calm...

501
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,400
and pat on his hips calmly.

502
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,640
Keep patting.

503
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,809
Hold on!

504
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,880
- Oh, no! Why is he throwing up? - He threw up.

505
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,650
Jae A, you're all right now, right?

506
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,619
Gosh. You are so adorable.

507
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,730
For goodness' sake. How could this have happened?

508
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,500
Why is he taking so long?

509
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,109
This was almost new.

510
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,880
Did you pour the whole body wash over you or what?

511
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,089
You shouldn't be saying that.

512
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,839
Are you insane? Why did you step out naked?

513
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,740
I didn't have a change of clothes.

514
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,339
What was I supposed to do?

515
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,009
Right.

516
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,849
Sorry about that.

517
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,049
Change into this quickly and leave.

518
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:18,049
I'm going to leave tonight even if you grab me and say not to.

519
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,529
But when you were sick, you held my hand and didn't let go.

520
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,660
When did I do that?

521
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,640
Hurry and put the clothes on.

522
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,650
- Are they here already? - Mal Ja, I'll do it. Step aside.

523
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,910
Follow me.

524
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
This way.

525
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,569
What? You're home already.

526
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,440
- Yes. - What about Jae A?

527
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,470
- He's sleeping in the room. - What about Geum and Hyun Ju?

528
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,170
They went out in a hurry.

529
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,210
Bo A, you have to brush your teeth.

530
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,640
I'll go to my room and take some rest, then.

531
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Take some rest.

532
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,150
What are you doing?

533
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,660
We didn't do anything wrong, did we?

534
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,859
How are you going to explain this to my mother?

535
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,960
I thought we were business partners.

536
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,700
Why would my business partner take a shower at my place?

537
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,099
- That would look odd. - I see.

538
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,799
They're going to bed soon.

539
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,640
Wait here quietly for ten minutes and leave.

540
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,339
What should we do for those ten minutes?

541
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,240
There's nothing we'll "do."

542
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,440
Just stay and do nothing.

543
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,700
Where are your manners looking around a woman's room like that?

544
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,200
You can't see your friend as a woman.

545
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:16,869
I guess you consider yourself a woman in front of me.

546
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,680
What?

547
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:20,640
It's nothing.

548
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,990
What is this?

549
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,490
- Give it to me. - Wait.

550
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,220
Gosh.

551
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:36,890
What now?

552
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,660
It's okay. Hand it to me.

553
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,930
I think it's broken. I'll fix it for you.

554
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,430
No, just give it back to me.

555
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,730
I don't like to leave anything behind to feel sorry for.

556
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,269
I said it's all right.

557
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,140
What? Why are you holding my hand?

558
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,210
Well. Why did you take it from me, then?

559
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,150
Was this when you were a student?

560
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,420
That's Jagam Girls' High School's uniform.

561
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,250
- Don't look at it. - How pretty.

562
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,259
I wasn't that pretty. Come on.

563
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,559
I meant the uniform.

564
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:15,299
Right.

565
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,900
My school's uniform was pretty, indeed.

566
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,470
By the way,

567
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,710
did you really not see me around back then?

568
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,740
What?

569
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,210
Of course not.

570
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,049
I said I didn't see you because I didn't.

571
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,390
I said stop looking at it.

572
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,529
Why? I'm looking at it because it's pretty.

573
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,630
Are you some sort of uniform maniac?

574
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,630
No way. It's you that's pretty.

575
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:54,640
No. How could you say that so casually?

576
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,869
I thought we shouldn't get caught.

577
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,509
Sol, are you on the phone?

578
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,940
Yes. But I just hung up.

579
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,109
It's late. Go to bed.

580
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,239
I think everyone's sleeping.

581
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,619
It's becoming a habit.

582
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,690
What? What is?

583
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,820
You holding my hand.

584
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,820
You hold it so easily and casually.

585
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,789
Well...

586
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,900
Let's hurry. Come on.

587
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,610
What if my family comes out?

588
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,909
Hurry up. Come on.

589
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,710
Go. Hurry.

590
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
I'll get going.

591
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,369
What was that?

592
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,610
Thank you, sir.

593
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,179
It's Ryu Sun Jae.

594
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:02,900
Imagining about kissing...

595
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,329
a woman.

596
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,170
I wasn't imagining it or dreaming it.

597
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,940
I was sober.

598
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,280
Was it a hallucination?

599
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,920
Did you imagine kissing a woman?

600
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,960
What? When did you get here?

601
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
You don't have to imagine it.

602
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,190
You can do it in real life.

603
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,590
I thought you were seeing someone.

604
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,159
I'm not seeing anyone.

605
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:36,070
What about the girl you brought home the other day?

606
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,369
She was my business partner.

607
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,000
Do you fancy...

608
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,369
kissing your business partner?

609
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,809
That's not the case.

610
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,110
I think it is.

611
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,679
It's just...

612
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,980
whenever I see her, some scenes pop up in my head blurredly...

613
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,880
as if they were scenes from a movie I watched a long time ago.

614
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,389
Really?

615
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:57,889
And how does that make you feel?

616
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,119
I don't know if I'm overwhelmed with joy or sadness.

617
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,260
What's gotten into me?

618
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,900
- You have a crush on her. - What?

619
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,260
It's love.

620
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,130
- Leave now. - Why?

621
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,699
You're overwhelmed with joy and sadness.

622
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,469
You're on an emotional rollercoaster.

623
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:14,869
You either have a crush on her or become insane.

624
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,739
Okay. I'm insane.

625
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,909
I told you to beat it.

626
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,440
I'm here because I have something to tell you.

627
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,480
I had to come because you just wouldn't answer the phone.

628
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,010
What is it?

629
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,980
Do you remember Kim Tae Seong who was in our high school band?

630
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,719
He was really famous as a handsome guy.

631
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,619
Anyway,

632
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,719
he has become a cop.

633
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,820
And he wants you to make time to meet him...

634
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,159
because he has a favor to ask you.

635
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,230
A cop wants to see me?

636
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm Kang Tae Seong, a detective...

637
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,760
from the Violent Crimes Division at Wonbook Police Station.

638
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,570
- Here we meet again. - Exactly.

639
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,599
Did you see each other before?

640
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,300
Not so long ago. By accident.

641
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,769
What is that urgent favor you need to ask me?

642
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,909
I need your dashcam videos.

643
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,179
Why do you need them?

644
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,480
Sun Jae, are you in trouble?

645
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,849
Don't you have to tell me what is it for first?

646
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:03,389
Your fan almost got kidnapped by an unidentified assailant...

647
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,150
in front of your house.

648
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,260
- What? - Really?

649
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,530
Your dashcam must have caught the suspect's car.

650
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,360
We need the videos to identify its license plate.

651
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,900
Is my fan all right?

652
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,969
Fortunately,

653
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,139
she didn't get hurt.

654
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,039
I'm glad to hear that.

655
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,840
I'll send you the videos right away.

656
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:25,539
What a scary world.

657
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,710
I hope the suspect gets caught soon.

658
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,809
He should be.

659
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,750
I heard you'll be in the movie my Sol came up with.

660
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,949
"My Sol," my foot.

661
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Yes. Why?

662
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,760
You must be busy.

663
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,389
I'm always busy.

664
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,030
How busy were you...

665
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,670
so that you couldn't come out to talk business?

666
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,869
So that you had to call her to a single man's house in the morning.

667
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,039
You even meddle in her company work?

668
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,110
Of course.

669
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,340
It's my Sol's business.

670
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:01,539
Why do you keep...

671
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,349
saying, "My Sol?"

672
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,750
It's a habit.

673
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,650
By the way,

674
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:11,349
I can see some animosity in your eyes, Mr. Ryu.

675
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,389
In my eyes?

676
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,489
No way, Mr. Kim.

677
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,429
What's going on?

678
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,329
Did you come here to fight?

679
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,429
- No way. - No way.

680
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:26,639
And why are you calling each other by last name?

681
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,400
If you're my friends, you're also friends with each other.

682
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,940
Talk casually.

683
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,110
Why bother?

684
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,079
I'm not here to build friendships.

685
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,280
You're right.

686
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,949
This isn't a high school reunion.

687
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,449
Thank you.

688
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,849
Thanks.

689
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,789
Let's just drink our teas.

690
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,829
It's hot. Gosh!

691
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,530
It's boiling hot.

692
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,000
Guys, aren't those hot? Are you all right?

693
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,030
- It's not bad. - It's not bad.

694
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,500
It's super-hot. Stop bluffing.

695
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,869
It's nothing.

696
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,739
It's lukewarm.

697
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,309
You crazy idiots.

698
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,219
- No one's here, right? - Right. Come.

699
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,489
No one is here?

700
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,469
Look.

701
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,739
Honey.

702
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,900
(Deposit, 400,000 dollars)

703
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,840
We really got the lottery-winning prize!

704
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,239
What should we do with this money?

705
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,880
For Mother, Grandmother, Sol, and our kids,

706
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,909
we should buy nice padded jackets.

707
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,610
Let's get your mother a dental implant.

708
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,880
We should get a house to rent too!

709
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,989
But once we rent a house with 400,000 dollars,

710
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,619
it'll go back to zero dollars in no time, won't it?

711
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,690
But can we complain, Honey?

712
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,820
You don't have to live with in-laws anymore.

713
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,030
But usually, isn't the top lottery prize millions of dollars?

714
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,969
I heard we got the smallest prize money.

715
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,230
A whopping 50 people who bought lottery tickets...

716
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,539
at the same convenience store...

717
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,170
where you bought yours won the lottery.

718
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,070
- Isn't it shocking? - Really?

719
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,969
(About 1 year ago)

720
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:21,940
They are 6, 18, 28,

721
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,210
30, 38, 40...

722
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:28,480
And 41.

723
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,389
Wait. What are those numbers?

724
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:38,829
My sister got these numbers from a really talented shaman.

725
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,630
I've tried so many times, but I've never won.

726
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,599
He got the numbers from a talented shaman.

727
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,170
What were the numbers?

728
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:49,070
It's not going to work, anyway.

729
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:55,809
Listen carefully, then.

730
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,010
They are six,

731
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,280
eighteen,

732
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,650
twenty-eight,

733
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,980
thirty,

734
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,420
thirty-eight,

735
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,789
forty,

736
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:05,960
and forty-one.

737
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,460
One more time!

738
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,260
- "One more time!" - Come.

739
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:11,630
- They are six... - "Six!"

740
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,730
- Eighteen... - "Eighteen!"

741
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,929
Twenty-eight...

742
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,000
That's strange.

743
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,530
That convenience store was popular for a reason!

744
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,539
I think you are destined to be super lucky this year.

745
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,239
Since I'm happy,

746
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,739
I'll let you do it.

747
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:27,309
You said there was an audition someone told you about.

748
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:28,380
Try it.

749
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,480
What?

750
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,880
- Really? - Yes.

751
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,320
Since you're finally on the lucky side,

752
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,989
- go for it. - Honey!

753
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,050
However,

754
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,489
this is the last one.

755
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,090
Honey.

756
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:43,159
Thank you.

757
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:46,730
You're the best!

758
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,500
Let's go and pick up our kids now.

759
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,699
Sure. Let's go.

760
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,739
Should we go and have some meat today?

761
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:53,869
Should we get Korean beef?

762
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,210
Thank you, Sol!

763
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,909
Thanks for deciding to appear in the movie.

764
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,579
You'll be generous and forget about Ms. Im's mistake, right?

765
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:06,550
But he tends to be vindictive...

766
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,719
Of course.

767
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:16,929
Goodness.

768
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,329
You have such a generous heart.

769
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,340
- Do you like the food? - It's amazing.

770
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:30,309
When will we start filming?

771
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,340
We plan to hire a director while developing the script.

772
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,380
By the way,

773
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,409
when you start working on the script,

774
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,519
is there a chance for the ending to change?

775
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,150
What about the ending?

776
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:43,920
Well,

777
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,019
it's just sad if it ends like that.

778
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,760
I understand.

779
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,389
Because life is hard,

780
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:52,159
people don't like it when it's too sad.

781
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,130
I think...

782
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:57,630
the current ending is for the best for the main characters.

783
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,340
Gosh. We should listen to him.

784
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,670
We should listen to what our male protagonist has to say.

785
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,079
Which ending would you prefer?

786
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,480
The man without the memory of her because it's been reset...

787
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,179
runs into her by chance...

788
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,679
and falls in love again in the end.

789
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,550
He just can't help it.

790
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,460
Gosh. What a romantic ending.

791
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,019
I don't like it.

792
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,690
Getting tangled up again by fate.

793
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,460
Isn't that the worst ending?

794
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,570
What if the man dies again after meeting the woman?

795
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,900
It's sickening.

796
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:34,239
He keeps dying over and over again when she keeps saving him.

797
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,440
All humans live a time-limited life, don't they?

798
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,739
Everyone is destined to die one day.

799
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:40,840
She wants him...

800
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:42,980
to live longer.

801
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,550
Is it better to live for a long time?

802
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,579
Even for a moment,

803
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,449
it's better to live happily with someone you love.

804
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,619
But how hard did she try to disentangle herself from him?

805
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,519
If they fall in love again,

806
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,260
all her efforts are in vain.

807
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,730
What's the point?

808
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,730
No matter what,

809
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,599
it's just my personal opinion.

810
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,940
I respect the producer's opinion.

811
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,110
- I see. - Right.

812
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,010
The producer...

813
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,780
will take into consideration the main male character's opinion.

814
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,010
- Right? - Yes. Help yourselves.

815
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,250
Yes. These seasoned vegetables are so tasty.

816
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,960
Why are you following me?

817
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,130
It's up to me.

818
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,829
You said we can't be in an open space like this.

819
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,570
I won't take responsibility even if we're caught up in a dating rumor.

820
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,369
You said we were business partners.

821
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:47,840
We could just say we were talking about business.

822
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,309
Are you going to talk about work then?

823
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:50,449
No.

824
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,019
I want to take you home, but I didn't bring my car.

825
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,119
I'll be seeing you take a cab.

826
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,690
- Why are you doing this? - Doing what?

827
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,360
You would know well.

828
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,599
Are you sure you don't have a boyfriend?

829
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,699
You're not seeing the police officer we met in front of my house, right?

830
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,170
Why are you curious about that?

831
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,900
I know.

832
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:16,840
Did I really fall in love with you?

833
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,750
It hasn't been long since we met. How can you fall in love?

834
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,750
I also think it's weird,

835
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,920
but it's true that I'm interested in you.

836
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:32,789
I keep thinking...

837
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:35,190
and worrying about you.

838
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,800
I'm sorry,

839
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:44,469
but please...

840
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,269
lose interest in me now.

841
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,739
Why?

842
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:51,670
If you get involved with me,

843
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,679
will it ruin your family for three generations?

844
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:02,550
I'm in love...

845
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,690
with someone.

846
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,489
I love the person...

847
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,559
very much.

848
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,840
That's why we can't be together.

849
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,409
I'm begging you.

850
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,239
Please don't approach me anymore.

851
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,389
You rejected me...

852
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,889
many times.

853
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,699
Fine. I can't cling to someone who doesn't like me.

854
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:50,199
From now on, I won't cross the line.

855
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,139
Thank you.

856
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
And...

857
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,309
I've been rude to you.

858
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,309
I'm sorry.

859
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,510
Is this your farewell?

860
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,050
We'll be meeting again because of work anyway.

861
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,690
I rejected you. Do you think we can handle the awkwardness?

862
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:19,929
Mr. Ryu.

863
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,199
Stay healthy and have a good life.

864
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,099
Then, goodbye.

865
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,460
You're busy. Why did you come to pick me up?

866
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,559
I heard you had a get-together today.

867
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,500
I thought you wouldn't have brought your car.

868
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,230
Did you drink a lot?

869
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,500
A little.

870
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:04,039
Why have you been taking care of me so much these days?

871
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,110
Don't like me.

872
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,239
Can I not like you?

873
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,909
- What? - Honestly,

874
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,219
I'm confused when I see you these days.

875
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,420
What are you talking about?

876
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,489
We're friends. We've been like that for more than ten years.

877
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,619
But nowadays, my heart says the otherwise from time to time.

878
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:25,059
Did I like you in the past?

879
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,900
I definitely didn't as far as I remember.

880
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,300
But it feels like I did at the same time.

881
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,869
I've been a little weird these days.

882
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,800
You...

883
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,170
are probably mistaken. No.

884
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:39,469
You're mistaken.

885
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,440
Am I? Should we date so that I can find out if I'm mistaken or not?

886
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,880
I know you're not serious.

887
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,250
I can't even make a move...

888
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,590
as I'm afraid I'll lose our friendship because of my confusion.

889
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,730
This is how I've been recently.

890
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:03,230
I'm being honest because you might think I've been weird.

891
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:07,599
You know...

892
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,070
there's someone I can't forget.

893
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,739
I know.

894
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,679
That guy you never tell me who it is.

895
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,750
Things will come back to their place soon.

896
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,789
Yes. It will. It should.

897
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,119
Both you and Sun Jae.

898
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,130
And me.

899
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,840
Why aren't you sleeping, Grandma?

900
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,409
My Sol has come.

901
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:45,969
Have you eaten?

902
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,210
Grandma.

903
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,179
Grandma, do you remember me?

904
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:56,590
You might pierce my face with your eyes.

905
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,159
You remembered me after a long time.

906
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,960
Did you think I forgot everything?

907
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:07,730
Yes.

908
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,960
I didn't.

909
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,070
Memories don't disappear.

910
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,710
Where do you think all the countless memories...

911
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,809
of what you see, listen, and feel in your life go?

912
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,610
They're all smeared into my soul.

913
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:29,050
Even if my brain forgot them,

914
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,489
my soul hasn't. It's been keeping every piece of it.

915
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,960
I've been...

916
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,860
feeling weird lately.

917
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:39,690
But nowadays, my heart says the otherwise from time to time.

918
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,130
I've been a little weird these days.

919
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,969
Is that so?

920
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,110
Of course, it is.

921
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,309
I'm traveling...

922
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:57,880
in my memory.

923
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,619
I sometimes go back to when I was three,

924
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:04,090
acting like a baby in my mom's arms.

925
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,320
Then I become an 18-year-old self when I met my husband.

926
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:12,789
When I miss my youngest grandchild,

927
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,099
I come back like this too.

928
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,809
You should come often then. Okay?

929
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,050
Sure.

930
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,119
I'll do that.

931
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,690
(Establish the order of the law.)

932
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,059
Detective Seo.

933
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,030
When will the results be out from the National Forensic Service...

934
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,090
regarding the dashcam footage we submitted a few days ago?

935
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,599
It was out just now.

936
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,960
Even the name of the taxi company.

937
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:31,170
The shooting will begin at the beginning of next year.

938
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,710
We're talking with Director Choi Ki Sung.

939
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,210
He directed "Again, Love."

940
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,880
Or you could choose one of the rookie directors...

941
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,150
- with an artistic mind and... - I'm sorry to interrupt,

942
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:43,219
Yes.

943
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:44,849
but when is Sol coming?

944
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:47,159
Well,

945
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:51,329
from now on, I'll be in charge of the project.

946
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,400
Ms. Im left the company.

947
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,699
She left the company?

948
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,429
You didn't know.

949
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,639
I tried my best to stop her,

950
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:03,710
but she said she wanted to study film properly and quit.

951
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,409
(Building Ppuri)

952
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,210
Mr. Ryu.

953
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,780
Stay healthy and have a good life.

954
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,050
Was it really her farewell?

955
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,829
How can I return this?

956
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,730
I might never see her again.

957
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,510
Sun Jae, get in.

958
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:48,380
(Building Ppuri)

959
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:52,949
(The song that exists only in her memory, "Sonaki,")

960
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,920
(is playing quietly.)

961
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,059
(I didn't want it to stop. (On the day you first came to me,)

962
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:58,860
(I didn't want you to be the rain that soaks me wet only.)

963
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,329
What is it?

964
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,980
Number 5663. Who drives this cab?

965
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:15,679
Let me check.

966
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,420
(Kim Young Soo)

967
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,420
We found him.

968
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:28,619
I think this is the guy.

969
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,260
Send the photo to the victim to verify it...

970
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:31,530
and apply for an arrest warrant.

971
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:32,730
Yes, sir.

972
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,300
- Does he drive today? - Yes.

973
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,730
What time is his shift?

974
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,579
Sun Jae worked on the song in your proposal...

975
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,320
and sent us the guide version.

976
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,449
Take a listen.

977
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,059
How come he sang this song?

978
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,460
("Sonaki")

979
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,230
Memories don't disappear.

980
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:16,070
Where do you think all the countless memories...

981
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:19,070
of what you see, listen, and feel in your life go?

982
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:23,010
They're all smeared into my soul.

983
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,280
Even if my brain forgot them,

984
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,750
my soul hasn't. It's been keeping every piece of it.

985
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:48,769
("Sonaki")

986
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,949
I haven't listened to this for a very long time.

987
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:12,730
I didn't want it to stop

988
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,800
On the day you first came to me

989
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:24,210
- I didn't want you to be the rain - I didn't want you to be the rain

990
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,840
- That soaks me wet only - That soaks me wet only

991
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,409
- I've prayed so hard - I've prayed so hard

992
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,889
Do you know how I feel?

993
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:42,289
I've dreamt of you every day

994
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:44,630
My heart is

995
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,059
- Soaked in you again today - Soaked in you again today

996
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,099
- You are a gift - You are a gift

997
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:55,670
From the sky

998
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,469
When you're all alone in this world

999
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:03,409
I'll protect you

1000
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:07,780
- You have fallen to me - You have fallen to me

1001
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,719
- Like a sudden shower - Like a sudden shower

1002
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,730
But I sing to you again today

1003
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:22,199
My precious

1004
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:26,400
- Love - Love

1005
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:42,679
Tae Seong.

1006
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,789
An arrest warrant has been issued for Kim Young Soo.

1007
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,019
I immediately requested for assistance too.

1008
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:47,690
All we have to do now is to catch him when that jerk comes.

1009
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:50,260
He has a criminal record.

1010
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:51,860
He served six years in prison...

1011
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,460
after being convicted of attempted murder in 2008.

1012
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,800
The police officer who arrested him at that time...

1013
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,369
was Detective Kim Won Chul,

1014
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,639
- your father. - What?

1015
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:02,039
What a coincidence.

1016
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,610
He's here.

1017
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,300
What's the matter?

1018
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,829
Get out for a moment. Let's talk.

1019
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:32,630
I have questions to ask.

1020
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Darn it.

1021
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,539
Detective Seo, get in the car quickly!

1022
01:00:58,289 --> 01:00:59,360
I request for assistance.

1023
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,929
The suspect's vehicle is fleeing...

1024
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,400
toward Bangmun Bridge from Hancheon Transportation.

1025
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,559
I request immediate assistance.

1026
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,409
Darn it.

1027
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,679
That crazy jerk.

1028
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,530
Sun Jae, let me bring the car quickly.

1029
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:32,690
- Okay. - See you.

1030
01:01:57,889 --> 01:01:59,489
Time that passes again. This is my gift.

1031
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:00,860
Thank you for living.

1032
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,780
What?

1033
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:25,380
It's snowing.

1034
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:02,320
I was waiting for you.

1035
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,289
Sir!

1036
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,750
Sol!

1037
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,940
Sun Jae.

1038
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:05,880
Sol.

1039
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:09,050
Sol.

1040
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,130
Sol.

1041
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,739
Sol.

1042
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,079
Sol!

1043
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:09,110
Move over, you idiot!

1044
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,829
Get lost!

1045
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,960
Why did you save my life?

1046
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:33,730
You should've let me die!

1047
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:37,730
Why did you save my life and make me like this?

1048
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,139
Sol.

1049
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:46,840
Why are you crying?

1050
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,019
Sol, I...

1051
01:06:56,019 --> 01:06:57,119
like you a lot.

1052
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,989
Sol!

1053
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
Sol.

1054
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,889
I wanted to tell you if I ever got a chance...

1055
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:07,190
to see you again.

1056
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,730
That I liked you too.

1057
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,230
That I missed you.

1058
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:14,599
I missed you with all of my heart, Sun Jae.

1059
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,909
Could the reason for my death be you?

1060
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,780
While saving you?

1061
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:30,789
Sol. Stop running away from me.

1062
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:32,389
Just pursue your feelings for me.

1063
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,320
If I end up dying to save you, I'll be fine with that.

1064
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:38,059
That doesn't matter.

1065
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,929
Sun Jae!

1066
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,099
I like you.

1067
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,699
I like you, Sun Jae.

1068
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,440
I love you.

1069
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,940
I love you, Sol.

1070
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,610
Perhaps,

1071
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,780
we should have never met in the first place.

1072
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,449
Yes. We should've never met.

1073
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,489
Is there such a thing as predetermined fate?

1074
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:09,789
Like an inevitable fate...

1075
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,789
that we can neither change nor defy.

1076
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,599
If there is, Sol,

1077
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:17,329
my fate is...

1078
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:20,670
no matter in which time we meet,

1079
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,300
past, present, or any other,

1080
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,739
I'll fall in love with you.

1081
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,109
Sun Jae.

1082
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,250
Sol, I love you.

1083
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,750
(Lovely Runner)

1084
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,319
Sol.

1085
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:16,720
I'm sorry I'm late.

1086
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,229
Stop right there, Kim Young Soo!

1087
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:23,060
You must remember what I say. Keep it a secret.

1088
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:24,270
He must be crazy.

1089
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,829
Should I kidnap you and run like this?

1090
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,470
Don't we look like newlyweds?

1091
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,510
"Newlyweds?"

1092
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:35,180
- Now is the time. - Are you perhaps...

1093
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,079
No, this is not the time.

1094
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:39,350
I'm scared sometimes.

1095
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,819
That you might go to a different time again.

1096
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,420
Sol.

1097
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,590
Please stay with me in every moment from now on.
