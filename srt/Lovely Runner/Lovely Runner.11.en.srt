00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,580
(Byeon Woo Seok)

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,348
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:09,349
(10 missed calls from CEO)

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,919
(Kim Hye Yoon)

5
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,929
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,500
It's quiet in the alley

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,600
Isn't that Sun Jae?

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,609
Oh, my!

9
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,038
Sorry.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,179
That's my mom's voice.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,210
I was going to walk past them quietly.

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,548
You know, what you're doing is so sweet and all.

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,090
Why are you doing it under that bright streetlamp?

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,060
You must have gotten a girlfriend.

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,530
- Hello. - Youth is a blissful phase.

16
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,428
I'll let you finish up.

17
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,100
I didn't see anything. I couldn't see a thing.

18
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,609
Gosh, Sun Jae.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,079
Does he want to kiss a girl right in front of his house?

20
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,420
That's so embarrassing. Seriously.

21
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,089
I knew he wouldn't be shy about it...

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,120
when he rented an adult movie as a high schooler.

23
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,590
Seriously. Goodness.

24
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,959
(Episode 11)

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,260
What am I going to do now?

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,739
Sun Jae. Don't worry.

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,569
I'll keep you safe no matter what.

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,810
I'm not talking about that.

29
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,709
What if your mother thinks poorly of me?

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,079
- What? - Should I tell her it was you?

31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,810
Or will that make her angrier?

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,979
Hey. You were...

33
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,919
worried about that? Is that important to you?

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,989
It's very important.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,559
How can you smile right now?

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,629
Why?

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Am I not allowed to smile because I found out that...

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,129
I would die after 15 years?

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,299
How can you say that as if it's nothing?

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,198
I'm worried that it will come true if I say it out loud.

41
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,240
So I can't even talk about it. How could you...

42
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,509
I won't die that young.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,180
So whatever happens to me in the future,

44
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,310
don't ever think that it's your fault.

45
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,050
So this is the last time?

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,629
When will you go back?

47
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm not sure.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,960
Maybe, I have a month left.

49
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,569
Can you not go back?

50
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,870
I guess you have to go back.

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,409
Then...

52
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,719
when you go back to the future after a month,

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,719
let's meet there.

54
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,159
I'll be running diligently...

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,659
to the Year 2023...

56
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,729
where you will be.

57
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,649
Being on the plane for over ten hours...

58
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,710
must be exhausting for him.

59
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,750
Well, I got him a business seat. Will he be okay?

60
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,889
Even at 50 years old, I've never had the chance to fly business class.

61
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,688
The in-flight meals must be good. Right?

62
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,129
What is it? Your son is all grown up.

63
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,258
Are you that sad you can't see him for a few months?

64
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,759
Gosh. He may be all grown up, but he's still a kid to me.

65
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,900
Other than a few days of the off-season training,

66
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,870
he had never been away from me for this long all his life.

67
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,809
I pampered my son,

68
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,409
so he never felt the absence of his mother.

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,349
Once he gets married later, your effort won't mean anything.

70
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,659
(Recipient: Im Sol)

71
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,758
Are you still up?

72
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,800
(Your message was sent to Im Sol.)

73
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,269
(Contacts)

74
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,209
(Sol)

75
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,189
(Contacts, Sol)

76
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,629
(Contacts, Sol)

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,920
I need to...

78
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,050
take good care of myself for the next 15 years.

79
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,069
In Hyuk must have left some behind.

80
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,699
There it is.

81
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,250
I'm still up. How come you're still up?

82
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,620
She's just so unbelievably cute.

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,100
My phone charger is in the luggage.

84
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,750
Gosh.

85
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,360
Now that my son isn't here,

86
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,129
the house feels so empty.

87
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,899
Gosh. I forgot to close the door.

88
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,339
It's scarier because the house is big.

89
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,110
Gosh. Whatever. I should wash my feet and go to sleep.

90
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,360
(Circuit breaker)

91
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,500
What was that?

92
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,230
Who is that?

93
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,269
Who's there?

94
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,740
Dad!

95
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,180
Dad!

96
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,980
Oh, no. What do I do?

97
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,079
Dad!

98
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,120
- In front of your house? - Yes.

99
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm not sure.

100
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,028
But it was the same truck...

101
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,389
Kim Young Soo was driving to chase me.

102
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,898
Could you check on it?

103
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,069
I'll check on it right away.

104
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,198
Gather all the security footage around the house of the victim...

105
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,870
in Kim Young Soo's attempted abduction.

106
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,540
If you see a white truck in it, track its route.

107
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,350
Stop running away from me.

108
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,350
Just pursue your feelings for me.

109
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,759
Can I do that?

110
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,570
Dad!

111
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,739
Oh, no.

112
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,769
Dad!

113
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,279
It's Sun Jae!

114
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,649
It's your son! Ryu Sun Jae!

115
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,120
- You startled me. - My son?

116
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,690
You should be having the in-flight meal by now.

117
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,389
Why are you still here?

118
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,159
Because I never got on the plane. That's why I'm here.

119
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,399
Dad. Are you okay?

120
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:20,870
You brat. What's this? Why do you have this on your face?

121
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,500
Are you trying to give your own father a heart attack?

122
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,499
Why didn't you go to the US?

123
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,469
- Why? - Dad, let me speak then.

124
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,509
Hear me out.

125
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,239
Since everyone wanted me to go,

126
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,409
I was going to give it a shot one last time.

127
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:35,149
But to be honest, I wasn't sure if I could do it.

128
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,678
Why spend a fortune on the rehabilitation process...

129
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,419
when I was only doing it for other people's sakes?

130
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,850
But still.

131
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,518
Getting a spot in the process...

132
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,289
was difficult even for talented athletes.

133
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,089
That kind of chance doesn't come often.

134
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,460
How could you waste that on a whim like that? You brat!

135
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,830
When I thought about swimming again,

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,299
I no longer felt passionate about it like I was before.

137
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,399
I thought I still wanted it,

138
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,700
but I guess I didn't.

139
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
I must have closed that chapter pretty tightly.

140
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,809
Are you sure...

141
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,850
you won't regret this?

142
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,250
Yes.

143
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,250
So what do you plan on doing with your life then?

144
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,090
I'm only 20 years old, Dad.

145
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,960
I'll take some time to look into...

146
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,519
what I want to do with my life.

147
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,889
Gosh. You're so frustrating.

148
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,090
Dad. Who knows?

149
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,629
I might become super famous in a different field...

150
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,870
and end up with so many fans.

151
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,898
Gosh. You are an ambitious one. Aren't you?

152
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,440
Do you think it will be that easy?

153
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,408
Gosh.

154
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,210
Why is my head pounding?

155
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,440
Dad. Do you have a headache?

156
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,450
Oh, right. Your luggage.

157
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,610
What did you do with your luggage?

158
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,779
I left the airport after checking in your luggage.

159
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,189
Did you get it back?

160
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,250
Why is my face so dry? I should apply some lotion.

161
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,460
Yes?

162
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,389
I don't care about your dry skin. What about the luggage?

163
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,360
Hey, you brat!

164
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,558
Not the stir-fried gochujang! That's...

165
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,870
- Face the front and spin them. - Spin them.

166
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,199
All right. This is a great exercise to lose the fat in your arms.

167
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,740
- Do it while watching TV. - To the right.

168
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,940
When you spin them like this,

169
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,370
you can spin them 500 times in 10 minutes.

170
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,240
- It's the same as punching... - The other side.

171
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,350
the sandbag.

172
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:18,620
Great.

173
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,419
- What was that? - Face the front.

174
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,089
The faster you spin them, the better workout you will get.

175
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,089
- My gosh. That's so loud. - All right. This is our 11th move.

176
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,090
- Shouldn't she be having menopause? - Bend your knees.

177
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,028
- Why is she dancing in the morning? - Bend your knees.

178
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,898
You have to raise them up next.

179
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:33,960
- Go. - A knee strike.

180
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,429
Gosh.

181
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,669
To live a long and healthy life, I ought to exercise.

182
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,909
- Don't you agree, Mom? - You're totally right.

183
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,909
Right.

184
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,210
Guess what I saw last night.

185
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,179
I saw Sun Jae kissing a girl...

186
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,389
in front of his house.

187
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,950
What? He was kissing a girl?

188
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,258
Don't tell me you stood there and watched him.

189
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,329
Gosh. You're so inconsiderate.

190
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,928
He was doing that out on the street for everyone to watch.

191
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,259
How could I not watch them?

192
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,000
Gosh, that brat.

193
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,070
He has an innocent face and all.

194
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,200
But he's not shy about going after what he wants.

195
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,000
He's not like that!

196
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,169
How do you know if he's not like that or not?

197
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,038
Men are all the same.

198
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,449
Besides, his girlfriend must be just like him.

199
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,250
She followed him all the way to his house.

200
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,679
They weren't alone, you know?

201
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,120
"Muah."

202
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,289
He's not a little kid. He's done nothing wrong.

203
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,758
Well,

204
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,590
when two people like each other, it's okay to kiss.

205
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,729
Your mom is the one to talk. Whenever your mom and your dad...

206
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,329
looked at each other, they started kissing at the wall...

207
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,798
- or wherever they were. - Gosh. Come on, Mom! Stop it.

208
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,469
Gosh. Her lips were practically attached to his lips.

209
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,340
- Darn it. - That's how they had you.

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,539
Mom, I didn't know your lips were glued to his.

211
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,990
- Hello. - Hi.

212
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,359
By the way,

213
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,090
your son must have gotten a girlfriend.

214
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,029
- What? - Well, last night,

215
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,628
I saw him in the alley.

216
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,200
He was with his girlfriend.

217
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,898
- And he was... - He was what?

218
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,309
Well, he stayed very true to his instincts.

219
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,740
Is it because he watched the movie, "Basic Instincts," many times?

220
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,148
Gosh. He just went for it.

221
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,250
Gosh. Spit it out. What did he do?

222
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,549
Forget it. Gosh.

223
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,519
I should respect your son's fried.

224
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Gosh. Oh, my. He was just...

225
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,559
"Fried" is for fried chicken.

226
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,889
You meant to say "privacy."

227
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:46,129
So just tell me! What did he do? Come on.

228
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,940
Gosh. This is so frustrating.

229
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,769
- Sun Jae. - Yes?

230
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,870
You decided...

231
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,809
not to go to the US.

232
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,110
A girl can't be the reason behind not going. Right?

233
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,350
What?

234
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,450
Gosh, it's nothing like that!

235
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll be back later.

236
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,099
I knew it.

237
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,070
Swimming was the only thing he had ever been interested in.

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,408
She was the one who was mistaken.

239
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,669
How dare she accuse of my innocent boy?

240
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,809
It was a wild accusation at that too.

241
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,058
Someone might see us again.

242
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,159
Let's go now.

243
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,299
Let's go.

244
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,389
What if our classmates see us together?

245
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,590
Then should we hide it?

246
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,230
I'm just not sure if we should be holding hands in public.

247
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,360
Once I go back...

248
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,169
To me, every moment with you is precious.

249
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,509
So let's not conceal our feelings.

250
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,909
Let's not hide from people.

251
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,379
Let's fully follow our hearts.

252
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,480
Once you leave, I'll take care of the mess.

253
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,179
I won't cause any confusion on you.

254
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,919
You're saying that because you want to keep holding hands.

255
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,350
Yes.

256
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,529
Are you still worried?

257
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,860
Fine. If it still makes you uncomfortable,

258
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,129
keep it a secret.

259
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,440
- I got you! - What?

260
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,700
What's going on with those two?

261
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:09,840
Are you two dating?

262
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,879
You said you weren't dating!

263
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,679
You traitor!

264
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,419
You said you weren't dating and you guys weren't even close.

265
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,678
You said nothing was going on.

266
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,249
You feigned innocence and hid this from me. What?

267
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,288
"Keep it a secret?"

268
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,350
How could you betray your best friend?

269
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,220
Hey, why are you getting so angry over this?

270
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,889
You're hiding something from me too.

271
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,100
Like what?

272
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm not hiding anything from you.

273
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,870
Yes, you are.

274
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:35,969
You!

275
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,128
You must be nice to me.

276
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,798
I'll keep my eyes on you to see how well you treat her.

277
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,569
So you'd better behave well. Don't even look at other girls.

278
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,908
If you upset her and make her cry,

279
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,169
I'm going to...

280
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,479
My friend saw us together earlier. And he wants a date with you.

281
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,778
Zero, one, one, four, eight, eight, two, eight, four, eight.

282
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,779
What did you say?

283
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,019
Zero, one, one, four, eight, eight, two, eight, four, eight.

284
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,220
Tell your friend to contact me.

285
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,018
Then you two, have a lovely time together.

286
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,490
I'll give you guys privacy.

287
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,670
- You can go now. - Okay.

288
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,410
What? Are you going to take this lecture for me?

289
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,609
Yes.

290
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:18,909
Don't you have class today?

291
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,079
I have no class today.

292
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,079
You came to school when you have no class?

293
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,150
It's about to start.

294
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,548
What if the professor finds out?

295
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,549
Be quiet.

296
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,049
There's public distance.

297
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,390
Next.

298
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,460
Take a look at this. It's the depth of field.

299
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,899
It's the distance that allows the objects to be in focus.

300
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,268
- What was that? - There are different types...

301
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,328
- Pay attention. - of camera focus.

302
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,470
Deep focus, selective focus, and soft focus.

303
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,039
As for the deep focus,

304
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,339
it's an expressive method where it depicts objects directly.

305
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,980
Moreover, it emphasizes the harmony of the objects.

306
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,049
The realistic mise-en-scene will be important.

307
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,420
Should we have tteokbokki, your favourite?

308
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,089
- Tteokbokki sounds good. Yes. - Right?

309
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,519
Wait.

310
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,259
Hey. So you didn't go to the US.

311
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,839
- How did you find out? - Your dad called.

312
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,598
He said he was so frustrated by you.

313
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,240
He complained about you all morning.

314
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,140
You should've told me if you weren't leaving.

315
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,108
You made us audition by ourselves.

316
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:27,509
Right. How did the audition go?

317
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,450
We passed.

318
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,079
We're here for the final preliminary round.

319
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,250
Had I known you weren't leaving, I would've come here with you.

320
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,319
That's good.

321
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,088
You passed without me last time.

322
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:39,258
I'm sure you can pass without me again.

323
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,059
Hey, we're up.

324
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,259
Hey, I need to go in now.

325
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,459
Anyway, you have to make up for this.

326
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,329
Okay. I really hope you pass.

327
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,569
- Let's go. - Okay.

328
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,740
What audition?

329
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,609
Were you going to audition?

330
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,239
Yes.

331
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,910
In Hyuk told me to audition for some show, "Superstar K."

332
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,079
What?

333
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,589
But he passed without you?

334
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,118
Yes.

335
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,920
He's at the final preliminary round now.

336
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,390
No, Sun Jae.

337
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,099
Run.

338
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,369
- Where are we going? - To the audition.

339
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,568
- What? - Hurry.

340
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,500
Call In Hyuk. Tell him you're on your way now.

341
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,469
Calm down, Sol.

342
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,839
You must go now!

343
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,210
Going there now won't make a difference.

344
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,539
He said he was up next.

345
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,279
What?

346
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:37,809
Oh, no.

347
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,220
What do I do?

348
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,460
Why did you sing in front of so many people for something like this?

349
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,529
I must have gone mad.

350
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,069
Why do you look so down?

351
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:05,210
Was I supposed to audition for the show with In Hyuk?

352
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,980
Am I...

353
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:09,980
a singer in the future?

354
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,950
If you knew and heard about my song in the future,

355
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,690
I must be pretty famous.

356
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,990
Maybe not anymore.

357
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,059
So what then?

358
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
You liked...

359
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:31,670
singing.

360
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,970
You seemed really happy then.

361
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,109
- Really? - Yes.

362
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,309
I'm afraid that I might have stolen your joy...

363
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,220
and you might never get a chance to perform on stage because of me.

364
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,750
What if...

365
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,420
I'm not a singer anymore...

366
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,490
when you go back to the future? Will you be disappointed?

367
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,490
Why would I be disappointed?

368
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

369
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,459
What if I'm a happily unemployed man?

370
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,829
As long as you're happy,

371
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,670
I'll have to take care of you.

372
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,440
That feels reassuring.

373
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,538
Here are two cups of Americano.

374
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,880
- Thank you. - Thank you.

375
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,750
Really?

376
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,680
What do you do on the days without classes?

377
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,848
I watch movies.

378
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:21,949
I'm a fan of overseas soccer,

379
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,318
so I stay up all night to watch it when the season starts.

380
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,319
"Overseas soccer?"

381
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,559
Me too.

382
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,920
Are you a fan of Park Ji Sung?

383
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,359
- You too? - Me too.

384
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,588
- Two... - Hearts!

385
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,598
- Unstopping... - Hearts!

386
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,599
- Three... - Lungs!

387
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,599
- Oxygen... - Tank!

388
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,269
- Park Ji Sung, rise! - Rise!

389
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,269
I told her to find another guy, and she quickly did so.

390
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,069
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

391
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,779
He's in our department, right?

392
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,380
How is he? Is he a nice person?

393
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,410
Cho Rong?

394
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,920
He's a funny, heavy drinker.

395
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,519
His nickname is HDN,

396
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,650
short for Hard-drinking Nutcase.

397
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,119
"HDN."

398
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,659
- Open your mouth. - The one who likes to drink...

399
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,789
isn't a good guy.

400
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,700
Why did she choose him of all men?

401
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,329
Gosh.

402
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,400
- Hey. Let's go. - Okay.

403
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,799
That's boiling hot!

404
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,170
- It's not that hot. - How could you drink it?

405
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:19,680
- What's so funny about it? - Stop drinking it.

406
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,609
Wait. No.

407
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,348
You skipped morning classes.

408
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,419
Did you run a marathon or what?

409
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,219
My brother is getting married,

410
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,389
(Always greet politely, Department of Physical Education)

411
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,889
so I got him a honeymoon gift.

412
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,960
What is it?

413
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,469
I went to 100 convenience stores.

414
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,029
My goodness.

415
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,539
You're amazing.

416
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,369
- Hey. If he uses them all... - I'm sorry.

419
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,890
What are you doing?

420
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,930
Hey, Sun Jae.

421
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,059
You're making a lot of women cry since you got a girlfriend.

422
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,730
I'll also make many women cry once I get a girlfriend.

423
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,670
- What a nonsense. - Did the blind date go well?

424
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:18,670
Yes. Thanks, friend.

425
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,769
Hey. Let's go on a double date if it works out well with Hyun Ju.

426
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,608
What? Hey, hold on.

427
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,979
Did you set him on a blind date?

428
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,140
- Are you done? - Hold on.

429
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Okay. I'll be on my way.

430
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:30,880
I'll see you in front of the College of Humanities.

431
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,278
- Hey, I'll get going. - Okay. Bye.

432
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,420
- What? - Hey, about that blind date...

433
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,920
What are you doing?

434
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,190
Here.

435
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,000
What is this?

436
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,630
- It's cute. - Tada!

437
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,269
- It's a matching set. - Yes.

438
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,909
- They are cute. - They're cute, right?

439
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,940
Yes.

440
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,799
What are you doing?

441
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:21,059
Don't you know this?

442
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,068
If you catch a falling petal,

443
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,230
they say your wish comes true.

444
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,039
Let's make a wish. Close your eyes.

445
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,029
What did you wish for?

446
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,829
It's a secret.

447
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,799
What about you?

448
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,970
It's a secret too.

449
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,680
But...

450
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,880
I think I already got my wish.

451
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,650
What?

452
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,990
What was that?

453
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,059
What if others see us?

454
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:03,829
Hey.

455
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,618
Wait until I catch you.

456
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:21,819
Catch me if you can.

457
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,089
Why?

458
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,269
Why does a day feel so short?

459
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,529
I know.

460
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,900
Go and get some rest, then.

461
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,710
- Do I really have to go home? - What?

462
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,910
I want to stay with you a little longer.

463
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,950
Can't I?

464
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,549
You can.

465
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,490
What? No.

466
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:57,950
I mean...

467
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,460
There's no place to go at this hour.

468
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:03,990
There's a place we can go.

469
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Where?

470
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,869
When are you going to get a hold of yourself?

471
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,410
Don't count your chickens.

472
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,509
What's wrong?

473
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,509
What?

474
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,380
It's nothing.

475
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,019
The ocean is pretty.

476
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,230
Should we go?

477
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,160
To the ocean?

478
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,829
Yes. Let's go and watch the ocean...

479
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,839
before you go back.

480
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,049
Okay. We'll go and watch the ocean.

481
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,759
I just wanted to rewind it a little.

482
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,170
Sure, go ahead. Rewind it.

483
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,299
Roll back about a minute.

484
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,480
Should we roll back a minute too?

485
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
What?

486
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,279
If you give me another chance, I'll try my best...

487
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,950
Stop it.

488
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,518
Because you pecked me on the streets before,

489
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,950
I got all confused.

490
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,789
Just keep watching the movie.

491
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,859
It's a shame.

492
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:33,839
How can you fall asleep right now?

493
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,940
Let's stay like this a bit.

494
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,640
Just a little longer.

495
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,119
(Gold Videos and DVDs)

496
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,509
When did I fall asleep?

497
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,490
Oh, no!

498
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,559
For goodness' sake.

499
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,670
Are you up?

500
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,480
I didn't sleep.

501
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,109
You didn't?

502
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,149
How could I fall asleep?

503
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,650
Why? Did I snore?

504
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,119
Forget it.

505
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,759
Why are you fanning me all of a sudden?

506
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,599
What? Right. Well...

507
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,900
I thought it'd be hot for you.

508
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,940
What?

509
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:44,839
Why are you grabbing me by the collar?

510
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,909
I think something's on the shirt.

511
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,519
Were you drooling? It's all right.

512
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,650
No.

513
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:55,849
It's okay.

514
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,490
That Cotton Swab.

515
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,730
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

516
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,240
Actually...

517
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,569
- Son of a gun! - Geum.

518
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,739
Come on out!

519
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,909
- Come here, jerk! - What's wrong with you?

520
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,380
Was it you...

521
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,548
who was smooching in the alley?

522
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,118
What did you do with my sister all night long?

523
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,919
Let go, Mom. We didn't do anything.

524
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,118
I didn't do anything.

525
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,490
Then why are you half-naked, jerk?

526
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,229
How dare you grab my son by the collar?

527
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,189
Let go of him!

528
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,259
- Dad. - Let go!

529
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,200
Gosh. What are you doing?

530
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,430
Dad!

531
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:45,670
Dad.

532
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,240
How dare you...

533
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,410
Let go of him, I said!

534
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,209
Gosh!

535
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,609
Did you just hit my son?

536
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,339
Did you?

537
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,949
- Mom. Calm down... - Dad.

538
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,250
- and listen to me. - Don't stop me!

539
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,049
- Yes. I hit him. - Dad.

540
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,618
Do I just stand here and watch while my son gets humiliated, then?

541
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,018
"Humiliated?"

542
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,159
Check how your son looks before you say so.

543
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,490
What can be wrong with how he looks?

544
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,859
Well, it's...

545
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,940
Does that mean you two are...

546
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,269
You prick.

547
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,539
Did you not go to the US because of Sol?

548
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,710
That's not it, Dad.

549
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:28,079
Why do you give up your dream just for a girl?

550
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,848
"Just for a girl?"

551
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,108
That's my precious daughter!

552
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,750
My son is precious too.

553
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,088
How did she seduce my innocent son...

554
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,720
and drag him down so that he wouldn't go to the US?

555
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:40,289
Who dragged him down?

556
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,828
It was your son who scooped up the water...

557
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,660
like a servant when our house was flooded...

558
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,098
to win my daughter's heart!

559
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,329
You have no idea.

560
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,629
Also, my Sol wasn't interested in him at all.

561
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,599
You're being ridiculous.

562
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,500
Hey. Is this true?

563
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,869
- Goodness. - Yes.

564
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,140
I begged her to like me.

565
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,308
See?

566
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,410
Keep your mouth closed, prick.

567
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,410
"Innocent," my foot.

568
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,319
He rented an R-rated video when he was underage.

569
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,448
He rented "Basic Instincts..."

570
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,618
for a month and watched it over and over again...

571
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,859
until the tape is distorted.

572
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,119
- For goodness' sake. - Really?

573
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,499
Gosh. I'm sick and tired of hearing...

574
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,329
- about "Basic Instincts." - No. Don't listen to them.

575
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,440
- Don't listen to them. - Okay.

576
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,739
I watched it.

577
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,869
I watched the movie!

578
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,340
- Dad. - Satisfied?

579
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,809
For goodness' sake.

580
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,308
Besides eating and sleeping, Sun Jae only cared...

581
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,079
about swimming.

582
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,650
He had no interest in women.

583
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,420
Not even a little bit.

584
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,219
Not even this much he was interested in them.

585
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,360
- Same here! - He was truly innocent!

586
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,389
He was pure like oxygen.

587
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,030
Oxygen!

588
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,300
Let's go.

589
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,070
Dad. We can't leave like this.

590
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,268
You're too naive. Come on out.

591
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,738
Dad. We can't leave like this.

592
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,578
- Hurry up! - No, I can't.

593
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:07,610
- Why do you insist? - Come on, Dad!

594
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:28,969
No. Why are they...

595
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,530
"Innocent?"

596
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,368
"Pure like oxygen?"

597
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,670
Pervert!

598
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:37,809
You...

599
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,440
What's going on?

600
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,909
What's wrong?

601
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,308
Mom, actually...

602
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,409
Stop!

603
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,849
These are mine.

604
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,759
These are all mine.

605
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,959
That doesn't make sense, does it?

606
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,189
It's because I still feel hot in my heart!

607
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,300
Stop it.

608
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,070
I get that he's an adult now, but still.

609
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,670
Look. There must be hundreds of them!

610
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,968
Sol. You can never see a wolf like him...

611
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,638
with such a dark intent. Never.

612
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,868
I'll never let you!

613
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,038
Gosh.

614
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,550
Thank you for being against their relationship. Yes.

615
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,480
I told you to let go of him!

616
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,948
You too. Don't date a girl...

617
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,590
from such a bossy family. Never!

618
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,320
- Let's go. - But...

619
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,988
These aren't really mine.

620
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,360
- Who cares? - Please hear us out.

621
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:33,799
- Sun Jae. - Sol.

622
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,130
- Sun Jae! - What are you doing?

623
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,598
- Let it go! - Sun Jae!

624
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,669
- Sol! - Let go!

625
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,698
- Sun Jae! - Sol!

626
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,169
Dad, come on. Sol.

627
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,269
Sol!

628
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,469
Sun Jae!

629
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,510
Are they furious?

630
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,319
I explained to them that you were not such a person,

631
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,420
but it didn't work.

632
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,349
What should we do?

633
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,460
By the way, Sun Jae,

634
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,489
those...

635
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,659
aren't yours, right?

636
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,429
Of course not!

637
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,229
Come on.

638
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,569
Of all people, how could you think...

639
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,809
Right. I do believe you.

640
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,639
- Do you believe me 100 percent? - What?

641
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,809
Yes. Sure.

642
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,079
I believe you.

643
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,579
You don't believe me.

644
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
I can't let this pass.

645
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:33,019
I'll give you an explanation within an hour, so wait.

646
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,230
Okay.

647
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,260
How did they get into my bag?

648
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,230
So, they...

649
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,300
I have to focus.

650
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,550
Is that how they got in?

651
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,690
(Calling Cho Rong)

652
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,788
- The phone is turned off. - Why isn't he picking up?

653
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:06,920
Please leave a message...

654
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,960
- Hey, Sun Jae. - Hey. About those con...

655
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,199
Those con...

656
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,529
- "Con?" - You know those.

657
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,900
"Con?" What do you mean?

658
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,400
Unicorns?

659
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,699
No.

660
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,669
There were hundreds of them in a black plastic bag.

661
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,670
Don't you know them?

662
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,739
Right. Those.

663
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,340
How did you know about those?

664
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,808
Actually, Cho Rong was worried sick because he lost them...

665
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:30,979
while they are a gift for his brother.

666
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,179
Were they Cho Rong's?

667
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,880
For goodness' sake!

668
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,920
Cho Rong's phone was off. Where is he?

669
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,769
Dad.

670
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,869
- What? - You came all the way here.

671
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,709
So, this boy, Sun Jae...

672
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,578
No. He knows enough now,

673
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:01,979
so he's a grownup.

674
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,949
So, Sun Jae, a grown-up man has summoned us...

675
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,579
to get the record straight.

676
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,420
Let's resolve the misunderstandings between the two sides now.

677
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,360
Here's what started.

678
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,730
Who watched...

679
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,860
"Basic Instincts?"

680
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,969
I was the one who rented it,

681
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,099
but I didn't watch it.

682
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,940
Are you saying that you drank but it's not a DUI case?

683
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
Look!

684
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,309
We have a DVD player, so we can't watch VHS tapes.

685
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,049
He's right.

686
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,650
Why did you rent it, then?

687
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:39,920
It's because...

688
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,288
I grabbed whatever because my heart was throbbing.

689
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,388
Why did your heart throb while renting a video?

690
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:46,719
Do you have arrhythmia?

691
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,360
It was because...

692
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,289
Sol at the counter was so pretty.

693
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,800
What are you talking about...

694
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,170
You brat.

695
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,599
Why are you smiling with your eyes?

696
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,178
Gosh. You're so soft.

697
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:10,449
You're saying you were blinded by my granddaughter's beauty.

698
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,880
Sure. That's possible.

699
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,619
Okay. Moving on.

700
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,888
Who will explain the reason why you were naked...

701
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,590
in the morning?

702
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,388
Actually, Grandma,

703
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,800
the shirt got ripped while I tried to wipe something off.

704
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,900
What? You ripped it?

705
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,730
You are unbelievable!

706
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,069
She did rip off the shirt, but nothing happened.

707
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,070
Hey.

708
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,969
She's strong.

709
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,639
- Dad. - "It's love, not an affair?"

710
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,848
It's true. I fell asleep while watching a movie.

711
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,079
I drooled, so...

712
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,650
Will you trust me, Grandma?

713
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,659
Of course. I trust what my puppy says.

714
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,760
Okay. Moving on.

715
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,929
The pile of this stuff from the bag.

716
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,170
Goodness, Mom.

717
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,599
- Please cover them. - Anyway.

718
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,210
In what mindset did you prepare more than hundreds of them?

719
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,880
Those aren't really mine. Those are my friend's stuff.

720
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,150
Liar! Why would we believe that?

721
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,650
I have a witness.

722
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,420
He is supposed to be here. Hold on.

723
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:22,550
- I'm on my way. - Wait a minute.

724
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:23,919
"A witness?"

725
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,190
Did you ask the owner of those to come over?

726
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,360
Yes.

727
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,619
He'll be here soon.

728
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,130
Darn it.

729
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,829
Why isn't he coming? This is insane.

730
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,099
Gosh. You fool.

731
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,969
What the heck is this?

732
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,369
Hey, let's just go.

733
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:43,340
No, Dad. Hold on.

734
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,408
Right. A clumsy explanation will only embarrass you more.

735
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,078
Also, I have to go to an aerobics class.

736
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,279
- Let's go now. - Mom.

737
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,808
- Mom, just a little longer. - Let's wrap it up...

738
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,279
because I have to go to the cultural centre too.

739
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,979
- Please wait. - Grandma.

740
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,289
- Just another three minutes. - Sun Jae.

741
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,510
Hello. Well...

742
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,239
Where are...

743
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:20,340
my condoms?

744
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,980
We're safe now!

745
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,860
It's a bit blurry.

746
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,230
It's Kim Young Soo.

747
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,360
I think he tried to pull over in a place with no security camera.

748
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,929
Fortunately, he didn't notice the camera blocked by the tree.

749
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:45,369
And...

750
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,070
Here. He came back after 15 minutes and left.

751
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,380
We can't track his location after that.

752
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,039
I think he took the national highway where there's no security camera.

753
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,178
He pulled over onto the shoulder...

754
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,050
and came back as long as 15 minutes later?

755
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,820
Did he meet someone?

756
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,820
Was there an ATM by any chance?

757
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,119
There was a pay phone.

758
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,789
There was a pay phone about 1km from here.

759
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,329
I requested the outgoing call records...

760
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,230
for that time frame from the telephone office.

761
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,328
What is this place for?

762
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:18,229
They sell livestock feed.

763
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,539
The owner used to run an illegal slaughterhouse.

764
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,879
He uses anaesthetic for animals every time he commits a crime.

765
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,340
Was he trying to get it there?

766
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,449
I think he's preparing for the next crime.

767
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,718
I like your confidence.

768
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,789
I like your confidence.

769
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,029
Let's do it. Show me.

770
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,059
Show me your confidence.

771
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,730
There you go. It's good.

772
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
Good.

773
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:54,570
Gosh.

774
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,780
This is nice. Smile.

775
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Gosh, this is great.

776
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,549
Yes!

777
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,149
My hair doesn't look so good.

778
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,159
- Your hair? - Yes.

779
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:14,619
It looks nice.

780
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,760
You look cool. You're the best.

781
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,190
Don't do that.

782
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,530
Excuse me.

783
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,500
Don't take pictures of my prince.

784
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,839
I'm texting.

785
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,999
Is he a celebrity or what?

786
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,299
- What's wrong with him? - This is unbelievable.

787
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,840
Don't go overboard. Come on.

788
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,239
Oh, my goodness.

789
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,150
He's so handsome.

790
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,549
The guy next to him looks like carp-shaped bread.

791
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,879
No. He looks like a sea squirt.

792
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,280
- But he's so good-looking! - He's so good-looking!

793
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,949
Thank you so much.

794
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,789
He said, "Thank you so much!"

795
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,659
Carp-shaped bread? A sea squirt?

796
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,760
Gosh, I envy you so much.

797
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,599
Yes. What's the matter?

798
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
What?

799
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:01,599
Is the owner of the white truck that was in front of my house...

800
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,869
- Kim Young Soo? - Yes.

801
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,578
It means he's been roaming around me,

802
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,078
waiting for a chance.

803
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,679
They'll contact you soon.

804
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:11,550
But I came to warn you beforehand.

805
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,380
- Thank you. - Considering the situation,

806
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,549
don't you have to tell your family and evade him beforehand...

807
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,789
until he's caught?

808
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,619
No, I can't.

809
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:21,989
If he had decided to find me,

810
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,360
he'd do it no matter where I am.

811
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,130
What on earth happens because of him? Why are you being like this?

812
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,099
You can't give me an answer to this either, can you?

813
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,670
So please don't tell anyone and keep it a secret.

814
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,110
For free?

815
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,710
You should treat me to a meal at least.

816
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,480
Okay. I'll treat you to a meal.

817
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,780
What?

818
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,079
Sun Jae.

819
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,449
Hi, friend.

820
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,650
Why would you treat him to a meal?

821
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,019
Well,

822
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,289
that's...

823
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,929
Why are you here?

824
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,199
I came to get my dad's underwear back.

825
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
Look.

826
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,329
Right.

827
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,170
I took it by mistake last time.

828
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,639
I said I would treat him to a meal because I was sorry.

829
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,639
Let's go.

830
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,309
I'll treat you to a meal.

831
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,409
Why would you do that?

832
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:21,550
I don't want my girlfriend to eat with her ex-boyfriend.

833
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,820
- Why? - What?

834
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,190
Thank you.

835
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:32,760
Don't visit Sol from now on.

836
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:35,400
Let me just eat, friend.

837
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,768
We were never friends. Why do you keep calling me that?

838
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:41,969
We even slept together. Of course, we're friends.

839
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,880
So Sol is your girlfriend?

840
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,210
She's my girlfriend now.

841
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
(Soju)

842
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,019
Congratulations.

843
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,869
You think it will last forever, right?

844
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:11,699
It doesn't.

845
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,800
Look at me. She dumped me only after two weeks.

846
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,070
You should treat her right while she's your girlfriend.

847
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,739
Whatever.

848
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,309
What's the secret...

849
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:24,849
- she told you not to tell anyone? - What?

850
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,320
Did you hear it earlier?

851
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,848
Did you say you would treat me to food to ask me about that?

852
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,449
Why would I do it then?

853
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,960
What can I do?

854
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,689
She told me not to tell anyone.

855
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,260
I'm not "anyone."

856
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,259
I don't know.

857
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,760
I'm never going to tell you.

858
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,670
So ask your own girlfriend.

859
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,840
I'll pay for it before I go. Enjoy your food.

860
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,639
Are you leaving?

861
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,780
I hate eating alone.

862
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:57,849
Are you a kid?

863
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,219
You...

864
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,789
Don't roam around Sol.

865
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,659
There's a reason for it.

866
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,859
You don't even know.

867
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,599
- What's the reason? - It's a secret.

868
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,500
My goodness.

869
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:20,800
I'm jealous of you, you punk.

870
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,639
You should've done better, you punk.

871
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,039
You know what?

872
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,210
I think...

873
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,380
I liked her a lot.

874
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:34,519
So what? I don't care.

875
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:39,889
Is she really going after a month?

876
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,989
I don't know, you punk.

877
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,269
Action.

878
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,598
("My Daughter's Affair As Revenge")

879
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,800
What do you want to do now?

880
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,799
- Shall we eat? - Shall we?

881
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,339
- What do you want to do after that? - After that...

882
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,468
- How dare you do that? - What are you doing?

883
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,408
- Hey! - Hey!

884
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,749
- It's not what you think. - Hey.

885
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,780
It's not good.

886
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,849
How dare you cheat on my daughter?

887
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:10,150
- Hey! - Get him!

888
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,849
Wait!

889
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,489
Wrap up the shooting!

890
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,260
- Why? - The guy who cheats on his wife.

891
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Hwang Jung Ho will make a cameo appearance and play it!

892
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:20,799
What? Hwang Jung Ho?

893
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,959
Hwang Jung Ho who received Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival?

894
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,098
Wrap up the shooting immediately...

895
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,368
and set the date again according to his schedule.

896
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:28,339
- Yes. This is amazing. - This is incredible.

897
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,739
- Oh, my gosh. - Ma'am.

898
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,839
- It's Hwang Jung Ho. - It's Hwang Jung Ho.

899
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,138
It's Hwang Jung Ho.

900
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,650
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Hwang Jung Ho!

901
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,348
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Hwang Jung Ho!

902
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,819
Director.

903
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,348
Does it mean I'm fired?

904
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,820
I don't usually replace actors.

905
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,618
But it's Hwang Jung Ho who went to the Cannes Film Festival.

906
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:48,718
You understand it, right? I like your mindset.

907
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,530
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Hwang Jung Ho!

908
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,199
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Hwang Jung Ho!

909
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,170
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Hwang Jung Ho!

910
00:49:57,269 --> 00:49:59,969
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Hwang Jung Ho!

911
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,900
- Hwang Jung Ho! - Dinner is on me!

912
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:13,848
(Pain relief patch)

913
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:14,980
Put this on.

914
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,989
They beat you everywhere.

915
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,659
Don't tell my mom about this.

916
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,829
Be happy that you're fired.

917
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,730
You might have broken your bone if you had continued.

918
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,530
Is that how you comfort people?

919
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:31,969
Don't pity me.

920
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,599
Do you think I'm pitiful?

921
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,840
What's pitiful about you?

922
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:38,368
The broadcasters who don't recognize your talent...

923
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,280
and look down on you are much more pitiful.

924
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,210
You look like Hyun Bin and Gong Yoo to my eyes.

925
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:44,949
What?

926
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,719
Gosh.

927
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,820
That's not right.

928
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,449
I have a conscience too.

929
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,550
No.

930
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:55,960
You're a man who is like 24k pure gold to me.

931
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:58,659
You're like a gold bar.

932
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,599
A gold bar?

933
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,800
A gold bar, my foot.

934
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,940
By the way, I thought things were going well with Cho Rong.

935
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,839
- Who said that? - You guys were giggling...

936
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,078
and overjoyed.

937
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,679
I couldn't bear to look at you because I got goosebumps.

938
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,149
Look at this. Do you see it?

939
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,280
I got goosebumps.

940
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,219
What? I got you.

941
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,119
What are you talking about?

942
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:25,820
You're jealous, aren't you?

943
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,719
What do you mean I'm jealous?

944
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,789
You are.

945
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,329
Why are you stuttering? Why is your face red?

946
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:34,459
Go away.

947
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,670
- Why is it red? - Don't touch me.

948
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,980
Go!

949
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,868
Geum, go inside quickly.

950
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:11,269
No. You go in first.

951
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,769
I'm okay. You go in first.

952
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:15,939
You should survive at least.

953
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,039
No way!

954
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,369
How can I try to survive alone?

955
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:29,989
We're safe.

956
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,920
Why is it not leaving?

957
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,860
By the way,

958
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,690
why did you want me to hide alone?

959
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:40,960
I was worried you might be bitten.

960
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:42,730
That's ridiculous.

961
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,369
You almost got bitten to death by that big dog.

962
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,869
Geum.

963
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,670
You're so...

964
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,659
Gosh! What the heck?

965
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,300
What the heck?

966
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,030
Good morning.

967
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,130
What?

968
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,139
I can't believe they're my friends.

969
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,710
Hey, why was I sleeping with this guy here?

970
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,009
Do you not remember?

971
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,139
Do you not?

972
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,980
Sol.

973
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,719
Why are there so many Sols here?

974
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,448
- Sol. - Let's go.

975
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,759
- Why are you hurt? - Sol.

976
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,788
- I like you! - Im Sol!

977
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:45,788
- Im Sol! - Im Sol!

978
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,499
Sol.

979
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,698
Im Sol.

980
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:54,469
Don't go

981
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,739
I wish it was me

982
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,009
I wish you loved me

983
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,179
- Don't cry, you punk. - I wish it was me

984
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,750
No way.

985
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,889
Gosh.

986
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:13,050
- Look. - This is crazy.

987
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:15,719
What?

988
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,760
Darn it.

989
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,630
What are these?

990
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,559
You're best friends now.

991
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,729
No wonder. You both have a weird taste for women.

992
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,900
You must click.

993
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,170
- What's wrong with Sol? - What's wrong with Sol?

994
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:31,409
Don't you ever drink together.

995
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,809
I'm sensitive today.

996
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:36,139
So please get lost. Okay?

997
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,519
My goodness.

998
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,579
I should just cook hangover ramyeon.

999
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:47,659
Two packets?

1000
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,289
Three.

1001
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,760
Those punks.

1002
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,139
What's the secret she told you about?

1003
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:03,570
Don't you think I should know?

1004
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,809
What on earth is that?

1005
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,779
My dad is chasing after Kim Young Soo.

1006
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,179
So mind your own business.

1007
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,750
That's all I can say.

1008
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,219
Kim Young Soo.

1009
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,400
Why are you taking them off?

1010
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,400
I put up this place for rent.

1011
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:34,570
I'm going to quit the band and go back to my hometown.

1012
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,670
All of a sudden?

1013
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,309
Are you all right?

1014
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,239
What if I'm not all right?

1015
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,510
The club fired us. So today is our last performance.

1016
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,849
But we won't even be able to do it because Dong Seob quit the band.

1017
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,059
It's your last performance. You should do it.

1018
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:55,460
Do you want me to promote it?

1019
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,829
I can't sing, but I have a good look.

1020
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,769
I'll fill the venue with an audience. How about that?

1021
00:56:06,969 --> 00:56:07,969
You?

1022
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:09,599
Really?

1023
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,219

(Anaesthetic for animals)

1025
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,949
Darn it.

1026
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,058
It's good to see you, Young Soo.

1027
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:04,130
Kim Young Soo.

1028
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,530
You're caught, you punk.

1029
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,269
What did you say?

1030
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,699
He was caught?

1031
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,030
Yes, Sol.

1032
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,800
It's all over now. You don't have to worry.

1033
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,210
Okay. Thank you.

1034
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,719
It's really over.

1035
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:35,420
Today is In Hyuk's last performance.

1036
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:36,889
Do you want to watch it together?

1037
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,960
- Let's go. - Yes.

1038
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,679
Did Sun Jae not come yet?

1039
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:02,679
There are usually not many people when we perform.

1040
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:03,989
It's unusual today.

1041
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,349
It's thanks to my friend.

1042
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,389
Princesses, please come and watch these cool guys' performance.

1043
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,460
Are you ready?

1044
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:13,429
Let's go, guys.

1045
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,869
- Oh, my gosh! - Goodness!

1046
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,110
Hello.

1047
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:34,050
So many people are here. Thank you.

1048
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,449
Actually, today is our last performance.

1049
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,760
That's why we're joined by a special guest vocalist.

1050
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,190
Please give him a hand.

1051
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,400
The first song is made by our guest vocalist.

1052
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,440
You might never get a chance...

1053
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,539
to perform on stage because of me.

1054
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,309
It's "Sonaki."

1055
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,460
I didn't want it to stop

1056
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,570
On the day you first came to me

1057
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,070
I didn't want you to be the rain

1058
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,610
That soaks me wet only momentarily

1059
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,480
I've prayed so hard

1060
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,650
Do you know how I feel?

1061
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:50,089
I've dreamt of you every day

1062
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:55,059
My heart is soaked in you again today

1063
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,928
You are a gift

1064
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,468
From the sky

1065
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:08,079
When you're all alone in this world

1066
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,650
I'll protect you

1067
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,309
Thank you for staying alive.

1068
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,280
You should live your life today.

1069
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,090
Because it's a great day.

1070
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,590
It rained when I saw you for the first time.

1071
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,820
I liked it that day.

1072
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,360
I like you...

1073
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,260
a lot.

1074
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,500
Sol.

1075
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,530
Stop running away from me.

1076
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,539
Just pursue your feelings for me.

1077
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:40,380
If I end up dying to save you,

1078
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,449
I'll be fine with that.

1079
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,269
Sun Jae. It's all over.

1080
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:07,239
We have a future now.

1081
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:12,969
I haven't forgotten even the smallest memory

1082
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:16,279
That you gave me

1083
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,650
I think about you again today

1084
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,949
You who are a gift

1085
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:27,119
To me

1086
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,070
It was amazing!

1087
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,659
Yes, Sol.

1088
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:11,170
It's all over now. You don't have to worry.

1089
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,809

01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,489
Let's make a wish. Close your eyes.

1093
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,659
I hope my dear Sol stays happy for a long time.

1094
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,190
I hope my dear Sun Jae stays happy for a long time.

1095
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:42,059
- I hope we stay happy together... - I hope we stay happy together...

1096
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,199
- for a long time. - for a long time.

1097
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:09,219
(Lovely Runner)

1098
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,730
What happens here that day?

1099
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,400
Why are you suddenly being like this?

1100
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,928
Someone might carry my girlfriend away. Why?

1101
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:18,599
- What? - He put up his house for rent?

1102
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,400
Do you know where his house is in his hometown?

1103
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,940
Danpo-ri?

1104
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:23,638
Don't cause any trouble for the adults...

1105
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,409
and come back after playing quietly.

1106
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,880
- Soondol! - If there's the brightest moment...

1107
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,940
in my youth,

1108
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,980
I hope I'm with you.

1109
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,150
I wish tomorrow would never come.

1110
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,650
I wish we could stay here, trapped in this moment.

1111
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:39,349
I wish you could never go back.

1112
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:42,889
Sun Jae. What do we do?
