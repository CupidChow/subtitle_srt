12
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,790

(Episode 13)

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,040
What are you thinking about?

15
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,870
What?

16
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,510
Nothing.

17
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,650
Are they raiding the snack bar? What's taking them so long?

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,879
Sorry, we're late.

19
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,180
The train will arrive soon. Let's go.

20
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,219
Let's go.

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,590
Okay.

(May 6, 2pm)

23
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,900
Do you want to listen to music?

24
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,229
Sol.

25
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,300
Sol?

26
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,520
Did you fall asleep?

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,979
Where am I?

28
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,419
What's wrong?

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,789
What am I doing here with you?

30
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,770
Sol. Why all of a sudden...

31
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,439
Don't tell me...

32
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,039
Did you...

33
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,479
go back?

34
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,479
Let go of me.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,550
- Sol. - Don't follow me.

36
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,990
I'm a bit confused right now.

37
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,460
I'll go back alone. I'm sorry.

38
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,560
I'll change my fate on my own.

39
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,899
Sun Jae.

40
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,899

41
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,399

44
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,990
What's this?

45
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,419
Darn it. I won nothing again this time.

46
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,019
The cash prize this time was ten million dollars.

47
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,889
- Ten million dollars? - Yes.

49
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,870

51

A present from me.

52
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,099
What's this?

53
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,069
I got these numbers from a very trusted source.

54
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,009
Are they lottery numbers?

55
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,579
How trusted is your source?

56
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,049
Please do it tenaciously.

57
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,350
Don't give up after a few tries. Keep trying until you win.

58
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,550
Understood?

59
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:46,949
Okay. I got it.

60
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,790
Hyun Ju, I did everything I could.

61
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,509
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

62
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,439
- Let's go. - Okay.

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,209
There are much better amusement parks.

64
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,009
Why here?

65
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,749
I came here with my family...

66
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,790
on my birthday before my father passed away.

67
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,019
I really wanted to come here.

68
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,189
You should've told me that sooner.

69
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,759
Nothing has changed.

70
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,160
Does this exist in the future too?

71
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:31,660
Probably.

72
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,029
Let's come back here then.

73
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,629
We can meet again in the future...

74
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,500
and come back here together.

75
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,509
Sure.

76
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,980
I really hope this isn't the last time we come here together.

77
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,649
Let's go.

78

79
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,459
Hey, you can't eat the whole thing.

80
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,029
Here. Have some.

81
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,959
I won't hang out with you.

82

(Kingdom of Thrill)

84
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,019
It's kind of scary now that we're inside.

85
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,560
Is that so?

86
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,529
Then stay close to my back.

87
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,029
- Let's go. - Okay.

88
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,800
It's creepy.

89
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,699
Gosh. This isn't scary at all.

90
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,540
What...

91
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,190
Are you scared?

92
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,649
Gosh. This is nothing...

93
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,059
This really isn't scary at all.

94
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,529
That's a doll. This too.

95
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,399
And this.

96
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,940
Sun Jae. Are you okay?

97
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,340
Hey, where are you going?

98
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,379
What's taking him so long?

99
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,820
- Sol! - I...

100
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,419
- I'm sorry. - Hello.

101
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,099
What is that? Did you leave to buy that?

102
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,769
Yes. I ran like crazy.

103
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,539
It's your birthday. You should get to blow out the candles.

104
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,779
- Happy birthday. - You should sing the song too.

105
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:33,379
I can't believe Sun Jae will be singing right in front of me.

106
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,519
Happy birthday to you

107
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,259
Happy birthday to you, dear my Sol

108
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,919
Happy birthday to you

109
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,429
Thank you.

110
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,570
Put your hand in your right pocket.

111
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,769
What?

112
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,110
When did you put this in? What's this?

113
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,679
Open it if you want to.

114
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,759
Why are you so quiet?

115
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,490
Do you not like it?

116
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,659
No. This is so beautiful.

117
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,929
It's so beautiful that I'm speechless.

118
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm glad to hear that.

119
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,039
Can I put this on now?

120
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:37,679
Give that to me. I'll put it on you.

121
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,250
Is this how you do it?

122
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,190
The guys in the dramas could hook it in one go.

123
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,759
- Should I do it? - I'm almost there.

124
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,799
All done.

125
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,100
What?

126
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,669
I'll let you ride it one more time. It's on the house.

127
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:06,999
Have a nice time.

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,240
Go back to what you were doing. Keep going.

129
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,879
One more round for the couple!

130
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,080
He definitely got the wrong idea, didn't he?

131
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,779
Oh, my. How will I get off later? This is so embarrassing.

132
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,220
You look beautiful.

133
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:30,899
This is really beautiful.

134
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,899
Thank you.

135
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,169
I should thank you...

136
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,870
for coming into this world.

137
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,139
For making the long journey of time to come to me.

138
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,768
With that, I got a chance...

139
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,240
to ask you to be with me.

140
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,009
For that, I'm grateful.

141
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,950
Sun Jae.

142
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,950
The present you may not know,

143
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,759
but the person who saved my life...

144
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,590
and the person who made me want to live again...

145
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:03,990
It was all you.

146
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,500
I did that?

147
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,500
So...

148
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,799
I will be more grateful to you.

149
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,110
By the way,

150
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,620
just a thank-you is all I get?

151
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,279
What?

152
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,149
He told us to have a nice time. Since he got the wrong idea...

153
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,830
You asked for a reward right after thanking me for being born.

154
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,600
Gosh. You're so petty.

155
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,330
I've always been petty.

156
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,370
If...

157
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,570
tomorrow... No.

158
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,809
If today ends up being my last day here,

159
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,110
don't be so sad.

160
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,379
Don't cry. Okay?

161
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,599
Hello.

162
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,658
Hello.

163
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,470
Hello. I am...

164
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,840
Detective Kim Won Chul from Kangmok Police Station.

165
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,070
What?

166
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,110
What brings you here, Detective?

167
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,049
How could we believe your word that a fugitive might show up...

168
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,779
and be on standby all day?

169
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,110
Are you a shaman?

170
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,850
No one is going to believe me.

171
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,090
What should I do?

172
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,090
(Mom)

173
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,058
Hey, Mom.

174
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,600
Come to Seoul right now.

175
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,200
What? Well, I told you I was coming tomorrow.

176
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,970
So you were abducted...

177
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,139
last year.

178
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,378
Mom, how did you find out about that?

179
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,509
The detective came to me and told me everything.

180
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,719
You barely escaped after getting abducted by a killer.

181
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,278
- Why didn't you tell me? - Mom, that's...

182
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,449
I don't want to hear it. Just come back to Seoul now.

183
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,119
The murderer is still at large. He could be anywhere.

184
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,959
How could you go out right now? It's dangerous.

185
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,058
No. I'll go and pick you up.

186
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,830
Stay in a crowded place.

187
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,299
Mom, calm down. Please?

188
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,599
I told you I was with Sun Jae.

189
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,999
Why would I be in danger when I'm with Sun Jae?

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,269
- Sun Jae is with you? - Yes.

191
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,138
Besides, Sun Jae's friend's father...

192
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,969
will drive us to the station tomorrow.

193
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,839
How could I leave so urgently like something happened?

194
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,878
They will be worried.

195
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,178
Then don't be alone. Stay in a crowded place.

196
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,980
No. Stay glued to Sun Jae. Okay?

197
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,450
Okay.

198
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,789
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

199
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,320
Once I get home, I'll explain everything.

200
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:21,230
Okay. Be careful when you come back to Seoul.

201
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,939
- Gosh. - You fool.

202
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,340
You should have comforted her.

203
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,638
Why did you yell at her?

204
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,639
Because I was so upset.

205
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,808
She must have been so scared if she lost her memory.

206
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,009
I had no idea. I scolded her for being so scatterbrained.

207
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,379
- I kept lecturing her. Oh, no. - Gosh.

208
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,720
- Hello. - Sun Jae.

209
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,460
- Is Sol here? - Where's Sol?

210
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,600
I thought you were with Sol.

211
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,269
She said she was with you and not to worry about her.

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,569
She told you she was with me?

213
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,340
- Yes. - When?

214
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,970
- Just now on the phone. - What?

215
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,779
Sol. Why all of a sudden...

216
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,080
- Let go of me. - The watch...

217
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,620
She was still wearing it.

218
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,919
She went back to the future. Then why was the watch still here?

219
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,320
Sun Jae.

220
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,429
If tomorrow...

221
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:29,960
No.

222
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,799
If today ends up being my last day here,

223
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,700
don't be so sad.

224
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,629
Where am I?

225
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,340
What am I doing here with you?

226
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,570
Did she pretend to have gone back to the future?

227
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:48,580
May 10? What's happening on that day?

228
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,519
I won't ask you about the date. But why is it there of all places?

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,778
Don't talk about to me.

230
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,549
Just dispatch some guys on a stakeout here that day.

231
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,018
Is it because she's Tae Seong's friend?

232
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,519
You personally went to see her family too.

233
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,730
Partially, yes.

234
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,660
But for some reason, I can't stop worrying about her.

235
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,329
It's like I've known her for a long time.

236
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,900
Hey, rookie. Yes.

237
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,339
What?

238
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,579
Okay.

239
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
What is it?

240
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,249
That jerk, Kim Young Soo, must have left Seoul.

241
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,419
We got several calls that people saw him in Busan.

242
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,618
The police in Busan checked the security footage nearby.

243
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,619
They think it's him.

244
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,950
- Busan? - Yes.

245
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,059
Hello. Hey, Sol.

246
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,589
I'm sorry, sir.

247
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,098
But could you come to me right now?

248
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,859
What did you say? Where are you?

249
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,329
You're the only one I can ask for help.

250
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,599
Detective,

251
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,200
please save me.

252
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,230
The phone is turned off. You'll be directed to...

253
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,500
(May 6)

254
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,858
On May 10.

255
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,369
He will probably come.

256
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,000
She still has a few days left.

257
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:20,039
What is she thinking? Why did she lie to me?

258
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,480
Did the future change?

259
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,579
(In Hyuk)

260
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,249
- Hey. - Hey, I don't think...

261
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,450
Sol got on the train.

262
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,720
What? My father called me.

263
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,420
He said he saw her when he was out on his boat.

264
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,690
He asked if she hadn't gone back to Seoul with us.

265
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,089
Why didn't you go?

266
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,900
Why not?

267
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,230
You should've gone to the US.

268
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,328
Why didn't you leave Korea? You can't be here!

269
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,169
Just act like you don't know me.

270
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,210
Whatever I do, whatever happens to me...

271
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,640
Please just leave me alone.

272
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,880
She lied to me, so she could stay behind there alone.

273
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,329
This is really beautiful.

274
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,299
Thank you.

275
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,240
I should thank you...

276
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,970
for coming into this world.

277
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,380
For making the long journey of time to come to me.

278
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:37,410
With that, I got a chance to ask you to be with me.

279
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,180
For that, I'm grateful.

280
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,839
I'm sorry, Sun Jae.

281
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,470
But you can't be here.

282
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,129
You know that, right?

283
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,899
- Gosh. I've done that. This pose... - Seriously.

284
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,169

(Ramyeon, Parboiled Octopus, Samgyeopsal, Gimbap, Samwon Food)

289
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,239
- I'm sorry. - No. It's all right.

290
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,039
It'll be 5am in the morning.

291
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,589
A wall with a dolphin painting.

292
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,579
Red bricks.

(Ramyeon, Gimbap, Samwon Food)

295
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,029
- Are you alone? - Yes.

296
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,529
I'll have whatever you serve me.

297
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,930
Sure.

298
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,950
(Missed calls, Sun Jae: 22, Mom: 3)

299
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,589
Sol, where on earth are you right now?

300
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,059
I met your mother.

301
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,089
Please answer your phone.

302
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:40,700
Sun Jae, just wait a little.

303
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,930
It'll be over soon.

304
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,940
(Ramyeon, Parboiled Octopus, Samgyeopsal, Gimbap, Samwon Food)

305
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,160
When will Detective Kim come?

306
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,960
He should be here before 5am.

307
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,269
Hello? Detective Kim?

308
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,869
I'm here now.

309
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,069
I'm right behind you.

310
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,410
We'll watch from here.

311
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,279
- Thanks for coming. - Yes.

312
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,519
Do you really think Kim Young Soo will come here today?

313
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,589
We should search Busan instead.

314
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,059
When his face was aired all over the country because he was wanted,

315
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,298
he was caught on the security camera...

316
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,799
because he showed up in the crowded Seoul Station and Busan Station.

317
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,098
Are you saying...

318
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,499
he did it deliberately for the cops to search the wrong places?

319
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Why would he do that?

320
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,940
We'll see.

321
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,210
Where did he see Sol?

322
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,880
I don't know. I think it was near the seawall.

323
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,819
Gosh.

324
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,518
I'll pay now.

325
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,650

Darn it.

345
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,720
Right. I'm out here, responding to a call.

346
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,750
Is everything all right?

347
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,619
- "A call?" - Yes.

348
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,119
Sol, are you all right?

349
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,319

- Gosh. - Darn it!

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,430
Sorry.

His name is Kim Young Soo.

354
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:55,149
He has a tall and robust build, standing at just over 180cm tall,

355
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,150
with long, mono-lidded eyes as a distinctive feature.

356
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,319
- Kim Young Soo? - Darn it.

357
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,119
Darn it.

358
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:10,390
We got a call, saying a woman in pink cloth...

359
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,259
is in danger that she needs protection.

360
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,160
It wasn't to report the wanted criminal?

361
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,869
No. The person who called sounded like he knew her.

362
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,069
It can't be...

363
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,640
Sun Jae. No!

Yes?

384
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,529
Close your eyes.

385
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,130
It's dark when your eyes are closed.

386
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,569
- Are you up? - No, I'm not.

387

What are you talking about?

389
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,680
You didn't want tomorrow to come.

390
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,109
Tomorrow won't come...

391
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,049
until we open our eyes.

392
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,289

You're eating so well.

408
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,719
It's so tasty.

409
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,089

- it was like the coffee you made. - What?

447
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,058
- That it wasn't good? - You're right.

448
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:20,719
- That it was bland. - What?

449
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,559
She said it was neither a thriller nor a romance.

450
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:27,698
Also, the scale of the movie was too small to be a commercial film.

451

That's why I want you to go there and persuade him.

The director is so pissed that he wants to replace him.

But we have to cancel the production...

475
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,099
because there'll be no investment without Troublemaker Do Jun.

00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,210
We can let that happen, can we?

477
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,279
What is his company doing...

478
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,110
that I have to persuade him all the time?

479
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,480
His company...

480
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,380
respects his opinion very much.

481
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,719
He's a nephew of the company CEO.

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,289
I came because I missed you.

00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,530
Gosh. I can smell alcohol.

491
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,500

494
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,369
Do you like whiskey?

495
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,480
You can't drink alcohol while filming.

496
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,309
Was your name Hol like alcohol?

497
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,079

498
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:01,480

499
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,949
It's Sol, not Hol.

500
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,760
I heard you didn't want to shoot the kissing scenes.

501
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,460
Why not?

502
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,530
I'm not going to act until the kissing scenes are out.

503
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,070
I can't do them.

504
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,630
Do Jun.

505
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,099
What is the title of our movie?

506
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,039
It's "I Want a Kiss."

507
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:29,210
How can we get rid of the kiss?

508
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,349
It's "I Want a Kiss,"

509
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,849
not "I Kissed."

510
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,550
That's what I'm saying.

511
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,320
We can't make a romantic movie without any kisses.

512
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,159
It's like a cream bun without cream.

513
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,819
How ridiculous is that?

514
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,360
Does a hot dog bun have a dog in it?

515
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,960
Does finger food have a finger in it?

516
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:47,400
Finger food doesn't mean...

517
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,499
You know how important the kiss is for the main characters' emotions...

518
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,968
because you read it too.

519
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,868
I saw the storyboard, and it was crazy.

520
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,439
I think it'll be the kissing scene...

521
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,840
that will go down the history of Korean cinema.

522
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,679
And you don't want to do it?

523
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,920
You're going to do it, right?

524
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,389
Come on. I know you will.

525
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,488
I'll give you some time to sober up. Brush your teeth first and...

526
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,629
I won't do it.

527
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,260
Why not? What's the reason?

528
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,760
Tell me the reason, at least.

529
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,429
It's a secret, though.

530
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,670
Okay.

531
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,469
I'm only telling you.

532
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,280
My girlfriend told me not to do it.

533
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,150
She often gets jealous.

534
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,150
What kind of nonsense is this?

535
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,158
If she tells you to die, are you going to die?

536
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,389
I'll pretend, at least.

537
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,058
I'm a good actor, you know.

538
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,698
You should act in the studio,

539

Anyway,

541
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,130
I'm not going to shoot anything until the kissing scenes are gone.

542
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,269
Got it?

543
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:01,739
I'll get going.

544
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,239
Wait. Hold on.

546
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,609
You can't act carelessly like this when the shooting is still on.

547
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,349
- I don't care. I can't hear you. - Do Jun.

548
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,419
The director wants to replace you. If you keep going like this...

549
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,550
I know your company...

550
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,820
obtained investment based on my appearance in the movie.

551
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,960
Do Jun, please hear me out.

552
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,539
He is horribly rude.

553
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,139
You're drunk. Are you out of your mind?

554
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,380
Get out of the car.

555
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,150
Troublemaker Do Jun, you crazy punk.

556
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,599
Darn it.

557
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,238
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

558
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,309
- What's wrong with her? - Oh, my.

559
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,579
You're the one who is crazy.

560
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,710
Get out, you punk.

561
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,519
People put you on a pedestal, and you're getting out of hand now.

562
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,319
How dare you get behind the wheel when you're drunk...

563
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,419
with your girlfriend in the car!

564
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,859
This is an attempted murder.

565
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,860
If you want to die, you should die alone.

566
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,389
Don't kill innocent people!

567
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,670
You're like a gangster.

568
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,339
You...

569
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,369
It's funny.

570
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,939
Can you play it again?

571
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,940
- Be quiet, will you? - What a bummer.

572
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,848
So you're saying she tried to stop the actor...

573
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:53,179
when he was leaving the set. Is that correct?

574
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes.

575
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,090
We can't settle this case before she apologizes.

576
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,659
Apologize?

577
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,889
Why are you so confident and brazen?

578
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:06,159
Let me explain the situation.

579
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,570
You should pick up the phone first.

580
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,440
- Yes, Ms. Lee. - Hey!

581
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,009
I told you to persuade him,

582
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,579
not fight him and be dragged to the police station!

583
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,379
That's not what it is. It's...

584
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,919
Just apologize.

585
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,949
Don't make things worse and just end it. Okay?

586
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,019
Excuse me?

587
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,988
Do Jun was trying to...

588
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:34,289
I heard he was with a woman.

589
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,130
Do you want to reveal that he was dating someone too?

590
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,429
Do you want to get the movie canceled?

591
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,599
Apologize and cover it up quietly.

592
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,429
Ms. Lee!

593
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:46,599
What did she say?

594
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,440
I'm sorry. I apologize.

595
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:55,909
There's no need to apologize to me.

596
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,349
It's the artist who is hurt.

597
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,050
Sorry?

598
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,090
(Letter of Apology)

599
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,819
I guess it's my fate to habitually come to the police station...

600
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,559
and write letters of apology in my 30s.

601
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,730
Hey, pretty girl over there.

602
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,429
Oh, you look familiar.

603
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,500
I guess you frequent here.

604
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,638
Can you be quiet, please?

605
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,368
I can't focus.

606
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:24,669
(It's my fault for causing the car accident. I'm so sorry.)

607
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,579
Do you want some tips for the letter of apology?

608
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:28,079
I'm an expert at that.

609
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,150
Why are you behind the bars? You're a police officer.

610
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,119
The temperature and the humidity behind the bars...

611
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:37,820
are perfect for me.

612
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,320
I strangely feel more comfortable here than in the night-duty room.

613
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,329
I see. I guess that's where you belong.

614
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,360
Just write it quickly and get over with it.

615
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,360
You have a long face.

616
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:49,669
Let me buy you a drink.

617
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,170
What are you talking about? I don't want to drink.

618
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,940
So what's your tip for the letter of apology?

619
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,840
Write it down.

620
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,480
- What should I write? - Write 119.

621
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,980
Ms. Gangster, please try this.

622
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,279
Hey. I'm not a criminal.

623
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,819
Why do you want me to eat tofu and turn over a new leaf?

624
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,119
You should turn over a new leaf.

625
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,888
Come to think of it, you've always been fearless...

626
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,190
and meddled with other people's business.

627
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:15,988
I knew it when you took the cigarettes away...

628
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,389
from the bullies and taught them a lesson.

629
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,130
Mind your business.

630
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,769
So why were you brought to the police station?

631
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,570
He was driving under the influence?

632
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,469
You should've said it earlier.

633
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:32,169
If we had used a breathalyzer, it would've been proved.

634
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,010
I was going to,

635
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,980
but my boss told me to apologize and cover it up.

636
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,419
I didn't join the film company...

637
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,289
to do something like this.

638
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:46,489
Gosh, it's bitter.

639
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,929
Do you want me to go through the dash cam and security cameras?

640
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,089
Do you want me to find the footage of him drinking,

641
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,959
getting behind the wheels while being drunk with a woman...

642
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
and arrest him?

643
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,500
I'll be fired then.

644
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:58,429
But I appreciate your gesture.

645
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,900
Give it to me.

646
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:02,809
I'm not just saying this. I mean it.

647
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:07,179
It's okay.

648
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,909
So...

649
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:14,380
I heard the girl who was in the passenger seat was a model.

650
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:15,718
Yes. Why are you asking?

651
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:16,719
Is she pretty?

652
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:17,889
She's pretty, isn't she?

653
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,619
Gosh. Why didn't she meet a guy like me...

654
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:22,059
and date a guy like Do Jun?

655
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,860
Should I have asked In Hyuk to introduce me to her?

656
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,400
What if he introduces you? Do you think she'll date you?

657
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,139
My goodness.

658
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:35,570
You think you're still a good-looking online star.

659
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:37,969
I still got it. Don't you think so?

660
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,710
Your eye smile doesn't work now.

661
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,610
It's a bummer.

662
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,489
Sun Jae used to endorse it.

663
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,590
Drink slowly. You'll get drunk and pass out again.

664
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,658
If you pass out today again, I'm going to leave you here.

665
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:03,099
Hey, I won't get drunk on this amount of alcohol.

666
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,369
I won't get drunk on a day like this even if I want to.

667
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,170
Why are you doing this to me, world?

668
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,078
What did I do wrong?

669
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,579
Let go of me.

670
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,980
Please be quiet. Okay?

671
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,079
Park Do Jun, you jerk.

672
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:22,848
You're dead meat!

673
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,190
Yes. He's dead meat.

674
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,489
Why did I tell her to drink with me?

675
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,360
I can't even catch a cab.

676
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,429
What an unlucky day.

677
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,969
Your scarf has come undone.

678
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Are you sleeping?

679
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,309
Yes. Just sleep.

680
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,039
Sleep.

681
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,619
Gosh.

682
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,869
What?

683
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,670
It's snowing.

684
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,309
Will I be able to catch a cab?

685
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,289
Sol.

686
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:05,989
I like you...

687
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:09,559
a lot.

688
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:13,699
Stop running away from me.

689
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:15,329
Just pursue your feelings for me.

690
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,269
If I end up dying to save you, I'll be fine with that.

691
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,039
That doesn't matter.

692
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:27,739
You said you missed me.

693
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
Then tell me.

694
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,510
How about now?

695
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,099
I like you.

696
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,030
I like you, Sun Jae.

697
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,409
I love you.

698
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,269
I love you, Sol.

699
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,619
I can't catch a cab.

700
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:11,489
Okay. Let's go.

701
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,429
Are you crying?

702
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,440
Stop crying.

703
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,980
Will you?

704
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:45,889
Sun Jae.

705
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,690
Sorry?

706
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,429
I miss you, Sun Jae.

707
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,949
(Bon Cinema)

708
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:22,618
Did you go to work safely?

709
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,630
(Did you go to work safely?)

710
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:26,460
I don't remember how I got home.

711
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,329
I heard you carried me home yesterday. Thank you.

712
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,429
If you're thankful, you should treat me to hangover soup at least.

713
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,070
Why don't we have lunch together?

714
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:35,869
Police officers must have a lot of time.

715
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:37,239
I'll treat you next time.

716
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,840
I should clean up the mess I made.

717
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,909
Gosh.

718
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,050
My stomach hurts.

719
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:07,969
Park Do Jun...

720
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:09,639
I will remove him from the movie.

721
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,808
If the movie is canceled because of the canceled investment...

722
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:15,408
It's because of his private life,

723
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:18,210
so I will file a damages lawsuit against him.

724
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,319
I thought we would cover it up and end it yesterday.

725
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,320
I...

726
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,549
didn't know he got behind the wheel...

727
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,489
while being drunk on the set.

728
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:31,460
Why didn't you tell me the most important thing?

729
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,900
Even before I said it, you told me to cover it up.

730
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,130
I did?

731
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
Yes.

732
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,369
Anyway,

733
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,309
I'll take care of this, so leave it at that.

734
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:49,179
I should've taken care of my employee.

735
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,050
I made you write the letter of apology for no reason.

736
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:56,789
Sorry.

737
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:59,488
What did you say?

738
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:00,489
I said sorry.

739
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,489
No, it's fine. Thank you.

740
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,159
Oh, right. The project proposal you submitted last time.

741
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,469
Revise it and bring it tomorrow.

742
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,539
- Didn't you say it wasn't good? - When did I say that?

743
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,509
Hey, I went back to it...

744
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,738
and thought if we could make a good youthful romance movie,

745
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:20,840
it would work.

746
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,379
Then...

747
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,820
Let's make a movie based on your scenario.

748
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,578
Really?

749
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,349
Thank you, Ms. Lee!

750
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,590
You know I hold your abilities in high regard, right?

751
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,158
Be nice to me, you rascal.

752
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:40,900
Of course, I should be nice to you.

753
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,098
What's that? The budget proposal?

754
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,130
Yes.

755
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,239
What's this?

756
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,010
I guess you heard that I would accept the proposal beforehand.

757
00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:00,150
It seems you wrote a letter because you were thankful.

758
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,590
I'll read it before I go to bed.

759
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,730
What are you doing? Hurry up and revise the proposal.

760
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,729
Oh, yes. I'll work hard.

761
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,760
Thank you.

762
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:22,069
Oh, my gosh! Congratulations!

763
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,768
I can't believe a day like this would come to me, Hyun Ju.

764
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,078
I didn't know Ms. Lee thought so highly of me.

765
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,980
So I badmouthed her a lot while drinking yesterday.

766
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
What's the matter?

767
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,550
The red envelope.

768
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,750
What? Cover it up?

769
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,420
Cover what up?

770
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,460
Yes. I'll quit this darn company.

771
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,929
I joined the company because I wanted to make movies,

772
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:55,269
not to be treated like this.

773
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,250
I'm sensible, savvy, and on top of everything.

774
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,018
That's what you said about me...

775
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:11,849
last time.

776
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,519
If I'm an employee like that,

777
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,489
how can you do that to me?

778
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:20,929
I lost all the respect I had for you.

779
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,629
I'm writing a letter of resignation for the first time.

780
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,038
I'm going to quit this company.

781
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:30,368
- Don't stop me. - I joined the company...

782
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:32,510
with big dreams of producing movies,

783
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:35,809
but I'm tired of doing nothing but babysitting celebrities...

784
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,750
and catering to their every whim...

785
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,519
instead of actually getting to produce movies.

786
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,920
So I want to quit...

787
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,749
- the company. - I'm going to quit the company.

788
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,619
I'm going to quit the company!

789
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,820
Dear Ms. Lee Kyung Ja.

790
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:51,659
Kyung Ja!

791
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,199
Stop overworking me...

792
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,230
for a pittance!

793
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:01,169
Should I go to the police station and write a letter of apology...

794
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,139
- What is wrong with you? - at this age?

795
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,768
I hope you hire...

796
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:09,579
someone more sensible, savvy, and on top of everything than me.

797
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,510
If you don't want me to quit,

798
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,079
you will have to persuade me,

799
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,059
Im Sol, who is more difficult to convince than Park Do Jun.

800
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,619
Kyung Ja.

801
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,530
I wasn't happy working for you.

802
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,699
Let's never meet again.

803
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:29,130
I'll get lost. Good luck.

804
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,328
Farewell then!

805
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,769
Someone who is capable and knows it all!

806
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:36,869
What do I do?

807
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,969
I'm doomed.

808
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:42,380
Bye. You're out now.

809
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,980
Your proposal is finally accepted, and you cause trouble like this?

810
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,250
Bye.

811
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,949
She said she would read it at night. She must've not read it yet.

812
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:50,019
Hey!

813
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,619
She's already gone.

814
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,590
What? Where did she go?

817
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:16,579
What if I say hi?

818
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:19,380
What should I say when she asks me why I'm here?

819
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,880
How can I take the letter out of her purse?

820
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:33,860
This is good.

Oh, my. Hi.

00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,420
- Cheers. - Cheers.

824
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,980
This is...

825
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:22,409
My gosh.

826
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,250
Oh, my.

827
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,590
What a relief.

828
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,289
I guess she didn't read it yet.

829
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,860
Let me put this back.

Sun Jae!

835
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:40,559
Why did my watch suddenly become a time machine?

836
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:43,590
It gained the power after you died.

837
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,360
How can I say that?

838
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,599
Is it perhaps...

839
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:57,210
Sun Jae.

840
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:58,940
Perhaps,

841
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:01,840
we should have never met in the first place.

842
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:10,949
Yes. We should've never met.

850

decline the movie.

851
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,739
Why does she hate me? She never met me before.

852
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,269
Sol, what's the matter? Did something happen?

853
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,880
Did you see his face?

854
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,409
We met again like this.

Are we meant to be at this point?

856

I'll never do something my fate doesn't allow.

857
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,250
Should I be ready to die...

858
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,260
if I want to be with you?
