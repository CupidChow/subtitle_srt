00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,559
I was crazy.

170
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,500
What on earth did you do, Sol?

171
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,100
How many days have passed here?

172
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,570
(July 29, 2008)

173
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,509
As many as ten days?

174
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,690
Yes. It was an opportunity, not time.

175
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,090
An opportunity to go back to the past.

176
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,129
If I go back to the future this time,

177
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,799
does it mean I have one chance left?

178

Do you feel better now? Does it hurt?

187
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,980
I brought something for you. Take a look.

188
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,019
Right. It's heavy. I'll carry it for you.

189
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,090
These are books and cups for therapy, which will be useful.

190
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,589
I looked into it. Cupping therapy...

191
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,899
does wonders for those who had shoulder surgery.

192
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,699
It's a hassle to go to the clinic every time,

193
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,399
so do this at home.

194
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,340
What are you doing?

195
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,669
- This is... - Why are you suddenly doing this?

196
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,110
You're really angry, right?

197
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,309
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,049
I'll explain everything.

199
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,519
The one who acted as if she didn't know you and called you a pervert.

200
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,960
- It wasn't me. - What?

201
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,758
She's just a foolish 19-year-old.

202
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,158
She did that because she didn't know you.

203
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,459
Who are you then?

204
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,860
I'm Sol from 2023, the future.

205
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,269
Look. This is the time machine.

206
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,628
Your watch took my soul to the past.

207
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,769
So that I can save you.

208
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,610
You've gone completely crazy.

209
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,740
Do you think he'll believe that?

210
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,210
I was possessed by a ghost.

211
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,378
It's the darn ghost again?

212
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,950
I'm telling the truth, Sun Jae.

213
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,820
We even had an exorcism on the rooftop yesterday.

214
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,960
Look at this.

215
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,090
- What the heck? - This is...

216
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,159
This is the talisman that wards off ghosts.

217
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,970
It was so serious that I even got this.

218
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,929
I was possessed by something. I wasn't in my right mind.

219
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,299
I didn't even recognize people I knew.

220
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
I guess ghosts can date too.

221
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,279
What?

222
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,379
It was a virgin ghost, Sun Jae.

223
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,410
Sun Jae!

224
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,670
Are you okay, girlfriend?

225
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,039
Would you like to go out with me?

226
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,338
(A 19-year-old)

227
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,369
I would like to.

228
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,539
You...

229
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,508
You...

230
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,640
Why? Are you injured?

231
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,339
Let's go for now.

232
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:02,849
Don't look.

233
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,319
- Please! - Why?

234
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,328
I can't believe that I became your girlfriend.

235
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,028
My stomach bell is ringing.

236
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,829
Enjoy the lunch.

237
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,039
Cuckoo! Sol's alarm is going off.

238
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,869
It's time to wake up.

239
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,339
What? "Cuckoo?"

240
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,180
It's a mess.

241
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,250
Okay. Pick one.

242
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,150
Number one. My hand can heal everything.

243
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
Number two.

244
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,589
Number three. Close your mouth.

245
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,259
I have hands too. Give it to me.

246
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,700
I said it's okay.

247
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,269
How was number two?

248
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,700
You...

249
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,539
This is how you hit on Sol, right?

250
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,380
Are you back, Granny?

251
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,109
How did you know?

252
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,019
You're so different from yesterday.

253
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Here.

254
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,519
Where did the heart eyes go?

255
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,190
Do you like Sol?

256
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,460
I like Sol.

257
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,069
- You're not serious, are you? - What do you want me to say?

258
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,170
You're in my heart.

259
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,700
Number three.

260
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,339
That line is so old.

261
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,039
Anyway, I'm against your relationship.

262
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,349
You'll never have my permission.

263
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,278
You said you lost all your memory.

264
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,379
You said you were possessed by a ghost.

265
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,680
You were scared to death.

266
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,589
Is it okay for me to do it as I want?

267
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,319
I'll go back soon.

268
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,858
(Gold Videos and DVDs)

269
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,099
(Videos, DVDs)

270
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,829
Can I ask you something?

271
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,970
Do you know where Sol is living?

272
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,109
I have something to give her.

273
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,809
That pot is mine.

274
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,349
My daughter gave you...

275
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,349
a whole pot of samgyetang.

276
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:15,390
It was a long time ago. Why are you returning it only now?

277
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,420
What? She's a daughter of the video rental store?

278
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,690
What is he saying?

279
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,029
I forgot because I've been busy. I'm sorry.

280
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,729
Please. I washed the pot.

281
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,769
Okay.

282
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,369
Bye then.

283
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,299
Hold on.

284
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,740
You only paid 15 dollars for the overdue fee.

285
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,339
What are you talking about?

286
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,979
You returned the videotape...

287
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,649
several days after I told you about the overdue fee.

288
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,119
You owe me three dollars more.

289
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,548
I have no idea what you're talking about.

290
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:50,650
It stings!

291
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,259
Oh, no. That's a wild rose.

292
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,890
Gosh.

293
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,359
Let's finish this at once.

294
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:58,559
Stand by.

295
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,799
Action.

296
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,230
You're a dentist, right?

297
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,339
I heard you had opened the clinic recently.

298
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,769
Please visit my clinic later.

299
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll get your teeth scaled for free.

300
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,578
Cut it for a moment.

301
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,608
- Let's cut it. - Nice. It was very nice.

302
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,980
But try to relax more.

303
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,220
Can you take a sip of the coffee in front of you?

304
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,779
Try to smile a bit brighter too.

305
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,990
Smile. Okay?

306
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,019
Smile? I got it.

307
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,259
- Okay. - Action.

308
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,359
You're a dentist, right?

309
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,000
I heard you had opened the clinic recently.

310
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,670
Please visit my clinic later. I'll get your teeth scaled for free.

311
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,970
I'll get your teeth scaled for free.

312
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,309
- What? - What?

313
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,740
- Was it a dental laminate? - Cut!

314
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,420
How can there be a dentist without his front tooth?

315
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,690
Change the actor! Gosh!

316
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,119
We'll change the actor.

317
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,119
Sir, I can put it back in right away.

318
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,058
- Come on. Get out. - Please give me another chance.

319
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,729
- Get out. - Another chance.

320
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,930
Come on out!

321
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,829
Give my front tooth back!

322
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,499
This is ridiculous.

323
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,239
Why does he ask for a new tooth after losing a decayed one?

324
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,680
For goodness' sake. What should I do?

325
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,680
I haven't been able to go to the bathroom due to stress.

326
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,589
I'm sick of getting constipated.

327
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,589
(Eclipse)

328
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,289
It looks exactly the same.

329
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,589
Are you here for Tae Seong?

330
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,900
No. I came to see you.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,039
Why?

332
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,539
Do you know...

333
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,079
how sorry he felt for you?

334
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,109
What?

335
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,109
You should know it.

336
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,250
What was it that I had to know?

337
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,818
In Hyuk.

338
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,549
What were you going to tell me?

339
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,750
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

340
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,589
In Hyuk.

341
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,329
If you want to tell me something, tell me right away.

342
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,190
Gosh.

343
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,858
I have nothing to tell you.

344
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,699
In the remote future. I mean,

345
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,269
you may want to tell me something around 2023.

346
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,970
At that time, don't hesitate to contact me.

347
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,170
I have something to tell you right now.

348
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,939
Don't come looking for Sun Jae anymore.

349
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,039
Right. Sun Jae too.

350
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,078
When you are auditioning, don't take him with you.

351
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,149
Don't let him step into that world at all.

352
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,450
Why do you care about our business?

353
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,230
In Hyuk, think carefully.

354
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,858
If you take someone who is handsome like Sun Jae with you,

355
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,028
he will pass the audition while you,

356
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,368
who poured your heart into the audition, won't make it.

357
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,470
Do you know why?

358
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,899
Instead of picking up the rock that rolled in,

359
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,740
the producers want to discover hidden gems.

360
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,839
- That makes sense. - I know.

361
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,079
What? Does that mean I'm a rock...

362
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,279
while Sun Jae's a gem?

363
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,720
Anyway,

364
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,920
if you want to protect your dear friend...

365
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,890
and to avoid regretting it,

366
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,690
keep what I said in mind.

367
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,589
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart.

368
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,000
I'll get going.

369
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,769
Hey!

370
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,740
Don't even try to see Sun Jae!

371
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,109
Hey, Sun Jae. It's been a while.

372
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,109
I guess you received an accolade.

373
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,809
I'm jealous.

374
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,079
Should we throw a party to celebrate?

375
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,848
I'm busy.

376
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,950
To study?

377
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,459
That's right. Since you can't swim anymore,

378
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,920
you should find another path quickly.

379
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,130
It's none of your business.

380
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,460
It's all because I feel bad for you.

381
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,970
I told you to be careful.

382
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,170
You should have listened to me carefully.

383
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,269
Why did you push yourself to compete in the tournament...

384
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,470
and wrecking your shoulder like that?

385
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,639
A person should be humble.

386
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,650
When you're arrogant, you get punished for it.

387
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,319
It must hurt.

388
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,759
You should be careful and never let your guard down.

389
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,960
You don't have much strength.

390
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,058
If you put too much stress on one side of your body...

391
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,999
to practice the loping stroke when it's out of your capacity,

392
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,329
you'll wreck your shoulder...

393
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:31,869
like me.

394
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,098
Hey, Sun Jae. You're here.

395
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,308
Hey. In the interview after winning a medal...

396
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:37,508
at the National Sports Festival, you said...

397
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,039
that it was your mom's wish...

398
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,740
for you to become a member of the national team.

399
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,308
Instead of giving me ridiculous advice,

400
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,779
go to your mom's tomb and apologize. Jerk!

401
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,490
Gosh. That jerk.

402
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,348
- Hey. - Hey.

403
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,719
- Hold on. - Hey.

404
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,018
- Hey, Sun Jae. Let it go. - Hey.

405
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,459
- Let go of him. - Sun Jae. Hold it in.

406
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,929
- Sun Jae, stop. - Easy.

407
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,058
- Let go of his throat. - Easy.

408
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,058
- Let go. It's all right. - Let it go.

409
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,129
- Why? - Good.

410
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,028
- Bring it on, prick! - What did you say?

411
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,099
Hey!

412
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,479
How dare you bring up his mother?

413
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,679
There is a line you shouldn't cross.

414
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,049
How dare you call yourself human? I had enough.

415
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,288
You.

416
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,220
I knew it when you stole his swimming suit back then.

417
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,689
I shouldn't have let you slide at that time.

418
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,990
Gosh. My nose is bleeding.

419
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,729
- Do you want to die? - Hey.

420
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,660
Do I have to hit you again for you to come to your senses?

421
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:36,470
If I see you one more time picking a fight with Sun Jae,

422
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,769
I'll make you pay for it.

423
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,169
- For goodness' sake. - Come on.

424
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,200
Move.

425
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,339
What is the fuss about?

426
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,210
Hey, the one with cigarettes!

427
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,538
- You! - Gosh.

428
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,009
Come here.

429
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,039
Gosh. That rat.

430
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:50,049
Come here. Where are you going?

431
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:51,880
- What? - You.

432
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,250
Hey. Stop right there.

433
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,450
I couldn't really speak to him.

434
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,890
Let go of me!

435
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,368
Sol, why did you go out with such a punk...

436
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,200
to face this kind of humiliation?

437
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,299
Hey, pretty.

438
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,140
Can you let it go and talk about it?

439
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:16,869
I warned you, didn't I?

440
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,239
You don't get it because I told you politely.

441
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,709
You didn't say it politely.

442
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,449
You said it viciously.

443
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,949
Are you serious?

444
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,450
- What did she say? - She's unbelievable.

445
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,818
You like Tae Seong very much.

446
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,019
I'll break up with him today. Okay?

447
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:31,618
Can you let go of it now?

448
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,288
Let it go, so we can talk it out.

449
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,259
How can I trust you?

450
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,699
You cried like a baby before, saying you can't break up with him.

451
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,000
It's your last chance.

452
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,130
I'll let this pass if you let it go on the count of three.

453
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,369
Seriously. What are you talking about?

454
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,569
One.

455
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,339
Two.

456
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,539
Three.

457
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
You!

458
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,279
How can you bully a person over a boy?

459
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,379
It hurts!

460
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,950
- Gosh. You! - When you look this pretty!

461
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,289
- Let go! - What are you doing?

462
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,589
- Let go! - Let go!

463
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,219
Let go, I said!

464
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,319
Hey, girls.

465
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,660
Are you fighting right now?

466
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,259
We're just playing around.

467
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:16,499
- It's for fun. - We're just hanging out.

468
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,630
Are you sure?

469
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,170
Be nice to one another. For goodness' sake.

470
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,940
I've seen him before.

471
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:27,309
Mr. Kim?

472
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,048
What is he doing here?

473
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,778
What on earth is she talking about?

474
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,318
- Hey. Where are you going? - Where are you going?

475
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,778
Let go of me. I'll break up with him, all right?

476
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:34,980
Move, you pricks!

477
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,759
Gosh. It hurts so badly.

478
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,599
Here.

479
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,599
Contact me.

480
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,039
Why is she standing there like that?

481
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,519
Sun Jae.

482
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,130
He suffered from various rumours and malicious comments in his life.

483
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,500
Hi.

(Gold Videos and DVDs)

485
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,608
Gosh. She looks just like her mother.

486
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,640
Hi. What brought you here?

487
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,078
Is Sun Jae home?

488
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,879
How unfortunate!

489
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,779
He just left for the rehab after he got changed.

490
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,579
Where is the rehab?

491
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,119
Hold on.

492
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,160

(Ryu Sun Jae)

494
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,690
I have something to give him.

495
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,129
Can I come inside for a second?

496
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,960
You don't have to because he isn't even here.

497
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,069
Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

498
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,439
Since I'm here, I'll leave it in his room myself.

499
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,369
You can't go into a guy's room like that.

500
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,779
If you want to give it to him yourself, wait until you meet him.

501
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,849
My stomach.

502
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:11,979
Can I use the restroom?

503
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,548
Rush home and use yours.

504
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:14,849
It's right there.

505
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,048
Gosh. Wait. Now that you mention the restroom,

506
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,419
I want to go too. Gosh, my stomach.

507
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,419
It hurts!

508
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,690
It's coming out. My stomach.

509
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,630
Gosh, it hurts.

510
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,349
Now, I'm even breaking and entering.

511
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,490
His room must be upstairs.

512
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,569
What should I do?

I can smell something fishy.

522
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,779
I asked you to come to give you this.

523
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,980
It's given only to the swimmers who broke the tournament record.

524
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,519
It has finally come after a production delay or something.

525

What a liar.

529
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:29,348
Gosh. Because we wash our clothes after wearing them once in summer,

530
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,079
there is so much laundry. Gosh.

531
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,419
- Did the treatment go well? - Yes.

532
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,250
Hey. Why are you sweating so much?

I ran around the neighbourhood.

Why did he run when it's even too hot to breathe?

Did the heat get me? I start to see things now.

00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,629
Really? Are you still going out with her?

553
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,768
But you said that it was weird...

554
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,500
she changed suddenly after you went out.

555
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,710
That was the case up until yesterday.

556
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,710
- But she's become cute again. - What?

557
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,579
I thought you went out with whoever just to get rid of Ga Hyun.

558
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,750
- I don't know. - He's the worst.

559
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,949
I'm sorry.

560
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,420
I'll get out of here right now.

561
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,460
How are you going to do that when my dad is downstairs?

562
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,329
I'll go through the window.

563
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,598
If I jump with a rope tied around my waist...

564
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,699
Don't come near me.

565
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,170
Sit right there.

566
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:53,840
Don't even try to get near me.

567
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:00,138
Dad leaves for a workout...

568
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,809
after the news. You should leave then.

569
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:04,980
Okay.

570
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,889
Why don't you give me an explanation?

571
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,719
Actually...

572
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,460
- I came to give you... - The books.

573
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,789
Why were you sleeping comfortably, then?

574
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,800
It wasn't my plan to fall asleep.

575
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,079
Do you want me to believe that?

576
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,980
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.

577
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,678
Again, I know it's hard to believe,

578
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,489
but I'm a person with extremely moral and normal thoughts.

579
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,389
But I did stupid things in front of you...

580
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,389
even though it wasn't my intention.

581
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,559
Exactly.

582
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,829
Why do you do that in front of me?

583
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,860
Will you forget...

584
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,329
all the stupid things I did?

585
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,400
I like you.

586
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,440
I have feelings for you.

587
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,539
You want to forget about what happened in the pool?

588
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,709
Is it that easy for you?

589
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,139
What happened in the pool?

590
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,279
Come on. That was nothing.

591
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm not drunk at all.

592
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,449
Have you been angry at me since then?

593
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,719
It might have been nothing to you,

594
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,730
but I don't feel the same way.

595
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm sorry, Sun Jae.

596
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,030
Forget it.

597
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,969
Was I in a drunken frenzy that day?

598
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,639
Did I act like an animal?

599
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,019
In fact, I don't remember anything because I blacked out.

600
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,079
What?

601
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,690
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,619
I get easily drunk when I drink homemade wine.

603
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:56,760
Are you telling me...

604
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,030
you don't remember a thing because you were drunk?

605
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,300
Sure.

606
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,339
Maybe it's for the better.

607
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,309
I'm glad to hear that!

608
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:14,408
When you drink homemade wine, you feel all right...

609
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:16,079
until the alcohol kicks in all of...

610
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,510
a sudden.

611
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,480
Be quiet until you leave.

612
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,190
I made a fuss in front of her when she doesn't remember a thing.

613

(Never Lose Hope in Life, How to Protect My Depressed Self)

614
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,130
Try reading these books...

615
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,070
when you can't fall asleep.

616
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,909
Why?

617
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:20,210
Do you think my life will become hard?

618
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,110
Everyone faces such a moment at least once in his or her life.

619
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,349
The moment...

620
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,388
when you feel like the whole world turns its back on you.

621
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:32,488
Do you think you can make me walk again?

622
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,960
That's what I want!

623
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:37,659
Thank you...

624
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,130
for staying alive.

625
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,829
But someone once told me...

626
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:50,110
to live my life because it was a great day.

627
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,239
To live another day while waiting for the rain to stop on a rainy day.

628
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,280
If you keep this up,

629
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,480
there might come a day when life doesn't seem so miserable.

630
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,449
So, Sun Jae,

631
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:08,619
when you feel like dying,

632
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,659
try to survive for just another day.

633
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,869
That way, I can go back and try to save you.

634
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,139
I want us to get along like before.

635
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:30,710
If you don't want that, could you at least not push me away...

636
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,179
for a few months?

637
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,190
She's so clueless.

638
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,030
I told you not to get close.

639
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,340
Well,

640
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,769
I didn't want the mosquito to bite you.

641
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,050
You give me no choice.

642
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,440
What is it? Do you want to dust off your blanket?

643
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,329
You want us to get along?

644
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,099
How do you want us to get along?

645
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:30,230
- Well, I... - I don't befriend girls.

646
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,170
Guys and girls can't be friends.

647
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,170
I didn't ask you to comfort me.

648
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:38,469
Have I ever asked you to look out for me?

649
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:40,980
I'll be honest. With the way you treat me,

650
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,009
it's embarrassing and awkward because I feel like...

651
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,409
you can see my despair and pain.

652
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,419
I'd rather have you pretend not to know me like before.

653
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,449
Why this again all of a sudden?

654
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,690
What do you expect me to do?

655
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:54,219
That silly attempt at comforting you is the only thing I can do.

656
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,018
Buying those books...

657
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,230
which would mean nothing to you now is the only thing I can do.

658
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,500
I've got my legs back.

659
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,529
But it feels as if I've gone mute and my hands are tied.

660
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,969
It's so frustrating to the point that I feel like I'm suffocating.

661
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:11,670
You're right.

662
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,440
You can't give me what I really want.

663
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,449
So...

664
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,550
don't try...

665
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,389
to get along with me when you're feeling frustrated.

666
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,820
Leave me alone now.

667
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,400
Here. Take them.

668
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:46,380
Take them and go!

669
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:04,289
Darn it.

00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,880
I didn't ask you to comfort me.

Have I ever asked you to look out for me?

673
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,849
I'll be honest. With the way you treat me,

don't try to get along with me.

Hey, how busy is your uncle?

Then there's the mature side of me.

00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,300
Is that so?

dating you.

721
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:11,439
She's a high school senior. She should be studying, not dating.

722
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,279
So you get why I'm worried about her. Yes?

723
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,449
I see. The innocent side of you are completely in love with me.

724
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:18,408
But the mature side of you think you should be studying.

00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,489
let's end this now.

732
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,659
You said you wanted to see me because it was my birthday.

733
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,260
That was sudden.

734
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:37,769
What? Your birthday?

735
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,538
(Age 19)

736
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:42,169
- No. - What do you mean?

737
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,909
No.

738
00:51:46,909 --> 00:51:47,909
Okay.

739
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:49,210
Don't do it.

740
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,449
Darn it. Don't do it.

741
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,250
Excuse me. Stop.

742
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,448
One of our customers prepared a surprise event.

743
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:58,190
I hope you'll understand.

744
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:02,759
Let's get out of here. Okay?

745
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,189
There's a surprise event. Let's go after that.

746
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,530
I'll buy you something tasty. Come on. Let's go.

747
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:15,969
(Happy Birthday, Tae Seong! By Tae Seong's Wifey Sol)

748
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,439
- I'd say no to Hyun Bin - Don't watch it.

749
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,509
- I'd say no to Gong Yoo - Don't watch it.

750
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,638
I would turn down even Dong Won, Oh, no

751
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,209
I'd say no to So Ji Sub

752
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,880
I'd say no to Zo In Sung

753
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,078
I'd say yes to my prince, Tae Seong

754
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,518
- Is that you? - Precious Tae Seong

755
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,519
- Gosh. You're something else. - From Jagam High School

756
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,389
I'm the perfect match for the cool guy, Tae Seong

757
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,058
I like Tae Seong

758
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:44,329
I like everything about him

759
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:47,839
I like Tae Seong

760
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,639
He's my favourite person in the world

761
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,539
I don't even want to think about a world without Tae Seong

762
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,138
Tae Seong is my favourite person

763
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,510
You're the best, Tae Seong

764
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,078
Happy birthday, Tae Seong!

765
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,980
(Happy B-day, Tae Seong!)

766
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,190
You're a high school senior. What were you thinking, you fool?

767
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:11,760
Please blow out the candle.

768
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,169
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

769
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,469
(Can More, Fresh Fruit Café)

770
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:24,769
Tell me the truth.

771
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,639
You tried to break up with me,

772
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,980
so you could throw a surprise, right?

773
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,210
Right. It sure must look like that.

774
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,650
I didn't know you had this much affection for me.

775
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,920
Right. I had no idea either.

776
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,289
What? Are you embarrassed now that you went through with it?

777
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,820
Do you want to go and eat?

778
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:45,230
Did you even have some seaweed soup?

779
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,329
The seaweed soup?

780
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,429
I wonder if my dad even knows it's my birthday today.

781
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,269
Are you serious?

782
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,809
Don't you feel bad for me? You do, right?

783
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,880
- I'd like some pollack soup here. - Sure.

784
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,119
Why aren't you eating? Why are you just staring at it?

785
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,389
You're the first girlfriend,

786
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:12,989
treating me to seaweed soup at a diner...

787
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,658
on my birthday.

788
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:16,829
Not a lot of restaurants sell seaweed soup.

789
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,058
Eat up and get a year older.

790
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:20,230
So you can grow up.

791
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,639
Is it good?

792
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,908
Don't girlfriends put a side dish on their boyfriends' spoons...

793
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:34,980
at times like this?

794
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:37,610
Why are you staring at me like that?

795
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,519
Did you just fall for me again?

796
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,719
I wonder why...

797
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,888
the old me liked...

798
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:48,090
an immature attention-seeker like you.

799
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,889
You make it sound like you don't like me anymore.

800
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:54,428
Anyway, when the innocent and the naive side of Sol comes back,

801
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,729
you have to be nice to her.

802
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,300
Don't hurt her. Okay?

803
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,968
Don't do anything delinquent. Be a good student.

804
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:00,268
Go on dates at the appropriate places...

805
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:01,369
like libraries or bookstores.

806
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,339
- What else? - Never let her ride...

807
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,669
your motorcycle because it's dangerous.

808
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,969
Send her home before the sun goes down.

809
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,179
- What else? - As for physical intimacy...

810
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:09,309
Which base?

811
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,610
What base?

812
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,880
You guys are still so young.

813
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,250
Never. Don't you dare.

814
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:20,460
She's me, and I'm her.

815
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,820
Gosh. What am I talking about?

816
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:25,059
They said they wanted to change their agency. They actually did it.

817
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,599
- Did your marine boy quit swimming? - What?

818
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,070
Look.

819
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,469
Isn't this him? Ryu Sun Jae?

820
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,169
They didn't have any talent to be celebrities.

821
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,710
Baek In Hyuk must be going to an audition. That's funny.

822
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,039
Where are they?

823
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,279
- Did you audition? - What are you doing here?

824
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,289
Why did you bring Sun Jae here?

825
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,419
I told you, didn't I?

826
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,690
- He shouldn't even... - What are you talking about?

827
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,359
Sun Jae got a call from his dad and left.

828
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,489
What? He left?

829
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,699
That's a relief.

830
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,599
Why do you keep butting in Sun Jae's business?

831
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,499
You're dating Kim Tae Seong.

832
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,939
Are you toying with Sun Jae?

833
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,039
What?

834
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:10,210
That's just nonsense.

835
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,670
Hey, are you okay?

836
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:18,349
Let me bring some side dishes.

837
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,118
Over here. I want some water.

838
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:21,219
Sun Jae. Water to Table Ten.

839
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,550
Okay. Water to Table Ten.

840
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,959
- Hello? - Are you still at the restaurant?

841
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,058
Yes. I'm busy.

842
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,789
Did you tell Im Sol about the audition?

843
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:32,329
- Have you been talking to her? - What?

844
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,000
She came here to see you.

845
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:35,658
She ran as if someone was after her.

846
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,428
Then she rolled down the stairs. It was crazy.

847
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:38,429
I wanted to check if she was hurt.

848
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,300
But she must've been embarrassed. She left in the blink of an eye.

849
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:43,099
I want some water.

850
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,110
Okay. I'll bring it right up. Sorry.

851
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,309
I'm busy. And...

852
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,980
don't talk to me about her. Bye.

853
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,309
Hey.

854
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,349
Let me change the grills.

855
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,320
She came here to see you.

856
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,050
Then she rolled down the stairs. It was crazy.

857
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:01,289
I wanted to check if she was hurt.

858
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:03,190
But she must've been embarrassed. She left in the blink of an eye.

859
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:05,159

00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,439
Sir! Which stop are we approaching?

865
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,070
We're reaching the end of the line.

866
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,808
You must have missed all the stops.

867
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:54,980
Really?

868
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,050

00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,130
I should go back.

Hello.

Why are you running away from me?

880
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,399
- Gosh. You're making me angry. - Why are you following me?

881

Hey, kid! Hold on.

882

I'm not a bad guy.

884

Call the cops?

Why would you do that? I just want to talk.

887
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:37,479
- Let go of me. - Seriously.

You should have let me die! Why did you save me?

911
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,469
was it you?

912
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,109
Are you hurt? Or are you just shocked?

913
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,239
Let's go to the hospital now.

914
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,829
Who should try after In Hyuk?

915
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,929
Why don't you give it a try, Sun Jae?

916
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,230
Oh, sure.

917
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,169
Hello?

918
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,340
What's this?

919
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,710
Hello. My name is...

920
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,309
Ryu Sun Jae.

921
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,980
So what?

922
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:36,550
Do you know who I am?

923
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:37,889
I don't.

924
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,260
Sol...

925
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,110
(Lovely Runner)

926
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,650
It's this moment.

927
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,789
- The moment I shouldn't miss. - Hey!

928
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,320
You be my lifesaver.

929
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:13,689
I'll be the magpie, returning the kindness.

930
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,860
You mean a swallow?

931
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,959
I hear he's dating Im Sol when he doesn't like her or anything.

932
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,130
He's dating any random girl.

933
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,459
Not even a hello?

934
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,899
We're not exactly friends, are we?

935
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,328
Gosh. He seemed really nice.

936
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:24,869
You're a horrible judge of character.

937
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,399
Attention.

938
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,569
Why that day of all days?

939
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,968
That way, I can change your fate.

940
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:31,170
So I don't have any regrets.

941
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,039
I'm telling you I'm fine.

942
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,908
- Yes. I can change it. - Shush.

943
01:04:34,909 --> 01:04:36,710
That's the reason why I came here.

944
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,210
And perhaps, the reason why you and I met again.
