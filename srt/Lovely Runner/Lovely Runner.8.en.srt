00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,509
(Byeon Woo Seok)

00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,278
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,279
(10 missed calls from CEO)

00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,890
(Kim Hye Yoon)

00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,859
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,629
(June of 2022)

7
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,759
May I search for something for a moment?

8
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,990
Well, go ahead.

9
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:57,759
Thank you.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,670
What? Isn't it Ryu Sun Jae?

11
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,569
Why is he shoveling here?

12
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,909
What's that?

13
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,709
Is it an egg or a gourd?

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,708
(Han River)

15
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,079
(6 months later on January 1, 2023)

16
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,049
(Episode 8)

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,450
You've come.

18
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,549
You're here.

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,989
It's been a while.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,760
It's been a while.

21
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,599
I'm freezing to death.

22
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,969
It's way past 12am.

23
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,209
Why is she not coming?

24
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,980
Yes. Why?

25
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,449
Sun Jae, what are you doing, brooding the egg?

26
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,450
What?

27
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,819
How do you know?

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,559
A reporter from TBS called me...

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,829
and said he had spotted you standing by Han River with an egg.

30
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,530
The reporter asked what you were filming.

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,229
Dong Seok.

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,469
I'm supposed to meet someone.

33
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,569
If she doesn't show up even after an hour,

34
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,069
does it mean she stood me up?

35
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,069
An hour?

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,840
It seems she forgot about it.

37
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,379
When did you agree to meet?

38
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,449
- Fifteen years ago. - It's a pity.

39
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,378
If she suggested meeting up 15 years later,

40
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,919
it means she never wants to see you again.

41
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,680
Why do you act like you're innocent?

42
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,448
- That's what it means? - If you don't want to...

43
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,089
hold a fan meet there, go home quickly.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,189
Your photo might be taken.

45
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,128
It's posted already.

46
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:36,189
Where did you get the egg?

47
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,259
Hey, I'm hanging up.

48
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,620
Time that passes again.

49
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,319
This is my gift.

50
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,919
Will this gift...

51
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,259
reach you in the future?

52
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,030
I'm desperately praying that it will,

53
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,400
writing this letter.

54
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,370
If you're reading this,

55
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,870
I want to say this.

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,280
Sun Jae, thank you...

57
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,439
for living.

58
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,830
"Time that passes again."

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
What?

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,379
They didn't say it was going to snow.

61
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,960
This is the first snow of the season.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,319
Sun Jae must be thrilled.

63
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,259
What's going on?

64
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,230
Oh, no.

65
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,779
Oh, no.

66
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,449
The same thing happened that day.

67
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,379
No way. It's impossible.

68
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:40,920
It can't be.

69
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,220
(Im Sol)

70
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,490
(Bon Cinema)

71
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Dong Seok.

72
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,259
Yes.

73
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,430
Is the name of that movie production company employee...

74
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,339
Im Sol?

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,639
Yes.

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,639
Do you really know her?

77
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,209
She said you would remember when you hear her name.

78
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,550
Sun Jae!

79
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,369
Don't forget that. The Hangang Bridge.

80
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,838
Even if we don't end up staying in touch,

81
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,949
please come to see me that day.

82
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,250
It's Sun Jae.

83
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,189
Sun Jae, come here!

84
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,769
(Im Sol)

85
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,779
Why do you suddenly want to go to the Hangang Bridge?

86
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,149
He would've passed by already.

87
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,959
Did he just go?

88
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,259
It's a relief then.

89
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,500
Hello?

90
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,740
Hello?

91
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,879
This is me.

92
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,549
It's been a while.

93
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,529
Yes. It's been a while.

94
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,399
Yes.

95
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,870
Why are you standing here like this?

96
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,610
Is your car broken?

97
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
No.

98
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,509
I was waiting for you.

99
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,120
How did you know I would come here?

100
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,820
I thought you would come.

101
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,519
What if I didn't see you?

102
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,190
You haven't changed.

103
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,470
Shall we go somewhere and have a cup of tea?

104
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,700
Is it too late?

105
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,768
No. It's fine.

106
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,909
Sun Jae.

107
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,879
I'm very sorry to interrupt you,

108
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,249
but everyone is calling me...

109
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,009
to ask why you aren't coming to the after-party.

110
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,049
You're the last person he met...

111
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,749
before he died last night.

112
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,659
- You should hurry up and go. - I can't let him go like this.

113
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,990
Just a second.

114
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:48,629
No, don't go.

115
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,360
You can't go.

116
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,429
What?

117
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:58,768
So what I want to say is...

118
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,039
Sun Jae.

119
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,840
Let's stay together tonight.

120
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,409
Let's spend the night together.

121
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,980
What do you mean?

122
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,649
You heard what I said. Why?

123
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,320
You...

124
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,860
and me, the two of us?

125
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,759
Yes.

126
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,100
Don't go. Stay with me.

127
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,740
Yes. Let's stay together.

128
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,678
Sun Jae, someone might see you if you stay here like this.

129
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,179
Tell them I can't go.

130
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,679
What?

131
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,649
Sun Jae, where are you going?

132
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,350
My gosh.

133
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,059
- Are you not getting in? - What?

134
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,230
Yes, I'm coming.

135
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,299
Sun...

136
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,539
Oh, my.

137
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,159
How have you been?

138
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,460
How do I look?

139
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,299
You look like you've been doing well.

140
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,460
Then I guess I've been doing well.

141
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,570
Are you going through any tough times these days?

142
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:37,940
Not really.

143
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,370
You mean it, right?

144
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,870
You've been doing well, right?

145
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,710
How about you?

146
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,509
Well, I think I've been doing well.

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,879
I'm in good health with no health issues and got a job.

148
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,590
I'm glad to hear that.

149
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,669
Where are we going?

150
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,240
A place where we can be alone together quietly.

151
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,710
- We're almost there. - What?

152
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,210
(Shelton Hotel)

153
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,480
A hotel?

154
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,389
I guess you came here often. You're not hesitant at all.

155
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:33,389
Well, I prefer a place I'm familiar with.

156
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,028
Is there a place you prefer?

157
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,230
I like the atmosphere.

158
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,429
What atmosphere?

159
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,299
(Suite Room)

160
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,500
Sun Jae!

161
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,340
Well...

162
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,109
Shall we go somewhere else?

163
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,980
Why? Do you not like it?

164
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,209
No. Whether I like it or not isn't a problem.

165
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,250
Let's go inside then.

166
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,590
This is the only place where we can be alone...

167
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,090
without prying eyes.

168
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,789
Sun Jae.

169
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,259
Yes.

170
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,929
I suggested we stay together tonight.

171
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,529
But I didn't mean it like that.

172
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,169
I'm saying...

173
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,539
I didn't suggest we spend a passionate night together.

174
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
"A passionate night?"

175
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,070
Yes. A passionate night.

176
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,349
Of course, it's not like we're strangers,

177
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,349
and we used to have a crush on each other or something like that.

178
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,788
Some people say when long-lost classmates meet and hit it off,

179
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,449
they sometimes skip the introduction and the main...

180
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,589
and go straight to the conclusion.

181
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,620
But...

182
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,860
I'm quite conservative. Sorry.

183
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,600
- What on earth are you thinking? - But...

184
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,470
I'm not blaming you for having a thought like that.

185
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,599
We just have different values.

186
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,298
When adult man and woman come to a place like this...

187
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,440
and the mood is right,

188
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,039
such things can happen.

189
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,980
But when I suggested we stay together tonight,

190
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,549
I didn't mean to have a passionate night with you. I'm sorry.

191
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,320
You don't have to be.

192
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,389
Still, I'm sorry for making you misunderstand unnecessarily.

193
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,490
(Shelton Lounge Bar)

194
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,258
Please escort us to a place with a pleasant ambiance.

195
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,789
Sure. Please follow me.

196
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,870
(Shelton Lounge Bar)

197
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,970
I'm screwed.

198
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,669
I brought you, the conservative one, here of all places.

199
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,679
I feel uncomfortable when there are many people. You understand, right?

200
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,080
Of course.

201
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,480
I forgot you were a celebrity.

202
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,750
Why did you visit me?

203
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,889
Well...

204
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,789
I wanted to apologize.

205
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,258
I didn't push you into the fountain yesterday...

206
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,659
out of resentment over the movie.

207
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,360
It was a mistake.

208
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,200
I was going out in a hurry. I didn't know it was you.

209
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,200
Right. There's no way you did that on purpose.

210
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,570
Forget about the lawsuit.

211
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,240
I reported to the police because of something else.

212
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,539
I don't know why they took you.

213
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,980
I apologize for the trouble.

214
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,120
It's all right.

215
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,990
But is that the only reason...

216
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,519
- you wanted to visit me? - What?

217
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,929
I thought...

218
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,029
it might be the time capsule.

219
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,470
I thought that's why you came.

220
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,669
Do you remember the promise?

221
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,908
Did you go there that day?

222
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,909
No.

223
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,179
I'm very busy.

224
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,980
You didn't go.

225
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,919
It's a relief.

226
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,419
How about you? Did you go?

227
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,919
No. I didn't go either.

228
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,389
It sounded like you put something amazing in there.

229
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,059
Would you be okay with not searching for that?

230
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm okay.

231
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,340
Because my wish was granted.

232
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,740
Seeing you again like this...

233
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,279
makes me so happy.

234
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,580
I guess you feel better now.

235
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,490
You got scared when you saw me after the incident.

236
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,960
"The incident?"

237
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,490
Never mind.

238
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,629
You said you wanted to become a movie director.

239
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,470
And you were really working for a movie production company.

240
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,469
Don't push. Move over.

241
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,070
- Am I on camera? - Gather here.

242
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,039
- Come in. - All right.

243
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,139
I'll take a picture in 1, 2, 3.

244
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,648
- You worked hard! - You worked hard!

245

(Eclipse Full-Member Concert Was Successful!)

246
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,919
Good job.

(After 5 years)

250
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,528
After five years, we had a full-member concert.

251
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,289
We burned the night away.

252
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:06,258
Thank you and love you.

253
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,598

254

(We burned the night away. Thank you and love you.)

255
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,028
- I love you, Eclipse. - Thank you for becoming singers.

256
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,139
I don't see Sun Jae.

257
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,470
He went to a hotel with a woman instead of going to the after-party.

(Baek In Hyuk)

259
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,779
Just a second.

260
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,849
- Yes. - Did you go to Shelton Hotel?

261
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:25,518
Everyone is talking about seeing you...

262
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,450
going to the hotel with a woman on social media.

263
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,420
Did you have a woman you were going to meet right after the concert?

264
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,819
Who is it? Tell me who it is.

265
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,429
You don't have to know.

266
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,459
Everyone will know when the articles are released tomorrow anyway.

267
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,499
Are you really going to do this?

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,029
The reporters must be hiding near the hotel already.

269
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,670
I'm hanging up.

270
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,609
Why?

271
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,109
I'm sorry, but we should get up now.

272
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,608
Already? We didn't even talk much.

273
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,079
I think I'm followed by reporters.

274
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,150
You should go...

275
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,250
No. I'll go out first.

276
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,389
Take your time and finish this before you go.

277
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,460
I can't let him go like this.

278
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,059
Can't you stay longer?

279
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,059
If articles come out, you'll get tired unnecessarily.

280
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,059
Sun Jae, please wait.

281
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,670
Make sure to cover your face when you leave just in case.

282
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,380
I'll contact you.

283
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,009
Let's meet again and talk.

284
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,809

Excuse me!

288
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,450
Mr. Kim, you keep an eye on the van. I'll keep an eye on the entrance.

289
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:06,650
Okay.

290
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,019
What's that?

291
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,220
- What? - What's that?

292
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,460
Sun Jae. Here. Hurry up.

293
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,568
What are you doing? Do you want to get your picture taken?

294
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,380
Get in the car quickly if you don't want to get your photo taken.

295
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,740
Hurry up!

296
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,490
What on earth are you thinking?

297
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,589
As long as there's no two-shot, no one will believe the article.

298
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,278
What kind of situation is this?

299
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,649
Why are you asking?

300
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,608
I'm driving the car, and you're sitting in the passenger's seat.

301
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,720
That's what I'm saying.

302
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,650
Why did you drag me into the car as if you were kidnapping me?

303
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,848
How can I let the celebrity followed by stalkers go alone?

304
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,919
You don't even have a car.

305
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,190
My manager was there.

306
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,099
Oh, my. Was he? I didn't notice.

307
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,639
Since you're already in my car, I'll drive you home safely.

308
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,809
I'm a good driver. A driver with a ten-year accident-free record.

309
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,240
Whether in the past or now,

310
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,579
you're still the same when it comes to pushing things ahead recklessly.

311
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,950
Let's push ahead recklessly.

312
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,859
You want to come to my place at this hour?

313
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,359
Why?

314
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,599
Well...

315
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,970
It's been urgent since earlier.

316
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,569
Can I use your bathroom?

317
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,269
What?

318
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,779
It's urgent.

319
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:15,480
It's urgent.

320
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,180
I think it's going to come out.

321
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,278
- Are you serious? - Of course, I'm serious.

322
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,989
She was all over him,

323
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,420
telling him to spend the night together.

324
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,318
So where did they go?

325
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,689
They're going to spend the night together. If it's not a hotel,

326
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,230
- it must be his house. - His house?

327
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,069
Sun Jae's house?

328
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,569
- They can't go there. - Why not?

329
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,308
After I filmed a game commercial, I received a gift from the company.

330
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:43,910
- And? - And...

331
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,940
I threw it away in Sun Jae's place this morning.

332
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,950
Gosh. My stomach.

333
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,450
Goodness.

334
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,349
My goodness.

335
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,739
Gosh. Where's the bathroom?

336
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,779
The bathroom!

337
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,609
It's this way. Come.

338
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,180
Take as much time as you need.

339
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,180
It was here.

340
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,950
Gosh. What is this doing here?

341
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,890
It's all right.

342
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,019
Darn it, Baek In Hyuk. That prick.

343
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,329
Be careful.

344
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Gosh. How can this happen in the middle of the night?

345
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,499
I'm hungry.

346
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,930
Let's go to Geum's place. Okay, Mom.

347
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,930
I've bulldozed my way into his house.

348
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,269
I wanted to meet him again in a pleasant way.

349
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,368
It's not the time to worry about my image.

350
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:58,210
I should never leave him alone today.

351
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,880
(Mom)

352
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,789
Yes, Mom.

353
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:09,989
Sol, where are you?

354
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,990
I'm outside. Why?

355
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,389
The water pipe at home froze and burst.

356
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,490
So I'm on my way to Geum's place in a cab with your grandmother.

357
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,200
You should also come to his house later.

358
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,059
I'm not going home tonight.

359
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,170
I'll stay out overnight, so don't worry.

360
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,568
"Stay overnight?"

361
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,640
You don't have a place to stay out overnight.

362
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,140
Are you seeing someone?

363
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,710
In that case,

364
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,440
I will grant you permission.

365
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,309
I'm with a man. Satisfied?

366
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:37,250
Anyway, I'm not going home tonight, so don't look for me.

367
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,049
Let's stay together tonight.

368
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,319
Let's spend...

369
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,960
the night together.

370
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,890
You said you didn't mean it that way.

371
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,359
What?

372
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,700
- Stop thumping. - Okay.

373
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,099
See you tomorrow.

374
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,079
You're done.

375
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,890
Yes.

376
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,230
How should I stall for some time?

377
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,029
What is she doing? Does she...

378
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,730
really intend to stay?

379
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:42,880
By the way,

380
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,349
you take good care of your house.

381
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,220
Can you...

382
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,619
give me a little house tour?

383
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,630
I'm not going home tonight.

384
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm not going home tonight.

385
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,700
No?

386
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Sure.

387
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,670
Your TV is as tall as me.

388
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,279
It's humongous!

389
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,319
It would take all night to organize your walk-in closet.

390
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,089
What?

391
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,049
How do I look?

392
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,359
You'll stay up all night checking out my clothes.

393
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,690
Come on out.

394
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,900
Wait. How do I look?

395
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,808
This painting keeps catching my eye.

396
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,109
I don't know.

397
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,640
It's as if it has captured my soul.

398
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,848
I heard people stare at...

399
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,980
famous work of art for hours.

400
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:53,980
Now I understand why.

401
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,420
Should I take it off the wall, so you can bring it home?

402
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
What?

403
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,230
No, it's all right.

404
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,500
What a nightscape!

405
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,328
The Namsan Seoultower is over there. Does the house face south?

406
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,369
It faces west.

407
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,369
I see.

408
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,209
Gosh!

409
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,740
What kind of tree is this?

410
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,578
I love the scent of phytoncide.

411
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,579
It's an artificial tree.

412
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,650
I see.

413
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,058
I mean, it looks so real.

414
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,119
That one's real.

415
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,829
Did you prick yourself? Let me see.

416
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,359
Are you hurt?

417
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,099
Let me check.

418
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,779
It's all right.

419
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,109
Thank you...

420
00:27:58,849 --> 00:27:59,880
for...

421
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,088
Should we continue the house tour?

422
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:03,149
Where did I miss?

423
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,150
The bedroom.

424
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,160
Do I have to show my bedroom to you?

425
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,759
What?

426
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,589
No.

427
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,059
You saw it all, then. Shall we get going?

428
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,960
Wait, Sun Jae.

429
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,230
Well...

430
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,109
Aren't you hungry?

431
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,009
Can I...

432
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,339
have ramyeon before I leave?

433
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,349
I'm not going home tonight.

434
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,450
No?

435
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,490
You can.

436
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:40,588
Never!

437
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,160
I won't allow Im Sol to see Sun Jae.

438
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,799
- Darn it. - Did something happen before?

439
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,130
Did it? Yes, it did.

440
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,900
She was so ungrateful even though her life was saved.

441
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,470
Anyway, I won't allow it.

442
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,109
I can't understand Sun Jae either.

443
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,808
How can he fall for her helplessly...

444
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,369
the moment he meets her after ten years?

445
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:01,880
Don't tell me he's cooking her something like an idiot right now.

446
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,230
What are those medications?

447
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,400
They can't be pills for depression.

448
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,940
Are you interested in medicine?

449
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,839
What?

450
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,380
I was wondering what those are for.

451
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,980
This is multi-vitamins.

452
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,819
Omega-three oils.

453
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,250
Lutein.

454
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,390
Supplements.

455
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,059
You take nutritional supplements.

456
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,390
I'm glad to hear that.

457
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,099
- Aren't you going to eat too? - How can I eat that right now?

458
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,769
What?

459
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm on a diet.

460
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,809
I see. You're on a diet because you're a celebrity.

461
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,950
I'll enjoy it since I don't need to be on a diet.

462
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,069
I think he's really going to send me home now.

463
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,410
What? Why is he so quiet?

464
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,279
Why is he making no response?

465
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:55,430
Wake up.

466
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,990
I know you're not asleep.

467
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,259
It will be less embarrassing if you wake up now.

468
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,769
I dozed off.

469
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,299
If you didn't wake me up, I would have slept until morning.

470
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,109
Are you really...

471
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,039
going to sleep here tonight?

472
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,150
Wait. Who is that person?

473
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,559
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

474
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,529
Well...

475
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,268
You said you didn't mean it that way,

476
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:40,700
so you don't have that in mind.

477
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,339
Is it for the movie, then?

478
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:46,410
Are you holding out so that I'd sign the contract?

479
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,038
No, you got me wrong.

480
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,049
Okay.

481
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,779
Give me an explanation before I get the wrong idea.

482
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,549
- I worry that you... - That I...

483
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,519
might...

484
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,920
die tonight.

485
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:08,500
That I might die?

486
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,970
Yes. That's right.

487
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,440
So, I won't be relieved unless I stay by your side tonight.

488
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,440
I chased you into your house because I thought...

489
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,150
something might happen when I leave you alone and I'd regret it.

490
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,419
Yes, a dream. I had a bad dream.

491
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,079
In my dream, you were badly injured at the competition.

492
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,589
It was so vivid as if it were real.

493
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,059
I got the feeling that it would happen in real life.

494
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,619
So I was nervous and worried.

495
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,390
You haven't changed.

496
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,269
I see. I guess I died in your dream this time.

497
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,569
How can I explain it to you?

498
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:51,039
The painful moments...

499
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,339
when you disappeared from this world.

500
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,150
Why the heck would I die?

501
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,119
What's in your mind every day to have such a dream?

502
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,118
In the interviews,

503
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,519
celebrities often say they are mentally exhausted.

504
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,630
Some even make an unfortunate decision because of it.

505
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,769
Many rumors have it that you are mentally exhausted.

506
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,368
That you suffer from depression and have panic attacks.

507
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,670
I don't have such things.

508
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,170
Depression and panic attacks.

509
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,909
Is that so? Really?

510
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,480
Why do you believe those groundless rumors?

511
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,210
I'm glad to hear that.

512
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,950
But...

513
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,559
why do you care...

514
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,059
after all this time?

515
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,569
I know. After all this time.

516
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:00,309
I'm holding you back from rest when you are tired. Sorry.

517
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,750
I'll get going after cleaning this up.

518
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,079
Don't go.

519
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:28,739
It'll be big, but just put it on.

520
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Right.

521
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,280
You can get changed in here.

522
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:43,920
Thanks.

523
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,309
No.

524
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,400
Hey. Did you get changed?

525
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,530
Yes. I did.

526
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,309
You can get out if you are done getting changed.

527
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,079
Okay.

528
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,619
Right, Sun Jae. I left my clothes in here.

529
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,329
I didn't know you had such a hobby.

530
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,139
No!

531
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,710
I understand you.

532
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,210
Don't. This is not it.

533
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,480
What do you take me for?

534
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,109
This is...

535
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,010
One thing that's clear is that this isn't mine.

536
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,619
Until I came home today,

537
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,289
I really didn't know such a thing was in my place.

538
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:24,719
It's all right.

539
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,219
You can have such a thing...

540
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,289
in your house when you live alone.

541
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,360
It's not mine, I said!

542
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,400
Let's talk outside.

543
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,169
Why? Let me take a look.

544
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,368
What? Don't do this. It's not mine.

545
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,139
- Come on. - Stop it.

546
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,099
Sun Jae.

547
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:32,489
Stay in here for a second.

548
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,429
Sun Jae.

549
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,329
Did I just make a big mistake?

550
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,030
What? What do you mean?

551
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,138
I think I saw you with a girl.

552
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:50,170
What are you talking about?

553
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,739
That was it.

554
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:54,909
No, it wasn't.

555
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,409
In addition to that,

556
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,849
I saw another one.

557
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,349
How many fingers are these?

558
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,319
- There are 2. - Wrong. There is 1.

559
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,650
You saw it wrong because you are drunk.

560
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:05,590
Is that so?

561
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,590
By the way, I heard you met Sol.

562
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,590
Didn't you bring her home?

563
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,460
Nonsense. We parted after drinking some tea.

564
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,300
- You're drunk. Go away. - You...

565
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,530
No way.

566
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:20,670
Don't tell me you still have feelings for...

567
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,340
No, you're wrong.

568
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,210
Leave now.

569
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,009
- No? - Darn it.

570
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,210
In that case,

571
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:32,279
I'll take a bath since I'm here.

572
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,348
Gosh. Why do you always take a bath here? Go home already!

573
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,190
I told you already.

574
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:41,989
Your bathtub is totally my type.

575
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:44,130
How much did you drink?

576
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,570
- What's wrong? - Go in quickly and wash up.

577
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,499
Can I take a lower-body bath?

578
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,170
Sure. Do whatever you want.

579
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,309
Yes!

580
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,150
I'm sorry. Let's get out.

581
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,219
Hey, Sun Jae!

582
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:09,690
What now?

583
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,119
Why are you back out again?

584
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,019
What is this?

585
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,090
What on earth is this?

586
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,859
Why was it there?

587
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,599
Honestly, is Sol that pretty?

588
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,630
I really don't get it.

589
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,869
There are many women around you prettier than her.

590
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,138
There are so many of them!

591
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:30,968
- That prick! - But why can't you...

592
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,578
get over her still? It's pathetic!

593
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,539
- Gosh. You're wrong. - I'm not wrong.

594
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:39,448
Don't you remember the fuss you made whenever you got drunk?

595
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:40,849
(Year 2012, Redevelopment project confirmed)

596
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,788
- Gosh. - Sol!

597
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:50,789
(Year 2014)

598
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:51,789
Hey, Sun Jae.

599
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,400
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,368
Hey. Wake up. Come on.

601
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:00,098
- I'm not leaving. - What are you talking about?

602
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:02,300
Sol!

603
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,710
(Year 2019)

604
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,309
Mom.

605
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,579
For goodness' sake!

606
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,250
Are you a salmon, coming back here to lay eggs?

607
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,889
Why do you keep returning to this place?

608
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,018
Whenever you are drunk, you've come back...

609
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,459
to old Sol's house site to act pathetically for ten years.

610
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,659
I won't come back now.

611
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,030
Today is the last day.

612
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm going to forget about her.

613
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,069
Hey. Get up.

614
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,638
- Give me some time. - No. Just get up.

615
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,698
For goodness' sake!

616
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:35,969
Are you still going to deny it?

617
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,808
You're over 30,

618
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,408
but you couldn't date anyone...

619
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:40,809
because you couldn't get over your first crush.

620
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,980
Darn it.

621
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,920
Hey.

622
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,218
Hey. Put me down.

623
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,690
Put me down. Hey!

624
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,260
You!

625
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,300
Close your mouth and wash up.

626
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:04,800
Should I?

627
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,900
It's warm.

628
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,599
It's so warm.

629
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,519
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

630
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,789
- You don't go to school and... - Sun Jae.

631
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,159
Thank you.

632
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,900
I'm truly grateful.

633
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,699
But when I see you, it reminds me of that incident.

634
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,670
It scares me.

635
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,070
So I can't see you anymore.

636
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,420
The tree...

637
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,320
was gone.

638
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,789
I found it beforehand.

639
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,099
I see.

640
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:47,339
Does that mean on January 1, did you...

641
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,440
I did go.

642
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,409
On that day,

643
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,579
I was there.

644
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,070
Look. Sun Jae.

645
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:48,400
You should go inside now.

646
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,110
I was there too that night.

647
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:58,610
To see you.

648
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,650
I was late, though.

649
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,849
So we must have missed each other.

650
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,889
Yes. I guess so.

651
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,460
And one more thing.

652
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,929
I...

653
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,000
liked you too.

654
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:29,099
I'm sorry for not telling you how I felt...

655
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,940
and hurting you.

656
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,409
I know that hearing this now doesn't mean much to you.

657
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,449
I'm still sorry.

658
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:42,619
But I didn't have any other choice back then.

659
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,250
I really didn't have any choice.

660
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,360
It was painful, and I was miserable too.

661
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:51,559
I wanted to tell you if I ever got a chance...

662
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,960
to see you again.

663
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:58,170
That I liked you too.

664
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,369
That I missed you.

665
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,670
I missed you with all of my heart, Sun Jae.

666
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,179
I missed seeing you like this.

667
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:18,920
Someone might see you.

668
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,360
Thank you for driving me. Bye.

669
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,679
I liked you too.

670
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,849
I missed you with all of my heart, Sun Jae.

671
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,519
I missed seeing you like this.

672
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,449
So you're telling me...

673
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,159
that...

674
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,559
you had feelings for me just like I did for you. Am I right?

675
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,530
You said you missed me.

676
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,110
Then tell me.

677
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:45,440
How about now?

678
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,929
Who is it?

679
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,929
I'm from the maintenance office.

680
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,440
I heard that your water pipes froze and burst last night.

681
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:28,940
Oh, right.

682
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:31,369
Well,

683
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,440
I'm sorry. But could you come back later?

684
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:35,940
No, I can't.

685
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,050
I'm only available now.

686
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,789
What's going on? How come she's not saying anything back?

687
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:48,820
Hello.

688
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,199
It's cold today. Have a good day, brother.

689
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:57,170
- Brother? - Brother?

690
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,569
Yes. He's...

691
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,439
my older brother. You know him. He recently had his second child.

692
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,038
What? Your older brother?

693
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,138
Yes.

694
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,539
I've known him for years now.

695
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,750
He looks completely different.

696
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,449
He got a totally new face now.

697
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,849
He got the plastic surgery done.

698
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,849
You should go now, brother.

699
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,788
Bye. Go already.

700
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:23,019
Come on in.

701
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,360
- Your brother is leaving. - Bye!

702
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,699
- I'm really leaving. - Okay!

703
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,099
Gosh. You're at a great age to be in love.

704
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,880
Come on.

705
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,409
That's a loud car.

706
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,820
I've never seen that car before.

707
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,900
Sorry. Keep going.

708
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,380
Seriously.

709
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,250
How can you smile right now?

710
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,519
How could you be smiling given the situation we are in?

711
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:03,360
How will you salvage this movie?

712
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,630
(Hero)

713
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,699
(Recents)

714
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,280
He must be busy. Right?

715
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,179
(Mom)

716
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,149
Hey, Mom.

717
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:31,750
Go to the postnatal care center and see Hyun Ju during lunch.

718
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,760
She's about to divorce your brother.

719
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,819
What do you mean?

720
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,959
Geum canceled the savings account...

721
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,558
and invested in his friend's business.

722
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,460
But he lost half of his money from the investment.

723
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,959
When Hyun Ju found out,

724
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,328
she even kicked him out without shoes.

725
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,369
What?

726
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,539
So...

727
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:53,780
you're really going to divorce him?

728
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,340
Are you crazy?

729
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:58,309
Divorce isn't a joke.

730
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,018
Geum must have been under a lot of pressure...

731
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:03,349
once our second child was born.

732
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,219
We have a small house, but we have one more baby.

733
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:09,260
Since we're a single-income family, we can barely save any money.

734
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,329
Who knew this would happen?

735
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,928
(Im Sol)

736
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,400
I envy you the most.

737
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,400
I should've joined you...

738
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,639
for the job interview at the movie production company.

739
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,610
Then we would've gone to school together.

740
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,340
We would've worked together too.

741
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:28,210
It would've been great.

742
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:31,609
I wonder why I rushed into marrying him...

743
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,750
even before I got a job.

744
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,219
If you could go back in time,

745
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:40,820
would you not marry my brother?

746
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,099
If I didn't marry him,

747
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,630
would my fate change?

748
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,269
Probably.

749
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,539
Yes. Let's say that my fate changed.

750
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,510
How could I be certain that my new life would be any better?

751
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,479
I could be happy for the time being.

752
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,610
But what about the future?

753
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,250
Who knows if all kinds of bad stuff might suddenly start happening?

754
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,179
No one can know what the future holds for us.

755
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,849
We never know what kind of life we will have until we live it.

756
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:17,530
My baby, did you pee?

757
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:18,960
Let's see.

758
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,559
Right here.

759
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,469
Even if...

760
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,230
someone gives me a chance to go back in time,

761
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,840
I would never gamble with my fate.

762
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,239
If I never got married,

763
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,940
I would have never been able to see my beautiful children.

764
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,769
(Radiating and dazzling skin with just hydration)

765
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:12,909
Hello?

766
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,079
It's me.

767
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,349
Yes.

768
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,090
I've been busy all morning.

769
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:18,989
Did you get to work on time?

770
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,019
Aren't you tired?

771
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,219
I'm okay.

772
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,429
I guess you're busy.

773
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,159
I have to work until late at night today.

774
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,860
I see.

775
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,198
You barely got any rest...

776
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,400
after the concert because of me yesterday.

777
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,530
You must be exhausted.

778
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,539
I'm not exhausted at all.

779
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:34,699
Liar.

780
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,769
There you go again, covering up your burdens.

781
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,809
You do that to other people, don't you?

782
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,339
You need to tell people if you're having a rough time.

783
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,980
If you don't talk to anyone, no one would know.

784
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,250
Are you there?

785
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:49,679
Why did you suddenly get quiet?

786
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,760
No reason.

787
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,789
I'm just happy.

788
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,730
By the way, it's about the present. The wind-up clock.

789
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,599
What did that mean?

790
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:12,340
I wanted your time...

791
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,079
to keep flowing instead of stopping.

792
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,849
That's odd.

793
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:18,510
Why?

794
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:20,949
Now that I hear you say that,

795
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,789
my time which was standing still until now...

796
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:26,860
is finally flowing properly.

797
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,519
- Is that so? - Yes.

798
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,030
Should we meet tomorrow?

799
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,630
Sure. Let's meet tomorrow.

800
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,760
No. Should we meet tonight?

801
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:37,230
When will you end?

802
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know.

803
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:42,000
Then you must be tired.

804
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:44,969
No. Let's meet even if it's late.

805
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,739
I'll go to you. Let's meet.

806
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,750
Sure. Let's do that.

807
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,849
Hey.

808
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,179
We're almost there.

809
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:55,550
Okay.

810
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,820
Do you have to get going?

811
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,949
Let's talk just a bit longer.

812
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,960
Gosh, why? We'll see each other later.

813
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:08,400
- Should we just meet up now? - What?

814
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,969
Just tell me that you want to see me. Then...

815
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:12,329
I'll quit everything and go to you.

816
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,300
Get back to work now.

817
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,869
See you later.

818
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,159
What about the scales?

819
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,388
It will be difficult to recreate...

820
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:37,460
the mermaid's tail because of the reflection.

821
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,659
We'll...

822
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,460
(Slide to answer)

823
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:46,429
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,199
- Let's focus on the meeting. - Okay.

825
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,238
What were you saying?

826
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,340
We tried to recreate the scales by using...

827
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,219
Could you look over here?

828
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,900
- Bye. - Goodnight.

829
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,510
The phone is turned off. You'll be directed to voicemail.

830
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,980
Her phone is still turned off.

831
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,519
Did something happen?

832
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,820
Her battery must've died or something.

833
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,420
Eyes on the road.

834
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,659
What on earth...

835
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,698
How did she get into the building?

836
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:50,500
They said they would tighten the security. What is this?

837
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,300
- She's back? - Yes.

838
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,098
She came to your house when In Hyuk was sleeping this morning.

839
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,840
She tried to get the door open.

840
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,670
So she never left the building? What is this?

841
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,579
This girl is driving me so angry.

842
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:02,880
Gosh, don't be so angry.

843
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,849
Report her to the police. Let's go to the hotel for now.

844
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,150
I need to change quickly, so I can go and see Sol.

845
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,389
Right!

846
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,730
I left my car at Sun Jae's place.

847
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,679
He's probably not home yet. Right?

848
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,960
Gosh. I had my phone off the whole day.

849
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,800
(Missed calls)

850
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,039
(Recents)

851
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,849
(Sol)

852
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,578
The person you have reached is unavailable.

853
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:14,948
You'll be directed to voicemail.

854
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:16,550
I guess he's still at work.

855
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,960
By the way, where did I park my car?

856
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:25,190
I found it.

857
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,929
(Missed call from Sol)

858
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,570
My car didn't hit her.

859
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:41,039
She fell on her own.

860
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,809
Gosh. Are you all right?

861
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,639
Stop right there!

862
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,619
Darn that stalker. Come on.

863
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:56,050
What a nuisance.

864
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:58,820
- "Stalker?" - Yes.

865
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,199
(Dong Seok, JNT Entertainment)

866
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,238
- What is it? - Sun Jae. Which room was it?

867
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,239
Room 251...

868
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,179
What? So you know which room I'm in. Why did you ask?

869
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,380
What are you talking about?

870
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:29,280
That wasn't you?

871
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:51,309
- I got you. - Let go of me!

872
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,829
How long has it been since you left home?

873
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,199
A month.

874
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,769
How old are you? Fifteen? Sixteen?

875
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,469
I'm fourteen.

876
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,170
I'm in seventh grade.

877
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:25,908
I get that you're only a minor.

878
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:27,780
But this is still a crime. Do you know that?

879
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,440
I did it because I liked him a lot.

880
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:30,909
That still doesn't make it okay.

881
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:34,250
You're torturing the person you like and making him more miserable.

882
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,519
How could you do that when you like him?

883
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,059
Take your time. I'll get you some water.

884
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:48,829
Gosh.

885
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,029
- Breaking news. - I can't believe this.

886
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,198
There has been a shocking incident...

887
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,999
where the actor who started off as a singer, Ryu Sun Jae,

888
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,399
was attacked by an unidentified assailant...

889
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,670
at a hotel in Seoul.

890
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,609
The police are currently in pursuit of the suspect...

891
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,768
who ran away from the scene.

892
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,239
Reporter Kim Eun Ju will give us more details.

893
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,939
The incident took place at a five-star hotel.

894
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,110
So it's difficult for unregistered guests to enter.

895
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,879
But by the time Ryu was found, he had already lost a lot of blood.

896
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,479
He was transported to a hospital immediately.

897
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,949
And an emergency operation is being performed now.

898
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:15,090
Moreover, based on the DNA analysis of the weapon found at the scene,

899
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,118
the suspect had been imprisoned for murder in 2009...

900
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,928
and was released only a few days ago.

901
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:21,300
The suspect is identified as Kim, a man in his 40s.

902
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,829
The police announced that they decided to disclose...

903
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,928
the suspect's information...

904
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:26,429
due to the possibility of repeated crimes.

905
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,969
Why on earth...

906
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,539
Why did he hurt Sun Jae?
