00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,549
She has to get off now.

Well...

11
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,829
Hey...

12
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,129
- Hey. - You still didn't wake her up?

13
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,829
Since you're still on the bus,

14
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,239
you should stay with her until she wakes up.

15
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,999
Pretend that you missed your stop too.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,540
You guys can come back together then.

17
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,680
Use this chance to talk to her. You fool.

18
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,379
Bye. I have to wake her up.

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,419
When did she get off?

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,289
Sir, could you stop the bus?

22
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,550
No.

23
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,860
We'll arrive at the next stop soon. You can get off then.

24
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,629
No, I need to get off now.

25
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,900
Did I miss the last bus?

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,639

- You're not getting in? - What?

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,599
My mom is coming to get me. I'm sorry.

31
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,800

35
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,310
I think the last bus stopped running.

36
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,279
She probably took a taxi home, right?

37
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,769
Why did she wake up already?

38
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,610

39
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,779
Come on, Sol. I asked you to bring the charger.

52
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,549
What? When did she leave?

53
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,759
(Vacant)

54
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,429
It wasn't a car accident.

55
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Why is her umbrella here?

56
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,809
You startled me.

57
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,610
Hey.

58
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,449
What's your problem?

59
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,378
Is Sol home?

60
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,419
No.

61
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,190
By the way, she said she couldn't leave home today.

62
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,320
Where on earth did she go?

63
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:25,519
- She said she couldn't leave home? - Yes.

64
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,590
She made a big fuss about not leaving the house today.

65
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,189
Several days ago,

66
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,298
she told me to tie her up or something to stop her...

67
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,429
if she wanted to go to a reservoir today.

68
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,929
A reservoir?

69
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,808
What should we do?

70
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,269
I think someone took your phone.

71
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,710
- What's wrong? - I remember my accident scene.

72
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,580
You mean the car accident you told me about before?

73
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,580
The accident was here?

74
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,879
Yes.

75
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,980
I think so.

76
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,649
Are you...

77
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,658
talking about the reservoir where Sol got into a car accident?

78
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,720
A car accident?

79
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,789
What are you talking about? There's not a scar on her.

80
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,659
She was never in an accident?

81
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,629
What? Did she say she was?

82
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,168
Did she have a car accident at a reservoir...

83
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,768
in her dream or something?

84
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:12,798
Yes, a dream.

85
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,069
I had a bad dream.

86
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,439
In my dream, you were badly injured at the competition.

87
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,779
It was so vivid as if it were real.

88
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,509
What was that?

89
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,580
Yes. I can still run away.

90
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,820
Since I know everything, I can change it.

92
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:48,789

93
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,089
All right.

94
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,690
So someone went missing.

95
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,359
But your gut told you that she might be here. That's it, right?

96
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,730
It's just your gut feeling, right?

97
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,629
Can't you just go out and look for her?

98
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,539
Gosh. Come on.

99
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,169
Is it because there was a murder case here?

100
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,709
Why is everyone saying that...

101
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,440
something bad is going to happen here?

102
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,080
Just go to an Internet cafe or a karaoke room to look for her.

103
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,179
Gosh...

104
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,830
If I go that way, I'll be at the reservoir.

105
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,429
Then...

106
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,500
Come on.

107
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,399
Wait. Is it September 1 today?

108
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,939
The girl who came to pick up her wallet...

109
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,700
also said something might happen today.

110
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,269
What?

111
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,690
Sol!

112
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,529
Must I accept this...

113
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,970
as my inevitable fate?

114
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,180
Sol!

115
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,058
Are you okay?

116
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,619
Are you okay, kid?

117
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,589
I'm safe.

118
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,910

Are you okay?

121
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,420
Did something happen to you?

122
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,289

125
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,839
A woman kissed me on the lips that night.

126
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,910
Was that you, a mere court maid?

127
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,109
No, Your Majesty.

128
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,508
- That was not my intention. - Hey.

129
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,880
I just lost my footing.

130
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,489
- Lower your body. - I had no idea that...

131
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,650
- What? No way. - it was you who...

132
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,359
How unfortunate.

133
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,160
I have a bad temper.

134
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,890

135
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:48,269
I can't believe this.

No!

137

138
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,509
No what?

139
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,038
Hey, Assistant Director.

140
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,578
Come on. Get the extra to behave.

141
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,910
I'm sorry.

142
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,680
Let's take ten, everyone!

143
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,649
- What is this? Come on. - This is so annoying.

144
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,848
- What on earth is going on? - All right.

145
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,450
Come over here.

146
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,819
Come on. This isn't your first rodeo.

147
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,720

(January 1, 2023)

149

It's 2023 right now, right?

150
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,930
We're not in the Joseon Dynasty, right?

151
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,099
What?

152
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,829
Oh, I'm safe.

153
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm safe.

154
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,670
What's wrong with her? She must be going crazy.

155
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,279
Seriously? How dare he call you crazy?

156
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,079
Aren't you cold, Sol?

157
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,180
Put this on.

158
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,779
You were great.

159
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,690
Hey, Sol. Why are you crying?

160
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,289
Did he give you a hard time because you messed up?

161
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,489
They changed the storyboard the day before the shoot.

162
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,758
So they asked all the employees at our production company...

163
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,859
for help at the last minute. They should be thanking us.

164
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,129
Seriously. If they wanted decent actors and actresses,

165
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,829
they should've hired extras.

166
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,200
Don't you agree?

167
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,139
But who are you?

168
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,539
What? Who are you talking about?

169
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,740
Me?

170
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,079
What brings you here?

171
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,480
Nice to meet you.

172
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,319
My fate has changed again.

173
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
What's wrong?

174
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
I kept them safe.

175
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,970

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,119
Did he go to dig it by himself?

189
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:16,109
What? It's gone.

190
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,970
Sun Jae.

191
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,380
When did you get here...

192
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,109
without telling me?

193
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,690
Gosh.

194
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,930
Hey. This is not a public bath.

195
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,730
Why do you keep taking a bath here?

196
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,529
Because your bathtub is the best with the view of the nightscape.

197
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,869
Hey. I'll pay rent.

198
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,700
Take me in.

199
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,400
I'll give you one minute. Get out of there.

200
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,750
What?

201
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,130
Who is it?

202
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,670
Hey.

203
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,069
My apologies.

204
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,170
- Hey! - Gosh.

205
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,039
Is it that White Padded Jacket again?

206
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,779
I'd like to file a police report.

207
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,259
My goodness. Wait.

208
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,130
You dropped this.

209
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,799
(Let's grab Sun Jae and run)

210
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,660
Is she Sun Jae's fan?

211
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,599
This one says, "Let's grab and run."

212
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,329
- Excuse me. You dropped this. - I got you.

213
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,500
Pardon?

214
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,769
- Here. - What?

215
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,338
We got a call on breaking and entering.

216
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,410
- I got the perp. - Pardon?

217
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,920
(Let's grab Sun Jae and run)

218
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,789
Thank you for being alive.

219
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,160
What's your name?

220
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,599
Excuse me.

221
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,268
Sun Jae is pretty, isn't he?

222
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,369
She's hopeless.

223
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,539
Excuse me. What is your name?

224
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:09,539
Your name!

225
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,710
- Pardon? - Your name.

226
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,039
Right.

227
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,449
It's Im Sol.

228
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,750
Hand me your ID card.

229
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,920
What do you do for a living?

230
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,190
I work at a company.

231
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,499
I woke up one day and found myself...

232
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,930
working for a film production company.

233
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:36,670
In fact, my dream was to be a film director.

234
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:38,839
It's so interesting.

235
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,798
A choice I made in a moment...

236
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,569
has led to a completely different life.

237
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,639
I couldn't even dare to dream.

238
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,940
But now, I'm chasing my dream.

239
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,078
I knew it. Determination...

240
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,180
can change anyone's fate. Right?

241
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,719
But you can't change your fate...

242
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,849
of going to jail. What now?

243
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:57,920
For breaking and entering,

244
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,819
you can't avoid getting a penalty if the victim sues you.

245
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,089
So, the initial statement matters. Do you get it?

246
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,700
Breaking and entering?

247
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,058
At a luxurious resident complex,

248
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,768
do you get arrested for standing at the entrance?

249
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:10,900
"At the entrance?"

250
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,339
You tried to unlock the door of Ryu Sun Jae's apartment.

251
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,308
How did you get a hold of the passcode?

252
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:19,539
What? Who on earth dared to unlock Sun Jae's house?

253
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,278
Was it a stalker? That's crazy!

254
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,649
What kind of human trash...

255
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,348
And that's you.

256
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:25,419
I'm not the person.

257
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,319
- You're that crazy human trash. - I...

258
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,920
We can send her away once her ID is confirmed.

259
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,959
The victim won't file a lawsuit.

260
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,390
It'll make a fuss with the articles and all, and he doesn't want that.

261
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,159
You are truly lucky.

262
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,058
Why won't he file a lawsuit?

263
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,729
He should arrest them all, give no room for mercy,

264
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,299
and put them in handcuffs!

265
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,369
For goodness' sake. He's still so tender-minded and kind.

266
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Can you persuade him to sue them?

267
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,578
Yes, Sun Jae. I told the police you won't file a lawsuit.

268
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,109
I made sure there wouldn't be news going out.

269
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,680
- Okay. - But why aren't you...

270
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,249
- Why aren't you calling him? - Forget it and go home.

271
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,219
- Let me go inside again. - No.

272
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,018
Gosh. Why?

273
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,019
She must be the White Padded Jacket.

274
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:08,559
She looks normal, but she's a stalker.

275
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,029
Gosh. I think I saw her before.

276
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,299
Why aren't you suing her?

277
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,269
You have to give her a tough lesson so that she won't do it again.

278
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:21,769
What is this?

279
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,369
You are done with the bath. Why are you still here?

280
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,079
Do you think I came here for the bath?

281
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,879
I heard you turned down the film all of a sudden.

282
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,349
Mr. Kim is a nervous wreck right now.

283
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,690
He forced me to persuade you.

284
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:39,960
Try reading it yourself and see if you'd be persuaded.

285
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,359
You're so picky.

286
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,730
"Hero!" The title is nice too.

287
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,269
Is it about a Korean-style hero?

288
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,329
A hero, my foot.

289
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,369
What? What is it about?

290
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,369
A mermaid from the sea...

291
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,980
crosses the Imjin River and meets a North Korean military officer.

292
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,079
And they fall in love, right?

293
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
Suddenly, a zombie virus spreads.

294
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,979
The North Korean officer and the mermaid kill the zombies.

295
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,548
I see. It's an action-filled blockbuster.

296
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:07,949
No. It's a sci-fi drama.

297
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,649
The North Korean officer is actually an alien.

298
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,660
The story goes way too far to the outer space.

299
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,018
Sun Jae!

300
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,259
The stalker who tried to break and enter.

301
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
What now?

302
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,799
She's so... I need to catch my breath.

303
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,670
She's so vicious.

304
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,339
Why? Did she go on a rampage in front of the cops?

305
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,109
- Scooch over. - What?

306
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,240
In fact,

307
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,549
I think she works for this film production company.

308
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,848
- What? - She was the one...

309
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,749
who gave me the script when I visited the company.

310
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,960
I remember her clearly.

311
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:49,088
Why would she try to break into Sun Jae's place?

312
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,058
It's obvious. She wanted to attack him...

313
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,960
out of spite because he turned the movie down.

314
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,470
Or she is a real stalker.

315
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,129
You know, some get into the entertainment business...

316
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,900
to be close to the one they like.

317
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,339
I think we have to be extra careful.

318
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,059
Everything has changed.

319
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,869
Right. The watch.

320
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,858
Right. I wouldn't have kept it...

321
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,119
because I wasn't his fan.

322
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,630
I no longer have a reason to go back anyway,

323
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,400
so I don't need it.

324
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
Yes.

325
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,609
It's all for the better.

326
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,279
It's all good.

327
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,750
Sol!

328
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,630
What was that dream?

329
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,869
- Grandma. - Hello, ma'am.

330
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,440
Even when you can turn back time,

331
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,809
you're still helpless because you can't stop time from passing.

332
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,749
What's so funny, Grandma?

333
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,420
You're ugly.

334
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:01,089
You look like a baby octopus.

335
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,190
What?

336
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,160
What? I look pretty.

337
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:09,199
Have you seen a baby octopus this pretty?

338
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,329
Baby octopus

339
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,740
Baby octopus

340
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,160
These are pretty.

341
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:47,440
My pumpkin's legs have been cured.

342
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,170
- What? - You're walking.

343
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
Grandma, do you remember it?

344
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,680
Do you remember that I couldn't walk...

345
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,380
and that I was in a wheelchair?

346
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:01,380
Don't go out.

347
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,919
Play with me.

348
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,220
Sister.

349
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,389
She can't do that.

350
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,258
She'd get fired from work.

351
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:15,200
Mal Ja, why don't you come and have some snacks?

352
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,740
Snack time.

353
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,869
Here's your snack.

354
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,509
Why aren't you leaving for work?

355
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,578
What?

356
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,609
Right. I should get going.

357
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,480
Actually, Mom.

358
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,278
That guy...

359
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,420
who abducted me in the past.

360
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,758
What happened to him after that?

361
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,920
Why do you ask?

362
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,229
It's nothing. I don't remember what happened clearly.

363
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,900
What happened to him?

364
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,359
He got arrested and went to jail, of course.

365
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,900
He got arrested.

366
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:52,470
What a relief.

367
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,240
Gosh. Why do you bring back what happened 14 years ago?

368
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,640
Come on and get going.

369
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,109
Did you say 14 years ago?

370
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,508
Wasn't it 15 years ago?

371
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:00,609
Hurry.

372
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,849
- Right. I'll get going. - All right.

373
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:04,880
Hey. You forgot your car key.

374
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Here.

375
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,659
My car?

376
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,519
Yes. Gosh.

377
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,199
- I'll get going. - Sure.

378
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,959
Drive safely!

379
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Bye.

380
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,739
She didn't even want to talk about it.

381
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,409
Why does she bring it up suddenly?

382
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,179
Gosh. This is crazy.

383
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,179
You're my sweet ride!

384
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,150
But will I...

385
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,460
be able to drive?

386
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,360
Yes. I'm an exemplary driver who hasn't had a single accident...

387
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,099
since getting the Class 1 driver's license in 1 try.

388
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,630
I can do it.

389
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
What?

390
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,480
Why am I such a good driver?

391
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,650
Gosh. This is awesome!

392
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,650
- Good morning. - Good morning.

393
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,119
- Hello. - Hi.

394
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,039
- Good morning. - Good morning.

395
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,409
My goodness!

396
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,249
- Good morning! - Good morning.

397
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,379
Hello.

398
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,719
Gosh.

399
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:56,829
(Hero)

400
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,578
Good morning.

401
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,449
I just saw something horrendous to in see in the morning.

402
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,920
Well. Boss wants to see you.

403
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,090
She is angry like this.

404
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,789
It really wasn't me.

405
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:30,959
Stop it.

406
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,929
I heard that you were taken to the police office.

407
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,529
He's dropping the film because of you. What now?

408
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,400
I was in front of the building, indeed.

409
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,639
But the police mistook me as a stalker and took me in.

410
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,170
- Really? - Yes.

411
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,709
I couldn't pass the entrance.

412
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,309
Why did you go there to cause such a misunderstanding?

413
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,078
I'll schedule a meeting, then.

414
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,750
You explain to him yourself and get the record straight.

415
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,920
We really need to cast Sun Jae.

416
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,059
Pardon?

417
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,230
Do I meet him in person?

418
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,460
I mean, Sun Jae?

419
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:15,570
(Hero)

420
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:45,900
Sun Jae.

421
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,239
Who are you?

422
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,510
Do you...

423
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,368
not remember me?

424
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,880
Do we know each other?

425
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,090
He's not here yet, is he?

426
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,059
Why are you crying?

427
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,829
- Something got in my eyes. - What?

428
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,429
I'll wash it quickly.

429
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,460
No. She...

430
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,639
Are you going to cry like a lunatic in front of Sun Jae?

431
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,380
(Hyun Ju)

432
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,050
Hello?

433
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,018
What's wrong, Hyun Ju?

434
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,960
I couldn't reach anyone.

435
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:43,788
Please come quickly!

436
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,960
What's going on?

437
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm in a taxi to the hospital.

438
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,630
It'll come out soon.

439
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,070
What do you mean? What is coming out?

440
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,969
My baby, of course!

441
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:59,678
My water broke!

442
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,710
Your baby?

443
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,179
Oh, no!

444
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,250
I'm on my way. Where are you?

445
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,199
Yes.

446
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,139
We stepped out of the rehearsal for a second.

447
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,679
Try to hold it in.

448
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,049
I can't keep a baby from coming out!

449
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,449
Which hospital is it?

450
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,789
Sun Jae!

451
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,760
I'm on my way.

452
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
What?

453
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,630
- Excuse me! - What was that?

454
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,229
Are you just leaving after pushing someone into the water?

455
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,300
What?

456
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,899
Oh, my! I'm so sorry.

457
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,139
I'm all over the place.

458
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:03,939
Hold on.

459
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,369
- The White Padded Jacket? - What?

460
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,150
Hyun Ju.

461
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,749
I'm so sorry,

462
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,049
but I'm in a hurry.

463
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,920
Call me. I'll make compensation.

464
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,888
- I'm so sorry. - How...

465
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:16,988
Hey!

466
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:18,889
Hyun Ju, take a deep breath.

467
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,219
Keep breathing, okay?

468
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,059
Sun Jae.

469
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,500
Are you all right?

470
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,829
- I don't know. - Gosh.

471
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,099
Sun Jae.

472
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,828
She is the one. The one from the film company.

473
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,940
What?

474
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,699
She's unbelievable.

475
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,069
She did this on purpose, didn't she?

476
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,709
Even on a bullet train, people can recognize you.

477
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,809
Of course, it was deliberate.

478
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,238
I know what it is.

479
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,879
Because you turned down her film,

480
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,348
she did this to get back to you.

481
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:46,380
Gosh.

482
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,649
Do you want to call her and call names?

483
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,689
Forget it.

484
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,289
Make sure she pays for my clothes because she said she would,

485
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,090
including the cost of the underwear. Okay?

486
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,190
- Even the underwear? - Gosh. It's cold.

487
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,690
That's so childish.

488
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,960
- Gosh, it's Ryu Sun Jae! - It's Ryu Sun Jae!

489
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,099
- Sun Jae? - Sun Jae!

490
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,400
You're amazing! You're so hot!

491
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,010
Sun Jae!

492
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,519
My husband is making me go through this again. That jerk!

493
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,348
I'm going to kill him!

494
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,259
Who is he? I'll kill him for you!

495
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,889
Bring Im Geum here.

496
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,189
Hurry!

497
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,860
What? Im Geum?

498
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,300
Honey!

499
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,800
Hyun Ju!

500
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,639
Why are you just showing up now, you jerk?

501
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm sorry. I turned my phone off during a meeting.

502
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:44,710
It'll be all right since I'm here.

503
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,210
What do you mean it's all right?

504
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,679
You trash, when did you seduce my friend?

505
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,320
Why are you doing that to my husband?

506
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,050
What on earth did I change?

507
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,419
How did you two get married and have a child?

508
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,960
Mom!

509
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,030
It's you, Aunt.

510
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,630
Aunt!

511
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,569
Oh, my. The second child is surely coming out faster...

512
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,539
- than the 1st. - "The 2nd child?"

513
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,099
Yes. The second child.

514
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:19,239
The second child?

515
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,809
I'm sorry.

516
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,379
I'm glad to hear it was a smooth delivery.

517
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,779
Sun Jae didn't come anyway.

518
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,579
They said something happened on his way here or something.

519
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,519
What happened?

520
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,150
An accident?

521
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,059
No way. It's just an excuse.

522
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,259
Should I visit him and apologize?

523
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,300
Never mind. The CEO will take care of him.

524
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,829
She wants you to back off.

525
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,599
I understand.

526
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,340
We will never bump into each other anymore.

527
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,488
(Total price: 7,180 dollars)

528
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,619
(Please deposit the corresponding amount to the account.)

529
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,090
The total is 718 dollars?

530
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,760
Why is it so expensive?

531
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Wait.

532
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,099
It's 7,180 dollars?

533
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:22,840
It's 7,180?

534
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:29,650
Who is it?

535
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,919
Hello.

536
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,190
I'm sending a text as you're not answering calls.

537
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,118
First of all,

538
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,788
I'd like to sincerely apologize for making you experience...

539
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,590
such an unpleasant incident due to my mistake.

540
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,198
But there's something I'd like to check...

541
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,730
regarding the compensation for the clothing.

542
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,139
Did he really charge her for my underwear too?

543
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,840
I can't even joke with him.

544
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:00,308
Forget about it. I just hope I never cross paths with you again.

545
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:01,578
Actually, I was so flustered...

546
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,679
that I didn't get a good look at you earlier.

547
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,948
I'd like to know if you were actually wearing these clothes.

548
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:07,949
What?

549
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,519
(Forget about it. I just hope I never cross paths with you again.)

550
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,960
I would've been okay with paying the laundry expense, but this?

551
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,960
The underwear is as much as 400 dollars?

552
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,070
Do I look like I'm trying to scam you for money?

553
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,229
Of course not.

554
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,968
I thought I had to check because it's a lot of money.

555
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:29,238
I'm sorry, but can you send me...

556
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,709
a photo of you wearing the outfit today...

557
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,610
or the wet clothes?

558
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,710
She's rude in a very polite way.

559
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,110
I'm sure you'll never do something like that,

560
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,380
but there are so many people who scam others like this.

561
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,289
I'd appreciate it if you could do it.

562
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,260
How can she treat me like a scammer?

563
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:10,449
Let's go, Sun...

564
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,619
- What are you doing? - What?

565
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:18,150
Right. What am I doing?

566
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,960
What? An article has been released.

567
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,300
They didn't even edit the photo nicely.

568
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,828
("Ryu Sun Jae Looks Like He's Modeling Even When He Falls")

569
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,239
When was this taken?

570
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,368
Forget about compensation.

571
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:37,469
File a lawsuit right now. Okay?

572
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,610
He isn't even replying.

573
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,710
Did my request to take a picture make him feel guilty?

574
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,919
I knew it.

575
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,250
He tried to take money from me but failed.

576
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,659
My goodness.

577
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:58,489
Hey, our baby is so cute, taking after me, right?

578
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,199
You have no conscience.

579
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,570
You're sleeping soundly.

580
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:07,698
(Place to Meet Babies)

581
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:10,269
I didn't know you became a father.

582
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,409
It's been a long time.

583
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,078
It's just that I thought you'd still want to become an actor...

584
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:17,348
if I hadn't been injured.

585
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,820
When you gain something, you lose something.

586
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,679
Happiness always comes with a cost.

587
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,329
He must be so happy, right?

588
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,828
- Sorry? - He was just a silly guy.

589
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,329
I didn't know he would become a superstar.

590
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:41,899
(Newborn Intensive Care Unit Donation Ceremony)

591
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,369
He donated as much as one million dollars?

592
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:44,969
He must have a lot of money, right?

593
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,110
You shouldn't have let him go back then.

594
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,678
What do you mean I shouldn't have let him go?

595
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:51,980
I should've been nice to him.

596
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,949
Then Sun Jae could've been the uncle of my children.

597
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,250
Gosh.

598
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,460
Baby, I'm sorry.

599
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,360
By the way, did you really stop contacting him after that incident?

600
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,300
"That incident?"

601
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,030
Why don't you visit him before it's too late?

602
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,070
He had a crush on you.

603
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:16,169
You never know.

604
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,239
Those old feelings might resurface if he sees you again.

605
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,539
Don't come.

606
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,579
You're making me feel burdened and uncomfortable.

607
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:27,849
So please...

608
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,389
stop liking me.

609
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,059
How dare I show my face and approach him first?

610
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,090
(Give your skin the gift of rest.)

611
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:49,730
(Skin pure)

612
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,500
Sun Jae, thank you for living.

613
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:57,969
I'm glad you're alive.

614
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,280
I'm overflowing with happiness.

615
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,010
I really mean it.

616
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,519
Everything is in the right place, but...

617
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,159
Sol.

618
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,630
I like you a lot.

619
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,099
I miss you.

620
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,149
Look at the camera now. Come on. Smile.

621
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,380
Come on. Try it.

622
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,739
Today is expected to be clear and sunny across the country.

623
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,768
Temperature during the daytime will reach up to 1°C,

624
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:03,570
going back to the average temperature.

625
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:06,379
The eastern regions, currently under a dry warning,

626
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,238
are expected to experience even drier conditions...

627
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,209
and slightly strong winds.

628
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,678
Small sparks can grow into larger fires.

629
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,919
So be cautious of wildfires and house fires...

630
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,150
- when using heating devices. - What is this?

631
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:28,730
Hello?

632
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,929
Yes. That's me.

633
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,340
Sorry?

634
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,340
Where is it again?

635
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:41,078
"I promise not to come within 100m..."

636
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,150
"of the victim, Ryu Sun Jae,"

637
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,550
"or his residence."

638
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,980
"If I break this promise..."

639
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,988
I'm not really the stalker.

640
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:55,689
You should've stayed still.

641
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,928
Why did you call him to apologize...

642
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,960
and push him into the fountain?

643
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Excuse me?

644
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,510
That was Sun Jae?

645
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,340
What's my problem?

646
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,209
My eyes are useless.

647
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,079
He was really going to sue you,

648
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,579
but he decided to give you the last chance.

649
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,590
Sign the document and finish it already.

650
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:24,989
All right.

651
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,719
(Im Sol)

652
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:33,759
By the way, regarding 100m,

653
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,259
is it a straight-line distance or a walking distance?

654
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,429
Come on.

655
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:38,869
Stop talking and sign it.

656
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,799
He was busy preparing for a concert that day,

657
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,170
yet he made time to go and ended up in an unpleasant situation.

658
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,038
If they acknowledge you had a malicious intent,

659
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,010
- you may be subject to... - Wait.

660
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,710
He was preparing for a concert?

661
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,980
He must've had a concert at the end of the year already.

662
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,789
(Eclipse concert)

663
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,789
(2023 Eclipse Full-Member Concert, "The 1st Encounter and...")

664
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,289
It was postponed?

665
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,428
(Enjoy the food and the concert!)

666
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,929
(Look at us only.)

667
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,500
(I love you, Ryu Sun Jae.)

668
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:20,710
Excuse me.

669
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,409
Excuse me.

670
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,150
I work for the production company for the film where Mr. Ryu appears.

671
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,379
I have an urgent business.

672
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,519
Can you let me in for a moment?

673
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:32,820
Do you have a ticket?

674
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:35,090
No, I don't.

675
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,059
You're not allowed to enter without a ticket.

676
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,530
Gosh.

677
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,400
Sorry? Where are you again?

678
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:49,340
I'm Sun Jae's friend.

679
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:51,368
I came to meet him and apologize in person.

680
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,110
There's something I should check too.

681
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,808
Can you please spare me some time?

682
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:58,409
Hey, you wrote a restraining agreement, didn't you?

683
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,480
I did, but...

684
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,280
Come on.

685
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,948
Don't you think it'll be more sincere...

686
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,989
to apologize in person, face to face?

687
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:08,719
Look at him on TV.

688
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,089
Please don't come within 100m of him as the agreement states.

689
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,559
Show your sincerity.

690
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,769
Can I talk with him while keeping a distance of 100m from him then?

691
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:18,768
Please.

692
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:21,900
Hello? Sorry, you can't.

693
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,110
Hello?

694
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,269
(Exchange and Customer Service)

695
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,739
What do I do?

696
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,809
My goodness.

697
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:33,519
Sun Jae, the woman from the production company is crazy.

698
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,519
She claimed she's your friend and begged me to let her meet you.

699
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,419
Should I just let her in?

700
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,960
Do you want to see her face...

701
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,190
- and tell her off? - Are you out of your mind?

702
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,459
Go out and say this to her.

703
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,760
We're filing a lawsuit against you tomorrow. Do you understand?

704
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,929
Just a moment.

705
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,099
Tell him my name at least then.

706
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,368
Im Sol. It's my name.

707
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,669
He'll remember if he hears it. It'll clear the misunderstandings.

708
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:59,840
So just please...

709
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,339
trust me and tell him. Okay?

710
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,448
Sure. I trust you. So go back...

711
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,420
and wait for the complaint.

712
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:09,320
Hey!

713
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:11,050
I'm begging you like this!

714
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,130
Sun Jae.

715
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:22,159
Sun Jae.

716
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,269
I guess he's on standby already.

717
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:29,539
My goodness.

718
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,460
It has started already.

719
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:23,530
I didn't want it to stop

720
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,630
On the day you first came to me

721
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:38,769
I didn't want you to be the rain that soaks me wet only momentarily

722
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,210
I've prayed so hard

723
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,549
Do you know how I feel?

724
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,988
I've dreamt of you every day

725
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:57,690
My heart is soaked in you again

726
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,828
You are a gift

727
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:06,268
From the sky

728
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:11,409
When you're all alone in this world, I'll protect you

729
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,050
They didn't say it was going to snow.

730
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,559
This is the first snow of the season.

731
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:30,019
Sun Jae must be thrilled.

732
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,210
The same thing happened that day.

733
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,079
No way. It's impossible.

734
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:57,590
It can't be.

735
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,599
- Thank you. - Thank you.

736
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:36,260
(Han River)

737
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,559
(Han River)

738
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,639
Don't come, Sun Jae.

739
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,349
You're the last person he met...

740
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,449
before he died last night.

741
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:02,619
Please don't come here.

742
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,519
(Han River)

743
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
He would've passed by already.

744
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,099
Did he just go?

745
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:25,409
It's a relief then.

746
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,050
Hello?

747
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,260
Hello?

748
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,489
This is me.

749
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:11,420
You can't come like this.

750
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,619
It's been a while.

751
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,530
Yes. It's been a while.

752
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:54,429
Yes.

753
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,840
Why are you standing here like this?

754
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:04,670
Is your car broken?

755
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,510
No.

756
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:11,610
I was waiting for you.

757
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:16,219
How did you know I would come here?

758
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,949
I thought you would come.

759
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,119
But I hoped you wouldn't come.

760
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,320
What if I didn't see you?

761
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:28,829
You haven't changed.

762
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,139
Shall we go somewhere and have a cup of tea?

763
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,340
Is it too late?

764
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,408
No, I'm fine.

765
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:42,579
Sun Jae.

766
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,480
I'm very sorry to interrupt you,

767
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,249
but everyone is calling me...

768
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,750
to ask why you aren't coming to the after-party.

769
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:53,219
- You should hurry up and go. - I can't let him go like this.

770
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:54,989
Just a second.

771
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,519
No, don't go.

772
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,329
You can't go.

773
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
What?

774
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,769
So what I want to say is...

775
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,969
Sun Jae.

776
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,800
Let's stay together tonight.

777
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:13,880
Let's spend the night together.

778
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,460
(Special thanks to Yoon Jin Young for his cameo appearance)

779
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,440
(Lovely Runner)

780
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:50,379
She told Sun Jae to spend the night together.

781
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,510
Where are we going?

782
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,149
A place where we can be alone together quietly.

783
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,420
I'm not going home tonight.

784
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:58,389
I'll be sleeping over. Don't worry.

785
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:00,590
What kind of person is that?

786
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:02,820
Okay. Let's say the fate has changed.

787
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:05,329
But how can you be sure the new life is better than the old one?

788
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,900
When I meet you again someday,

789
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,429
I wanted to tell you...

790
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:12,000
that I also liked you.

791
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:13,530
So what you're saying is...

792
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:16,739
you had the same feelings as me.

793
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,269
How about now?
