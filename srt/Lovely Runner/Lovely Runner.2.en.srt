(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,139
You should be polite.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,369
Hello.

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,199
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,539
It's raining.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,750
Hey.

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,829
Why are you crying, then?

12
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,059
I didn't make you cry.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,460
(Breaking News)

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,040
Why are you crying?

15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,909
Why do you always cry when you see me?

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,390
What did I say to make you cry?

17
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,759
Hey, I think he made her cry.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,419
Come on. It must be a lover's quarrel.

19
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,559
What's going on? What did he do wrong to make her cry like that?

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
What is it?

21
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:29,789
- Come this way for now. - Hey, it looks serious.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,930
Hey.

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,829
Sun Jae!

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,439
(Episode 2)

25
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,750
After all the things I said yesterday,

26
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,890
why am I crying without saying a word today?

27
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,479
So this is how you looked when you were 19.

28
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,090
Why is she staring at me like that?

29
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,360
- What are you? - What?

30
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,269
I'm a fan, sir. No.

31
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,329
I'm a fan of yours, Let's Kidnap Sun Jae and Run.

32
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,370
What?

33
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,110
That's my username in your fan community.

34
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,409
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,379
I know. What nonsense am I saying?

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,709
Sun Jae is an ordinary student now.

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,080
I can't do this.

38
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,250
My name is Sol. Im Sol.

39
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,620
I know.

40
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,120
How?

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,289
(Im Sol)

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,099
Why do you always cry when you see me?

43
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,900
You cried yesterday too.

44
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,969
Well, that's because...

45
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,969
you remind me of something.

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,209
Something I liked very much.

47
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,210
Something you liked?

48
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,080
A dog.

49
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,848
A dog? I look like a dog?

50
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,650
That's not it.

51
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,590
That dog was a great swimmer.

52
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,750
So you're saying...

53
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,119
I look like a dog that was a great swimmer?

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,189
That's what it is, I guess.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,830
How did you know about the game and come to the arena yesterday?

56
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,360
You knew my name as well.

57
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,330
Okay. Let's try to fix it.

58
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,039
It can't be difficult to convince a 19-year-old.

59
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,569
I'm a fan of swimming.

60
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,279
- A fan of swimming? - Yes.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
I told you. My dog was a great swimmer.

62
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,209
Naturally, I became a fan of swimming.

63
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,508
Watching the videos of swimming competitions,

64
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,119
I naturally learned about you, the ace of the swimming team.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,388
So naturally, I went there to cheer you on.

66
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,318
Watching you swimming,

67
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,959
my dog came to my mind naturally. And I got emotional.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,758
So naturally, I said I love you.

69
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,459
It doesn't sound natural at all.

70
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,800
Okay.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,910
Anyway, you were flustered a lot, right?

72
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,540
It's all because you remind me of my dog.

73
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,378
What's the name of the dog?

74
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,220
The name?

75
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,980
The name is...

76
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,148
- Otter. - You called your dog Otter?

77
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,360
They're good swimmers. Both otters and my Otter.

78
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,188
Why didn't you name your dog Seal then?

79
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,959
Oh, that's a great idea.

80
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,959
My goodness.

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,569
Take it.

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,870
Did you also give this to me because of Otter?

83
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,549
It's yours. Take it.

84
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,809
Oh, my gosh.

85
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,079
No, Sun Jae.

86
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,479
Let's live together.

87
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,388
Let's live together.

88
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,490
Darn it.

89
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,688
Oh, my gosh. I'll be running late.

90
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,258
I'll get going first. I'm sorry.

91
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,799
What? Hey, where are you going?

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,899
My goodness.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,639
Hey!

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,110
I should've not opened my mouth. He'd think I'm weird.

95
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,508
Why did I bring this?

96
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,980
He'll get rained on.

97
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,209
I'm so dumb.

98
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,779
What? This is my classroom.

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,459
Thinking it was a dream, I didn't take a good look at it yesterday.

100
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,060
- Hey. - That's what he said.

101
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,899
- Here. - Give it to me.

102
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,669
- Don't hide it. - This is...

103
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,470
- Seriously. - Hey.

104
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,740
I haven't seen them for a long time.

105
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,079
Have you guys been doing well?

106
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,979
Oh, my. Hi.

107
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,688
Da Hye. Bo Rim.

108
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,289
It's been such a long time.

109
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,959
Young Sun, I remember you were an excellent student.

110
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,360
What was your name?

111
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,089
Oh, right. Kim Eun Ju.

112
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,230
You cuties.

113
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,259
Hi.

114
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Sol, what was it yesterday?

115
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,870
Hyun Ju.

116
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,669
I'm so happy to see you! Oh, my gosh.

117
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,938
Where did you go, skipping school?

118
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,839
You weren't there when I went to your house to give your bag to you.

119
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,378
Oh, my gosh. Your skin is amazing.

120
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,849
You were so sad about your freckles, girl.

121
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,279
Be honest with me. Something happened yesterday morning, right?

122
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,519
What?

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,518
I can't remember because I wasn't myself yesterday morning.

124
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,619
What did he say to make you lose your mind...

125
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,289
and skip school, which you've never done before?

126
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,490
Yesterday? He?

127
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,128
- Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning, ma'am.

128
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,500
Oh, my gosh. Ma'am!

129
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,469
Ms. Kwon.

130
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,239
I tried to let out this place a long time ago,

131
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,768
but there's still no tenant.

132
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,938
Are you even trying?

133
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,008
Don't let it out. Just sell it...

134
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,480
and buy an apartment in Pangyo.

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,049
When the subway opens, the price will skyrocket.

136
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,250
Pangyo, the empty plain next to Bundang?

137
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,290
The price surely increased dramatically.

138
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,289
The price of apartments in Seoul will decrease only.

139
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,319
Why would I buy an apartment in Pangyo?

140
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,160
"Basic Instincts."

141
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
(Overdue)

142
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:37,800
It's been overdue for as long as a month.

143
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,100
Who on earth is it?

144
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,730
(Ryu Geun Duk)

145
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,638
This is Gold Videos.

146
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,198
Please return the tape.

147
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,438
I haven't rented anything.

148
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,809
I'm calling you because you did.

149
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,809
You rented "Basic Instincts."

150
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,750
My gosh. I didn't rent it.

151
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,078
And who watches a VHS tape these days?

152
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,750
We don't even watch DVDs that much anymore.

153
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:03,420
What did you say?

154
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,859
Your family might've rented it.

155
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,060
Please check it.

156
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,028
Please return it quickly.

157
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,800
The overdue fine is 15 dollars.

158
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,768
This guy is funny.

159
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,669
He was embarrassed about renting a R-rated movie.

160
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,768
So he pretended not to know about it.

161
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,300
I guess he watched it until the tape was stretched.

162
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,878
The Great Wisdom Heart Sutra

163
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,109
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva

164
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,909
- He came to receive offerings. - When practicing deeply

165
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,350
- The Prajna Paramita - We're Christians.

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,889
- Amen. - Hallelujah.

167
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,720
Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.

168
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm the bodhisattva.

169
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,528
I'm the bodhisattva who is living with you.

170
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,570
Come on!

171
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,899
- Mom. - Are you Geum?

172
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,370
You completely fooled me.

173
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,268
What is it called? Oh, right. Mammoth acting.

174
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,538
It was perfect.

175
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,439
Right? I'm a good actor, right?

176
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,610
What do you mean you're good?

177
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,148
What kind of audition is it this time?

178
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,350
Why do you always make a scene? You can't become an actor.

179
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,648
Mom, you never know.

180
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,689
Who knows? I might step on the red carpet at Cannes Film Festival.

181
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,190
All the things you say make me want to step on you.

182
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,330
Get out.

183
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,558
You could go there as my family too!

184
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,960
Cannes Film Festival, my foot.

185
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,469
If you draw a graph based on these conditions, it looks like this.

186
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,628
Take a look.

187
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,740
Time isn't passing.

188
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,210
Yes. I think I traveled to the past when I pressed this button.

189
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,940
Is this like a time machine?

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I might be able to go back if I press the button again.

191
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,190
No. What if I go back and can't come back?

192
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,888
I should never press it.

193
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,490
Number 15. Come out and solve it.

194
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,200
Hey. You're number 15.

195
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,200
Nothing has changed.

196
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,139
- Im Sol. - Yes?

197
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,710
- Come out. - Yes, ma'am.

198
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,139
That was close.

199
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,480
This is a bigger problem.

200
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,809
I blame the passage of time.

201
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,049
How can I not remember anything?

202
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,518
What's the matter? Are you sick?

203
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,789
Yes. I have cramps.

204
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,758
I have bad cramps during my period.

205
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,859
Go to the infirmary.

206
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,759
Okay. I'm sorry.

207
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,399
Oh, my gosh. My back hurts.

208
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,970
Her period ended last week.

209
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,779
(Jagam High School)

210
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,450
Where is my Sun Jae?

211
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,419
Oh, he's over there.

212
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,190
It's nice that I can watch him easily when I want to.

213
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,798
Hey, the competition is around the corner.

214
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,829
- What is this? - You got this!

215
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,070
- You got this! - You got this!

216
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,129
We got this!

217
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,539
I'll protect you by your side from now on.

218
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,980
So that you will never have bad thoughts.

219
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,080
I should stick to him for 15 years then.

220
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,750
How can I get close to him?

221
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,490
Why does it smell like cigarettes?

222
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,629
What?

223
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,609
Don't do it. Seriously.

224
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,119
Those punks are smoking here of all places.

225
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,549
The smoke is entering the gym.

226
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:54,889
Those delinquent kids.

227
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,429
Are you smiling?

228
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,330
I should just...

229
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Darn it.

230
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,299
You're dead!

231
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,480
- Darn it. - You punks!

232
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,090
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

233
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,190
My goodness.

234
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,399
Darn it.

235
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,729
You crazy witch! How dare you!

236
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,330
How dare you!

237
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,470
"Witch?"

238
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,539
How dare you say that to a woman older than you?

239
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,409
You're fighting and smoking in someone else's school.

240
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,979
The gym is near here.

241
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,809
Do you know how bad secondhand smoke is for the swimmers' lungs?

242
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,048
You try so hard to look cool.

243
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,409
I'm confiscating this. Go now.

244
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,819
I told you to go. Are you not going?

245
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,720
Hey. What?

246
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,250
Excuse me, ma'am. I think we should run.

247
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,559
What? Hey!

248
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,419
Kids these days are scary.

249
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,730
No. Are they kids in the past?

250
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,500
Did you take a year off?

251
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,429
I took 15 years off.

252
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,740
I confiscated it and you took it?

253
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,539
Give it to me.

254
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,808
You don't look like you're older than me.

255
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:57,879
Give it to me.

256
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,580
What?

257
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,120
- I saw you somewhere. - You...

258
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,320
(September 2007, Jagam High School festival)

259
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,419
I love you.

260
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,629
Yes. I remember.

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,929
The first artist I became a fan of and my favorite in the past.

262
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,370
What was your name?

263
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,610
(Kim Tae Sung)

264
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,678
Oh, right. Kim Tae Sung.

265
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,548
Oh, my goodness. It's so nice to see you.

266
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,049
- How long has it been? - What?

267
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,719
- Yesterday, you... - I used to chase after you...

268
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,149
like crazy.

269
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,619
You looked so cool back then.

270
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,590
But looking at you now, you look tacky.

271
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:46,919
So it's you.

272
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,330
Why are you so different from yesterday?

273
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:50,658
Do you have multiple personalities?

274
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,759
Oh, my.

275
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,628
I didn't know because I was blinded by love back then.

276
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,769
But you're a delinquent kid.

277
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,100
Smoking cigarettes and stuff.

278
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,969
Get it together.

279
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,110
- Smoking is nothing but bad. - Okay, ma'am.

280
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,240
I'll give this to you too.

281
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,779
Good luck with running away by yourself this time. Okay?

282
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,049
- What? - I got you guys!

283
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,529
You skipped class.

284
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,158
What are these? Did you smoke?

285
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,200
Pardon?

286
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,299
No. These are not mine.

287
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,799
That punk!

288
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,980
I only taught delinquent students a lesson.

289
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,308
I plucked up my courage to keep the lungs of the athletes healthy...

290
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,479
and prevent secondhand smoke.

291
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,720
This is unfair.

292
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,449
So a girl came to a boys' high school...

293
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,120
and taught other students a lesson?

294
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,059
How dare you lie to me!

295
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,789
I should just...

296
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,158
I wasn't punished even when I was a high school student.

297
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,860
But I'm receiving a punishment when I'm over 30.

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,100
Oh, no. Please pass by.

299
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,639
Straighten your posture.

300
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,839
- Please. - Hey.

301
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,479
Just go quickly.

302
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,710
Please go.

303
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,210
Peekaboo.

304
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Where do you think you're joking around?

305
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,250
Stay like this until the bell rings.

306
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,658
I'll be watching you through the security camera.

307
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,419
Don't even try to slack. Got it?

308
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,740
Otter...

309
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,070
will be so sad.

310
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,409
What?

311
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,779
Seeing its owner living recklessly.

312
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,309
Quit smoking.

313
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,350
No.

314
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,719
I don't even burn mosquito repellents in summer,

315
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,120
let alone smoke.

316
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,149
I do drink a little when I'm having a hard time, but I don't...

317
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,730
Sun Jae. I don't smoke.

318
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,858
I was a model student.

319
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,299
- For real. - Oh, right.

320
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,240
That camera is fake, not real. So you can just go.

321
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,410
Wait. Not before I clear the misunderstandings.

322
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,240
Sun Jae.

323
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,250
(Quit Smoking.)

324
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,028
I told you to run away. Why did you follow him and receive a punishment?

325
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,729
Did you wait for me to make me angry?

326
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,159
I waited for you to get my lighter back.

327
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,230
I threw it away.

328
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,869
You're so disloyal.

329
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,199
I saved you from the bullies.

330
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,269
And you ran away by yourself?

331
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,839
- Were you trying to save me? - Yes.

332
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,868
I ran away with you as you were coming at him,

333
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,940
and I was worried you might get hit.

334
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,440
Oh, I got it.

335
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,649
I guess you wanted my attention.

336
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,680
What?

337
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,079
I didn't know you were this kind of guy.

338
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,679
You're unbelievably annoying.

339
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,849
Thanks for the compliment.

340
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
But hey,

341
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,930
don't step forward and think about your own safety from now on.

342
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,359
Or you'll get hurt badly.

343
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,799
Why did I like someone like him when I was younger?

344
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,140
Tae Sung!

345
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,309
Gosh, she's bothering me again.

346
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,210
Hey! Tae Sung!

347
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,759
Hey. Get out of my way.

348
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,029
That was so rude!

349
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,799
Hey. What did you just say?

350
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,979
Hey, look down.

351
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,049
Oh, my gosh. Look at you.

352
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,019
Look down.

353
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,099
Let's think about my own safety. Or I'll get hurt badly.

354
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,029
Don't you dare come near Tae Sung again.

355
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:28,609
Let's go.

356
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,339
Gosh.

357
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,779
The kids in the past are scary.

358
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,660
I got a new key ring for my phone. Isn't it cute?

359
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,359
Gosh, you're cuter.

360
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,829
Hyun Ju, I can walk again.

361
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,269
You would've been so happy if you had seen me walking.

362
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,768
Do you want to get a bread refill?

363
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,740
No. Hold back. Your uniform will burst.

364
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,980
You'll lose weight when you're older. Just eat.

365
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,709
No. I'm going to hold back.

366
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,950
Oh, right.

367
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,809
I must get close to someone. What should I do?

368
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,819
It's been too long since I got close to someone and opened up my heart.

369
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,420
So I don't know how.

370
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,160
First of all, the first impression is important.

371
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,390
The first impression?

372
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,430
- Mom. - No.

373
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,960
Let's live together.

374
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,799
Let's try living together.

375
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,969
It was the worst.

376
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,700
The second impression better be good, then.

377
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:34,568
Quit smoking.

378
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,008
- It was even worse. - Give it up, then.

379
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,140
No!

380
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,710
Then don't approach the person hastily.

381
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,079
Ask the person to be your Ilchon.

382
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,480
What? Ilchon?

383
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,819
Is this person a guy?

384
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,890
You've moved on to another guy already?

385
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,929
I thought you were gloomy because you got rejected...

386
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,390
when you asked Tae Sung out yesterday.

387
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,400
What?

388
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,129
I've had a crush on you since I saw you perform...

389
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,970
in the school festival last year.

390
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,940
This is... my gift to you.

391
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,779
Hey, Tae Sung.

392
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,450
You.

393
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:19,880
Who the heck are you?

394
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,119
Gosh.

395
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,650
Look at her.

396
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,190
I won't let you get away next time!

397
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,029
That little piece of rat ran away again.

398
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,130
Hyun Ju, did I ask Tae Sung out yesterday?

399
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,528
I wondered why the stars were missing from the night sky.

400
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,200
I guess they were in your eyes.

401
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,169
No wonder why I couldn't see you straight.

402
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,569
It was because you were so bright.

403
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,279
Tae Sung, you are my star.

404
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,579
A big star.

405
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,549
Did it have to be yesterday?

406
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,380
I should have come a day earlier.

407
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,250
This is embarrassing.

408
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,259
Why were the stars missing from the night sky?

409
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:00,459
They were in your eyes.

410
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,589
What is it?

411
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,059
When did you get in here?

412
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,599
Give it back to me!

413
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,900
When did you unbox it?

414
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,069
Give it to me.

415
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,670
Get out.

416
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,109
- Get out already! - Hey.

417
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,180
Hey.

418
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,250
I almost had them.

419
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,358
Then don't approach the person hastily.

420
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,730
Ask the person to be your Ilchon.

421
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,049
(Im Sol wants to be Ilchon to Ryu Sun Jae.)

422
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,429
He was crazy about swimming at this time.

423
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,559
(A new message has arrived.)

424
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,769
(From. Sun Jae)

425
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,739
(Ryu Sun Jae has declined to be your Ilchon.)

426
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,900
(Don't be upset and find other precious friends.)

427
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:29,509
(Declining the offer to be Ilchon)

428
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,430
It feels like we are getting further away.

429
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,500
He refused to be my Ilchon.

430
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:53,970
Let me help you.

431
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:56,869
- Here. - Thank you.

432
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:12,660
Please wait!

433
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,710
We use the same bus stop to take the bus.

434
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,509
Have we ever taken the same bus before?

435
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,910
Have you seen me before?

436
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,480
Even if I have, I haven't seen you.

437
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,750
Have you seen me or not?

438
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,649
Do you always ride the bus at this hour?

439
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,150
I usually go to school earlier.

440
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,018
I don't have early morning practice because the competition is near.

441
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,059
That's why I'm going to school now.

442
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,259
I should ride the bus when he rides it from now...

443
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:51,700
to be close to him.

444
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,199
Do you have a competition soon? What kind of a competition?

445
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,298
If I tell you,

446
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,429
are you going to come running again?

447
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,470
Well...

448
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,509
Get off.

449
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,779
- We're here. - Yes.

450
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,778
- Hey. - Don't push.

451
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,480
- Excuse me. - Come on!

452
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,419
- I'm getting off. - Gosh.

453
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,180
Excuse me.

454
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,149
- I'm getting off. - Excuse me.

455
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,489
- Excuse me. I'm getting off. - Please wait.

456
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,190
- Excuse me. - Please wait.

457
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,259
Hey. I have to get off.

458
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,859
- It's because of you. - He's so hot.

459
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,000
- It's your fault. - Sir.

460
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,400
Sir!

461
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,299
I couldn't get off.

462
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,279
Sir, please stop.

463
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
Stop.

464
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:19,279
He's awesome.

465
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,779
Sun Jae.

466
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,349
Sun Jae, are you all right?

467
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,459
Hey.

468
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,829
You have to keep it together. How could you not get off?

469
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,859
Still, thank you.

470
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,400
I didn't do it for you.

471
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,569
I stopped the bus to take my umbrella back.

472
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,240
Right. I was going to give it to you.

473
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,680
Still, don't do that next time because it's dangerous.

474
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,579
Who tries to beat the bus by running?

475
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,109
You're an athlete.

476
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,309
You have to be careful and always play it safe.

477
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,919
If someone with my umbrella did get off the bus,

478
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,049
I would have played it safe.

479
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,519
Gosh. Is this what he was like when he was younger?

480
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,259
You are constantly talking back.

481
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,029
Your father must have a headache because of you.

482
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,430
Look who's talking.

483
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,930
Quit smoking.

484
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,569
How did I fall in...

485
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,568
Is that why...

486
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:13,769
you declined my request to be your Ilchon?

487
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,440
Why? Do you feel guilty?

488
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,940
I said I was innocent.

489
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,579
Here. Do you want to smell them?

490
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:22,279
The fingers of a smoker smell like cigarettes.

491
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Smell them.

492
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,879
See?

493
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,049
They don't smell, do they?

494
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,630
You're right. They don't smell.

495
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,470
(Humiliation)

496
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,970
Why did you crawl into his nose?

497
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,679
Hey.

498
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,809
That's not a nose. That's an outlet.

499
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,250
Who was he talking to?

500
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,778
It's a 220-volt outlet.

501
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,119
Come on. Stop bothering me.

502
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,220
I thought you said there was nothing between you two.

503
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,460
But you come to the school together.

504
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:09,788
I just got my umbrella back.

505
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,130
Right. Your umbrella.

506
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,200
Right. I remembered where I saw her.

507
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,730
It was in our practice room.

508
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,528
She has a crush on Kim Tae Sung.

509
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,640
She came and left chocolates for him secretly.

510
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,740
No wonder she looked familiar.

511
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,109
Who is this Kim Tae Sung?

512
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,180
He is the bassist of our band.

513
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,910
He is known as the best-looking guy on the internet.

514
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:29,680
Don't you know him?

515
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:30,910
I don't know him.

516
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,920
- Why? - What?

517
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,250
Why are you getting angry?

518
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,349
I didn't get angry.

519
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:44,859
- Isn't it amazing? - I mean...

520
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,329
Come on down.

521
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,670
That was what I wanted to do.

522
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,170
(Jagam High School's bulletin board)

523
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,539
(The 27th Presidential Cup Swimming Tournament)

524
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,150
It was the first competition after my shoulder surgery.

525
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,180
That competition...

526
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,720
ended up being my last one.

527
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,420
Was it this tournament?

528
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,420
Cool! Check the menu.

529
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,819
Will you stop...

530
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,258
Sun Jae, can I talk to you for a second?

531
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,599
Hey, use what I taught you yesterday.

532
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,900
I have the training to do right now.

533
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,670
Sun Jae.

534
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,839
(Jagam High School)

535
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,109
Sun Jae.

536
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,279
You can't participate in the competition this time.

537
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,578
- Why not? - If you do,

538
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:38,650
you'll get injured again.

539
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,450
You won't be able to swim again.

540
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,890
So,

541
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,690
you shouldn't enter the competition.

542
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:48,960
Why not?

543
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,160
Didn't you hear what I just said?

544
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,729
What did you say?

545
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,630
You'll hurt your shoulder.

546
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,000
This tournament will be your last.

547
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,739
What is this? A superpower?

548
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,980
If you have nothing to say, I'll get going.

549
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,210
Sun Jae, take a look at this.

550
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,880
Wait a second.

551
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,549
If you enter this competition, your athletic career will be over.

552
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,049
Take a look at this for a second.

553
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,660
What am I supposed to look at?

554
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,910
(Study hall)

555
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,079
Does the time stop when I talk about an event in the future?

556
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,500
Obama becomes the president of the United States.

557
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,970
What? That was scary.

558
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:16,210
How did you feel after you quit swimming?

559
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,619
I regretted, wondering if I had pushed...

560
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,079
myself too far.

561
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,250
Perhaps, it happened because I was destined...

562
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,589
to be a singer.

563
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,930
If you didn't quit swimming,

564
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,960
you...

565
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,730
would still be alive.

(Jagam High School)

567
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,618
You just went a little over 1 minute 50 seconds.

568
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,229
Are you finally going to reach 1 minute and 49-second range?

569
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,230
- Yes. - That'll be a new record!

570
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,730
Hyung Gu. Aren't you going to focus?

571
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,799
Gosh.

572
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,470
Yes. Be careful.

573
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,910
Sun Jae. What's wrong?

574
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,109
It's nothing.

575
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,180
Right. Okay.

576
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,319
(Jagam High School)

577
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,660
I heard you'll compete in two events.

578
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,160
I just found out about it.

579
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,369
Why are you competing when you just got surgery?

580
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,670
Because I can.

581
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,170
Don't push yourself too hard.

582
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
If you mess up your shoulder again,

583
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,809
you won't be able to lift a spoon for the rest of your life.

584
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,740
Why? Are you nervous...

585
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,180
you'd get no medals if I make a comeback?

586
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,109
Mind your own business.

(Jagam High School)

588
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,828
No. It was how you behaved.

589
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:12,059
Stop talking nonsense.

590
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,098
She's here again. Are you here for Sun Jae?

591
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:15,469
He will come out soon.

592
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,769
He is right back there.

593
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,740
- My goodness! - She'll ask him out.

594
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,970
- Hey, Sun Jae. - I think she'll ask him out.

595
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,639
Sun Jae, I know I'm crossing the line.

596
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,749
Yes, you are.

597
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,179
They say, "Take a step back to make a leap."

598
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,379
If I take two steps forward, I'll leap further, won't I?

599
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,749
Check the condition of your shoulder first.

600
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,219
They say, "Look before you leap."

601
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,159
I don't need to. I just need to swim.

602
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,259
You think you're in a good condition, right?

603
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,730
But that's not the case.

604
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
- Are you going to be all right? - What?

605
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,170
- Hey! - Yes!

606
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,470
You can keep following me if it's all right.

607
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,450
He's so stubborn.

608
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,519
I don't think I can talk him out of it. What should I do?

609
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,119
Sir,

610
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,059
are you acting like this over a small late fee?

611
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:19,360
The small late fee doesn't matter.

612
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,198
It can be that you make a mistake.

613
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,539
I checked everything through and through.

614
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,138
There's no member with a name similar to yours.

615
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,138
So, I just can't make a mistake.

616
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,010
Gosh. What a weird lady!

617
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,408
If I say it's not the case, it's not the case.

618
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,849
Did you call me a weird lady?

619
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,249
For goodness' sake!

620
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,848
Are you doing this because you are embarrassed...

621
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,178
about watching a naughty movie?

622
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,920
What? Am I embarrassed?

623
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,919
I'm old enough.

624
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,690
If I wanted to rent it, I would have rented it confidently.

625
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,730
Was it "Basic Instincts?"

626
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,158
I already watched it with my wife...

627
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,900
in a theater a long time ago.

628
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,669
Hey. Detective Lee. Treat him nicely.

629
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,138
Your statement is...

630
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,840
Gosh.

631
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:05,579
My goodness. You got into a fight...

632
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,138
because they spat on your bike?

633
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,849
Aren't you going to swing your fist if one spits on your child?

634
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,179
Who gave birth to your bike?

635
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,179
My heart did.

636
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,019
I see.

637
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,888
Is it maternal love or paternal love?

638
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:21,589
Also, they started the fight first.

639
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,229
- Aren't you going to shut it? - You started it.

640
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,058
- You started it first. - Sit down. Gosh.

641
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,760
My goodness.

642
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:31,170
Wait. Hello, sir.

643
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,539
What brought you here, Lieutenant Kim?

644
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,639
Do you still fight around like this?

645
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:41,780
I can go since my legal guardian is here, right?

646
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,119
Hey, Kim Tae Sung!

647
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,519
Is he your son?

648
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:01,000
Dad, it went well again today.

649
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm on my way home after the training.

650
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

651
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,340
Hey, kid.

652
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,469
Make a donation to Grandma Celestial.

653
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,340
I see. Okay.

654
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,949
Thank you.

655
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,590
It's nothing.

656
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,960
You were born in late October when the first frost falls.

657
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,659
I see the energy of a ghost around you.

658
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,360
The ghost's door is bolted.

659
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,799
- You have a door for a ghost. - Pardon?

660
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,399
You're not feeling well physically, right?

661
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,610
Doesn't your shoulder feel heavy?

662
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,539
Water ghost!

663
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,979
A ghost of an unmarried woman who unfairly died in the water...

664
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,449
is stuck to you.

665
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,710
A ghost?

666
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,518
She is looking for a bachelor to take...

667
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,980
to the underworld after passing the 49th day.

668
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,118
Stay away from water for a while.

669
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,889
Just for three days.

670
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,090
The day after tomorrow is the 49th day after her death.

671
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,899
I'm a swimmer, and I have a tournament tomorrow.

672
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,928
Forget about the tournament. It's not important.

673
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,169
Is it more important than your life?

674
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,569
Unless you want to cross the Sanzu Bridge in the afterlife,

675
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,139
don't even dip your feet in the water!

676
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,940
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

677
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,440
Are you going to keep that in mind? How can I trust you?

678
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I won't even take a shower. Okay?

679
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,210
Thanks for telling me.

680
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,150
I don't think he's buying it.

681
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,420
Kid. You have a mole below your collarbone, right?

682
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:37,230
Well, 3 out of 10 people have moles there.

683
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,369
She tells me you have a scar on your left sole.

684
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,570
- Did you see it? - She saw it.

685
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,940
That lady.

686
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,050
What?

687
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
I don't see her.

688
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,690
Gosh.

689
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,920
You are sensitive about jinxes.

690
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,960
Please trust me.

691
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,159
What?

692
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,260
No.

693
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,440
What?

694
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,780
Were you on a spiritual training?

695
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,139
You had a fistfight.

696
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,550
Okay. Will you give my dollar back?

697
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,150
If I give it back,

698
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,989
are you going to read my fortune? How is my love life?

699
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,960
You are destined to be beaten up.

700
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,730
I thought you liked me.

701
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,530
Did you read the letter?

702
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,699
There aren't many stars in the sky tonight.

703
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,170
Are they all in my eyes?

704
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,269
- Am I being so bright? - Stop it!

705
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,539
You read it so thoroughly.

706
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,948
Was he in a group fight with students from the adjacent school?

707
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,719
Anyway, it was a huge scandal.

708
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:10,949
He could've gotten expelled,

709
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,590
but they just let him withdraw from school.

710
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,960
Wait here for a second.

711
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,000
(Nuriro)

712
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,269
Okay. Give me your hand.

713
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,039
Be gentle.

714
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,079
Don't leave a scar on my pretty hand.

715
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,178
He's such a ladies' man.

716
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:38,050
He discretely makes eyes at me.

717
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,280
Gosh. This is why girls were crazy about him.

718
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,760
Why do you fight all the time?

719
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,420
Do you want to get expelled?

720
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,059
You should graduate high school, at least.

721
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,328
You're going to regret it terribly later.

722
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,760
Are you my mom or what? Stop nitpicking.

723
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,629
Exactly. Your parents must be worried sick.

724
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,739
Because you even look pathetic in my eyes.

725
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,809
I don't think they care.

726
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,940
I thought so in the past too.

727
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:09,809
But I was wrong.

728
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,119
If children get sick, their parents feel...

729
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:22,320
as if their ten fingers are pulled out.

730
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,730
A child's cry sounds like thunder to them.

731
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,329
That's what my mom told me.

732
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,440
So, in order not to break your parents' hearts,

733
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,010
don't get injured or get sick. Got it?

734
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,280
Not all parents are like that.

735
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,420
Well, that's true.

736
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,750
But you'll somewhat understand this once you become an adult.

737
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,559
Okay. All good. Right?

738
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,159
Give back my money now.

739
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,429
Here.

740
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,579
My favorite star has once touched this bill.

741
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:25,050
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,519
I'll change it to another bill. Okay?

743
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,889
Seriously. That face of yours is asking to be scolded.

744
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,260
Forget it!

745
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,969
I told you I would change it to another bill.

746
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,030
Hey, wait.

747
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,599
I'll change it.

748
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Here.

749
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,570
I'll be generous.

750
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:46,980
I'll change it to a five-dollar bill.

751
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,479
- Are we good now? - Forget it. Just go home.

752
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,909
Go away.

753
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,679
- Darn it. - What's going on?

754
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,320
"Grandma?"

755
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,960
Goodness, young man. Funny running into you here again.

756
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,158
You're a granny?

757
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,670
This is crazy.

758
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,269
You're Ryu Sun Jae, right?

759
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,739
A friend of In Hyuk. The swimmer.

760
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,110
Who are you?

761
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,510
I'm Kim Tae Sung.

762
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:21,880
She has a crush on Kim Tae Sung.

763
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,980
She came and left chocolates for him secretly.

764
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,919
Always be wary of water.

765
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,889
I'll get going now.

766
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,190
What are you doing?

767
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,260
What are you trying to pull in that outfit this time?

768
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,559
Grandma, I think you've been exposed.

769
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,329
Darn it. What do I do?

770
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,739
Are you making fun of me?

771
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,469
Is this funny to you?

772
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,210
I'm not making fun of you.

773
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,839
Sun Jae. Please hear me out. I can really see ghosts.

774
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,380
You really have to be careful around water!

775
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,879
I'm telling the truth!

776
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,150
You really have to be careful, Sun Jae! Please!

777
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,190
What?

778
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,730
(Ryu Geun Duk)

779
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,960
This is Sun Jae's house?

780
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,360
Grandma.

781
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,929
Can you really see ghosts?

782
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:22,500
Mom!

783
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,639
- Mom. - You startled me.

784
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,279
When did Mr. Bae move out? The guy from the blue-gated house?

785
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,149
What's up with your outfit? Are you in a circus show?

786
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,308
Mr. Bae moved out in spring.

787
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,079
Another family moved in. Did you not know that?

788
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:35,719
No, I didn't.

789
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,849
How could I have missed that?

790
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:47,729
One,

791
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,759
two,

792
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,799
three,

793
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,868
four,

794
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:51,968
five,

795
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:52,969
six,

796
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,069
seven,

797
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,169
eight,

798
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,209
nine,

799
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,210
ten,

800
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,210
eleven,

801
00:43:58,211 --> 00:43:59,268
twelve,

802
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,279
thirteen,

803
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
fourteen,

804
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
fifteen,

805
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:03,308
sixteen,

806
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,309
seventeen,

807
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,309
eighteen,

808
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,319
nineteen...

809
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,849
You can't participate in the competition this time.

810
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,489
Darn it.

811
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,369
He won't believe anything I say now. What do I do?

812
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,519
Where's he going at this hour?

813
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,599
Check the condition of your shoulder first.

814
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,010
They say, "Look before you leap."

815
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,340
You think you're in a good condition, right?

816
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,179
But that's not the case.

817
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,879
Don't push yourself too hard.

818
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,849
If you mess up your shoulder again,

819
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,119
you won't be able to lift a spoon for the rest of your life.

820
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,529
I knew it. I'm so proud of you, my son.

821
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,670
I knew this was a piece of cake for you.

822
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:04,900
Water ghost!

823
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,268
A ghost of an unmarried woman who unfairly died in the water...

824
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:08,768
is stuck to you.

825
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:09,968
I can really see ghosts.

826
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:11,409
You really have to be careful around water!

827
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:14,280
I'm telling the truth! You really have to be careful.

828
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,510
I

829
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,679
I am

830
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,179
I am

831
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,268
This jerk believes in this superstition...

832
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:38,269
that he must wear the same swim pants...

833
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,769
he wore the day before in order to win a medal.

834
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,769
That's why...

835
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,369
he always practices the day before in the same swim pants.

836
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,710
So what do you want to do?

837
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,809
He'll be so flustered when he sees that it's gone.

838
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,579
Hey, what if he finds out?

839
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,919
No one will know as long as you keep your mouth shut.

840
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,050
Are you scared?

841
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,730
Do you want me to snap your wrist?

842
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,329
Let go.

843
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,800
What are you doing? Let go of me.

844
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,899
Should I tell everyone on your swimming team?

845
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,139
Or should I call the police?

846
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,239
Leave the swim pants, and walk away quietly.

847
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,909
Come on. Get your hands off it.

848
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,638
Who's there? Hey!

849
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:21,909
- Who is it? - Darn it. Let's run away.

850
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:51,969
- What do I do? - What was that?

851
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,380
Why is the light off?

852
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,889
My legs are falling asleep.

853
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:14,300
What?

854
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:31,849
Who are you?

855
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:40,559
(Advance into the water!)

856
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,380
What? It was you?

857
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:10,190
You stole my swim pants? How could you stoop this low?

858
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,789
- No. I didn't steal them. - What is it?

859
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:14,719
What is your excuse this time?

860
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,329
Are you going to say a ghost stole them?

861
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,729
Why are you doing this to me?

862
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,159
I did it because I was worried.

863
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,369
I don't know how to explain this.

864
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,669
Yes, a dream.

865
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,940
I had a bad dream.

866
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,308
In my dream, you were badly injured at the competition.

867
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,739
It was so vivid as if it were real.

868
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,379
I got the feeling that it would happen in real life.

869
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,509
So I was nervous and worried.

870
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,780
Why are you worried about me?

871
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,218
Because I want to protect you!

872
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:41,280
Why?

873
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,750
Why do you want to protect me?

874
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,149
It's not like I'm going to die.

875
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,419
Yes. That's right. You'll die.

876
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,860
You're going to die.

877
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,730
I'm the only one in the world who knows that.

878
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:51,730
But I can't even tell you that.

879
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,630
Despite that, I still want to protect you.

880
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,400
I'm doing everything I can to save you.

881
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,300
Why can't you say anything?

882
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,639
Do you think all these behaviors of yours are normal?

883
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,110
Don't you think this is weird?

884
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,908
We were strangers before.

885
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:10,909
But you came to me and said you were my fan.

886
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,150
Then all of a sudden, you don't want me to compete?

887
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,219
Just because you had a bad dream?

888
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,949
Who do you think you are?

889
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,349
Why must I do what you say?

890
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:45,079
My son, I brought dumplings.

891
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,519
He's supposed to leave early in the morning. Where did he go?

892
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,289
Goodness.

893
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,828
These dumplings are tasty when they're eaten warm.

894
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:59,229
Goodness. He'll eat them when he gets hungry.

895
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,530
Boys at his age can even chew on rocks.

896
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,599
What's that?

897
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:10,670
What is that?

898
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,880
What is that?

899
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:24,920
What on earth...

900
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,559
("Basic Instincts")

901
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:41,940
- What is it? - You were at the pool, right?

902
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,070
- Did you run into Hyung Gu? - What?

903
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,179
That jerk wanted to mess with you, so he went to the swimming pool.

904
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,939
You guys didn't fight, right?

905
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,209
That jerk was at the pool?

906
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,609
Yes. He wanted to steal your swim pants.

907
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,650
- Gosh. Seriously. - Nothing happened, right?

908
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,420
Goodness. Don't you think that jerk is crossing the line?

909
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,360
Hello?

910
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,460
Are you there, Sun Jae?

911
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,250
Why can't you say anything?

912
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,250
Do you think all these behaviors of yours are normal?

913
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,349
He's right. I'm not acting like a normal person.

914
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,820
I don't even know what I'm doing right now.

915
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:52,110
One,

916
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,780
two,

917
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,409
three,

918
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,610
four,

919
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,349
five...

920
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,929
Hey, Sol!

921
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,349
Are you crazy?

922
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:05,010
Why didn't you step away? Why did you stand there?

923
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,750
Thirty-four dash one.

924
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:42,320
It got delivered to the wrong house.

925
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:43,789
(34-1, Nuri-dong)

926
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:48,489
Sir!

927
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,920
This package is for me, right?

928
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:24,929
It is mine.

929
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,030
You should take this umbrella, sir.

930
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,329
Come on. Take it now.

931
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,038
Just take it with you. You can drop it off...

932
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,340
in the umbrella stand in front of the store at any time.

933
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,210
I'm giving you the umbrella because I feel bad, actually.

934
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,038
The next package is going to be quite heavy.

935
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,840
I bought a whole bunch of stuff.

936
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,379
And one more thing. Have this.

937
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,619
Bye now.

938
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,989
Give me the name of your account, please.

939
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,090
It's Ryu Geun Duk.

940
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,400
("Basic Instincts")

941
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,739
Sun Jae!

942
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,579
What? What's going on?

943
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:02,750
Am I dreaming?

944
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:07,619
Be my Ilchon!

945
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,460
My son! Have some vegetable juice.

946
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,530
(You declined the request.)

947
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,730
Come on, Dad! Why can't you knock?

948
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,900
It feels like we are getting further away.

949
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,639
He refused to be my Ilchon.

950
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,969
It seems he has no interest in becoming friends with me.

951
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:57,170
(Do not cross, Police line, Under investigation)

952
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:29,960
(Lovely Runner)

953
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:31,369
I'm going to compete in the tournament.

954
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,669
I'll compete and win a medal no matter what.

955
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,969
Just wait until I win the gold medal.

956
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:36,699
I'll tell her I like her.

957
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,368
- Right. - Make sure your timing is good.

958
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:40,070
It's all about the timing when telling a girl how you feel.

959
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:41,409
This is the right time.

960
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:42,409
There's something...

961
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,078
It's about Kim Tae Sung, the bass guitarist in the band.

962
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:47,319
Are you his fan? Or do you have feelings for him?

963
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,480
Do you want to date me? You said you liked me.

964
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,319
Where's Sun Jae?

965
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,719
I didn't see him during the swimming drills.

966
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,489
- I'll quit swimming. - You brat.

967
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,928
I stopped it.

968
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:00,059
I like you.

969
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,329
I have feelings for you.
