00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,580
(Byeon Woo Seok)

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,348
(CEO)

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:09,349
(10 missed calls from CEO)

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,919
(Kim Hye Yoon)

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,999
(Lovely Runner)

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,359
(July 22, 2009)

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,769
Are we rolling right now?

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,669
- Gosh. Look at that. - Over there!

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,739
- There it is! - Gosh.

10
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,039
Hey, what's that?

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,840
- Look at that. - What?

12
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,039
- What is that? - Look!

13
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,310
- This is so fascinating! - Oh, my. So beautiful.

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,710
- I mean, how... - Gosh.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,719
Did you all take a look at the sky just now?

16
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,688
There hasn't been a total solar eclipse...

17
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:54,960
of this magnitude in the past 61 years.

18
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,459
The Moon is smaller than the Sun by 400 times.

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,629
- When I saw the Moon slowly... - Are you ready?

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,469
- swallowing up the Sun gradually... - Okay. Great.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
- Get in. - It felt...

22
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:02,999
- so surreal to watch it. - How can you smile right now?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,699
- It gave me a feeling that... - Let's go.

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,239
something incredible would happen.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,140
I was sort of wishful that a miracle would happen to me.

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,979
- So I hope that... - I'll get going now.

27
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,180
your lives will be blessed with a miracle.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,849
We will begin Part One of the show after this song.

29
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,420
Hey, we're late. Hurry up.

30
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,590
Let's go.

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,059
Hello.

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,719
- Hello. We're Eclipse. - Hello. We're Eclipse.

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,989
Hello.

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,560
Hello, we're Eclipse.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,500
- Hello! - Hello!

36
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,030
Then there's no break.

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,439
No way.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,879
Okay. I can rest up after this then.

39
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,310
Yu Ri.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,079
I'm a huge fan of yours.

41
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,980
Can I tell you my wish?

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,650
Sir, you can't do this here.

43
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,049
It's fine.

44
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,090
He's my fan.

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,219
What's your wish?

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,599
- Please hurry. - Okay.

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,270
- Let's begin right away. - Hello.

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,199
- Don't mess it up. Okay? - Okay.

49
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,639
Do a good job. Okay?

50
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:14,969
One, two, three.

51
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,369
- Hello, we're Eclipse. - Hello, we're Eclipse.

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,409
- We can't wait to work with you! - We can't wait to work with you!

53
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,749
All right, we've had the opportunity...

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,780
to hear a nice introduction for each member of Eclipse.

55
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,589
By the way, there's something...

56
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,188
all the new singers on our show must go through.

57
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,418
- I should paint your toenails... - It's to test...

58
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,090
- your popularity with the public. - with your favorite color, yellow.

59
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,129
- Yellow. - Yes!

60
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,598
It's a great way to gauge...

61
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,628
- the public's reception... - Sol.

62
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:41,729
- of your song. - Look out the window.

63
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,870
It's so sunny today. The weather is amazing.

64
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,139
Should we go out for a walk?

65
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:49,509
The doctor said lying in bed all day wouldn't do you any good.

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,779
To practice navigating in the wheelchair,

67
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,449
- I'll go first. - let's try moving around a bit.

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,809
- Yes? - Hello.

69
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,449
I'm so busy. Who's calling me?

70
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,750
Who is this?

71
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,119
This is the leader of a new group, Eclipse. My name is Baek In Hyuk.

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,819
What? Your name is Back In The Day?

73
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,460
- She said, "Back In The Day." - Oh, no. You failed.

74
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,499
- Oh, no. - Hello.

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,030
- Oh, no. Sol. This must hurt. - We're calling...

76
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,429
- from a live radio show. - Are you okay?

77
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,929
Eclipse is joining us today.

78
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,769
- Sol. - So we were running...

79
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,169
a popularity test with our listeners.

80
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,370
- Is that so? - All right. Ma'am.

81
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,780
Let me give you a special hint.

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,438
It's a surprise guest that comes to us...

83
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,008
during the hot summer out of the blue.

84
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,080
- I'm sorry. I cut it too short. - When you see this,

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,918
you can also see the rainbow.

86
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,449
I'll hurry and get some ointment.

87
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,150
Guess what this is.

88
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,389
I'm such a klutz. Seriously.

89
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,800
- The answer was the sudden shower. - Gosh, the sudden shower.

90
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,468
Okay, ma'am. Thank you for answering our call.

91
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,438
Unfortunately, you couldn't give us the correct answer.

92
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,169
However, you know that we're quite generous right here...

93
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,710
on "Hamster Seung Yeon's 10-10 Friend."

94
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,780
Just like In Hyuk's brimming confidence,

95
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,680
our show brims with generosity.

96
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,119
We'll send you a present for accepting our call,

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,379
ma'am.

98
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,089
We'll send you a red ginseng gift set,

99
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,060
so you could maintain good health for a long time.

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

101
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,659
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

102
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,329
We'll continue with the second try.

103
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,160
Who should try after In Hyuk?

104
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,269
Why don't you give it a try, Sun Jae?

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,970
Oh, sure.

106
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,370
Your phone is ringing.

107
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,509
No one is answering the phone.

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,850
I hope you'll at least get to try even if you succeed in the end.

109
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,120
That's so noisy.

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Just answer it.

111
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,610
Hello?

112
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,680
Can you hear my voice?

113
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,490
- What's this? - Hello. My name is...

114
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,850
Ryu Sun Jae.

115
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,920
So what?

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,220
Do you know who I am?

117
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,230
I don't.

118
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,259
Do you know Eclipse?

119
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,528
We made a debut two months ago.

120
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,768
I said I didn't know who you were.

121
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,268
That was another failed attempt. What a bummer.

122
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:35,109
Okay. Hello. Thank you for accepting our call.

123
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,078
This is DJ Hamster from "Hamster Seung Yeon's 10-10 Friend."

124
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,339
I'm hanging up.

125
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,980
Hold on. Don't forget about your present.

126
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,018
- I'm good. - The weather...

127
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,318
has been amazing lately.

128
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,148
We'll give you a pair of functional running shoes,

129
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:50,119
so you can wear them when you go on a picnic.

130
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,490
I don't need them.

131
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,689
I wonder what kind of present you would like then.

132
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,429
How about the latest indoor exercise bike?

133
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,930
I said I didn't want anything.

134
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,100
I don't need whatever you're trying to give me.

135
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,839
You call that a present?

136
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,239
Do you think you can make me walk again?

137
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,769
That's what I want!

138
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,239
If you can't even do that,

139
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,578
why are you calling me and harassing me...

140
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,709
when I haven't asked for this?

141
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,079
Are you having fun, doing prank calls like this?

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,679
Good for you guys...

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
that life is fun for you.

144
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,019
Somewhere in this world,

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,889
there are people who don't want to live...

146
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,959
because the weather is darn too good.

147
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,568
So don't do prank calls like this ever again.

148
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,730
You're making me want to set your TV station on fire!

149
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,508
I see. I'm so sorry.

150
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,008
It wasn't our intention...

151
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,079
Wait.

152
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,550
Are you still listening?

153
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,680
You're listening, right?

154
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,519
Mom.

155
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,689
Mom! Turn this off.

156
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,759
"Thank you..."

157
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,420
"for staying alive."

158
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,600
Your loved ones around you would be relieved...

159
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,069
and be grateful...

160
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,100
that you are still with them.

161
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,139
So...

162
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,550
you should live your life...

163
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,850
today...

164
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,420
because it's a great day.

165
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,089
It will rain tomorrow.

166
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,250
Then...

167
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,420
as you wait until the rain stops,

168
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,730
live another day.

169
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,399
If you keep this up,

170
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,629
there might come a day when life doesn't seem so miserable.

171
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,969
Gosh. Come on.

172
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,669
I would like to apologize sincerely...

173
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,138
to the people who accepted our calls...

174
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,509
- and our listeners. - What is it?

175
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,879
What's wrong?

176
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,579
After we listen to "Sonaki" by Eclipse,

177
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,519
we'll come back with Part Two of the show.

178
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,730
Cry it out. It's okay.

179
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,170
It's okay.

180
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,540
It's okay.

181
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,490
(December 31, 2022)

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,159
(Ryu Sun Jae)

183
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,629
(Episode 1)

184
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,829
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

185
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,128
(Sun Jae)

186
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,699
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

187
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,230
(I love you, Ryu Sun Jae.)

188
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,639
(Resume)

189
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,330
(Alarm)

190
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,329
Come on.

191
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,869
I submitted my resume a long time ago.

192
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,970
If they were going to hire me, they would've already contacted me.

193
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,769
I shouldn't expect anything from it. Let's just move on.

194
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,440
You startled me!

195
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,750
What's that on your face, Grandma?

196
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,990
Miss, you look so pretty.

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,419
Am I pretty?

198
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:46,860
Yes.

199
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,169
How did you get that out?

200
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,269
Let me see your hand, Grandma.

201
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,210
You wish!

202
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,479
Where did she learn to talk like that?

203
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,720
- Grandma! - Whatever!

204
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:13,220
Give it back! Come on, let me have it.

205
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,319
Grandma!

206
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,689
- Hello. - Hello.

207
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,489
- Mom. - What is it this time?

208
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,360
This old lady is scary!

209
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,960
You called me Miss earlier!

210
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,070
Come on. That's my dear Sun Jae's.

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,168
I'm going to die if she makes a scratch on that!

212
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,299
- No way. - Please! Oh, no.

213
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,069
Grandma, come on!

214
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,908
Dear me!

215
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:38,480
- I'm home. - You're back.

216
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,110
- Another all-nighter at work? - Where are you going, Grandma?

217
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,949
That jerk, General Manager Kim.

218
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,980
I should just quit my job or something. Seriously.

219
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,980
- Did you eat? - I must go back after a shower.

220
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,350
- Again? - Grandma!

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,019
Geum! Can you take that from her? Please?

222
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,889
Gosh. She'll give it back to you once she's done playing with it.

223
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,799
- Come on. - Right.

224
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,330
Oh, no!

225
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,168
Mom!

226
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,340
Okay. Just sit tight.

227
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,470
- Mom. - Oh, no.

228
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,340
If you give it back to me,

229
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,440
I'll let you watch "Secret Jouju."

230
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,480
- Jouju? - Yes.

231
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,710
- Bibbidi boo. - Bibbidi boo.

232
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,719
My dear Mal Ja.

233
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,719
- Are you in a good mood? - Yes.

234
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,788
Gosh. You brat. It's just a watch.

235
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,450
Why are you yelling at your grandma at this hour?

236
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,819
All right. Let's watch...

237
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,189
- "Secret Jouju." - It's not "just" a watch.

238
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,059
I bought this at an auction. I paid 3,000 dollars for this.

239
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,389
Three thousand dollars?

240
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,029
Three thousand dollars?

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,028
It was 300 dollars.

242
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,970
Goodness. That was a slip of the tongue.

243
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,500
There's a power struggle going on...

244
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,340
between my brain and my lips these days. Right.

245
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,839
Seriously. You must be the most enthusiastic fan.

246
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,109
Goodness. You sure are the most loyal fan.

247
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,580
- Get my spell! - Gosh.

248
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,779
So the concert is today?

249
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,450
Yes.

250
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,549
It's been five years since their last concert.

251
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,500
Hey, Sun Jae.

252
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,000
What happened?

253
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,110
You met with Director Park and said you wouldn't do the movie.

254
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,409
Are you out of your mind?

255
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,950
Sun Jae.

256
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,809
Didn't I tell you?

257
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,749
I said you could take a long break once you were done with this movie.

258
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,980
I said I wanted to retire.

259
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:28,649
I didn't ask for a break.

260
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,889
Why don't you just go out there?

261
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,758
Look at the sea of people out there. They're your fans who came...

262
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,330
to watch you perform after waiting for years and on.

263
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,460
You're going to regret this later!

264
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,529
Regret?

265
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,899
I won't regret it.

266
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,169
Your body will remain,

267
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,809
but your spirit will leave this world...

268
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,909
when you have fulfilled the time in this world.

269
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,709
Gosh, you can't ask me to edit this at the last minute like this.

270
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,808
I have an important plan today. Seriously.

271
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,620
Have you forgotten that I'm your first client?

272
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,349
Then I'll hire someone else.

273
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,789
Gosh. Come on, don't be like that.

274
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,288
By the way, didn't Sanzu Bridge appear...

275
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:06,820
in a drama or something?

276
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,759
You must have enjoyed watching the drama.

277
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,659
Gosh, don't tell me.

278
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,529
Are you Jang Man Weol?

279
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,369
The crew did a good job...

280
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,399
at integrating authentic elements into the drama.

281
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,899
You think only the living realm undergoes development?

282
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,569
They build bridges over rivers in the afterlife too.

283
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,709
Gosh, I got it.

284
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,470
How would I know that? I haven't been to the afterlife.

285
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,480
All done.

286
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,210
(Grandma Celestial)

287
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,149
I'll post it now.

288
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,190
I'm late! Oh, no!

289
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,049
Come on.

290
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,519
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

291
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,600
I almost forgot the most important thing.

292
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,110
(Eclipse's Concert)

293
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,778
You.

294
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,379
Will you keep putting me under your spell?

295
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:10,149
I love you so much.

296
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,090
See you soon.

297
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,559
Bye.

298
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,798
I've got zero problems

299
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,100
I'll start running again right now

300
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,869
- Are you that happy? - Of course!

301
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,870
It's my first time seeing him in person.

302
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:29,909
Of course, I'm thrilled.

303
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,379
Thank you. I know you're busy.

304
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,779
Don't mention it.

305
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,008
I switched to a big car...

306
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,350
so I could give you a ride like this.

307
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,479
Check the shopping bag there.

308
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,620
It's a present from me.

309
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,120
What is it?

310
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,759
(Jagam High School)

311
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,459
- Hey! - Hey!

312
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,928
It turned out my junior's older brother was...

313
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,599
in Graduating Class 13 at Jagam High School.

314
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,128
I asked to borrow it.

315
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:56,230
Oh, my! I can't believe this!

316
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,240
Was Sun Jae in Class Five when he was a senior?

317
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,870
Class Five... Let's see.

318
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,740
Oh, my.

319
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,679
He's been so handsome even in high school.

320
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,109
I totally want to kidnap him and run!

321
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,518
Why didn't you do that when you had the chance?

322
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,120
You could have done that if you wanted.

323
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,018
Exactly. His school was across from ours.

324
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,289
How come we never saw him?

325
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,720
How did we miss such a dazzling young man back then?

326
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,158
Had I been his fan since high school,

327
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,428
I would've been the most successful fan.

328
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,700
That's because you were someone else's fan back then.

329
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,529
Like who?

330
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,370
Right. I was.

331
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,409
Which class was he in?

332
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,740
He's not in the yearbook.

333
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,610
Was it after your accident?

334
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,538
Was he in a group fight with students from the adjacent school?

335
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,580
Anyway, it was a huge scandal.

336
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,950
He could've gotten expelled,

337
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,649
but they just let him withdraw from school.

338
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,850
I didn't know.

339
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,419
- Hyun Ju. - Yes.

340
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,120
Can I cut out Sun Jae's picture?

341
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,888
Sure. It's not mine. Do whatever you want.

342
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,529
Thank your junior's brother for me.

343
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,830
One, two, three.

344
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,409
(Sun Jae over stars.)

345
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
This is cute.

346
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:11,709
- Thank you. - Thank you.

347
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,710
(We're always on your side.)

348
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,049
(I love you, Eclipse. I can't live without you guys.)

349
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,179
(I love you, Ryu Sun Jae.)

350
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,070
- Sol! - Hey!

351
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,939
- Sol! - You're here.

352
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,350
- Have you been well? - Yes. You're here early.

353
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,330
(I'm always grateful.)

354
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,639
Then what should we eat?

355
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,239
- Tteokbokki? - Sounds good.

356
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,078
It took five years for them to hold a concert because of somebody.

357
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,939
It's not like this is Ryu Sun Jae's solo concert.

358
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,249
Seriously. In Hyuk isn't some filler on stage.

359
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,950
If he wants to be an actor, he can just leave the band.

360
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,949
What does he think he's doing?

361
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,179
Is he trying to use Eclipse as his crutch?

362
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,689
Fans like them are the origin...

363
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,088
of breakup rumors surrounding the band.

364
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,119
Exactly.

365
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,619
Our kind Sun Jae still considers people like them his fans.

366
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,528
So even when they write hate comments and spread rumors,

367
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,160
he's letting that slide. Seriously.

368
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,900
Wait.

369
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,808
Hello?

370
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,069
Hello. This is Choi Jung Hoon. I'm calling from Bon Cinema.

371
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,709
You applied for an internship, correct?

372
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,240
I'm calling you after checking your portfolio.

373
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,379
Yes! I did apply for it!

374
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,709
By the way, is it possible...

375
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,549
to come in for an interview now?

376
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,189
Now?

377
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,349
We need to process this really urgently.

378
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,889
If you can't...

379
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,318
I'll be there. I can!

380
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,519
Thank you.

381
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,490
Are you going somewhere?

382
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,929
We have two hours left until we can enter.

383
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,159
Yes, it's an interview for an internship.

384
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,328
I'll be back in a jiffy. Get in line first. Okay?

385
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,670
- Don't be late. Okay? - Okay.

386
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
You're all set.

387
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,848
(Planning Room, Editing Room)

388
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,219
I think it looks good.

389
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,380
That's fine.

390
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,859
Get back to work.

391
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,529
What brings you here?

392
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,889
I got a phone call just now.

393
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,500
I'm here for the internship interview.

394
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,829
I see.

395
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,640
I see.

396
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,709
I would love to work with you,

397
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,808
but as you can see, this is a two-story building...

398
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,240
without an elevator.

399
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,549
- I'm truly sorry. - Darn it.

400
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,950
What a bummer!

401
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,879
I would have gotten the job...

402
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,279
if it weren't for those annoying stairs.

403
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,019
Why don't I go and see Sun Jae perform?

404
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:01,169
Why aren't you back already?

405
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,710
We'll enter pretty soon.

406
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,160
Excuse me!

407
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,729
I'm really sorry.

408
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,559
Could you please let me in?

409
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,028
Were you not able to go in?

410
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,629
I really wanted to get here quickly.

411
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,598
You can't enter past the admission time.

412
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,470
I know that. I'm well aware.

413
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,939
It's the last day of the year. So it was so hard to get a cab.

414
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,778
I went through so much trouble of taking the bus...

415
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,380
and barely managed to come here.

416
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,380
But I ended up coming late.

417
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,990
I can tell that you're very good at your job.

418
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,049
Could you please...

419
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,490
help me out?

420
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,960
Well, I really shouldn't.

421
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,529
It's cold.

422
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,069
Gosh, it's so cold.

423
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,038
If you show me your ticket, I'll let you in.

424
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,940
Really? Thank you!

425
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:14,880
Hold on.

426
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,750
What?

427
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,519
Where did it go?

428
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,700
I'm screwed.

429
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,240
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

430
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,880
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

431
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,650
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

432
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,788
Ryu Sun Jae, Baek In Hyuk, Hyun Su, Jay.

433
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,759
Eclipse!

434
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,028
- Towards the sunset - The sunset!

435
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,730
- Fly with all your strength - Fly

436
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,669
- Bring back the dreams - Bring back the dreams

437
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,400
- That have been forgotten - That have been forgotten

438
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,239
- In the city, there's a chance - Chance!

439
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,008
- If the wall is high, break it - Break it

440
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,909
- Follow your heart - Follow your heart

441
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,108
In the burning sunset, the old days get hot

442
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,449
- The moment we've been waiting for - Waiting for

443
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,949
- Right now - Right now

444
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,818
I've got zero problems

445
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:32,420
- I'll start running again right now - Running again

446
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,930
Believe me, don't you worry

447
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,769
- We'll meet each other after all - We'll meet each other

448
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:46,940
You save me like a god of love

449
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,910
We'll meet each other in the end

450
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,980
Remember

451
00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:00,750
You shine so brightly

452
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,890
When you feel like hiding

453
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,230
Like the night sky that embraces us

454
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,230
Every moment of every day, stay with me

455
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,869
- Just you and I, for you and I - Just you and I, for you and I

456
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,579
- You and I, just you and I - You and I, just you and I

457
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,619
This song...

458
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,920
is our debut song.

459
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,490
It's been a long while since I sang it live.

460
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,400
Is Sun Jae talking right now?

461
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:48,929
What is he saying?

462
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,799
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

463
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:03,779
I didn't want it to stop

464
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,548
- On the day - This song wasn't on the setlist.

465
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,990
You first came to me

466
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,390
I didn't want you to be the rain

467
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,229
That soaks me wet only momentarily

468
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,529
I've prayed so hard

469
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,838
Do you know how I feel?

470
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,308
I've dreamt of you every day

471
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,880
My heart is soaked in you again today

472
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:43,189
- You are a gift - You are a gift

473
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,489
From the sky

474
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,328
When you're all alone in this world

475
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:54,259
- I'll protect you - I'll protect you

476
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,799
You have fallen to me

477
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,709
Like a sudden shower

478
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,670
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

479
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,609
But I sing to you again today

480
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,119
My precious

481
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,119
Love

482
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,380
Please move carefully and slowly.

483
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:41,749
Many people are heading home.

484
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,118
Please head to the bus stops nearby.

485
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,619
(We've got your hunger covered!)

486
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,950
It was so touching, though I heard it from outside.

487
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,519
If I had seen it myself, I would have passed out.

488
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,890
This is the first snow of the season.

489
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,500
Sun Jae must be thrilled.

490
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,769
Let's go home now!

491
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,359
What a day today!

492
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,130
In Hyuk, calm down, please.

493
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,809
- In Hyuk, let it go. - Move!

494
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,539
- You! - In Hyuk!

495
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,909
- Who do you think I am? - You should talk it out.

496
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,410
- Let go of me! - Talk it out.

497
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,220
In Hyuk.

498
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,289
How could you let me find out about your retirement from someone else?

499
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,960
You're retiring?

500
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,789
- Are you out of your mind? - In Hyuk.

501
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,730
Let's do this some other time.

502
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,730
I'd like to be alone for a moment.

503
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,170
Sure. Do as you please.

504
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,109
Don't do this!

505
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:19,609
In Hyuk!

506
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,740
Why is the bus stop so far away?

507
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:55,079
And why is this bridge so long?

508
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,250
Wait. What?

509
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,650
You can't stop right here.

510
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,859
There you go.

511
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,259
Let's go a little further, please.

512
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,259
What?

513
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,329
Gosh.

514
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,470
Are you serious?

515
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
I would love to work with you,

516
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,479
but as you can see, this is a two-story building...

517
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,740
without an elevator.

518
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,549
If you show me your ticket, I'll let you in.

519
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's so cold.

520
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,609
What are you doing right here?

521
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,579
Did your wheelchair...

522
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:14,619
break down?

523
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,890
What?

524
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,049
Right. Yes.

525
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,689
Dear mouth, say something.

526
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,630
It's Sun Jae. Why aren't you saying anything?

527
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,509
You looked cold.

528
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,519
Thank you.

529
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,059
Why are you crying, then?

530
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,059
I didn't make you cry.

531
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,369
I'm crying...

532
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,299
because I'm so happy.

533
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,299
Actually, I...

534
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,539
I'm your fan.

535
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,440
I can tell.

536
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,680
(Let's kidnap Sun Jae and run!)

537
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Right.

538
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,490
This is funny.

539
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,359
It's a nickname I've been using on the fan club website...

540
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,559
for more than ten years.

541
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,629
Actually, I've been your fan since your debut.

542
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,859
I haven't been distracted by other singers, not even once.

543
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,500
Thank you.

544
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,140
I'm the one who should thank you.

545
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
What?

546
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,809
For giving me the will the live again.

547
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,049
I want to thank you for everything.

548
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,279
For existing in this world.

549
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,420

550
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,130
How are you getting home?

551
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,730
- Well... - Do you want me to ride you home?

552
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,329
- What? - I can't leave you behind...

553
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,930
when you're my fan.

554
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,750
My friend is here to pick me up.

555
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,019
Thank you for everything today.

556
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,170
Take it with you.

557
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,779
Give me a second.

558
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,880
It's unfortunate I have nothing to give you.

559
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,049
But...

560
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,619
I know you like these.

561
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,619
Will you take these?

562
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,839
Mom, the one who saved me when I had the accident...

563
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,069
Do you remember his or her name?

564
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,740
No.

565
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,109
That's so long ago.

566
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,419
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

567
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,249
It's nothing. Because I met the person who made me live,

568
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,650
I wondered about the person who saved me.

569
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,160
I feel bad because I didn't thank the person back then.

570
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,820
Right.

571
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,489
I should have gotten this autographed.

572
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,360
It feels like I just woke from a dream.

573
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,710
Wait. What was it?

574
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,510
Did I see it wrong?

575
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,300
Will Sun Jae's wrist be this big?

576
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,469
About this big?

577
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,849
What's up with the outfit today?

578
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,420
Gosh.

579
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,820
My Sun Jae looks better in person.

580
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,190
The camera can't deliver his beauty.

581
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,429
Goodness. This is crazy!

582
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,699
I'm not the guilty one here.

583
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,530
This collarbone is the guilty one.

584
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:33,269

Hey. I ran into Ryu Sun Jae in the lobby.

589
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,158
Really? I'm jealous.

590
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,530
How was he? Was he tall? What about his shoulders?

591
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,658
Is he handsome?

592
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:32,828
His face is that of CG.

593
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:35,159
Hey. How come you saw him alone? I wish I had seen him too.

Come on. We've been through this many times.

- What if it's true? - I don't believe it.

600
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,488
The reporters are giving a false report again.

601
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,960
Does it even make sense that he tried to kill himself?

602
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,000
What are they talking about?

603
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,869
He was right before my eyes not so long ago. How could he...

604
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,809

Let me go inside just for a moment.

725
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,169
No.

726
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,368
This game is being conducted in strict secrecy.

727
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:24,709
Don't you ever talk about it to someone else.

728
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:25,968
Let me go inside just once.

729
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,440
If you understand, you should leave right now.

730
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,809
Are you all right?

731
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:33,420
No, it hurts.

732
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:37,989
It hurts?

733
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,789
Why?

734
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,559
Why can I not wake up from the dream?

735
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,659
I was definitely looking for Sun Jae's watch.

736
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,269
I found it.

737
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,969
And...

738
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,780
then...

739
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,780
No way.

740
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,550
Your body will remain,

741
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,288
but your spirit will leave this world...

742
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:15,559
when you have fulfilled the time in this world.

743
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,960
Your spirit crosses long Sanzu Bridge...

744
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,929
to go to the underworld.

745
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:24,170
Am I...

746
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,869
dead?

747
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,619
Hey.

748
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,190
Hey, what are you doing?

749
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,559
Hey.

750
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,530
I'm sorry.

751
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:00,670
We're dead, right?

752
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,610
What?

753
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,409
Are you a ghost?

754
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,179
"A ghost?"

755
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,719
You're Sun Jae.

756
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:22,589
Hey, why are you crying?

757
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,159
Right. I can see him.

758
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,260
It means I'm dead.

759
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:31,500
What is wrong with her?

760
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:33,899
Here.

761
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,939
I have the same watch.

762
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,440
It's yours. Take it.

763
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,570
- It's mine? - Yes.

764
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,039
This is actually better.

765
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,339
I'll go with you.

766
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,809
I'll go with you so that you don't feel lonely on the way there.

767
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,590
But what about my poor mom?

768
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:54,719
Mom. Grandma.

769
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,090
No.

770
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,190
I haven't crossed the bridge yet. There must be a way.

771
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,900
Let's go back together.

772
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,170
Never cross this bridge.

773
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:04,900
I should if I want to go home.

774
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:06,900
No.

775
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,638
No, Sun Jae. You shouldn't cross the bridge.

776
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,309
Yes, I should.

777
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:14,110
No, Sun Jae.

778
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,280
Let's live together. Okay?

779
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,110
Let's live together.

780
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,719
"Let's live together?"

781
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,388
Taxi!

782
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,650
- Sun Jae! - Taxi!

783
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,059
Please go straight.

784
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,230
Sun Jae!

785
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:35,460
There's a cab...

786
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,400

Hello?

789
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,150
Where are you?

790
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,820
I heard you had skipped school!

791
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,919
It's really Mom's voice.

792
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,488
Cut the chatter and come home quickly.

793
00:51:58,489 --> 00:51:59,788
If you don't come back in an hour,

794
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:02,420
you're going to take an express train to the underworld!

795
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,030

Oh, my. Sun Jae, the Shortfin Mako.

00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:23,908
What's "Shortfin Mako?" It's weird.

How did the game go today?

804
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,519
It wasn't even an official competition.

805
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,420
But...

806
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:37,888
the records were good.

807
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:40,199
I knew it. I'm proud of you, son.

808
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,360
I knew you would make it.

809
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,400
How was your shoulder?

810
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,769
Of course, it was fine.

Yes. See you later.

813
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,420
You must've been struggling by yourself, feeling so lonely.

814
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,360
You couldn't even tell anyone that you were having a hard time.

815
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,829
I didn't know you were in so much pain.

00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,679
What? Mine was here.

(We'd like to thank Park Tae Hwan, Kwon Yu Ri, Han Seung Yeon,)

912
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:04,949
(and Lee Su Ji for the special appearance.)

913
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,030
(Lovely Runner)

914
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:22,869
I must get close to someone. What should I do?

915
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,940
Quit smoking.

916
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,809
Give up. No.

917
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:28,639
Have you ever seen me by any chance?

918
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:29,909
Even if I have, I haven't.

919
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,510
Hi. Oh, my gosh.

920
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,308
They like Kim Tae Sung.

921
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,218
- Who is Kim Tae Sung? - You don't know him?

922
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:36,880
- You're Ryu Sun Jae, right? - Who are you?

923
01:03:37,389 --> 01:03:39,489
Sun Jae, you shouldn't participate in the upcoming competition.

924
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:43,760
Who are you?

925
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,788
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

926
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,030
Because I want to protect you.

927
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:49,429
I'm trying anything because I have to save you.
