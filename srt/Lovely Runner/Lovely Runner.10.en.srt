(The Terminator 2)

8
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,139
You came like him?

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,299
No.

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,908
I'm not saying I'm the Terminator.

11
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,538
I just gave an example to explain time travel.

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,779
So you came from the future?

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
Yes.

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,548
I pressed the button here.

15
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,280
And I came to 2008 just like that.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,630
So are you saying this is my watch from 2023?

17
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:54,829
Yes.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,399
Why did my watch suddenly become a time machine?

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,439
I think it's the deity's will that this time,

20
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,969
I save you, just like you saved me in the past.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,409
I gained the power after you died.

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,780
How can I say that?

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,579
I know.

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,579
It's very interesting.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,189
And why do you have my watch in the future?

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,090
I bought it through an auction for 3,000 dollars.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,359
- What? - What?

28
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,059
Why would I put an old watch like this for auction...

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,700
and why would you pay as much as 3,000 dollars? What did I become?

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,699
I said I was a fan.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
A fan of what?

32
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,870
You were in a very famous band called Eclipse.

33
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,939
That's why I know "Sonaki."

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,108
I can't tell you about that.

35
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,340
- Why not? - Because time stops.

36
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,409
Stop it then.

37
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,319
It stopped just now, but you can't notice it...

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,090
while time stops.

39
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,089
So you control time as you want?

40
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,090
No, I can't do that.

41
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,499
All the things I'm saying are ridiculous and unbelievable, right?

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,530
Yes.

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,200
I knew it.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,300
That's why I couldn't say it to anyone.

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,270
Okay. Let's say what you said is true.

46
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,039
What are you here to change this time?

47
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,908
You said you would make sure to change it this time.

48
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,080
Change what?

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,779
I said I wouldn't change anything.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,050
I must've said it wrong because I was drunk.

51
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,819
You won't make a change?

52
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,919
My careless words and actions here...

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,060
might change my future or someone else's.

54
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,060
This is my last chance.

55
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,300
I can't come again when I go back.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,969
That's why I was going to stay quiet until I go back.

57
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,139
Is that why you ran away like that whenever you saw me?

58
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,969
I said I was sorry...

59
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,310
for confusing and shaking you for no reason before.

60
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,879
I'm not going to do that this time.

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,479
I don't want to confuse you.

62
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,849
Why?

63
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,189
Do you think I'll misunderstand your feelings and ask you out?

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,620
If that's why, you don't have to waste your energy on running away.

65
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,360
I'm going to take a leave of absence and go to the US.

66
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,759
- What? - I want to try rehab again.

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,369
I'll leave so that you don't feel uncomfortable.

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,399
And even if we bump into each other, I'll pretend that I don't know you.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,539
So don't make such a ridiculous excuse like that.

70
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,039
Hey...

71
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,639
Rehab?

72
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,979

(Spearhead PE)

75
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,400
She came from the future?

76
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,610
Hey, what are you thinking?

77
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,879
Have you guys watched "The Terminator?"

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,978
- I have. - Why?

79
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,050
Is time travel possible in real life?

80
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,419
It might be possible if science advances tremendously in the future.

81
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,549
Don't you guys know Einstein's theory of relativity?

82
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,960
Have you not heard about wormholes?

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
You know what people say when talking about time travel.

84
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,789
What do they say?

85
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,659
If I know that, I'm Einstein.

86
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
Come on.

87
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,699
But why do you ask?

88
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,430
What would you do...

89
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,969
if someone you like says she came from the future?

90
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,568
I should give up right away.

91
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,669
What kind of stupid refusal is that?

92
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,708
Is that a new refusal method that is trending these days?

93
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,209
She should just say she doesn't like you. Is she teasing you?

94
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,050
- Is that so? - But...

95
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,448
if someone I don't like says she likes me, I'll refuse like that.

96
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,689
Hey, you'll be able to time travel before someone says she likes you.

97
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,060
Idiot.

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,959
Anyway, you should give up.

99
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,769
He's leaving for rehab out of nowhere?

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,339
Did the past change again because of me?

101
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,410
Yes. It's actually better this way.

102
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,980
While Sun Jae is far away,

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,980
he will never bump into that man.

104
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,449
Sir.

105
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,949
Really?

106
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,620
Yes.

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
The vocalist?

108
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,430
Of course, he can.

109
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,230
Thank you.

110
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,069
What is it about?

111
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,139
- Well... - What's the matter?

112
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,669
I sent the video of our performance...

113
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,639
to "Superstar K."

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,879
We passed the primary screening.

115
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,639
They asked us to participate in the regional preliminary.

116
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,079
Are you serious?

117
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,819
I should call Dong Seob too.

118
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,319
No.

(Superstar K)

120
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,359
When I sent the video of our performance,

121
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,399
I also sent this just in case.

122
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,199
They said they would let us pass the screening...

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,970
if Sun Jae becomes our vocalist instead of Dong Seob.

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Why?

125
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,670
Did he agree to become our vocalist?

126
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,209
Well...

127
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,740
We should persuade him now.

129

A future superstar is here.

132

Take a seat. I just have to get a bowl of rice.

133
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,669
I heard you've been busy performing every day.

134
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,698
What brought you here?

135
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,100
I have something to say to Sun Jae.

136
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,240
You do?

137
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,569
What thing to say?

138
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,910
Let's talk later.

139
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,110
Father,

140
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,579
how did you know I would come? You made galbi.

141
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,680
Did you close the restaurant early to come home?

142
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,550
I closed it early to meet Coach An.

143
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,220
Oh, right. Sun Jae,

144
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,990
I heard you decided to go to the US.

145
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,319
- What? - The US?

146
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,258
Sol who lives next door told me.

147
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,500
You said you wanted to try rehab.

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,699
Yes. That's the right decision.

149
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,839
Father, the thing is...

150
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,970
Sol worried about you so much.

151
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,778
She said I should send you to the US...

152
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,709
for treatment as soon as possible.

153
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,879
I thought she was my daughter-in-law or something.

154
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,578
She told you to send me as soon as possible?

155
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,389
Yes. That's why I told Coach An...

156
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,259
to schedule the treatment as soon as possible.

157
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,990
Hurry up and eat. Why aren't you...

158
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,560
The meat is burnt!

159
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,199
Why do you suddenly want to get rehabilitation?

160
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,800
You studied so hard to go to university.

161
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,600
I know.

162
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,410
I don't know why I studied so hard to go to university.

163
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,938
You haven't swum for more than six months after the surgery.

164
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,740
If I'm going to get rehabilitation, this is the right time.

165
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,750
Everyone wants to send me to the US.

166

I'll give it a try for the last time.

167

What if I say I can never let you go?

168
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:07,389

What's the matter?

171
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,569
You told me to take a leave of absence and move on with my life.

172
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,269
Are you going because of Sol, by any chance?

173
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,610
Because I told you to keep her out of sight before?

174
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,379
Are you crazy?

175
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,249
Why do you let her control your life?

176
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,879
She doesn't control my life. You're overreacting.

177
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,220
And why are you mad?

178
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,419
It isn't your life.

179
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,850
My life is also at stake.

180
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,019
Why is your life at stake?

181
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,330
You said you had something to say. What is it?

182
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,758
I don't know. Darn it.

183
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,500
(Kangmok Police Station)

184
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,799
I called you because we should confirm the victim's statement.

185
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,110
It must've been scary.

186
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,609
Thank you for plucking up your courage and reporting to us...

187
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,669
before it's too late.

188
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,809
Last year,

189
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,609
you passed out in front of the Juyang Reservoir police box...

190
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,149
on the day you were kidnapped, didn't you?

191
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:09,049
Yes. Thank you for taking me to the hospital that day.

192
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,190
I see. I didn't expect that you would lose your memory.

193
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,429
I should've looked into it more back then.

194
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,059
It's all right.

195
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,370
I heard the deserted house where the crime happened...

196
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,600
had been burnt down.

197
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,969
Does it mean no evidence was found?

198
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,139
Well, no.

199
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,278
Fortunately, we found a bloodstain...

200
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,279
on the interior wall of the house, untouched by the fire,

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
which matched the DNA of the body found at Juyang Reservoir.

202
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,919
You did?

203
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,049
That's great.

204
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,789
He's a wanted murder suspect. He'll be caught soon.

205
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,960
- Don't worry too much. - Okay.

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,129
By the way, you said you had been dragged away in a taxi...

207
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,230
on the day of the incident,

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,469
but according to your statement,

209
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,499
he chased you down in a truck when you were escaping...

210
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
from the crime scene.

211
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,070
Oh, yes.

212
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,769
I took the key to the cab when I ran away.

213
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,970
I see.

214
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,940
Is there something else you remember about the truck?

215
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,849
Given his behavioural characteristics,

216
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,980
it's highly likely that he's currently fleeing in a vehicle.

217
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,950
There was no information about the truck...

218
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,649
in the case record.

219
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,419
No. I was out of my mind that day.

220
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,529
I think there was a license plate,

221
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,860
but I don't remember well.

222
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,070
Can you pick the car the most similar to the truck...

223
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,740
among these then?

224
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,519
The white one.

225
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,179
It was stained, but it was a white truck.

226
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,519
It's a relief that some evidence was found.

227
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,659
- Hey! - Oh, my goodness!

228
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,190
You said I shouldn't act like I know you in school.

229
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,399
Do you have a one-dollar bill?

230
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,230
My gosh.

231
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,269
(Hyun Ju)

232
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,169
(Hyun Ju)

233
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,509
Why isn't he picking up my call?

234
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,850
What? Where did he go?

235
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,589
You were with Geum just now, weren't you?

236
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,120
Yes. He was with me just now.

237
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,190
So this is what he's going for.

238
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,730
Hey, it's Sun Jae.

239
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,029
Where did she go?

240
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,899
I guess Sun Jae takes this class too.

241
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,100
I haven't seen him before because there are so many students.

242
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,470
Did he apply for the class because of you?

243
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
You're saying nonsense again.

244
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,408
Even though it's an elective,

245
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,740
why would a Physical Education major take Understanding of Film Music?

246
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,479
He always liked both films and music.

247
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Does he...

248
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,278
still like you?

249
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
- It's good to see you. - I guess not.

250
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,090
Who is she? His girlfriend?

251
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,220
She also stuck with him during the field trip, right?

252
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,700
I squeezed out too much cream.

253
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Let me rub some on you.

254
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,700
What are you doing?

255
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,940
I don't like my hands sticky.

256
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,669
You have very big hands.

257
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,169
Do you want to compare it with mine?

258
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,979
Do you have to compare them to know which is big or small?

259
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,508
Hey, look at what she's doing.

260
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,980
I think she likes Sun Jae.

261
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,908
She's using the technique...

262
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,379
girls use to seduce guys.

263
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,889
That's cute.

264
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,250
That's cute?

265
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,190
Well, guys will find it extremely cute.

266
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,460
A silent film is a film...

267
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:40,200
without recorded sound, especially dialogue.

268
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,870
People tried to synchronize sound with the film...

269
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,870
from the beginning,

270
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,039
but all the films were silent until the late 1920s...

271
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,610
due to technical limitations.

272
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:55,250
As popular culture was formed in the 1920s,

273
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,279
centered in Gyeongseong, silent films...

275
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,889
(3 alcohol accompaniments for 10 dollars!)

276
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,090
Gosh, you're young.

277
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,359
You drank so much during the field trip.

278
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,830
Can you drink again only after a few days?

279
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,298
We should keep drinking.

280
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,369
This is why we studied so hard in high school, isn't it?

281
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,370
Cheers.

282
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,769
It's sweet.

283
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:29,480
By the way, how is...

284
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,279
Geum doing these days?

285
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,620
Is he still crying over his ex-girlfriend?

286
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,049
Ask him if you're curious.

287
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,960
I can ask him only when I can reach him.

288
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,058
I'm not that curious.

289
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,600
I just asked because it came to my mind.

290
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,898
Why did we have to come here?

291
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,768
You can take a seat here.

292
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,239
- Thank you. - Thank you.

293
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,909
Feel free to order anything you need.

294
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,370
- Okay. - Thank you.

295
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,908
- Cheers. - Cheers.

297
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,349
Sun Jae, can you please...

298
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,648
go to an audition with me before you go to the US?

299
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,720
What audition?

300
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,859
Why would I go there?

301
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,889
Hey, where...

302
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,129
What?

303
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,159
Why can't you find it?

304
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,669
Fine.

305
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,340
I'll bring Cho Rong.

306
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,740
What should I do with this girl with a terrible sense of direction?

307
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,509
See you later.

308
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,779
What?

309
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,120
Hyun Ju. Are you sleeping?

310
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,190
Hey.

311
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,690
Why does he...

312
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,289
keep ignoring my calls?

313
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,429
I might have to just barge into his house.

314
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,059
Let's go now. Okay?

315
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,330
Come out while I'm paying. All right?

316
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,529
Gosh.

317
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
My goodness.

318
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,740
Darn it.

319
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,710
- Hey. - Stand up.

320
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,350
- Stand up. - Hurry up.

321
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,149
- Happy birthday - Happy birthday

322
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,388
- Happy birthday - Happy birthday

323
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,090
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday to you

324
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,529
- Tada. - I'm sorry.

325
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,929
What are you doing?

326
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,460
When did you switch seats?

327
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,029
It's too hot over there.

328
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,970
I feel hot.

329
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,039
Gosh, what do I do?

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,279
What do I do? Am I drunk?

331
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
My cheeks are red, aren't they?

332
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,710
You should go home if you're drunk.

333
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,179
I'm not that drunk.

334
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,220
What's wrong with her?

335
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:50,919
It's bitter.

336
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,419
Why do you drink when you're drunk?

337
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,429
By the way, why isn't he coming?

338
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,258
- Sun Jae. - Yes?

339
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,600
Are you really going to take a leave of absence to go to the US?

340
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,230
I guess the rumour spread already.

341
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,999
Should I apply...

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,110
for the exchange student program to follow you?

343
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,240
Why would you follow me?

344
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,710
You're not very perceptive.

345
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,980
I like you.

346
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,509
Sun Jae, would you like to go out with me?

347
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,490
Why? Do you not like me?

348
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,490
Do you hate me that much?

349
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,690
Are you doing this because you don't even want to see me?

350
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,500
I turned right after turning left. And then I...

351
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,639
Sorry. Did we interrupt you?

352
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,509
- Interrupt? Interrupt what? - Yes.

353
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,378
Let's sit somewhere else.

354
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,580
Yes. Let's sit somewhere else.

355
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,980
Aren't you hearing something?

356
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,619
Gosh.

357
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,960
Why is she wearing a trash can on her head?

358
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,190
Sol!

359
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,130
She's drunk.

362
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,809
Thank you for the trash can. I'm sorry.

363
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,680

365
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,349
Gosh.

366
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,279
Hey.

367
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,180
It was Sol, right?

368
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,690
I feel bad for her.

369
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,259
She must've seen you guys kissing under the table.

370
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,890
- Kiss? - You didn't kiss?

371
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,029
What are you doing?

372
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
Well...

373
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,470
You have an eyelash on your face.

374
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,569
Turning left or right...

375
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,339
- Did it look like we were kissing? - Yes. It was a perfect angle.

376
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,709
If you didn't, she totally misunderstood you.

377
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,109
She might be heartbroken and cry.

378
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,980
Hey, why would she be heartbroken?

379
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,979
She's not even interested in me.

380
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,420
What? I thought she liked you.

381
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,189
I saw her running with tears...

382
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,160
after hearing that you injured your shoulder last year.

383
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,200
It's a misunderstanding. You're the only one who thinks so.

384
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,960
My instincts are right.

385
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,799
Why do you think she was hiding under the table like that?

386
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,769
She must be so jealous right now.

387
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,140
Jealous?

388
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,680
You said I was your first love!

389
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,419
You dated another girl just fine.

390
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,749
You couldn't forget about your 1st love for 10 years? That's nonsense.

391
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,119
That's possible!

392
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
I...

393
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,130
still can't forget about Chae Won.

394
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,569
You just couldn't date anyone because there was no one to see.

395
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,640
It's not that there's no one to see.

396
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,909
It's because I don't like anyone other than Chae Won!

397
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,640
A man should have conservative lips.

398
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,479
You can't let some random girl kiss you. Okay?

399
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,750
What do you mean I let her kiss me?

400
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,750
Hyun Ju kissed me out of nowhere. What could I have done?

401
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,390
You can't just let it happen when she kisses you.

402
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,930
"No. You can't do this." Can't you say that?

403
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,328
You accepted it because you liked it.

404
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,730
Well, I didn't hate it.

405
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:26,768
It was like an unexpected gift.

406
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,109
Did you like the gift?

407
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,509
Did you like it?

408
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,008
Did you like it?

(Gold Videos and DVDs)

410
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,759
Right. I don't deserve to feel jealous.

411
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,419
I'm fine as long as you're happy!

412
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,960
Okay. Yes.

413
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,269
Whatever!

414
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,170
Darn it.

(Gold Videos and DVDs)

416
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,549
- Sorry. - It's you, right?

417
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,950
It's not me.

418
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,319
My brother was kicking his feet, being all drunk.

419
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,089
Not that. The person who was running out of the bar,

420
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,730
wearing a trash can on her head.

421
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,700
Wasn't it you?

422
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,469
- No, it wasn't. - Yes, it was.

423
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,739
- Never. - Did you see it?

424
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,970
No. I didn't see it because I had my eyes closed.

425
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,839
I have no relish for peeking at others kissing.

426
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,569
You saw it.

427
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,980
She must be super jealous right now.

428
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,150
I'll get going.

429
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,289
How does it feel?

430
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,920
- What? - Are you fine with it?

431
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,358
About what?

432
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,519
Wasn't it upsetting...

433
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,460
even when you saw me kissing another girl?

434
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,769
There's nothing to be upset about.

435
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,369
Are you really okay...

436
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,640
even if I go far away?

437
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,140
That you want to send me away as quickly as possible?

438
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,049
Okay. I got it.

439
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,119
But...

440
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,650
let me ask you one last thing.

441
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,519
I don't care about time travel.

442
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,059
It doesn't matter which time zone you are from.

443
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,959
Whether you're from the past or the future,

444
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,099
you are still the same to me.

445
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:34,460
How about you?

446
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,230
In all those times you have lived,

447
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,339
was there any time that you liked me?

448
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,940
Not even for a moment?

449
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:47,109
I don't deserve to like you.

450
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,049
No, there wasn't.

451
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,309
I wanted to tell you if I ever got a chance...

452
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,710
to see you again.

453
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,910
That I liked you too.

454
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,349
That I missed you.

455
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,450
I missed you with all of my heart, Sun Jae.

456
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Here.

457
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,068
Why do you keep asking me to bring your underpants?

458
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,338
I'm a busy man.

459
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,939
Do you want me to go commando, then?

460
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,808
Also, why aren't you getting back my underpants?

461
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,209
Why do you want to get them back?

462
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,740
Just buy new ones.

463
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,109
I'll get going.

464
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,849
Get back home early.

465
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,349
Captain.

466
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,420
You're here.

467
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,318
The white truck which the kidnap victim,

468
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,420
- Im Sol, identified... - Yes.

469
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,390
"Im Sol?"

470
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,220
Did you say, "Im Sol?"

471
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,730
Why would I participate in an audition?

472
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,900
Hey, are you joining the army tomorrow?

473
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,170
No.

474
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,140
It's to show how determined I am.

475
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,579
You're here.

476
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,130
What happened to your hair?

477
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,099
Do you know why I shaved my head?

478
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,599
Why?

479
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,970
Sun Jae.

480
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,299
I...

481
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,539
want to...

482
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,750
do music.

483
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,490
You.

484
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,359
Were you this serious?

485
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,519
My friend.

486
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,789
Will you take...

487
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,059
the audition with me?

488
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay!

489
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,599
Let's do it!

490
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,440
Let's do it together.

491
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,839
The music.

492
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,680
Yes. The music.

493
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,450
Hey, stop crying.

494
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,920
Stop crying, jerk!

495
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,750
Why is your hair so short?

496
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,190
Sun Jae.

497
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,299
You're here.

498
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,230
I heard the audition is next week.

499
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,400
- What? - Hyun Su called and asked me.

500
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,899
I was going to talk about it.

501
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,970
I'll do it.

502
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,970
I heard you're about to get fired from the club.

503
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,769
It'll be better if you are on the air, won't it?

504
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,309
This easily?

505
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,480
Even if we fail the audition, it's not my problem.

506
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,779
I won't be excellent after practising for a few days.

507
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,890
I'll be there after the morning class.

508
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,619
See you later.

509
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,819
Okay.

510
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,630
- Get there safely. - Okay.

511
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,259
Get there safely.

512
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:09,569
Darn it.

513
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:11,980
He should have told me earlier.

514
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,509
Where did Hyun Ju go?

515
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,149
It's amazing. Someone's boyfriend is here with flowers.

516
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,619
Goodness. He's so handsome.

517
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,089
Does he go to our school?

518
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,900
How did you...

519
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,969
Why are you here?

520
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,630
I'm here to get back the underpants you took.

521
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,869
- This way. - Where are you going?

522
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,940
I told you not to come here.

523
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,079
How long did you wait for me?

524
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,750
- For a minute. - Lying.

525
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,818
- For five minutes. - I'm not a fool!

526
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,819
How long did you wait?

527
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,890
I waited for you until 87,000 leaves fell from that tree.

528
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,259
You're insane.

529
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,759
Tae Seong who is crazy about you...

530
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,400
has waited for you ever since we broke up.

531
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,799
Why? Why did you do that?

532
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,700
Did you...

533
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,440
like me?

534
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,599
No.

535
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,838
Why did you wait for me, then?

536
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,910
I loved you...

537
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:19,609
to death.

538
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,779
I loved you insanely...

539
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,910
until the universe burst into pieces!

540
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:25,880
Tae Seong.

541
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,150
I told you.

542
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,390
Im Sol.

543
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,019
You're my star forever!

544
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,259
Son of a gun!

545
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,460
I just wanted a bite.

546
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,900
How pathetic is this?

547
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,240
"Pathetic?" Okay. I'm sorry.

548
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm sorry for being pathetic. Gosh.

549
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,109
What are you doing?

550
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,809
What's with the flowers?

551
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,980
Flowers won't make me go back to you.

552
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,149
- Let's not jump the gun here. - What?

553
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,890
These aren't for you. They are mine.

554
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:04,750
Before I came here,

555
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,289
someone asked me out.

556
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,160
Good for you.

557
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,900
Here it is.

558
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,130
(Yeonseo University)

559
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,170
What about the underpants?

560
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:20,670
Why would I carry them with me?

561
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,669
Did you come all the way to get back the underpants?

562
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,509
No way. I didn't come here to give you that.

563
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,480
What is it, then?

564
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,420
Well.

565
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,289
I was going to look the other way,

566
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,089
but that's not who I am.

567
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,490
I came because I was worried.

568
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,619
I heard...

569
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,359
you got kidnapped last year.

570
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,930
You're Detective Kim's son.

571
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,868
Why did you live like that before, then?

572
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,009
Gosh. My ex-girlfriend speaks so nicely.

573
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,578
Anyway, don't tell anyone because it's a secret.

574
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,579
Okay?

575
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,339
Don't tell me you didn't tell your family...

576
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:02,980
after such a big incident.

577
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,119
What's the point? I'd just make the worry.

578
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,950
By the way, are you all right?

579
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,319
Did you get hurt back then?

580
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,259
I'm sitting here like this because I'm fine.

581
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,460
My dad is good at what he does.

582
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,259
He lost Mom,

583
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,230
but he is good at catching bad guys.

584
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,730
The perp will get caught soon, so don't worry about it.

585
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,339
Okay. Thanks...

586
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,039
for worrying about me.

587
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:43,749
Actually,

588
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,519
I'm saying this to you because you're Detective Kim's son.

589
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,759
Can you do me a favour?

590
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,990
"A favour?"

591
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,159
The perp of the Juyang Reservoir homicide case gets caught...

592
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,259
as Sun Jae saves me.

593
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,299
When he's about to get released from jail...

594
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,470
Later, in the year 2023,

595
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,710
please tell your father...

596
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,440
that he has to protect Sun Jae,

597
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,680
not me.

598
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,609
What are you talking about?

599
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,180
Protect what?

600
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,990
I can't tell you in detail.

601
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:18,789
Just tell him what I said.

602
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,390
Does that have to do...

603
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,960
with the perp of the Juyang Reservoir case?

604
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,199
You're surprisingly perceptive.

605
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,599
My dad is on that case, and you were the victim.

606
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,470
You wouldn't ask me a random favour.

607
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,369
You would have made a good detective if you studied hard.

608
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,809
But why the year 2023?

609
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,839
Well...

610
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,209
I can't tell you the reason.

611
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,750
Why don't you tell him yourself in 2023,

612
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,319
instead of asking me to do it?

613
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:49,119
When it comes, it won't be me, but the past me.

614
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,890
And she has no idea.

615
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,690
Ex-girlfriend, will you explain so that I can understand?

616
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,529
Well, it's...

617
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,470
Right. What's the point of hiding when Sun Jae found out about it too?

618
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,079
Actually, I...

619
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,079
am from the future.

620
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,190
You are a gift

621
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,930
- From the sky - She's so drunk.

622
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,319
In Hyuk.

623
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,250
Are you sure...

624
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,990
you didn't play this song to Sol?

625
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,190
To Sol?

626
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,759
Why would I play it for her?

627
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,329
Why? Was I supposed to play it to her?

628
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,269
How did she know the song, then?

629
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,970
Did she really listen to it in the future?

630
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,048
It's not going to be easy to find...

631
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,579
because almost all households have a truck like that.

632
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,989
Gosh. It's a shame there are no security cameras around here.

633
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,289
There's one in front of the police box.

634
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,558
Send me all the footage from that camera.

635
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,559
Pardon?

636
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,159
I don't think the footage from six months ago...

637
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,058
is still there because it's been a while.

638
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,000
No. I'm talking about the day of the fire.

639
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,799
If he drove the truck, the camera should have caught it.

640
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,069
"The market at dawn?"

641
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,809
Don't wait for me. Just go to bed.

642
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,069
- You can't come home tonight, then. - Hey, Sun Jae.

643
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,778
- I have good news. - "Good news?"

644
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,480
The rehabilitation center in the US.

645
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:59,750
Fortunately, an athlete before us cancelled his appointment.

646
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,419
That means you can get treated right away.

647
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,989
So I made the appointment without hesitation.

648
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,758
I heard we had to wait for months.

649
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,390
This must be fate.

650
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,558
Hey. I've been busy all day...

651
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,459
getting the flight tickets and all.

652
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,798
Check it when you get home.

653
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,400
Also, don't forget to take a leave of absence tomorrow.

654
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,068
When do I leave the country?

655
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,869
What? It's...

656
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,639
- It's very soon, but... - My goodness!

657
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,439
- What? - Gosh.

658
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,410
I'll trust you. Just tell me.

659
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,980
Which team will win the Korean Series this year?

660
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,278
I don't remember.

661
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,818
Even if I do, I can't tell you.

662
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,420
How can I trust you, then?

663
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,819
It's up to you to believe me or not.

664
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,589
But remember what I told you for 15 years...

665
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,700
and tell Detective Kim about it.

666
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,900
It's to save someone's life. Okay?

667
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,869
Does something happen to future Sun Jae?

668
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,369
Did he get hurt badly?

669
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,240
I said I can't tell you what happens in the future.

670
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,480
How can you ask your ex-boyfriend to protect another guy?

671
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,220
You're making me jealous.

672
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,989
Gosh. Flirting is so natural to you.

673
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,389
Goodness. What a ladies' man.

674
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,719
By the way, this area is a bit dark.

675
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,730
Here. Hold it.

676
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm not going to hold your hand.

677
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,059
I'm not talking about my hand.

678
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,469
Hold this, at least.

679
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,368
Stop joking around and go.

680
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,780
How far are you going to follow me?

681
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,079
I'll take you home.

682
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,780
That guy hasn't been arrested yet.

683
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,550
What if he comes looking for you?

684
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,389
It's okay. It won't happen yet.

685
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,519
"Yet?"

686
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,530
Yes, Mom.

687
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,130
What?

688
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:00,839
Why are you so late?

689
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,268
What is happening?

690
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,369
For goodness' sake!

691
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,239
Look who's here.

692
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,339
It's Sol's ex-boyfriend, Tae Seong.

693
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,480
- Mom. - Hello.

694
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:12,320
Gosh. It was the fire the other day, and it's water today.

695
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,019
I get to see you whenever we have a problem.

696
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,150
I love it.

697
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:17,419
It's cold.

698
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,119
Why is Sun Jae collecting water like that?

699
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:23,859
I asked him to come to help us.

700
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,559
- Grandma. - Do we let it get flooded, then?

701
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,900
Unbelievable.

702
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,669
Geum went to get Mr. Kim who fixed the water pipe before,

703
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,969
so we just need to wait a little. My goodness!

704
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,070
Still. This is crazy.

705
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,550
Hey. I'll do it. Give it to me.

706
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,510
Forget it.

707
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,849
Hey, can't you see your mom's arms are hurting?

708
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,289
You hold it.

709
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:53,658
I'll do it.

710
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,789
Will you, Tae Seong? Do you have some time?

711
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,760
Time is all I have.

712
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,829
I love it.

713
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,699
- Mom! - What?

714
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,070
Gosh. I love it.

715
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,340
Why is the water coming out nonstop?

716
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,510
Did other pipes break, too?

717
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,309
For goodness' sake.

718
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,579
Gosh.

719
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,980
Hey, Sol. Here.

720
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,859
Send them home now.

721
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,959
They came forward to help us.

722
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,329
I didn't call them.

723
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,400
Good.

724
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:38,900
I need to throw the water away.

725
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,670
- Gosh. - Hold this for a second.

726
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,710
- What? - Hold it.

727
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:50,849
I'll carry it for you.

728
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:52,980
Gosh.

729
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,349
He's so amiable.

730
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,920
Gosh. Why did they break up?

731
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,889
- Mom! - What?

732
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,599
Gosh, Tae Seong. With your pretty face,

733
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,629
you get things done pretty well.

734
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,829
I'm pretty, indeed, Mother.

735
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
"Mother?"

736
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,099
Come and hold it.

737
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,210
"Mother?"

738
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:26,079
I can't call her Father, can I?

739
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,190
Mom.

740
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,158
Look at our Sun Jae's arms.

741
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,829
Because he used to swim, they are so robust.

742
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,260
You can't compare my muscles...

743
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:42,230
to the one who just hangs around.

744
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,070
"Who just hangs around?"

745
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,599
Am I wrong?

746
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,039
Bok Soon, Mr. Kim is here,

747
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,980
so go upstairs right away.

748
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,079
- Is he here? - Yes.

749
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,249
Sol. Let's go to the rooftop to grab a big bucket.

750

751
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:00,649
- Mom, that's not it. - I know.

752
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,078
- Come on. - Gosh.

753
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,190
My goodness.

754
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,029
The water splashed all over me.

755
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,460
It was wet already, so why do you care?

756
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,198
- Gosh. - Hey.

757
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,599
It was wet already, so why bother?

758
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,469
Hey, hold it for a second again.

759
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,090
Gosh. She mopped it hard. Kim Tae Seong!

760
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,289
Darn it.

761
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,489
Do it right.

762
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,488
What do you mean?

763
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,190
If you're not going to help, leave.

764
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,829
Are you her son-in-law or what?

765
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,730
Who are you to tell me what to do?

766
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,069
Who are you to follow Sol here to collect water?

767
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,070
Her ex-boyfriend?

768
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,969
You're neither her friend nor her ex-boyfriend.

769
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:55,769
I'm her neighbour,

770
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,369
which is closer than a distant relative.

771
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,610
No. Since you got dumped, you're worse than a stranger.

772
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,179
Darn it, In Hyuk. You're a man with a big mouth.

773
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,050
I did go out with her once.

774
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,420
You didn't go out with her. You used her.

775
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,760
How can you be sure?

776
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,230
- What? - What if I really liked her?

777
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,170
What are you doing?

778
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,639
I'm not doing anything with you.

779
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,110
If I were to do something, I'd do it with Sol.

780
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,150
For goodness' sake.

781
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,619
Stop playing with Sol.

782
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,280
What do you know about her?

783
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,050
Darn it.

784
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,579
Grandma. Which pipe burst?

785
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,780
It was the pipe in the boiler room.

786
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,788
Mr. Kim is fixing it right now.

787

791

Please stop it!

792
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,599
Oh, my. This is so scary.

793
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,469
At this rate, it will be the end of us.

794
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:13,380

Hey, how could you let go of my hand?

798
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,459
I saved you.

799
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,619
You little...

801
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,558
Goodness. Thank you so much for your help.

802
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,299
- Thank you. - I don't know how to thank you.

803
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,159
You know what? Come upstairs and eat with us before you go.

804
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:12,070
- Mom. It's already past midnight. - What?

805
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,400
It's already that late?

806
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:15,739
Oh, no. I feel awful.

807
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,309
Then I guess you'll have to come back.

808
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,510
I'll cook you something nice.

809
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,909
Okay. Call me anytime.

810
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,010
Hold on. Oh, no.

811
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:24,749
The bus must have stopped running.

812
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,948
How will you get home, Tae Seong?

813
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,949
You should sleep over. Your clothes are wet too anyway.

814
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,619
I would be happy to.

815
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,019
He shouldn't.

816
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,589
He's right, Mom. Sol is a grown woman now.

817
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,488
Why do you keep letting guys sleepover at our house?

818
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,229
Gosh, I'll be in the house the whole night.

819
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,428
Nothing is going to happen.

820
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,230
Besides, Tae Seong isn't like that.

821

if they are bound to happen.

823
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,579
Then I don't know what to do. I feel awful.

824
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,649
I can just sleep over.

825
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,979
- It won't be uncomfortable for me. - Right?

826
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,110
He can sleep over at my house.

827
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,449
Yes. That will be better.

828
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,820
Yes.

829
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,920
But you guys are on good terms, right?

830
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,289
You guys didn't have a fight or anything just now. Right?

831
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:19,130
Gosh. That's silly. We're very close.

832
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,539
- We are? - Yes.

833
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,050
Do you have water?

834
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:37,650
Gosh.

839
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,139
Fine.

840

So must you sleep over here?

841
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,110
You said you would let me. Didn't you?

842
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,179
You changed your mind?

843
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,380
I thought we were close.

844
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,750
Hey. Then be quiet and go to sleep now.

845
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,690

I was joking.

848
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,429
Do you think I want to sleep on the same bed with you?

849
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,929
I'm going to sleep on the sofa.

850
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,969

00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,079
All right.

What are you doing here?

853
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,679
What?

854
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:44,389
Are you a night watch?

855
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,059
Are you worried that I might sneak into...

856
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,920
Sol's house when you go to sleep?

857
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,030
I can't say that possibility hasn't crossed my mind.

858
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:53,399
You and Sol must think...

859
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,329
that I'm some kind of jerk who doesn't know any better.

860
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,199

865
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,510
you feel threatened by me.

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,920
What?

867
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,889
Don't waste your energy, getting jealous of me for no reason.

868
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,690
Just focus on protecting yourself.

869
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,559
Otherwise, why would she come to me and ask me to protect you?

870
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,959
You have a big build too.

871
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,760
What do you mean?

872
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,230
She'll scold me if I give you any more details.

Is this the place?

908
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,670
Is Sun Jae flying out of Korea today?

909
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,309
Why is he leaving so suddenly without saying goodbye?

910
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,609
It's not sudden.

911
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,848
The coach has been asking him to go through rehab since last year.

912
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,449
Gosh. Maybe, we should've greeted him at the airport.

913
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,980
You mean to see him off?

914
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,719
Besides, the plane leaves at 7:30pm. So he'll depart in 1 hour.

915
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,590
We're already late.

916
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,190
That cold-hearted jerk.

917
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,530
Sun Jae.

918
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,629
Gosh. I barely managed to check in your luggage.

919
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,669
It was 23kg. We were pretty close to the weight limit.

920
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,999
- What? - I wrapped gochujang carefully.

921
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,139
Be careful with that, so it doesn't explode.

922
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,070
- The seaweed and laver flakes... - Dad.

923
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,309
Am I emigrating? Besides,

924
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,178
they'll put me on their meal plan.

925
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:29,439
Shut it, you jerk.

926
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,348
You'll be shedding tears of love...

927
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:32,949
at the thought of me whenever you eat.

928
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,519
Right. As soon as you arrive, call Coach An right away. Okay?

929
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,349
He'll pick you up personally.

930
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:39,518
I got it.

931
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:40,760
Gosh.

932
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,319
If you're worried, come with me.

933
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,959
I would love to go with you...

934
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,760
if I didn't have to run the restaurant.

935
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,799
Actually, we're getting meat today. I have to inspect it.

936
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,399
I can't be here right now.

937
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,500
Exactly.

938
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,099
Go back to the restaurant now.

939
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,868
Right. You're an adult now.

940
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,909
You can get on the plane on your own, right?

941
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:01,380
Okay. Gosh. I'm so proud of you, my son.

942
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,279
- I believe in you. - Okay.

943
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,550
- Okay. Have a safe trip. - Okay.

944
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,750
Right. You know that...

945
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:10,788
you have to take off your shoes for international flights, right?

946
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,320
- Of course, I do. - Okay.

00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,860
Why isn't Sun Jae here already?

950
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,630
Baek In Hyuk.

951
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:25,429
You.

952
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,400
Tell me the truth.

953
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,280
Well,

954
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,280
the truth is Sun Jae can't make it.

955
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,510
- What? - What?

956
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,250
- Hello. We're Eclipse! - Hello. We're Eclipse!

957
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,860
By the way, there are four people in your band.

958
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,320
Where's the last member?

959
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,590
Right. The vocalist. How come the vocalist isn't here?

960
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:53,960
I'll bring him right now.

961
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,159
Wait. Give me a second.

962
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:58,199
- It'll only take a second. - What's up with these guys?

963
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,079
Hello. I'm Baek In Hyuk, the vocalist.

964
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,219
This is an announcement...

965
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,659
for passengers on international flights.

966
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,889
(April 10, 7:40pm)

967
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,170
He really left.

968
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,400
What a relief.

969
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,820
I don't care about time travel.

970
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,989
It doesn't matter which time zone you are from.

971
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,960
In all those times you have lived,

972
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,820
was there any time that you liked me?

973
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,559
Not even for a moment?

974
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:33,960
No,

975
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,300
there wasn't.

976
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,369
I'm sorry that I lied.

977
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:39,630
Sun Jae,

978
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:42,500
but I'm more afraid of losing you again...

979
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,440
for the rest of my life than losing your affection.

980
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:49,809
So the only thing I can do is to push you away like a coward.

981
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:09,429
We passed!

982
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:13,400
Sun Jae! Your song helped us pass!

983
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,499
Hey, we should bow to Sun Jae.

984
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,710
Shall we? Which direction faces the US?

985
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,968
Who cares? Let's just do it.

986
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,679
- Thank you, Sun Jae! - Thank you!

987
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:28,179
I just need to find a way for me to stay safe.

988
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,269
Do you think you can remember anything else about the truck?

989
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,829
Given the behavioural characteristic of the culprit,

990
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,739
he might be on the run with his car.

991
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,769
Sun Jae.

992
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:24,969
Why...

993
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,739
Why are you running?

994
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,579
Why are you here?

995
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,360
No. Don't come close.

996
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,518
Don't come.

997
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,119
I told you not to come close!

998
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,840
Why didn't you go?

999
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,309
I'm going...

1000
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:33,809
anywhere.

1001
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,909
Why not?

1002
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,519
You should've gone to the US.

1003
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:44,090
Why didn't you leave Korea? You can't be here!

1004
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,960
You like me!

1005
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:51,159
I figured it all out.

1006
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,059
Why you keep pushing me away.

1007
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,969
I...

1008
00:54:58,769 --> 00:54:59,900
figured out everything.

1009
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:04,909
So...

1013

Just focus on protecting yourself.

1014
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,079
Otherwise, why would she come to me and ask me to protect you?

Why that day?

1021

reach you in the future?
