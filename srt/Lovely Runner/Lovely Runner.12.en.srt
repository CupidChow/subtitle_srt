(Episode 12)

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,769
It looks like you're in a good mood.

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,869
Yes, I am. I'm so happy.

9
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:39,939
By the way,

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,079
are you not going to say anything?

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,920
"It was cool. I was touched."

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,990
You should say such obvious things.

13
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,590
It was cool, of course.

14
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,219
How cool was it?

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,289
Well...

16
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,329
This much.

17
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,170
Come on. Only that much?

18
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,549
This much?

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,450
Gosh, I guess it was really cool.

20
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:26,590
When you go back,

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,090
should I sing a song for 20-year-old Sol?

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,260
Will she fall in love with me then?

23
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,640
Did you sing to show me?

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,709
Of course.

25
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,239
And I wanted...

26
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:49,010
to sing on stage once again.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,650
How did it feel doing it?

28
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,620
I'm not sure if I changed my mind...

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,219
or if it's because I know my future,

30
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,930
but what's for sure...

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,500
is that my heart was racing.

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,299
I told you.

33
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,830
Oh, right. Take this.

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,939
He gave it to me when I was going out after the concert.

35
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,539
What?

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,409
This is Mr. Kim's business card, isn't it?

37
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,180
What did he say?

38
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,879
Well,

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,849
he said he wanted to make Eclipse debut and sign a contract with us.

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,680
Really?

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,620
That's great for you, Sun Jae.

42
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,689
Does it make you that happy?

43
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,120
Of course, it does.

44
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,120
I thought I might've ruined your future.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,889
Do you know how worried I was?

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,900
I told you not to say things like that.

47
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,270
Sun Jae, I...

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,770
have nothing more to wish for now.

49
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:47,740
I have.

50
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,340
I wish...

51
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,650
time would pass by slowly.

52
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,150

(No Violence Allowed in Emergency Room)

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Excuse me.

55
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,610
Where's my father?

56
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,110
He's a police officer. I heard he had an accident.

57
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,620
Go behind the curtain at the end.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,969
Dad.

59
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,050
Are you crying?

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,590
Why am I yawning so much?

61
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,730
Oh, gosh. Dad?

62
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,600
Were you crying, thinking I was dead?

63
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,529
Me? I didn't cry.

64
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,529
I came because of something else.

65
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,240
- What are you doing here? - Don't put up a show.

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,870
You ran here because you were worried about me.

67
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:28,939
The paramedic called me...

68
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,139
and said things that made me think you were dying.

69
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,279
That's why I ran here in shock.

70
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,540
I got 20 stitches on my forehead.

71
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,649
And I sprained my neck a little.

72
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm the never-dying officer on the violent crime team.

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,220
"Never-dying," my foot. You're not invulnerable.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,889
So how were you injured?

75
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,129
The suspect of the Juyang Reservoir murder case was arrested today,

76
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,129
but he escaped...

77
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,129
- while being transported. - What?

78
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,529
Kim, the key suspect,

79
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,269
has been confirmed to have deliberately crashed the vehicle...

80
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,639
- on a national highway... - Oh, my gosh. What's going on?

81
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,899
- leading to a mountain road... - The front of the car...

82
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,540
- is completely destroyed. - escaped in the ensuing chaos.

83
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,040
- Are the people all right? - The police have decided...

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
to release a composite sketch of the suspect...

85
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,680
- to track him down. - Is it broken?

86
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,350
- The bathroom door is weird. - Please take a look at the sketch.

87
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,019
What? That's because the house is old.

88
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,050
- We should move into an apartment. - His name is Kim Young Soo.

89
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,389
He has a tall and robust build, standing at just over 180cm tall,

90
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,920
with long, mono-lidded eyes as a distinctive feature.

91
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,589
- The police are working... - Kim Young Soo?

92
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,959
with neighboring jurisdictions to track down the fugitive's movements.

93
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,699
We urge any citizens who may have witnessed the perpetrator...

94
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,300
to come forward with information without delay.

95

to the nearest police station to prevent further victims.

99

(Gold Videos and DVDs)

105
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,850
What? You want me to come here?

106
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,290
Yes. On May 10.

107
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,620
Can you please hide near this building that day?

108
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,589
On ten? Why?

109
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Do you think he will come again?

110
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:32,860
He was arrested near here. He won't come again.

111
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,970
He...

112
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,730
will probably come.

113
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,370
If it's because you're anxious,

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,439
Your witness protection measures are already in place.

115
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,610
If you're still worried,

116
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,079
how about discussing with your family...

117
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,040
the option of temporarily relocating your residence?

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,310
If Kim Young Soo notices that there are police officers near the place,

119
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,079
you'll never be able to catch him.

120
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,949
I'm not saying this because I'm anxious.

121
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,990
I'm asking you because he needs to be arrested.

122
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,850
Are you thinking...

123
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,389
of luring him here?

124
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,629
You can't do that. It's dangerous for you.

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,589
You can prevent him.

126
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,230
What on earth are you thinking...

127
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,899
I can't say why I'm doing this or what will happen here...

128
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,569
even though I want to.

129
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,769
Please don't ask me anything.

130
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,470
Can't you please just think that it's to protect me...

131
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,480
and do as I say?

132
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,879
Only then can you catch him.

133
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,079
What happens that day?

134
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,089
I said you should think about yourself only.

135
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,389
Why did you act like a fool and let something like that happen to you?

136
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,829
Just act like you don't know me.

137

Whatever I do, whatever happens to me, please...

138
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,029
Please just leave me alone.

139
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,069
No matter what happens...

140
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,879
How can I act like I don't know you, Sol?

141
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,420
Why are you trying to bear the consequences alone?

142
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,360

Are you okay?

151
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,740
Did you eat something wrong?

152
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,509
Why did you hug me and dive into the water?

153
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,710
- Were you trying to kill me? - No.

154
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,409
Sol was suddenly passing by.

155
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,980
I got flustered.

156
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,820
Was she passing by?

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,250
We were almost in trouble.

158
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,389
I told you, my Gold.

159
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,120
What would you have done without me?

160
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,659
I know.

161
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,259
Princess Hyun Ju, you're the only one for me.

162
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,830
By the way, our clothes are completely wet. What do we do?

163
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,169
Aren't you cold? Should we hug?

164
00:09:58,169 --> 00:09:59,840
- Yes. - Should we hug? Should we do that?

165
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,409
- It's cold. - It's cold.

166
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,870
- It's so cold. - Let's go.

167
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,679

- Oh, my. - Is it your core course?

170
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,149
No, it's an elective, but it was canceled.

171
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,820
They should've told us beforehand. I brought heavy books for no reason.

172
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,659
Give them to me.

Did everyone go out?

- Please excuse me for a moment. - What?

178
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,029
Give me a minute. I'll put the books in the room.

179
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,259
Let me look around the room.

180
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,830
What? No!

181
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,899
Why would you look around? There's nothing to see.

182
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,539
Because I'm curious.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,570
I want to see how your room looks.

184
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
It's not untidy like this every day.

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,950
It's usually very neat.

186
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,580
It looks so insecure.

187
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,519
I should install a window guard first.

188
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,620
What did you say?

189
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
Does this even lock properly?

190
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,559
Yes, it does.

191
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,899
Make sure to lock the window when you sleep.

192
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,399
And the stun gun you had before.

193
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,299
- Where is it? - Sorry?

194
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,840
Oh, right.

195
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,139
- This? - Yes.

196
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:55,850
Put this on your bedside when you sleep.

197
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,429
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

198
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,200
Someone might carry my girlfriend away. Why?

199
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,070
Because you're so pretty.

200
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,909
Can you say things like that too?

201
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,909
Who would carry me away?

202
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,990
Who is it?

203
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,720
You said Sol would be attending the core course lecture.

204
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,360
Was it canceled? What do we do?

205
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,730
Hide here. Let me handle this.

206
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,169
My hair is stuck.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Careful.

208
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,070
Let's go.

209
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,580
You stay here. Don't come out.

210
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,269
- Gosh. - Gosh.

211
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,830
Sorry.

212
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,769
I told you to stay inside.

213
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,320
Was the door closed...

214
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,759
earlier as well?

215
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,710
Gosh, what is it?

216
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,919
- There's no one? - No.

217
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,149
Let's go out.

218
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Now.

219
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,279
It's dangerous for you. Go out and report to the police quickly.

220
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,519
Okay.

221
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
No!

222
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,700
Geum!

223
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,240
You...

224
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:02,889
It's disgusting.

225
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Hey.

226
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,660
Despite the situation, you can't say I'm disgusting!

227
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,430
So it started around this time.

228
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,069
You hit on my friend!

229
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,839
No, Sol, I hit on him.

230
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,269
What were you trying to do here when there was no one around?

231
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,440
Why is she wearing my clothes?

232
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,710
I came to get changed for some unavoidable reasons.

233
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,609
It takes one to know one.

234
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,420
How about you? What are you doing with this guy in the empty house?

235
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,650
I carried her heavy books to put them in the house.

236
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,720
You followed her into the house, knowing there was no one,

237
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,190
because you had another intention, didn't you?

238
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,920
You got those weird stuff...

239
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,289
in the bag again, right?

240
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,299
I said those weren't mine.

241
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,900
Don't talk back to me!

242
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,900
Sister.

243
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,470
Let's settle this.

244
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,369
I'll give you guys my permission to date.

245
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,309
You give us your permission to date too.

246
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,579
You don't have to permit us. We're not breaking up.

247
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,750
How dare you talk back to me?

248
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,819
How dare you ask him to treat you like an older brother?

249
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,950
You can't say that. He's still your older brother.

250
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,349
That's rude.

251
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,259
"Rude?"

252
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,859
Don't get mad.

253
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,470
As expected, Princess Hyun Ju is the only one who cares about me.

254
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:24,170
My Gold, why are you treated like this at home?

255
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,180
I should just...

256
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,950
Do you want to get an electric shock again?

257
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,079
That wasn't strong enough, was it?

258
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,180
- Give me your neck. - Hold it in.

259
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,849
- Give me your neck! - Put it down.

260
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,049
What are you going to do with the apple?

261
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,890
I'm going to throw it at you. I can throw this too!

262
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,059
That girl...

263
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,299
Even after I warned her, she...

264
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,140
If you hate it that much, you should stop them.

265
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,009
When you gain something, you lose something.

266
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,809
Happiness always comes with a cost.

267
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,309
If I never got married,

268
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,650
I would have never been able to see my beautiful children.

269
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,980
I can't stop them when I think about Kkomul, their baby.

270
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,250
Are they meant to be together no matter what?

271
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,759
If there's a fate that doesn't change...

272
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,289
no matter how much you try to change,

273
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,930
it means the choice didn't change.

274
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,859
- What? - There are choices you make...

275
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,930
even though you know the consequences.

276
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,369
Because you like it.

277
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:28,970
You're right.

278
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,069
I gave her a chance to choose,

279
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,940
but she blew up the chance. I can't do anything about it.

280
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,349
I guess they love each other so much that they're inseparable.

281
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,519
Yes. Think that that's what it is.

282

Oh, right. When are you going to sign a contract?

283
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,490
I haven't heard an answer from In Hyuk yet.

284
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,289
I couldn't reach him for days.

285
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,430
Did something happen? I'm worried.

286
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,930
It's not time for you to worry about him.

287
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,339
Sol.

288
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,670
- You know... - Yes?

289
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,279
Never mind. It's nothing.

He will probably come.

Hey, were you at home?

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,720
What are you doing?

303
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,329
- Good morning. - What are you doing here?

304
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,430
Oh, my.

305
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,359
In Hyuk put up this house for rent and moved out.

306
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,529

Sol, you came too?

308
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,970
Are you all right?

309
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,809
He put up his house for rent? All of a sudden?

310
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,809
In Hyuk was shocked when he watched the show.

311
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,509
He immediately packed up and went to his hometown.

You didn't care about your friend because you were busy dating.

319
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,410
You forgot about friendship because you were crazy about love.

320
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,980
Do you know where his hometown is?

321

Why bother when we can drive there?

331
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,210
Did you get an imported car because you made some money?

332
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,579
With the money, you should have saved it to buy a house.

Of course.

Gosh. I didn't keep any water.

A man is locked in!

365
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,009
Gosh. That noise.

366
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,809
My face and brain are shaking.

367
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,980
Gosh.

368
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,349
I don't know what I'm eating because I can't focus.

369
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,119
Here!

370
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,559
Hey!

371
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,359
Make the dog stop barking!

372
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,900
That horrible dog!

373
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,940
No one can hear me because of the noise.

374
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,509
There's a construction as well as a barking dog.

375
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,819
Darn it.

376
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,190
I have no choice...

377
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,759
but to wait until Sun Jae gets home.

378
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,440
Are you kidding me? Push the gas.

379
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,609
Hey. What if Sunny gets scratched...

380
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,369
from a pebble?

381
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,210
It'll take forever to get there.

382
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:15,680
Why did you even get a new car?

383
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,109
You'll ruin it after treasuring it so much.

384
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,279
Goodness.

385
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,049
Korean people are so impatient.

386
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,690
They don't have room for relaxation.

387
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,349
Enjoy the view and all.

388
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,119
"The view?"

389
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,259
Well,

390
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,829
shouldn't you be faster than a cultivator, at least?

391
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,730
Hey. Is this the right address?

392
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:39,670
I think we're almost there.

393
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,609
It's a red-roofed house we can see right from this beach.

394
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,210
Hey.

395
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,480
Isn't that In Hyuk?

396
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,130
- What is he doing? - In Hyuk!

397
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,470
In Hyuk!

398
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:15,069
- In Hyuk! - Hey, In Hyuk!

399
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,609
Hey, In Hyuk!

400
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,809
In Hyuk!

401
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,579
- In Hyuk... - In Hyuk!

402
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,019
Sun Jae, are you all right?

403
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,150
- I'm all right. - Hey, In Hyuk.

404
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,349
- In Hyuk! - In Hyuk!

405
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,490
- In Hyuk! - Hey!

406
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,589
Oh, no!

407
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,970
Grab him. Come here.

408
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,069
What?

409
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,329
What are you doing here?

410
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,839
Hey, hold on.

411
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,940
Get out of here.

412
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,609
Hey.

413
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,009
What?

414
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,740
What is going...

415
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,450
- Is everyone all right? - Is this why you came back here?

416
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,880
- What? - It's not the end of the world.

417
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,180
You should persistently live on. Why do you try to die?

418
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,150
Who tried to die?

419
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,559
Gosh. The floatie I like has drifted far away now.

420
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,829
Why did you come here suddenly and make a fuss?

421
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,230
For goodness' sake!

422
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,029
You should have told us earlier. I'm all wet now.

423
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,200
"Told you?" You hit the water as you please.

424
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,339
No.

425
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,099
What should we do? Look!

426
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,509
Why? What?

427
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,980
No, Sunny!

428
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,910
Sunny, no!

429
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,609
No!

430
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,880
Sunny.

431
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,390
My Sunny!

432
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,759
No!

433
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,559
Take a photo of your memories.

434
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,259
Take a photo of your memories.

435
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,369
Take a photo of your memories.

436
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:53,240
Hey, there.

437
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,039
Do you want me to take a photo?

438
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,359
I heard your father treated In Hyuk as if he was his son.

439
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,529
I wanted to go and thank him, but I couldn't.

440
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,130
You drink makgeolli, right?

441
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,269
Okay, here.

442
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,039
I couldn't prepare much.

443
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,579
If I had known you were coming, I would have prepared properly.

444
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,609
Exactly. In Hyuk's friends came all the way from Seoul.

445
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,579
They'll criticize us for not treating them well.

446
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,619
No way.

447
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,920
These are a lot.

448
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,720
I thought it was a king's meal.

449
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,420
I still feel bad about it.

450
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,589
I'll get a chicken.

451
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,829
- No. It's enough already. - No.

452
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,799
Hurry and eat before he goes and kills a chicken.

453
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,200
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

454
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,099
By the way,

455
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,470
what's wrong with him?

456
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,650
Do you want a cup of makgeolli?

457
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,160
Gosh.

458
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,289
It's raining all of a sudden.

459
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,599
Good gracious.

460
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
Hello, this is Gold Videos.

461
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:07,940
Yes, Sol.

462
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,809
Where?

463
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:12,980
Danpo-ri? Where is that?

464
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,849
Why did you go that far?

465
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,720
How did the car get sunk into the sea?

466
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,220
Also, I know you're a grownup now,

467
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,349
but you shouldn't sleep out with your boyfriend.

468
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,690
The parents of Sun Jae's friend are here too.

469
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,930
Do you want me to hand my phone to them if you can't believe me?

470
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,630
Forget it.

471
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,329
Anyway, don't bother the parents.

472
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,130
Be nice and polite, and enjoy it before you come back.

473
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,730
Okay.

474
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,740
Gosh. They're really enjoying their youth.

475
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,309
What? Did he leave?

476
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:57,519
(Soon-to-be demolished)

477
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,160
(Soon-to-be demolished)

478
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,890
(Who is this development for?)

479
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,680
The water is so cold. Your hands will get chapped.

480
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,940
Gosh. Look how red they are.

481
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,920
It's okay.

482
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,849
Go back to Seoul at once.

483
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,789
How can we?

484
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,759
My Sunny is in the cold sea.

485
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,329
Gosh.

486
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,230
Why did I give them a ride?

487
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,700
This is annoying.

488
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,470
By the way, In Hyuk,

489
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
does your goat go on a picnic all on its own?

490
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,579
What?

491
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,640
Gosh. It ran out again.

492
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,279
Hey, go and catch Soondol.

493
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,279
Soondol!

494
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,220
- Soondol. - Soondol.

495
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,660
Hey, come here.

496
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,630
- Come here. - Hey.

497
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,099
- Soondol. - Come.

498
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,599
- Come. - Come here.

499
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,329
Soondol.

500
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:17,869
Soondol.

501
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,039
Hey, Soondol.

502
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,170
Goodness.

503
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,940
Here. Soondol.

504
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,309
Soondol!

505
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,950
Soondol.

506
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,750
- Sol, are you all right? - Yes.

507
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,549
Hey, Soondol.

508
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,519
- Soondol. - Soondol.

509
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,420
Close in.

510
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,660
- Stay there. - Wait right there.

511
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,160
Come here.

512
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,000
- No. - Is this okay?

513
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,099
Don't go that way.

514
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,599
I got him.

515
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,670
I finally got him.

516
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,440
Gosh. Why do you keep running away from home?

517
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,910
I'm glad we got him.

518
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,680
Let's go home. I'm exhausted.

519
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
- Let's go. - Okay.

520
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,929
- Hey, come here. - It's cold.

521
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,269
Gosh.

522
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,739
They said they'd wash up, but they're having fun.

523
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,869
It's pretty.

524
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,780
We said we'd come see the sea...

525
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,210
before you return.

526
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,150
And this is how we got here.

527
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
I know.

528
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,119
But I'm still happy that I came with you.

529
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,150
Me too.

530
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,260
Hey.

531
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,130
- Did you come here to date? - Yes.

532
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
"Yes?"

533
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,099
- Hey, get him. - Get him.

534
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,630
- Get him. Come here. - Hey.

535
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Sol!

536
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,539
Don't come this way.

537
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:00,969
Don't do it.

538
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,210
Don't even try it.

539
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,679
Come on!

540
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,480
- You are ridiculous. - Come here.

541
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,119
There.

542
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,090
Come here.

543
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,389
- Do you want to do it? - Try it.

544
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:29,699
Sol.

545
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,739
Are you really going to quit the band?

546
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,539
In Hyuk, to be honest,

547
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,480
I'm a bit scared.

548
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,719
For me to play music while all I used to do was swim.

549
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,349
It's a path I haven't taken before.

550
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,219
It's scary.

551
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,760
But...

552
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,429
I think I can do it well if I do it with you.

553
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,900
I don't know when I'll die,

554
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,900
but if there's the brightest moment...

555
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,699
in my youth,

556
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,969
I want it to be with you.

557
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,150
Whatever.

558
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,750
Hey.

559
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:58,090
You've become smooth-tongued after dating Sol.

560
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,389
You're a man, but you're crying.

561
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,119
- You fool. - Hey, what?

562
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,559
Hey, stop crying now.

563
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,929
- In Hyuk. - Okay. Let go of me.

564
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,070
- Gosh. - Goodness.

565
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,409
Here. Pick one.

566
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,639
I'll get this.

567
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,239
Gosh.

568
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,750
I'm relieved to see you smile after coming here.

569
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,659
I was worried you'd be terrified by the news on Kim Young Soo.

570
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,599
I'm not terrified. I'm all right.

571
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:47,340
But why do you keep worrying about me recently? It's unlike you.

572
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,210
Why? Do you regret losing me?

573
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,639
Goodness. You should have treated me well when you went out with me.

574
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,780
The bus has left already.

575
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,480
I know.

576
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,679
I realized it after the bus left.

577
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,949
I really liked you back then.

578
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:04,949
I'm telling you I didn't use you.

579
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,619
I know it's late,

580
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,059
but if that hurt you before,

581
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,030
this is the truth, so get it over with.

582
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,639
Okay. Thank you for telling me now, at least.

583
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:24,469
Gosh. My self-esteem is boosted...

584
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,639
because the popular boy at our school had really liked me.

585
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,809
I'm not as bad as you think.

586
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,679
I know.

587
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,579
Even though I told you such stuff,

588
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:38,119
I know you're a good person.

589
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,389
Thanks to someone, I hear that I'm a good person.

590
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
Tae Seong.

591
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,269
Did you buy ice cream?

592
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:51,500
Guys, pick one.

593
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,380
Hey, move over.

594
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,099
Wait.

595
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,440
Where's my phone?

596
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,380
You had it when you called your mom.

597
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,750
Yes. I put it in my pocket.

598
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,550
Gosh. Did I drop it somewhere?

599
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,380
You fell while catching the goat.

600
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,050
Maybe you dropped it then.

601
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,760
- Sol, are you all right? - Yes.

602
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,500
I think so.

603
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,230
Let's go and check.

604
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:56,570
You two can get back.

605
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,489
(Samwon Supermarket)

606
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,980
- What was that? - What?

607
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,849
No. It's nothing.

608
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,159
I'll go and find it, so stay right here.

609
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:30,889
I found it!

610
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,400
Sol?

611
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,630
Sol.

612
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,469
Where is she?

613
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,679
Sol!

614
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,750
Sol!

615
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,619
Im Sol!

616
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,190
Sol, Im Sol!

617
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,219
Sol!

618
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:01,889
Sol!

619
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,030
You can't disappear without telling me...

620
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,269
when you don't have your phone.

621
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:11,900
Sun Jae.

622
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:15,969
Why are you sitting here like this?

623
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,280
- Did you fall? - What?

624
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
Yes.

625
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,849
I came to see the view, but I tripped.

626
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,119
Let me see.

627
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,389
You're not hurt.

628
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,889
How are your ankles? Do they hurt?

629
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,130
Let's hurry back.

630
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,130
It's getting dark and scary.

631
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:44,469
Okay.

632
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,539
I told you to stay right there.

633
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:54,739
Why did you roam around without being afraid?

634
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,909
I'm sorry.

635
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,449
Why are you overprotective these days?

636
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,550
Sol.

637
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:05,449
Do you...

638
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,019
have something to tell me?

639
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,269
No, I don't. Why?

640
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,369
It's just...

641
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,239
I want you to tell me everything when you're hurt and worn off...

642
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,239
without hiding anything.

643
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,409
Don't try to bear it alone.

644
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,050
Okay. I'll do that.

645
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,820
You're lying.

646
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,989
You're not going to tell me to protect me.

647
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,360
But Sol,

648
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,829
no matter how hard you try to hide it,

649
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,099
I'll come to you that day.

650
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:51,969
This is the choice...

651
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,699
I cannot avoid.

652
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:00,980
Let's go.

653
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,210
Okay.

654
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,190
I'm so hungry.

655
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,429
Darn it. I screamed profusely.

656
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,159
My voice went hoarse.

657
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,170
Somebody help me!

658
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:29,539
Help me!

659
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,670
Darn it. It's making me hungrier.

660
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,150
I'm starving here. When will you come home, my son?

661
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,559
Yes. That's it.

662
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,099
I should use my firm body to break down the door...

663
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,599
and escape.

664
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:05,940
Darn it. I should've thought of this sooner.

665
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,840
The door is already worn down anyway.

666
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:09,550
It's about time that I get a new door.

667
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:32,969
What's going on?

668
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:34,869
Did everyone go somewhere?

669
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,940
We're all going fishing to catch webfoot octopuses.

670
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,440
Come to the dock right away.

671
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,909
We have to set out in 30 minutes.

672
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,079
What is it? What did it say?

673
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,889
They want to go fishing for webfoot octopuses.

674
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,050
Really?

675
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,619
Then should I change into something else?

676
00:45:58,829 --> 00:45:59,960
Do you want to go?

677
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,630
I don't want to go.

678
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,940
It's been 30 minutes already. Why aren't they coming?

679
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,719
I knew it.

680
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,719
I knew this would happen. Gosh.

681
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,690
Dad. Let's go.

682
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:31,460
- Go. - Okay.

683
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,659
Remove the rope. Then get on the boat quickly.

684
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,269
- Let's go. - Wait. We're not taking them?

685
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:37,469
Hey, I don't want to go either.

686
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,670
- No. - Hey.

687
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,369
You need to go and catch the webfoot octopuses with us.

688
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:41,500
- Go back in. - Gosh.

689
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:45,639
Dad, let's go!

690
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,510
My friend.

691
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,579
Have a blast!

692
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,679
- No! - Gosh.

693
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,949
No!

694
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,969
Do you want to catch a cold? Why didn't you dry your hair?

695
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,170
How can I dry my hair? I don't know where the dryer is.

696
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,400
It's not my house.

697
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,239
Come here.

698
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,380
Eat them.

699
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,989
Why are you staring at me? Have the strawberries.

700
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,329
Just because.

701
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:47,639
By the way,

702
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,570
you won't have to use the hair conditioner.

703
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:51,139
There was no hair conditioner.

704
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,340
Because you're in perfect condition.

705
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,039
You've been going easy with those cringy jokes.

706
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,949
- Wait. Are you a deer? - What is it this time?

707
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:59,449
Why do you keep melting my heart, my sweet dear?

708
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,050
It's embarrassing, so stop it.

709
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,260
Wait. You're not laughing.

710
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:08,760
Gosh, you smell so nice.

711
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,559
- Like the perfect boyfriend? - Correct.

712
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,829
You find these jokes funny?

713
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm trying to make you laugh.

714
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,030
These jokes used to make you laugh all the time.

715
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:21,639
No strawberries for me?

716
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:01,610
Soondol!

717
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,949
Where... Go in there.

718
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:17,289
Then I should go inside and get some sleep.

719
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,960
Where will you sleep?

720
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,900
In Hyuk's parents told me to sleep in the guest room.

721
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:26,539
Sleep tight.

722
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:27,900
Then...

723
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:29,940
- where should I sleep? - You?

724
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,550
You can sleep in the tent there.

725
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,909
- But I'm a guest too. - What?

726
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:43,920
Hey!

727
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,050
So what?

728
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,090
Are you saying you'll sleep in the same room?

729
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,329
I was just joking. Don't look so shocked.

730
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,400
Go in and get some sleep.

731
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,199
But...

732
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,699
call me if you're scared.

733
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:06,170
Why would I be scared?

734
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,239
Sol.

735
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,039
You've never slept in a house in the countryside, right?

736
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:10,710
It gets really scary at night.

737
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,650
Because it's so quiet here, you can hear all kinds of things.

738
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,750
You know,

739
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,920
there are ghosts too.

740
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,820
I see.

741
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,920
But I'm not scared of ghosts.

742
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,159
Sleep tight.

743
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,000
(Love)

744
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,360
No!

745
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,099
What's wrong?

746
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,039
I saw a ghost over there.

747
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:10,110
- What? A ghost? - Yes.

748
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,510
A virgin ghost in the white dress.

749
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,510
Didn't you hear the sound of the ghost just now?

750
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,079
That was so scary.

751
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,750
What if it shows up again?

752
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,849
Is that so?

753
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,920
Then I'll sleep in the tent.

754
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,260
What?

755
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,730
You want to sleep there where the ghost showed up?

756
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,230
No.

757
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,230
Are you worried that I might try something?

758
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,769
You heard what my father said the other day, right?

759
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,110
I'm pure like the oxygen.

760
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,039
I didn't have any kinds of dirty thoughts. Not even...

761
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,980
Not even a little bit.

762
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,679
So you really came here because you're scared of a ghost?

763
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:54,719
Yes.

764
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,050
On top of that, it's really cold out there.

765
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,789
Gosh, the draft...

766
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:01,590
came over like this. So the tent went like this.

767
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,460
The sandstorm kept coming into the house.

768
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,159
I couldn't get any sleep. And the tent kept...

769
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:09,130
You little...

770
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,800
You could've said you wanted to be together.

771
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,699
Why did you even try to lie when you're a bad liar?

772
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,199
If I say so,

773
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,440
would you let me sleep in here?

774
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:18,769
No.

775
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:23,280
All right. Look. I divided the room.

776
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,980
I won't go over this line. Okay?

777
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,420
This is nice.

778
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:30,889
What happens if you cross over the line?

779
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,190
Haven't you drawn a line on a desk in elementary school?

780
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,719
Anything that comes over the line will be mine?

781
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,030
So you know the rule.

782
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,460
So you should also be careful not to cross the line.

783
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,260
Aren't you tired? Let's go to sleep.

784
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,699
Why did you come over the line?

785
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,139
I guess I crossed the line.

786
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:59,239
Remember the rule?

787
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,539
Does it mean my arm...

788
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,750
belongs to you now?

789
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,880
It's mine.

790
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,449
Here. Take it.

791
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,750
But how will you take it?

792
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,989
It's not like you can cut it off.

793
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,059
You give me no choice.

794
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:23,429
All of you should be mine.

795
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,469
How nice. Let's go to sleep like this.

796
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:42,050
What's this sound?

797
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,420
That's the sound of the ghost.

798
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,019
Dear me. I'm so frightened.

799
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:00,969
Sol.

800
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,070
Yes. Sun Jae.

801
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,909
How long do we have left?

802
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:13,650
I'm not sure.

803
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,079
I hope you don't have to go back.

804
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,260
I hope you get stuck in this time...

805
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:23,219
and never go back.

806
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,599
I don't want...

807
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,400
tomorrow to come.

808
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,369
Should we break the clock?

809
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,510
Should we?

810
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:44,650
Let's try that.

811
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:51,619
Sun Jae.

812
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,519
Yes. Sol.

813
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,019
If...

814
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:58,059
tomorrow...

815
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,530
No.

816
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:04,469
If today ends up being my last day here,

817
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:07,670
don't be so sad.

818
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:11,539
Okay.

819
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,610
Don't cry. Okay?

820
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,880
I won't cry.

821
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,550
I like you.

822
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,349
I thought I would regret it...

823
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:57,690
if I left again without telling you how I felt.

824
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,159
I like you, Sun Jae.

825
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,739
I love you.

826
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:19,639
I love you, Sol.

827
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,980
You are...

828
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:05,889
my last hope.

829
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,800
What's this?

830
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,969
Help me.

831
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,769
Hey!

832
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:25,739
Is that you, Mr. Ryu?

833
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,210
Yes! It's me.

834
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,179
Help me.

835
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,449
Gosh. What's going on?

836
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,019
Help me.

837
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,820
I'm stuck in the bathroom.

838
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,760
You're stuck in the bathroom?

839
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,690
Oh, my. What should I do?

840
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,099
You know what? Let me go in there and open the door for you.

841
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:54,570
You can't come in here because the door is locked.

842
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:56,639
Call 911.

843
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,610
Call 911.

844
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,639
Call 911?

845
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:02,039
Call 911!

846
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:06,150
Are you okay?

847
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,420
Mr. Ryu!

848
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:09,980
Mr. Ryu!

849
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,590
Mr. Ryu!

850
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:13,860
Mr. Ryu!

851
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,090
Please call 911 now!

852
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,760
The door is locked.

853
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,300
Can't I just break down this door?

854
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:26,329
I've tried, but it's not possible!

855
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,639
I served in the Marines!

856
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:30,340
I tried to use my firm body to break it down.

857
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,570
But I think I fractured my shoulder.

858
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,809
Okay. Step back.

859
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:38,050
- Step back. - Gosh. I think I broke my bone.

860
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,820
Here it goes!

861
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,670
Are you okay?

862
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,769
Mr. Ryu.

863
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:03,239
Thank you for rescuing me.

864
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,679
Let's have the parboiled octopus for dinner.

865
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:16,050
Bye,

866
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,050
Sunny.

867
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,269
Hey, Kim Tae Seong.

868
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:32,500
Come already. Let's go.

869
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,699
You should stay for one more day.

870
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,840
I have to go back today.

871
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,139
But I'll come back.

872
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,860
Do you want to listen to music?

873
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,260
Sol.

874
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,260
Sol?

875
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,469
Did you fall asleep?

876
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,880
Where am I?

877
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,210
What's wrong?

878
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,690
What am I doing here with you?

879
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Sol. Why all of a sudden...

880
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,530
Did something happen to you?

881
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,599
Who are you?

882
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,070
Don't tell me...

883
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,739
Did you...

884
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,050
go back?

885
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,150
Let go of me.

886
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:56,079
- Sol. - Don't follow me.

887
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:59,590
I'm a bit confused right now.

888
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,989
I'll go back alone. I'm sorry.

889
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:31,590
If...

890
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:33,690
tomorrow...

891
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,420
No.

892
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,230
If today ends up being my last day here,

893
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,159
don't be so sad.

894
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,360
Okay.

895
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:46,570
Don't cry. Okay?

896
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:50,300
I won't cry.

897
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:39,320
Im Sol!

898
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,090
Sol!

899
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,230
My future has changed.

900
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,639
Sol!

901
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,170
Sun Jae.

902
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,039
What are we going to do?

903
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,449
I'll change my fate on my own.

904
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:09,780
Sun Jae.

905
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,789
This time,

906
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,349
please don't come to me.

907
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,489
(Lovely Runner)

908
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:22,360
We can meet again in the future and come back here.

909
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,289
I desperately hope this isn't the last time.

910
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,460
She said she was with me?

911
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:31,130
Sun Jae. Where's Sol right now?

912
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:33,070
She pretended to have gone back.

913
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,570
Detective, please save me.

914
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,139
Do you really believe Kim Young Soo will show up here today?

915
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,679
Did her future change?

916
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,880
Sun Jae!

917
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,880
