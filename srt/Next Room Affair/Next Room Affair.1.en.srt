00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,599
[laughing]

2
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,936
What's with you?
Not there, come on!

3
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,356
Come on, we always do that.

4
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:52,778
[muffled chatter]

5
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:56,039
It's okay, I'll take care of you.

6
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,072
Come on! Let's do it later!

7
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,460
- I know where you're ticklish.
- Not there!

8
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,819
Ramon!

9
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,513
Come on!

10
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,642
[muffled chatter]

11
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,950
I'm close!

12
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,601
It's so early,
why are you in a rush?

13
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,438
Babe!

14
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,859
- You forgot your ID.
- I know right?

15
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,570
- Hey, you better behave.
- Babe!

16
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,737
Babe.

17
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,948
Come home early, okay?

18
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,597
Taho...

19
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,655
- Hi!
- Oh, why are you late?

20
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,323
Got stuck in traffic.

21
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,951
But don't worry,
I'm here now.

22
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
Come in.

23
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,124
[muffled chattering]

24
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,754
Not there, it tickles!

25
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,402
Stop it!

26
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,650
Shit...

27
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,950
Shit!

28
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,793
Shit!

29
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,695
- Does it feel good?
- So much!

30
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,088
Shit!

31
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,881
Shit!

32
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,220
So good!

33
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,613
Oh shit!

34
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,992
It feels so good!

35
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:00,712
Really?

36
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,316
It feels so good!

37
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,858
That felt so good...

38
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,889
It's hot, isn't it?

39
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,183
But it's cloudy.

40
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,477
You're right.

41
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,146
Are you the new tenant?

42
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,316
Yeah, I moved in just last week.

43
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,736
It's quiet here every Sunday.

44
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,155
The tenants head home
to their provinces.

45
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,325
It's okay. I like it
better when it's quiet.

46
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,870
Me too.

47
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,636
Alright, well, I'll go ahead.

48
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,649
- Good evening.
- Good evening!

49
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,398
- Good evening.
- Good evening!

50
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,658
Excuse me!

51
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,535
Excuse me!

52
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,412
Excuse me!

53
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,455
Is there someone inside?

54
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
Excuse me!

55
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,334
Oh! There's no one there.

56
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,003
She left to go to Cavite.

57
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,881
Oh, I was hoping
to get my lights fixed.

58
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
The bulb burned out.

59
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,759
Where is it?
I'll check.

60
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,344
Okay, if you can do it.

61
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,595
Thank you.

62
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,281
Do you have an extra bulb?

63
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,158
Yeah, wait, I have one.

64
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,835
Here.

65
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,530
There. It's okay now.

66
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,823
Wow. Thank you.

67
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,825
I thought I was going
to eat in total darkness.

68
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,910
It's okay if you eat in the dark.

69
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,871
It's exciting.

70
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,748
I haven't tried it yet.

71
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,958
Try it next time.

72
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,962
I'll go now.

73
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,338
Thank you.

74
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,783
I'll probably do double duty tonight.

75
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,161
Okay. Take care.

76
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,163
Could you please
close the door for me?

77
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,956
Yeah, I'll handle it.

78
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,999
Okay.

79
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,517
You're just on time,
she just left.

80
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,702
You're so beautiful.

81
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,422
Sit down.

82
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,549
Thank you.

83
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,094
How are you?

84
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,972
I'm doing good. You?

85
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,056
I'm fine too.

86
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,477
I prepared something for you.

87
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,229
- Wow.
- Because you're special.

88
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,106
You're really prepared, huh?

89
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,817
Of course, anything for you!

90
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,492
I'll do it.

91
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,369
I'll do it myself.

92
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
Okay.

93
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,259
You missed me, didn't you?

94
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,855
- I missed this.
- Really?

95
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
Mhm!

96
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,458
Shit. So good!

97
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,414
See? I told you!

98
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,375
- You're right.
- Yeah!

99
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,462
- You're so sexy!
- Hey!

100
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,340
So good.

101
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,227
Thank you.

102
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,104
Take care.

103
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,397
You too.

104
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,899
I enjoyed.

105
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,216
Hi.

106
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,051
You're the new tenant?

107
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,886
Yes.

108
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,806
- I'm Mara, by the way.
- Lea.

109
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,974
You're quiet, aren't you?

110
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:47,951
That's how I am.

111
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,186
I don't have anyone to talk to.

112
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,736
Is he your husband?

113
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,029
Partner.

114
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,258
We've been together for eight years,
not yet married.

115
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,033
He doesn't want
to propose yet.

116
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,786
He's not here?

117
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,081
He has work. Sometimes he
isn't here during the evening.

118
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,334
Have you been living here for long?

119
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,087
About two years.

120
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,798
Okay.

121
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,258
Nice to meet you.

122
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,427
Nice to meet you, Lea.

123
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,999
You're up early.

124
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,794
I haven't slept yet.

125
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,213
What's that?

126
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,923
Insomnia?

127
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,759
Do you need help?

128
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,679
I'm fine.

129
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,147
Thanks.

130
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,149
You're welcome.

131
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,318
What's your perfume?

132
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,570
That's just my shampoo.

133
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,865
It smells good.

134
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,243
What's your name, by the way?

135
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,911
Lea.

136
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,039
Okay. I'll go inside.

137
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,708
Hello!

138
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,668
Do you know how to fix a sink?

139
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,670
Why? What's wrong?

140
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,005
It's leaking.

141
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,300
Let's go check it out.

142
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,759
Come on.
Let's go inside.

143
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,099
- Where is it?
- There.

144
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,559
Oh, here it is.

145
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,570
Seems like the valve is loose.

146
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,447
Do you have a wrench?

147
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,781
I don't have one.

148
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,077
Let me do this...

149
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,375
The pressure's a bit weak.

150
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,836
I'm going to borrow a wrench.

151
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,380
Thank you so much.

152
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,220
Are you always this quiet?

153
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,431
I just don't know what to say.

154
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,165
What? Why?

155
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,669
Nothing.

156
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,065
So good!

157
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:52,629
You can't sleep?

158
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,345
I can't.

159
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:56,717
What about you?

160
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,615
Trying to.

161
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,827
Do you love her?

162
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,581
It's complicated.

163
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:10,266
Are you just trying to
make me feel better?

164
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:12,626
No.

165
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,213
That's the truth.

166
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,966
Then why are you here?

167
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,845
I don't know.

168
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,474
Okay.

169
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,727
I don't really care anyways.

170
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,378
No goodbye kiss?

171
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,218
Take care.

172
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,919
I'm close... I'm close!

173
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,779
Miss me?

174
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,239
Yes.

175
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,691
Just relax.

176
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,569
Want to explore something?

177
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:32,673
Just relax.

178
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,454
I love you.

179
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,289
Louder!

180
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,541
I love you.

181
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,917
Okay, fine.

182
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,712
Because of that,
here's your reward.

183
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,891
Harder!

184
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,495
You feel so good...

185
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,888
I'm close! I'm so close!

186
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,634
I didn't see you last night.

187
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,762
I was reviewing.

188
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,181
Good girl.

189
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,891
Don't! Someone might see.

190
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,018
You're too paranoid.

191
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,359
You seem busy lately.

192
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,985
Yes.

193
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,654
Busy with work.

194
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,030
You know how it is.

195
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,617
Oh, you're working.

196
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,498
Okay. I'll go ahead.

197
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,639
Morning!

198
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,349
Morning!

199
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,686
Hey. I have a question for you.

200
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,020
What is it?

201
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:38,068
Do you know the feeling
that there's something wrong?

202
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,488
But you don't know why.

203
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,286
What do you mean?

204
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,830
Like there's something
going on with Ramon.

205
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,626
Last night, when I got home,
he was already asleep.

206
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,297
But the bed smelled
like a woman's shampoo.

207
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,299
And...

208
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,177
Look.

209
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,720
I saw this on the table.

210
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,971
Whose is that?

211
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,349
I don't know.

212
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,019
It's not mine.

213
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,232
You're really quiet, huh?

214
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,986
Sorry. I don't know
what to say.

215
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,533
Anyway, I'm sorry
for inconveniencing you.

216
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,107
Shit!

217
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,567
Damn it!

218
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:28,989
Why?

219
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,825
Damn it!

220
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,765
Damn it!

221
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,143
Damn it!

222
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,107
Damn it!

223
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,702
What do you think of me?

224
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,538
An idiot?

225
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,333
I read all of it, Ramon!

226
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,502
All your messages!

227
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,713
You even took pictures!

228
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,883
You didn't even bother
deleting them, huh?

229
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,847
You didn't even think
about me?

230
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:44,398
You know, I'm so tired
from working so many shifts.

231
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,568
You didn't even think
about what I felt?

232
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,365
Not just one.

233
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,992
There are many more.

234
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,244
What's with that?

235
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,165
Every week, there's a new one?
Huh? Damn you!

236
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,381
Why can't you look at me now?

237
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,383
Is it because it's true?

238
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,387
Is it true? Tell me!

239
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,392
I gave everything to you.

240
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,562
Everything you wanted.

241
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,733
Nobody else took care of you!

242
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,736
Just me!

243
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,698
It hurts so much.

244
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,243
Mara.

245
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:40,996
Mara, I'm sorry.

246
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,959
Say that to your other women!

247
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,295
Me?

248
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,881
I don't want this anymore.

249
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,008
Let's end this.

250
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,763
Damn it!

251
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm so useless!

252
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,907
Damn it!

253
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,836
Damn it!

254
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,587
Damn it!

255
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,523
- Whatever.
- Lea!

256
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,197
Wait!

257
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,586
Sorry.

258
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,300
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

259
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,801
No.

260
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,722
I don't know where I should go.

261
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,058
Why? What happened?

262
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,396
She's gone.

263
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,398
She left.

264
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,402
I can't blame her.

265
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:20,989
Why are you here?

266
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,827
I don't know.

267
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:46,932
Have you ever felt like
you don't belong here

268
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,852
but you have no where else to go?

269
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,687
Always.

270
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,899
I thought you love her?

271
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,571
I love her.

272
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,532
I still love her.

273
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,162
But, it's so bland.

274
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,668
I thought that's what I'm looking for.

275
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,962
But, it's not.

276
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,673
You know what?

277
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,174
You're just drunk.

278
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,236
I'm sober enough
to know what I'm saying.

279
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,770
Lea, I want to forget.

280
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,275
Me too.

281
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,723
You're leaving?

282
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,936
Yes.

283
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,648
Where are you going?

284
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,695
To Batangas.

285
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,321
Mara is there.

286
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,908
I need to talk to her.

287
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,494
We might be able to fix this.

288
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,914
Do you think she
will still accept you?

289
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,626
I don't know.

290
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,713
But I need to try.

291
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,175
Aren't you going to
say goodbye to me?

292
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,928
What for?

293
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,473
For me!

294
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,349
Lea, you can handle yourself.

295
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,520
Can I really?

296
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,323
Lea, I'm sorry.

297
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,243
I didn't mean to hurt you.

298
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,578
You wanted that.

299
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,080
You just don't care.

300
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,335
Lea, you're still young.

301
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,588
You'll forget me eventually.

302
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,218
Do you think I want to forget you?

303
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,305
You need to forget me, Lea.

304
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,017
You know what?
It's easy for you to say that.

305
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,228
Because you're the one
leaving me behind.

306
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,525
Lea.

307
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,197
Okay.

308
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,574
It's over.

309
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,368
You enjoyed it.

310
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,579
Now, you need to leave.

311
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,414
You'll go back to her.

312
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:04,958
What about me?

313
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,459
What about me?

314
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,963
Am I just nothing to you?

315
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,510
It's not like that, Lea.

316
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,262
Then what?

317
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:18,972
What am I?

318
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,267
I don't know.

319
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,894
I didn't plan for this.

320
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,565
But you wanted it, right?

321
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,450
You can't even think
of a reason for me.

322
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,331
You shouldn't have knocked
on my door that night.

323
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,210
I know.

324
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,630
But I tried, right?

325
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,759
Because all of that means
something to me, Lea.

326
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:01,180
Just stay here.
Why do you have to leave?

327
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,309
If I won't leave now,

328
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,936
then I won't be
able to leave at all.

329
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,442
Don't leave.
Just stay here.

330
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,819
I can't.

331
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,322
What?

332
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,121
Fine.

333
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,456
Leave!

334
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,966
I'm sorry.

335
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,936
Bring that down.
Oh, that was close!

336
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,648
You're so handsome
when you lift things.

337
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,691
Really?

338
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,611
- Hi, neighbor.
- Hello.

339
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,572
Hello. We're the new tenants
in Ramon's apartment.

340
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,823
Do you know him?

341
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,533
Not much.

342
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,285
I'm Tin.

343
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,454
He's Paolo, my boyfriend.

344
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:12,722
Lea.

345
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,999
Nice to meet you.
Sorry for being so loud last night.

346
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,209
It's okay.

347
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,211
I'm really sorry.

348
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,588
It's nice here.
It's quiet.

349
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,715
Yes. It's really quiet here.

350
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:29,138
- Okay. I'll go ahead.
- Sure. Nice meeting you.

351
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,557
- Come on, let's go.
- Your eyes...

352
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,518
They should only
be looking at me!

353
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,644
Of course.

354
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,771
- Oh!
- Oh no!

355
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,486
- Can you do it?
- Yes, I can do it.

356
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,404
I'll be the one to hold this.

357
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,634
- Can you do it?
- Can I get a kiss first?

358
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,659
Oh!

359
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,160
- Oh, you!
- That was one!

360
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,579
- Let's go!
- Next time, on the lips.

361
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,122
Geez!

362
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,257
- Geez!
- Can I get another kiss?

363
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:08,444
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, you! Let's go!

364
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,512
I told you...

365
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:41,080
Paolo!
