This way, Miss.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,940
It's rare to see you here.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,860
Please come inside. Please.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,380
I'm going to drink a bit more today.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,940
A beautiful girl has arrived.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,220
Please come in.

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,180
[No male guests allowed]
Sir, you can't go in.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,980
Why?

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,940
She can, but I can't?

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,260
We don't serve male guests here.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,940
You should go somewhere else.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,660
You...

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,260
Please come in.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,660
This way, please.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,740
I can't let Ying take risks alone.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,540
I need to come up with a plan.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,500
Ah, yes.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,740
Miss, I haven't seen you before.

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,620
Is this your first time
at the South Wind Pavilion?

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,620
Don't be nervous, just follow me.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,260
Sir, may I go in?

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,580
Please.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,220
Thank you, sir.

26
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,380
Excuse me.

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,580
Miss,

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,020
please come inside.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,180
Miss, what's wrong?

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,660
I'm here to look for someone.

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,980
Sure thing.

32
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,820
I'm the top entertainer here.

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,180
There's no one in this place

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,820
that I don't know.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,380
May I ask who you're looking for?

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,460
I'm looking for someone
with a red birthmark on his face.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,380
Miss, please follow me upstairs.

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,060
Miss, please have a seat.

39
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,980
Sir, weren't you bringing me here
to find the person?

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,380
Why have we come here?

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,300
Miss, please rest assured.

42
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,060
I will help you find this person.

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,660
But before that,

44
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,500
please have a seat.

45
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,540
Okay.

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,700
I'll pour you a drink right away.

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,740
Hua Chanjuan has been arrested.

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,580
She's unpredictable

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,540
and likely to rat you out.

50
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,300
Then I'll leave the capital for a while.

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,060
No need.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,740
This is...

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,140
If someone really finds out about you,

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,340
you know what to do, right?

55
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,380
I got it, sir.

56
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,540
Come, Miss, please have a drink.

57
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,380
Finding the person is the priority.

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,260
I'm afraid I can't keep you company.

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,260
Miss,

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,140
since you're already here,

61
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,820
you might as well take a sip.

62
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,140
No, I can't handle alcohol well.

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,220
If I get drunk,

64
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,740
how will I find the person?

65
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,140
Miss, please rest assured.

66
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,340
I'm willing to accompany you
until the very end today.

67
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,380
Please do me a favor

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,140
and have a drink with me.

69
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,580
This person is really annoying.

70
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,220
I need to find a way to get rid of him.

71
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,620
Come on.

72
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,340
It hurts.

73
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,780
What's wrong, Miss?

74
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,020
I've had poor health since I was young.

75
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,340
Whenever I smell alcohol,

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,220
I get chest pain.

77
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,140
Miss, let me take a look.

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,020
Miss, have a drink.

79
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,780
Come on, cheers to you.

80
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,740
Come, have some.

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,140
Come on.

82
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,580
Here, have a drink.

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,460
Come on, just have a drink.

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,220
Take me to find the man here

85
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,940
with a red birthmark on his face.

86
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,220
Sure.

87
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,900
It's you.

88
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,460
You can leave now.

89
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,460
Okay.

90
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,260
Xie... Xie Yi'an?

91
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,460
Su Yingying.

92
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
Why are you laughing?

93
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,740
It is for you that I dressed like this

94
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,820
and pretended to be a woman.

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,540
Okay, I'll try not to laugh.

96
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
I found the man you're looking for
with a red birthmark

97
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,900
on his face.

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,940
Wake up.

99
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,580
You...

100
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you know the location
of the underground bank

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,660
making counterfeit banknotes?

102
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

103
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,700
Hua Chanjuan has already confessed.

104
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,380
You're the contact person.

105
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,660
Hua Chanjuan?

106
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,740
I don't know her.

107
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,820
I have no idea who she is.

108
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,980
Why waste time talking to him?

109
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,060
If you don't talk,
today will be your last day.

110
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,260
It's up to you whether you want
to kill me or torture me.

111
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,060
You...

112
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,460
Good for you. Give it to me.

113
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,580
You are South Wind Pavilion's
top entertainer?

114
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,260
What do you want to do?

115
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,660
You are good-looking indeed.

116
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Your skin is delicate,

117
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,900
even better than many women.

118
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,100
What do you think would happen

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,500
if I were to slash your face?

120
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,180
No, don't.

121
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,940
I have a heavy hand.

122
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,620
If I slash too hard,

123
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,660
don't blame me.

124
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,740
No...

125
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,660
Three.

126
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,420
Two.

127
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,260
One.

128
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,980
I'll tell you.

129
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,460
The map of the underground bank

130
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,060
is over there.

Under the statue
of the Fertility Guanyin.

132
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,100
What are you doing?

133
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,020
It would be bad
if the superintendent found out.

134
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,380
It's fine. The superintendent
should have left by now.

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,500
We'll just stay here for a little while.

136
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,820
I've missed you so much.

137
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,220
Hold on.

138
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,500
