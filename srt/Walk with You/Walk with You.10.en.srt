[Seeing through the Disguise]

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,740
What's wrong?

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,460
I still think he's Su Tu.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,180
Wipe off the sweat.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,780
Thanks.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,140
Su...

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,860
Yang Ding,

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,020
where do you live?

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,940
How many people are there
in your family?

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,060
I don't have a home.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,380
Do you have a younger brother

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,100
named Su Tu?

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,100
Yes.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,980
I look a lot like him, don't I?

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,980
Almost identical.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,300
If you don't mind,

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,460
I can be your brother.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,100
Is it too abrupt for me
to ask like this?

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,860
No. It's fine.

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,820
This is for you.

22
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,900
You should eat more.

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,700
Thanks.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
I gave you the chicken leg.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,980
How could you give it
to someone else so casually?

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,340
You should eat more.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,260
The work in the bank
is heavy and tiring.

28
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
You're a girl,

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,660
and you need to keep your strength up
to stay healthy.

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,460
Thank you.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,580
Su Yingying.

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,180
What is it?

33
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,260
Although Yang Ding resembles Su Tu,

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,660
he is ultimately from the bank.

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,780
You easily regard him as your brother.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,380
I'm afraid

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,580
he might harm you.

38
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,020
He must be Su Tu.

39
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,100
I wouldn't be mistaken.

40
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,140
I just don't know what happened to him.

41
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,220
Su Yingying.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,060
Su Tu is already dead.

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,060
I don't need you to remind me.

44
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
You are here.

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,940
How's the bank doing lately?

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,260
The situation out there is tense.

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,180
Hua Chanjuan and Wen Lan
have both been arrested.

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,100
You need to be careful.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,100
I've recently discovered
two suspicious individuals.

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,020
But rest assured,

51
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,620
everything is still under my control.

52
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,740
The bank cannot afford any more trouble,

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,540
otherwise, the Crown Prince...

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,780
I understand.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,540
Was I

56
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,620
being a bit too direct just now?

57
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,340
What exactly are you to the bank?

58
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm the chief guard of the bank.

59
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,660
Since the day you entered the bank,

60
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,340
I've sensed
that something was wrong with you.

61
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,460
So, you deliberately approached us

62
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,700
to test us.

63
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,860
Because Su Yingying

64
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,060
mistakenly took you
for her brother Su Tu,

65
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,860
you took advantage of the situation

66
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,420
to try to sow discord between us.

67
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,100
And now you've brought me here,

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,420
wanting to get rid of me first.

69
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,700
You already know what's going on!

70
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,700
Yang Ding, I don't want to fight you.

71
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,460
Now that you're both here,

72
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,740
I'll fulfill your wish

73
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,980
and let you die together.

74
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Ying!

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,140
Yang Ding!

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,260
Don't harm her.

77
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Come at me instead if you dare.

78
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,740
You are awake.

79
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,380
Are you alright?

80
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,100
I'm feeling better.

81
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
It's all my fault
for not protecting you well.

82
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,340
As long as you're by my side
every time my mania strikes,

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,140
I'll be fine.

84
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,660
Just seeing your plum blossom mark

85
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,500
is enough to calm me down.

86
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,540
Isn't it because of my blood?

87
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,140
At first, I also thought
it was your blood

88
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,700
that could suppress my mania.

89
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,820
Later, I realized

90
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,380
it's actually the plum blossom mark.

91
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,540
Every time my mania strikes,

92
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,260
just seeing the plum blossom mark,

93
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,860
even without blood,

94
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,780
can calm me down.

95
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,580
By the way,

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,060
why do you have mania?

97
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,140
My mother

98
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,420
is from the Full Moon Clan.

99
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,260
Full Moon Clan?

100
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,340
People from the Full Moon Clan
are born with a peculiar condition.

101
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,780
They can't tolerate the scent of musk.

102
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,420
Once they smell it,
they go mad to death.

103
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,700
But as long as they can evoke
the deepest memories

104
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,940
of the most familiar things,

105
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,860
they can calm down.

106
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,260
Is plum blossom candy
the most familiar thing to you?

107
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,060
My mother used to make it for me
when she was alive.

108
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,220
Ying, don't worry.

109
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,460
Once I clear Chief Minister Su's name,

110
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,740
I will definitely cure your illness.

111
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,460
