[Episode 4]
[The Peril]

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,980
To be honest,

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,340
let me tell you something.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,180
I have a good friend
who works for the imperial court,

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,500
specifically in the construction
of dams.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,020
However, when he got the funds allocated
by the imperial court,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,020
he found that it was less
than 10 thousand silver taels.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,620
Exactly.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,390
My friend was afraid

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,820
that it couldn't be finished on time,

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,380
so he intended to report this matter
to the imperial court.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,930
However, he was prevented

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,260
by the faction
supporting the Crown Prince.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,020
Xie Yuheng is truly despicable.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,340
I have already sent someone
to investigate

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,420
the imposter who pretended to be me.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,870
It was a couple

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,860
using the alias of "Banjiu."
[*turtle dove]

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,620
Yes.

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,100
Banjiu?

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,260
That's right.

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,980
The rumors about the Banjiu couple
are terrifying.

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,580
Both humans and ghosts all fear them.

25
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,980
Everyone who fought them dies.

26
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,380
No one has survived.

27
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,860
Where can we find this couple?

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,900
I'll find a way to make an appointment
with the Banjiu couple for you,

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,340
but you must remember

30
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,340
this secret passphrase.

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,420
Ghosts knock on the door at midnight.

32
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,220
The passers by are in deep sorrow.

33
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,700
Right.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,100
My love, you are so beautiful.

35
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,220
You naughty man, always tease me.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,420
Don't tell me
they are the terrifying couple

37
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,100
that can make both humans
and ghosts tremble.

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,540
We are a married couple.
You can't call it "teasing".

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,020
This is called flirting.

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,420
You naughty man.

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,340
People are watching us.

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,340
I feel so shy.

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,380
What a bummer.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,220
I'll go get rid of them now.

45
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,740
Ghosts knock on the door at midnight.

46
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,260
The passers by are in deep sorrow.

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,780
Oh, you're here to borrow money.

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,180
Why didn't you say so earlier?

49
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,740
How much do you need?

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,140
Ten thousand taels.

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,740
Ten thousand taels?

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,900
That's a huge sum.

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,620
They must harbor bad intentions.

54
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,020
Darling,

55
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,820
get rid of them.

56
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,490
the Banjiu couple have been taken

57
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,980
to the Three Judicial Departments
for trial.

58
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,020
There will be results soon.

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,660
They are really

60
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,620
all bark and no bite.

61
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,140
You defeated them in no time.

62
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,380
Su Ying, you're truly remarkable.

63
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,740
Ying.

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,180
Have you been poisoned?

65
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,460
Your Highness.

66
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,020
Do you remember
what I just told you?

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,340
Yes.

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,500
As soon as you give the order,

69
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,380
we will rush
into the room immediately,

70
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,620
put that woman in a sack

71
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,940
and send her out of the city.

72
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,700
Be sure not to mess things up for me.

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,020
Your Highness, please rest assured.

74
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,980
We have been kidnapping people
for thirty years.

75
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,940
We're professionals.

76
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,700
As soon as she wakes up, I'll...

77
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,700
Good.

78
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,500
See you, Your Highness.

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,420
You...

80
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,700
Don't move.
I'll help you suck out the poison.
