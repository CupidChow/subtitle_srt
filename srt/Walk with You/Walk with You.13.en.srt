[Episode 13]
[The Deal]

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,940
You've got rid of evils for the people,

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,660
not only solving
the counterfeit banknote case

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,340
but also clearing my father's name.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm sending you this gift
as a mark of esteem.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,460
You are welcome.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,940
I invite you over this time

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,020
to inquire about an organization

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,260
related to the word "bird".

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,420
An organization
related to the word "bird".

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,620
There is indeed an organization
matching that description.

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,420
However, it's an assassin organization,

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,100
targeting only high-ranking officials
and the wealthy.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,180
High-ranking officials and the wealthy.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,580
It seems to be Xie Yuheng after all.

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,580
Your Highness.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,220
Are you referring to the Crown Prince?

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,700
I suspect the true mastermind
behind the counterfeit banknote case

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,660
is the Crown Prince,

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,780
because the Chief Minister Su
was investigating this case

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,900
before he died,

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,340
and the Crown Prince
has attached great importance to it,

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,220
often visiting the Archive
of the Three Judicial Departments

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,660
to check on the progress
of the investigation.

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,840
Wasn't the mastermind

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,620
the Left Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Revenue?

28
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,540
He's dead.

29
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,820
So,

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,580
I'm even more suspicious
that Xie Yuheng is the mastermind.

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,020
Your Highness,

32
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,180
His Majesty calls for your presence
in the palace.

33
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,420
Call for my presence in the palace?

34
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,420
Suying.

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,540
Furong.

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,380
Why are you here?

37
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,460
This is for you.

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,740
For... For me?

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,020
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

40
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,100
No worries. Thank you for your flowers.

41
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,900
Oh, I also made
some nourishing tea for you.

42
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Suying.

43
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,540
I've brought back some delicious food
from the palace for you.

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,940
Father wanted to host
a birthday banquet for me,

45
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,900
but I declined.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,820
Birthday banquet?

47
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,740
Is it your birthday soon?

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,540
Yes. It's coming up in a few days.

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,420
What gift are you going to give me?

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,620
What do you like?

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,380
I'll like whatever you give me.

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,020
Suying, I also want a gift.

53
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,940
You want one too?

54
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,860
But it's not your birthday.

55
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,620
Can't I celebrate it today?

56
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,380
Sure, you can celebrate it
any day you want.

57
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,940
Since the last failed arrest,

58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,460
the Seventh Prince's mansion
has been heavily guarded.

59
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,020
It's difficult to plant spies.

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,380
We can only take it by storm.

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,660
Now is not the time to take it by storm.

62
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,340
Today is the Seventh Prince's birthday,

63
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,790
which is the perfect opportunity

64
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,100
to investigate
the identity of that maid.

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,420
I'll dispatch someone right away...

66
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,180
No need.

67
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,700
It might alert them.

68
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,220
Since the maid is in the mansion,

69
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,420
I'll personally go
and meet her to find it out.

70
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,740
You've solved the case

71
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,900
and today's your birthday.

72
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,500
It's truly two happy events
happening at the same time.

73
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,180
But why don't you
host a banquet at home

74
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,460
and invite guests over to celebrate?

75
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,420
I'm not familiar
with those social niceties

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,700
and the affairs of the imperial court.

77
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,580
I'll have to rely on you
to take care of me.

78
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,780
Come on.

79
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,260
By the way,

80
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,500
is there a new rule
in the Archive that anyone

81
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,740
other than His Majesty

82
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,940
can't enter
the Archive without permission?

83
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,860
Xie Yuheng. It is really him.

84
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,460
It's also Father's intention.

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,660
Yuheng,

86
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,860
if you want to access
the documents in the Archive,

87
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,060
just let me know.

88
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,660
I'll have someone send them to you.

89
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,220
Okay.

90
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,380
Cheers.

91
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,300
Cheers.

92
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,580
Give this to me. You can go now.

93
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,260
Yes.

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Your Highness,

95
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,020
please enjoy this Golden Lotus Soup.

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,460
Didn't I tell you
not to serve this dish?

97
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,860
Can't you understand my words?

98
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,980
Bring another dish.

99
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,780
Go!

100
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,980
Yes.

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,540
Yuheng, where are you going?

102
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,100
You've finally come to visit me,

103
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,900
and I have a lot to say to you.

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,940
Yuheng, please.

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,460
Please.

106
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,340
Yuheng.

107
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,140
Ying.

108
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,420
Ying.

109
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,300
Ying, I'm coming in.

110
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,020
Ying.

111
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,500
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,620
I know you're angry.

113
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,860
Then why did you stop me?

114
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,620
You know that was the best chance
for me to kill him.

115
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,980
At present, we haven't got
solid evidence against Xie Yuheng

116
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,300
for falsely accusing
Chief Minister Su of treason,

117
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,460
nor have we confirmed him

118
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,380
as the mastermind
behind the counterfeit banknote case.

119
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,700
If you act hastily,

120
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
and if we fail,

121
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,940
it'll render all our efforts futile.

122
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,060
It's never too late
for a person to take revenge.

123
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,140
Until we find out
what he has been doing,

124
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,020
we must proceed cautiously

125
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
with patience.

126
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,100
What's this?

127
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,280

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,100
and pulsating veins,

129
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,570
