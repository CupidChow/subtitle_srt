[Episode 12]
[Being Exposed]

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,740
Your Highness.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,100
Step aside.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,860
Your Highness, you can't go in.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,460
I want to see Xie Yuheng.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,180
Your Highness.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,300
Your Highness.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,740
Your Highness, you can't go in.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,780
Xie Yuheng, when will you
break off the engagement?

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,020
Furong, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,740
Xie Yian, how come you are also here?

13
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,380
You just mentioned
breaking off the engagement.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,180
You and the Crown Prince...

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,700
You've been busy
solving the case lately

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,820
and may not know

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,860
that Father has already conferred on me
a marriage with Princess Furong.

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,580
What?

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,580
Xie Yian,

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,700
our friendship
has lasted over a decade,

21
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,540
and you even said you would marry me
when we were little.

22
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,660
Now, since you've got Suying,

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,460
I've disappeared
from your mansion for so many days,

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,700
yet you haven't even noticed.

25
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,620
You don't even know
about my marriage with Xie Yuheng.

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,900
Furong, stop making a scene.

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,740
Can't you see
what kind of occasion this is?

28
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,100
I don't care what occasion it is!

29
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,420
I'll keep causing trouble

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,540
until

31
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,140
you break off the engagement.

32
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,620
I won't marry you.

33
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,660
I'd rather die than marry you.

34
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,140
Who cares about being
a Crown Princess?

35
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,540
I don't want it at all.

36
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,260
This marriage
was bestowed by His Majesty.

37
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,460
Do you intend to disobey his decree?

38
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,300
I've had my fortune told before.

39
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,140
The fortune teller said
you will bring bad luck to your wives.

40
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,500
Your fiancee died

41
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,780
because of you once before.

42
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,340
I will not marry
a second-hand man like you.

43
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,140
You...

44
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,340
I happen to have some matters
to attend to.

45
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,540
I'll take my leave first.

46
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,940
Xie Yian,

47
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,700
we haven't finished
discussing our matter yet.

48
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,900
Why are you leaving so quickly?

49
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,620
Your Highness,

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,860
do you want
to get Princess Furong back?

51
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,140
She's not important.

52
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,100
What should we do
to the Seventh Prince?

53
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,140
I specially invited him here today.

54
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,740
If he didn't have something to hide,

55
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,860
why wouldn't he bring that maid?

56
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,060
He must have expected
that this is a test

57
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,820
and feared exposing the maid's identity,

58
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,020
so he came alone.

59
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,020
Send assassins
from Vermilion Bird Pavilion

60
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,140
to Prince Jing's Mansion now

61
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,740
and bring her back to me.

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,660
Yes, Your Highness.

63
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,940
You're not fully recovered yet.

64
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,820
Why did you come out?

65
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,980
The sky is so blue today,

66
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,220
and the sun is shining so brightly.

67
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,060
I just wanted to come out for a walk
and relax myself.

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,860
I'll accompany you.

69
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,220
Let's go.

70
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,340
I...

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,500
Let's go over there.

72
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,220
Is she injured?

73
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,820
Then wouldn't this
be the best time for me to take action?

74
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,820
Qing.

75
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,380
Xie Yian wants to see you.

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,580
Give this to me.

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,300
But...

78
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,660
What are you waiting for?

79
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
I'll go now.

80
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,060
If I don't knock you out today,

81
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,620
I'll eat my hat.

82
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,460
Oh, Suying,

83
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,180
don't blame me for this.

84
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,820
Xie Yian promised to marry me,

85
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,500
but now I'm becoming
someone else's wife.

86
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,140
This time,

87
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,420
if I still can't win Xie Yian's heart,

88
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,980
I'll completely give up on him.

89
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,620
Enough, Furong.

90
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,260
I'm Suying.

91
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,500
Stop pretending.

92
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,580
Even if you put on Suying's clothes,
so what?

93
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,500
I've done so much already,

94
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,340
can't you pretend not to recognize me?

95
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,060
I can't.

96
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,700
Furong, I'm sorry.

97
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,060
I was young and foolish before.

98
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,180
I didn't understand what love is.

99
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,620
I broke the promises I made to you.

100
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,420
I apologize to you now.

101
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,260
You can hit me, scold me,
or do anything you want.

102
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,620
But Suying is the only one in my heart.

103
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,540
Stupid Xie Yian,

104
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,220
bad Xie Yian!

105
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,620
I'll never speak to you again!

106
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,460
Ying.

107
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,660
Ying.

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,740
Are you okay?

109
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,700
Come on.

110
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,060
What happened to me?

111
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,420
I remember I took some medicine

112
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,340
and then...

113
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,460
It must have been Furong
who drugged you.

114
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,900
Just now, she disguised herself as you

115
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,420
and tried to seduce me.

116
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,580
Disguising as me

117
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,340
and seducing you?

118
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,900
You should get dressed first.

119
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,900
She must be the woman in the portrait.

120
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,940
Xie Yian.

121
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,660
I'm done, you can come in now.

122
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Let me go! Let me go now!

123
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,340
Go.

124
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,300
Let me go!

125
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,660
Help! Let me go!

126
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,660
Stop!

127
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,140
Xie Yian!

128
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,500
Furong!

129
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,380
Help!

130
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,220
Furong, are you okay?

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,620
I'm okay.

132
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,020
Qing.

133
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,060
Are you alright?
