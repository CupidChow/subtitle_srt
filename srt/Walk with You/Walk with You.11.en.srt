You take a team of people
and go over there.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,460
They've definitely sealed off the area.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,020
Not even a fly can escape.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,220
They'll find us soon.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,860
With such a commotion,

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,700
they will definitely move
the counterfeit banknotes first.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,740
I know a very safe place.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,340
Let's go.

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,420
This is the superintendent's room.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,980
They definitely won't search here.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,380
Plus, the superintendent
is too busy right now

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,860
to even think about coming here.

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,620
So, this place is safe for now.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,380
Since this is the superintendent's room,

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,060
let's see if we can find

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,900
the printing plates
of the counterfeit banknotes.

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,620
What's wrong?

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,820
No... Nothing.

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,340
This is quite indecent of him.

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,700

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,340

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,700
Just a bunch of useless stuff.

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,780
Maybe there's a hidden compartment
or something.

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,740
I've searched everywhere,

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,660

Poison.

99
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,980
I'll send someone

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,980
to investigate the background
of this maid right away.

101
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,820

of the Left Vice Minister first

Yes, Your Highness.

105
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,220
Besides me, the only person
who could have injured Yang Ding

106
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,700
is Su Yingying.

107
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,780
Could that maid be her?

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,180
If it were her,

109
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,720
why would Xie Yian collaborate with her

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,380
to investigate
the counterfeit banknote case?

111
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,620
Do you feel better?

112
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,940
Much better. No need to worry.

113
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh, how is
the counterfeit banknote case going?

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,020
Did he give Xie Yuheng up?

115
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,340
No,

116
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,500
so we still can't confirm

117
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,340
if the Crown Prince
is involved in this matter,

118
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,090
and why Chief Minister Su investigated
the counterfeit banknote case

119
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,620
before he died.

120
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,740
Solving this case

121
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,180
would also be considered
getting rid of evils for the people

122
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,340
and fulfilling my father's dying wish.

123
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,740
Yes, Chief Minister Su
was upright and honest.

124
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
If he were alive,

125
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,580
he would never let counterfeit banknotes
harm the people.

126
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,780
Ying, rest assured.

127
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,300
As long as we continue
our investigation,

128
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,580
we will surely clear
Chief Minister Su's name.

129
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,540
Bad news, Your Highness.

so I'm hosting a banquet
in the Eastern Palace.

You are busy with state affairs

141

I heard you've got
a personal maid recently.

145

Why not bring her along?

146
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,180
She has already taken a leave
to return to her hometown.

Your status
is no longer the same as before.

150

I just want to remind you

151
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,220
that you must not

152
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,700
indulge in leisure as you did before.

153
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,380
