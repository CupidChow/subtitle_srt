00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,100
What's wrong?

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,780
I'm fine.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,780
Why did you use musk

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,300
to drive yourself insane?

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,620
On the day of the fireworks,

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,460
didn't you use musk
to restore my memory?

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,940
So I just wanted to see

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,540
if it could also restore
my martial arts skills.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,060
Now it seems it's not possible.

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,380
Enclose this area.

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,300

- Yes.

Xu Wan,

00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,940
are you sure you want to do this?

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,660

Really?

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,020
I wouldn't dare to lie to you.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,780
You did a good job this time.

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,780
You may leave now.

41
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,060
Don't worry.

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,740
I will keep my promise.

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,620
Once this mission is done,

44
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,980
I will set you free.

Thank you, Your Highness.

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,460
Rest assured,
I will protect you for a lifetime

and safeguard the Su Family,

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,940
ensuring that no one dares to bully you.

49

No one has ever said
they want to protect the Su Family.

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
don't blame me.

53
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,350
If you have to blame someone,
blame yourself

54
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,660
for following in your father's footsteps

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,140
and obstructing me.

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,460
You killed Xie Yian and Su Yingying.

57
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,900
I won't let you go.

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,820
Their deaths have nothing to do with me.

59
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,980
But you,

60
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,580
if you kill me,

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,420
you will commit the crime of rebellion.

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,060
Do you think Marquis Zhenwu
can escape responsibility?

63
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,900
His Majesty paired us up to balance

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,500
Marquis Zhenwu's power.

65
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,780
Since you are married to me,

66
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,060
you belong to me.

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,620
- Your Majesty, please have some tea.
- Your Majesty, please have some tea.

Furong,

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,420
the reason you were married
into the Xie Family at this time

70
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,380
is because of Yian's sudden passing.

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,100
Your marriage to Heng

72
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,300
can bring joy to the royal family,

73
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,540
so the wedding was arranged hastily.

74
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,820
I do feel bad about it.

75
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,660
The fact that I get to marry
the Crown Prince

76
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
is already the greatest blessing.

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,140
It's good that you can think this way.

78
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,060
In the future,
you will need to assist Heng

79
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,860
and govern the country together.

80
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,300
I will surely
abide by Your Majesty's wish

81
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,300
and assist the Crown Prince diligently.

82
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,860
You may rise now.

83
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,020
Ying!

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,420
You are not dead.

85
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,740
Why are you here?

86
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,700
I need your cooperation
to put on an act.

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
What act?

88
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,070
The assassins
from Vermilion Bird Pavilion

89
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,740
are about to arrive.

90
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,460
You pretend to be killed by me,

91
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,380
and Xie Yuheng will lower his guard

92
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,540
and let you go.

93
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,460
Ying!

94
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,260
Ying.

95
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,780
It's so hot.

96
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,900
You came back from the dead?

97
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,500
So Xu Wan informed you in advance

98
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,980
and asked you
to cooperate with her in this act.

99
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,780
You should have told me in advance.

100
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,100
You scared me.

101
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,940
Now,

102
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,420
the only one
who can take Xie Yuheng down

103
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,740
is Father.

104
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,100
Once Father knows

105
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,580
that Xie Yuheng is not his son,

106
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,300
he will surely be furious.

107
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,580
We can then take advantage
of the situation

108
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,220
to expose Xie Yuheng's various crimes

109
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,020
and clear the Su Family's name.

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,260
But how do we make His Majesty aware

111
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,940
that Xie Yuheng is not of royal blood?

112
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
This is the potion
Xu Wan gave me before,

113
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
she claimed that it could wash off

114
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,820
the plum blossom mark
on Xie Yuheng's body.

115
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,500
This way, we can confirm his identity.

116
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,660
Then we must ensure that Father

117
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,860
sees the mark disappear
with his own eyes.

118
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,380
Xie Yuheng is highly skilled
in martial arts,

119
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,460
I can't even defeat him.

120
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,740
How can we get close to him?

121
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,260
I have an idea.

122
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Go on.

123
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,140
I will marry Xie Yuheng.

124
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,500
On the second day of our marriage,

125
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,260
while serving tea to His Majesty,

126
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,340
I will tear his clothes

127
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,980
and use the potion
to reveal his true form.

128
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,060
Xie Yuheng's martial arts skills
are formidable.

129
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,420
If we fail...

130
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,580
You've attempted to assassinate

131
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,980
Xie Yuheng alone many times before

132
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,060
without any fear of failure.

133
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,820
This time, with me, Su Tu,
and Furong by your side,

134
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,300
why would you fear failure?

135
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm afraid of implicating you all.

136
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,460
At first, I was worried

137
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,540
about what to do
if I wronged Xie Yuheng.

138
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,900
After all, he is my brother,

139
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,540
and he has always treated me well.

140
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,100
It wasn't until we investigated
the counterfeit banknote case together

141
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,660
and went through so much
that I began to suspect him.

142
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,700
Now,

143
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,340
my only goal

144
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,980
is to expose his true colors

145
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,980
and stop him from harming the people.

146
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,620
More importantly,

147
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,060
I want to clear Chief Minister Su's name

148
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,020
and bring justice to the innocent people

149
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,340
