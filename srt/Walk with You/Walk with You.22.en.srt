00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Ying.

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,420
Ying.

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,340
Thank heavens you're not dead.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,900
Ying.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,100
Ying.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,900
Ying. This is great!

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,300
You are finally awake.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,540
I was just messing with you.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,860
You actually believed it.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
It was so funny.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,140
I'm okay.

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,300
Ying.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,540
I'm just...

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,220
Ying.

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,180
Ying.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,620
Ying.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,380
Ying.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,260
What happened to her?

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,100
She has just recovered
from a serious injury

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,060
and her body
has not fully recovered yet.

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,940
She still needs a few days of rest
and recuperation.

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,860
Thanks a lot.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,740
Don't be in such a rush to thank me.

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
Don't forget your promise to me.

27
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,260
You all go back and rest first.

28
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,940
I'll stay here and watch over her.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,500
See you.

30
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,060
You're awake.

31
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,220
Are you feeling better?

32
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,700
Much better.

33
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,260
- You...
- I...

34
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,380
You go first.

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,300
What happened to Xie Yuheng

36
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,020
while I was unconscious?

37
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,980
Xie Yuheng has rebelled
and taken up arms.

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,340
So you mean

39
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,820
everything he did before

40
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,180
was all in preparation
for this rebellion?

41
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,780
Father discovered that his mother
was a princess of the previous dynasty

42
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,780
and that he was born to her
and the Emperor's father-in-law.

43
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,380
The Emperor's father-in-law...
Then aren't they...?

44
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,980
They are not siblings.

45
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,370
The Emperor's father-in-law
was the bodyguard

46
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,260
of the princess
of the previous dynasty.

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,660
I see.

48
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,940
You've just woken up.

49
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,620
The most important thing
is to take care of your health.

50
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,980
Don't worry about anything else.

51
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,780
I've already sent experts
from the Three Judicial Departments

52
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,820
to capture Xie Yuheng.

53
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,900
He will be caught sooner or later.

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,180
Ying, just focus on recovering.

55
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Don't you have something
to tell me as well?

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,460
Father has made
an announcement to the nation

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,700
about everything you've done

58
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,260
to overthrow Xie Yuheng

59
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
and investigate
the counterfeit banknote case,

60
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,300
and he also cleared
Chief Minister Su's name.

61
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,220
You've done well.

62
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,820
I've come to bid you farewell.

63
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,820
Have you made up your mind?

64
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,500
Xie Yuheng has been exposed,

65
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,180
and I have regained my freedom.

66
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,020
There is no point in staying any longer.

67
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,740
But for me, it means a lot.

68
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,980
I only helped you for my own revenge.

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,980
Xie Yuheng killed my family.

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
I know.

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,220
Then until we meet again.

72
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,740
Ying, how's your recovery coming along?

73
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,700
I'm feeling much better. Don't worry.

74
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,300
You scared me there.

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,420
I almost went to Xie Yuheng

76
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,740
and fought him to the death.

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,700
Well, isn't it because of
my excellent medical skills

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,060
that I managed to save her?

79
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Hua Chanjuan?

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,980
That's my sister.

81
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,340
I'm her younger sister, Hua Mengchu.

82
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,180
Hua Mengchu.

83
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,860
Darling.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,820
Don't come near me.

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,060
I forbid you to call him that.

86
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,740
"Darling?"

87
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,220
Why can't I call him that?

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,340
He is my husband.

89
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,060
Darling.

90
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,140
What's going on here?

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,180
This woman asked Xie Yian to marry her

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,740
before she agreed to save you.

93
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,780
Darling.

94
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,940
Ying, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,580
I promised Hua Mengchu.

96
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,980
The condition for her to save you
was for me to marry her.

97
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,020
I know.

98
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,020
Don't worry though.

99
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
I will make it clear to her
about my feelings for you

100
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,500
and break off the engagement.

101
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
Here you are.

102
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,940
Why are you here again?

103
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,460
Listen,

104
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,140
he'll be my husband soon.

105
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,180
You can't have any designs on him.

106
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,660
Moreover, I plan to marry him
within three days.

107
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,540
You must leave my mansion before that.

108
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,740
I haven't...

109
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,340
Okay.

110
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,420
Ying.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,850
[Virtuous and harmonious]

112
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Hua Mengchu.

113
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,060
Darling.

114
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,940
Apart from marrying you,

115
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,580
I will agree to anything else you ask.

116
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,100
You... You don't want to detoxify
Su Yingying anymore?

117
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,300
Haven't you already revived her?

118
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
What poison could still be in her body?

119
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,220
It hurts.

120
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,340
I only saved her life.

121
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,540
I didn't detoxify her.

122
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,660
It's just to prevent you
from going back on your word.

123
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,060
What's the deal
with the poison in her body?

124
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
There are two types of poison
in her body.

125
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,740
One is called Amnesia Powder,

126
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,380
which can make her lose her memory.

127
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,860
The other

128
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,500
is called Neigong Dissipation Powder,

129
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,140
which can make her neigong
completely dissipate.

130
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,180
When these two poisons
are mixed together,

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,540
they can greatly shorten her lifespan.

132
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,580
If you don't save her soon,

133
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,020
within ten days, she will...

134
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,100
What do I need to do

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,380
for you to save her?

136
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,500
Marry me.

137
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,460
Why do you insist that I marry you?

138
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,500
Since I was little, I've had a wish.

139
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,220
Whoever can tame my sister,

140
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,700
