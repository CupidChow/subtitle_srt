00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,220
Stop.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,740
Where are you from?

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,340
I haven't seen you before.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,020
We are newcomers.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,180
I remember the newcomers

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,060
are the grandson
and granddaughter-in-law

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,420
of the sister-in-law

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,980
of my father-in-law.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,660
So you are

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,420
my cousins-in-law.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,100
That's right.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,700
Yes.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,620
My cousin-in-law,

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,500
you've finally recognized us.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,860
My cousins-in-law,

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,980
let me tell you,

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,620
the situation is tense
around the bank lately,

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,260
and this is our first meeting.

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,100
Don't blame me

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,900
for yelling at you just now.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,460
I was just being cautious.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,340
Come on, I'll show you the way.

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,020
Alright.

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,900
My cousins-in-law,

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,820
Don't say I'm not taking care of you.

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,580
This is the most lucrative job
in our bank.

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,380
Actually, we don't want that much money.

30
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,740
We just need an easy job.

31
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,140
This is already the easiest job

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,900
in our bank.

33
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,300
Or do you have a problem with me?

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,340
No, not at all.

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,580
We still have to rely on you a lot.

36
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,460
Then chop up all the firewood here.

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,500
Okay, we'll do it.

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,900
Hurry up and get to work.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,460
Are we going to spend the whole day
chopping firewood here?

40
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,860
Don't forget our real purpose

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,900
is to uncover the mastermind
behind the counterfeit banknote case.

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,140
I know,

43
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,180
but as you've seen along the way,

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,380
this place is remote

45
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,100
and perfect for us to hide.

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,780
That's true.

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,420
Let's chop some wood.

48
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,140
I'm so tired.

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,990
Tomorrow, if we still have to do this,

50
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,340
how are we going to investigate
the underground bank?

51
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,140
According to the information
provided by Wen Lan,

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,140
this is the den
of making counterfeit banknotes.

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,740
If we can find

54
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,300
the template
for making counterfeit banknotes,

55
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,420
then we will have the evidence.
