[Episode 15]
[Fate]

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,140
You are here.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,020
You sent away the guards
and put away the musk.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,860
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,740
Hand over the antidote.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,060
I can give you the antidote,

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,260
but on one condition.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,580
What condition?

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,260
Stay by my side.

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,540
Okay.

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,780
You should go with me now.

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,660
I'm going to kill you.

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,860
You know what to do.

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,420
Yes, Your Highness.

16
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,940
What happened to me?

17
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,780
Your Highness, you are awake.

18
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,460
Your Highness, you are finally awake.

19
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,460
The imperial physician said
the position in you was really dangerous

20
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,980
and beyond cure.

21
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,220
It must be by heaven's grace

22
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,020
that you survived since you've done

23
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,500
so many good deeds in the past.

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,980
Where's Suying?

25
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,580
I haven't seen Miss Suying today.

26
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,220
There's no way the poison
just be detoxicated on its own.

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,620
Your Highness, take it slow.

28
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,260
Miss, are you okay?

29
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,540
What is this place?

30
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,580
Who am I?

31
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,100
Have you found her?

32
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,380
No.

33
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,260
What's going on?

34
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100
Everything was fine,

35
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,620
then why did Suying suddenly disappear?

36
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,820
I got injured and poisoned.

37
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
She must have gone to Xie Yuheng

38
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,660
to get the antidote

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,660
to save me.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,500
Furong, can you help me with something?

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,940
This is the Eastern Palace,

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,220
and you are Miss Su Yingying,
the daughter

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,820
of the Chief Minister of the Cabinet,
Su Shouming.

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,780
Su Yingying?

45
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,060
That's all I know.

46
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,860
This is congee.

47
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,820
Please have some, Miss.

48
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,060
Thank you.

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,580
You may leave now.

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,180
Yes.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,300
Heng, you are here.

53
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
What did you just call me?

54
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,860
Heng.

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,580
Heng.

56
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Do you think I've hit my head
and damaged my brain?

57
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,700
I couldn't remember
who I was just now.

58
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,580
But as soon as I saw you,

59
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,100
I remembered that you're Heng.

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,980
Do you remember

61
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,740
what day it is?

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,580
In a few days, I will be marrying you.

63
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,380
That's right.

64
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,580
In just a few days,

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,060
I'll become your wife.

66
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,980
Heng,

67
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,940
you promised to protect me forever.

68
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,180
Will you keep your word?

69
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,940
It's such an important matter.

70
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,380
Of course, I'll remember.

71
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm not a freak.

72
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,580
Of course, you aren't.

73
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,660
But they all say I'm a freak

74
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,020
and bully me,

75
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,180
just because I suffer from mania.

76
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,460
It's not you want to have mania.

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,540
It's an illness every member
of the Su Family has.

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,140
And you won't transform

79
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,380
if you don't inhale musk,

80
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,820
and you'll just be like ordinary people
like us.

81
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,340
Only if everyone else

82
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,980
thinks the way you do, Heng.

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,300
Rest assured,
I will protect you for a lifetime

84
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,900
and safeguard the Su Family,

85
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,660
ensuring that no one dares to bully you.

86
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,060
No one has ever said
they want to protect the Su Family.

87
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,260
Then I'll be the first one.

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,500
How nice it would be
if we could go back to the past.

89
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,180
There would be no scheming
or resentment between us,

90
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,220
and I wouldn't have to go through
all this trouble

91
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,700
to erase your memories.

92
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,780
Heng, you're the first person
besides my father

93
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,460
who said you would protect me.

94
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,220
Don't break your promise.

95
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,380
Don't worry,

96
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,100
I promised to protect you,

97
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,700
and I will definitely keep that promise.

98
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,460
Pinky promise?

99
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,300
If it weren't for Xie Yian asking me
to come here to find Suying,

100
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,420
I wouldn't have set foot in this place,

101
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,380
in case I see Xie Yuheng

102
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,380
and have my day ruined.

103
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,740
But why would Suying come here?

104
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,220
Suying?

105
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,460
Xie Yian was right.

106
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,820
She's here.

107
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,420
Suying.

108
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,660
I'm Su Yingying, not Suying.

109
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
It seems you've mistaken me
for someone else.

110
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,980
I couldn't have mistaken you.

111
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,060
Wait a moment, you're Su Yingying,

112
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,740
the daughter of Chief Minister Su?

113
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,060
Yes.

114
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,060
You are Su Yingying,

115
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,980
not Suying.

116
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,620
What's going on here?

117
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,540
Miss,

118
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,900
are you alright?

119
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
I understand now.

120
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,620
I understand everything.

121
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,020
I always thought

122
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,180
although Xie Yian was a coxcomb,

123
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,940
he couldn't

124
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,580
keep a woman by his side all the time.

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,340
Besides, why would he suddenly start

126
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,700
investigating
the counterfeit banknote case?

127
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,620
You two are trying to clear
the Chief Minister's name.

128
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,740
Miss, what are you talking about?

129
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,980
I don't understand at all.

130
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,140
What does the Seventh Prince
have to do with me?

131
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,020
And why would I need
to clear my father's name?

132
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,260
You only remember you're Su Yingying,

133
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,060
but don't remember you're Suying.

134
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,660
That memory
seems to have been forgotten.

135
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,020
Miss, you're acting quite strangely.

136
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,540
Could you please clarify
what you're talking about?

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,100
It must be Xie Yuheng

138
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,100
who did something to you,

139
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,060
causing you to lose your memory.

140
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,540
Let me take a look.

141
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,020
Miss, what are you doing?

142
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,100
Let me take a look, Suying.

143
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,420
Let go of me. Let go.

144
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,700
Let me take a look.

145
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,780
This is the forbidden area
of the Eastern Palace.

146
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,460
Please leave immediately, Your Highness.

147
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,900
I...

148
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,820
So you are Princess Furong.

149
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,540
Let me go. You're hurting me!

150
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,620
If you don't let me go,

151
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,900
I'll tell Xie Yuheng

152
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,820
that you overstepped your boundaries

153
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,180
and ask him to punish you severely.

154
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,180
Princess Furong, please don't go.

155
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,380
Could you please explain
what's going on?

156
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,380
Miss Su, please don't wander around.

157
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,700
Otherwise, it will be difficult for me
to explain to the Crown Prince.
