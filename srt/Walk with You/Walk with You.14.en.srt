It's sweet.

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,460

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,460
I'll make sure you get the first bite.

15
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,420
Okay.

16
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,980
Your Highness.

♪Trapped in the cycle of day and night♪

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,020
I'll be right back.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,220
Go ahead.

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,260
Wait for me.

21
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,980
You should go now.
Don't let me get in the way.

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,300
Alright.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,140
Let's go.

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
Didn't I tell you?

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,580
All important matters,

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,180
especially those concerning
the Vermilion Bird Pavilion,

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,820
should not be mentioned
in front of Suying.

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,420
But Miss Suying
will eventually find out anyway.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,700
The Vermilion Bird Pavilion
is so dangerous,

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,420
and Suying is so eager for revenge.

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,420
If she knows
about the Vermilion Bird Pavilion,

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,820
she will definitely take risks.

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,220
I can't let her get hurt again.

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,220
So for now, I can only keep it a secret
for as long as I can.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,860
Once I'm done dealing
with the Vermilion Bird Pavilion,

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,060
I will tell her.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,340
Got it.

38
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,980
Is there anything else that's important?
Tell me now.

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,580
The spies have just sent word.

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,700
They have gained the trust
of the Vermilion Bird Pavilion

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,180
and lured the Pavilion's head

42
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,900
to the location you specified,
Your Highness.

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,100
Very well.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,980
There's no time to waste.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,100
Let's take action now.

46
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,020
And remember, don't let Suying
find out about this.

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,860
Understood.

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,700
How strange.

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,460
Why is no one here?

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,220
Where is the head
of the Vermilion Bird Pavilion?

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,620
I'm afraid
we might have fallen into a trap.

52
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,020
Fallen into a trap?

53
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,380
Have you checked the information
sent by the spies?

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,100
Your Highness,

55
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,260
the spies are carefully chosen by us.

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,620
They wouldn't convey false information.

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,620
The spies won't,

58
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,700
but the Vermilion Bird Pavilion might.

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,060
You go back first.

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,580
Go to the Three Judicial Departments
to get help.

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,980
Your Highness, you are alone...

62
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,540
Don't worry, I will be fine.

63
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,740
Go now.

64
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,580
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,620
You are the head
of the Vermilion Bird Pavilion?

66
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,060
You'll die today.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,780
Bear with it.

68
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,820
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,540
I know

70
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,260
you didn't tell me

71
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,660
because you were afraid
I'd get hurt again.

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,780
But I got injured,

73
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,380
and I made you worry.

74
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,780
So you know it.

75
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,460
That's why I'm sorry.

76
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,860
Then don't do this again
in the future.

77
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,180
Okay.

78
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,580
Xie Yian.

79
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,820
Xie Yian?

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,260
I deserve to die

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
for letting the Seventh Prince escape.

82
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
Useless!

83
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,980
But I injured him with a sword,

84
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,460
as per Your Highness's instructions,

85
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,940
it was coated with a deadly poison
from the Western Regions.

86
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,660
Now that the Seventh Prince
is injured,

87
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,780
his days are numbered.

88
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,860
You may leave now.

89
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,060
Yes, Your Highness.

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,620
Imperial physician, how is he?

91
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,460
I'm sorry, but I'm unable to help.

92
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,370
The poison in the Seventh Prince

93
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,620
is a rare toxin
from the Western Regions.

94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,940
The antidote can only be found there,

95
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,980
and the round trip to obtain it
will take at least ten days.

96
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,820
By then, the Seventh Prince
would have died already.
