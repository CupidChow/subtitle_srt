[Episode 24]
[Great Happiness]

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,260
Do you find satisfaction

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,060
in seeing me like this?

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,040
Guess you are finally feeling

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,220
that the long-awaited revenge
is imminent.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,580
This is all of your own making.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,460
Yes,

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,860
it's my own doing.

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,620
To ascend
to the position of Crown Prince,

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,180
to seize power

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,700
and bring about a change in the dynasty,

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,580
I've been secretly plotting
for over a decade

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,100
and made so many efforts.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,140
I personally established the bank
and the Vermilion Bird Pavilion,

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,820
but they were all destroyed by you
within a few short months.

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,020
The wicked shall surely perish.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,220
Xie Yian,

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,260
do you know how your mother died?

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,060
His Majesty once intended
to make you the Crown Prince,

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,980
so I had no choice

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,980
but to poison the tea
your mother often drank.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,660
I also sent you to the border.

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,220
As for Chief Minister Su,

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,420
if he hadn't opposed me in court,

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,220
obstructing my path
to the Crown Prince position,

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,020
and exposing me as the mastermind
behind the counterfeit banknote case,

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,740
I would never have harmed him.

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,020
I wouldn't have fabricated
his treasonable documents

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,500
or used our engagement

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,980
to lower his guard.

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,700
On the day of our wedding,

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,420
under the guise of his treason,

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,820
I annihilated the Su Family.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,700
Ying, I would have continued

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,500
to protect the Su Family
and protect you as before.

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,860
We could have been husband and wife.

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,820
Ying.

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,100
Just wait to die here.

Father,

42
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,100
both your and the Su Family's names
have been cleared.

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,900
Su Tu is still alive.

44
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,060
You can rest assured.

45
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,020
Chief Minister Su,

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,660
I will take good care of Ying and Su Tu.

47
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,660
Su Tu,

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,820
can't you stay?

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,300
I want to go look for someone

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,500
and seek an answer.

51
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,660
I will return once I find it.

52
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,100
Furong,

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,500
you are...?

54
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,860
Ying, I'm leaving.

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,580
Please don't miss me too much.

56
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,220
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,260
I became a widow
right after getting married.

58
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,380
It's a big deal.

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,420
I need to go home
and explain to my family.

60
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,020
True.

61
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,340
Be careful on your way home then.

62
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,220
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,340
Greetings, Father.

64
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

65
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,940
Rise now.

66
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,340
Thank you, Father.

68
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,540
Su Yingying,

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,500
do you still blame me?

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,260
I have never harbored
any resentment towards Your Majesty.

71
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,660
Why would Your Majesty say such a thing?

72
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,100
If it weren't for the deception
and manipulation by the traitor,

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,340
I wouldn't have decreed

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,620
the extermination
of the entire Su Family.

75
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,020
Now that the truth has come to light,

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,860
and my father's name has been cleared,

77
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,420
I hold no grievances.

78
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,540
You,

79
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,340
despite being a woman,

80
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,660
have shown courage, wisdom,

81
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,620
compassion, and righteousness.

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,860
Together with Yian,
you risked your lives

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,740
to solve the long-standing
counterfeit banknote case,

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,940
not only ridding the people of evil

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,700
but also stabilizing the nation.

86
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,420
It's a great achievement.

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,900
Moreover, in exposing
the true colors of the traitor,

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,660
you almost lost your life.

89
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,340
You are as capable as men

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,420
and can bear the title of heroine.

91
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,300
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

92
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,340
My father once taught me

93
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,420
that one should not seek
personal gain or avoid danger

94
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,460
at the expense
of the nation's well-being.

95
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,300
I have always kept this in mind
and acted accordingly.

96
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,820
As expected of a descendant
of the Su Family.

97
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,820
You and Yian both love each other.

98
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,940
I originally thought this matter

99
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,740
would become a stumbling block
between you two.

100
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,260
Now it seems I was worrying for nothing.

101
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020
Your Majesty, you need not worry.

102
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,660
The true love between Yian and me
is evident to all.

103
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,660
That's great.

104
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,780
Father,

105
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,660
do you recognize
these two jade pendants?

106
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,950
This is the jade pendant
your mother always wore

107
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,100
before she passed away.

108
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,500
I remember your mother once told me

109
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,100
that she divided
the jade pendant into two halves,

110
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,940
one for you

111
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,620
and the other for the daughter
of Chief Minister Su.

112
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,340
She hoped that when you both grew up,

113
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,740
I could arrange your marriage.

114
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,100
Unfortunately,

115
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,420
fate has its own plans.

116
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,820
Your Majesty means to say

117
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,420
that back then, the Seventh Prince
was far away at the border,

118
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,460
yet I insisted on marrying Xie Yuheng.

119
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,380
That's right.

120
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,260
But after all the twists and turns,

121
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,820
you two ended up together again.

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,100
It's truly fate at work.

123
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,100
What are you thinking, Darling?

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,220
I'm thinking

125
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,460
about when Su Tu can find Xu Wan

126
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,660
and when Furong
can come back to stay with us.

127
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,380
Look.

128
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,420
They were meant to be together.

129
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,660
Ying,

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,260
I have something very important
to ask you.

131
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,620
What is it?

132
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,460
His Majesty wants a grandson.

133
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,260
Oh, come on,
can't it be a granddaughter?

134
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,860
Sure.

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,860
Then the son will take my surname,

136
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,540
and the daughter will take yours.
