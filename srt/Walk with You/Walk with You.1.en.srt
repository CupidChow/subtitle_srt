[Walk with You]

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,020
[Episode 1]
[The Encounter]

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,700
I heard the Seventh Prince is also here.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,580
[Xie Yi'an, the Seventh Prince]
He's keen on eating and drinking.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,820
In a gathering like this,

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,020
how could he be absent?

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,470
It's all because his mother
passed away early,

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,820
there was no one to discipline him.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,220
Someone, take them away.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,340
Give them twenty strokes of the cane.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,940
Mercy, Your Highness!

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,780
- Mercy, Your Highness!
- Mercy, Your Highness!

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,350
[Xie Yuheng, the Crown Prince]

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,620
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,220
You may rise.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,780
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,540
Sorry about that, Yi'an.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,180
Don't listen to those people's nonsense.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,620
I'm used to it.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,180
Thank you for being so considerate,
Yuheng.

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,420
Come on.

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,140
Please.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,660
Cheers.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,060
Throughout history,
royalty has often been unfeeling.

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,620
Brothers have fought for power.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,980
There has been a lot
of bloodshed and chaos. Hasn't there?

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,700
I believe the Crown Prince simply wants

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,650
[Su Yingying]
to secure a leading position

30
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,460
[Chief Minister Su's daughter]
over the Seventh Prince.

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,300
There was no need for the Crown Prince
to offend those two old officials

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,740
for the Seventh Prince.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,340
Twenty strokes of the cane,

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,260
that's a punishment
for the most heinous criminals.

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,260
Oh, no. It's musk.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,770
Chief Minister Su has committed treason.

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,660
Even a hundred deaths cannot atone
for his criminals.

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,900
[Three years ago]
He should be executed without mercy.

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,060
Leave now, Ying.

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,820
I'm not leaving, Father.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,420
Leave.

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,500
I won't. We have to leave together.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,100
Leave now, Ying.

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,380
Leave.

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,100
Father!

46
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,260
Ying, don't worry.

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,540
Father and I will definitely be fine.

48
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,260
Su Tu!

49
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,820
Father!

50
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,540
Kill them!

51
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,980
Father, Su Tu, open the gate!

52
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,060
Ying, hurry and leave,
avenge us!

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,580
Yuheng!

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,860
Yi'an!

55
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,660
Don't come any closer.

56
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,940
If you come any closer, I'll kill him.

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,380
Do as she says.

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,060
Move.

59
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,660
Yuheng.

60
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,460
Step aside.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,220
Stop chasing them.

62
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,580
Miss.

63
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,340
Miss.

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Miss, are you okay?

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,740
Take me to your room.

66
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,540
Miss.

67
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,740
Miss, are you alright?

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,740
Have you been poisoned?

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,540
Go away!

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,220
Miss.

71
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,860
What happened to her?

72
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,420
Help. Help!

73
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,740
It's plum blossom candy.

74
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,370
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

75
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Stop struggling.

76
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,260
Let me go.

77
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,700
I can let you go,

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,100
but who exactly are you?

79
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,180
And why did you go berserk last night?

80
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Could it be that his blood
can serve as a remedy for my illness?

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,460
I suffer from mania.

82
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,620
Once I smell musk,

83
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,220
I go mad and harm others until they die.

84
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,100
Musk?

85
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,820
So, I'm your lifesaver.

86
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,260
Can you tell me

87
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,100
where this jade pendant came from?

88
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,100
Why should I tell you?

89
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,700
It's a shame

90
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
to destroy such a lovely face.

91
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,020
How about being
my personal maid instead?

92
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,940
You can warm my bed for me.

93
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,980
No way!

94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,340
Then tell me how did you get it.

95
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,020
It's my stuff.

96
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Why should I tell you?

97
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,140
My mother left me the only keepsake

98
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,620
when she passed away,

99
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,820
and that looks the same as this one.

100
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
I've been wearing this jade pendant

101
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,500
as a talisman since I was born.

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
I have no idea where it came from.

103
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,060
Then why did you attempt
to assassinate the Crown Prince?

104
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,060
His blood can control
my mania.

105
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,260
Maybe I can use him

106
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,740
to continue assassinating Xie Yuheng.

107
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,740
My father is Su Shouming.

108
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,500
Su... Su Shouming?

109
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,100
Su Shouming...

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,500
You are Su Yingying?

111
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,780
On my wedding day,
Xie Yuheng killed my entire family.

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,620
I am determined
to make him pay for this blood debt.

113
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,460
So, you assassinated the Crown Prince

114
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,700
for revenge?

115
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,900
An, are you there?

116
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,220
Furong,

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,100
how come you're back?

118
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,980
Who is this woman?

119
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,500
My new maid.

120
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,300
[Princess Furong]
Maid?

121
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,140
[Daughter of Marquis Zhenwu]
Would a maid lie in your bed?

122
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,900
Xie Yi'an,

123
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,580
I know you're a playboy,

124
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,860
but not every woman

125
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,980
is allowed to get into the mansion.

126
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,380
She really is my maid.

127
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,300
Ask her if you don't believe me.

128
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,740
It's true.

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,500
How come you're here all of a sudden?

130
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,940
I heard you were kidnapped
by an assassin

131
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,740
at the Crown Prince's birthday banquet

132
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,100
and returned injured.

133
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,740
I rushed here to check on you,

134
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,060
but I never expected you'd...

135
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,740
I appreciate your kindness.

136
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,940
I've got the makeup box
you asked me to buy for you,

137
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,180
and I've brought it back.

138
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,100
I just haven't had time
to give it to you yet.

139
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,540
Come on, I'll show it to you.

140
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,980
It's really nice.

141
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,820
Let's go.

142
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,380
Why has Miss Furong returned again?

143
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,340
Why haven't you left yet?

144
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,820
I am your maid, after all.

145
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,100
You want to use my blood

146
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,820
to remove the effect of musk on you,

147
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,380
and then continue assassinating
the Crown Prince, don't you?

148
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,020
Yes,

149
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,260
I want him to pay for his blood debt.

150
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,260
I sympathize with what happened to you,

151
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,700
but the Crown Prince is resourceful.

152
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,020
You won't succeed,

153
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,900
and you might even lose your life.

154
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,660
Why not investigate thoroughly,

155
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,140
uncover the truth

156
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,380
about Chief Minister Su's
alleged treason,

157
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,820
and clear his name?

158
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,780
Wouldn't that be better?

159
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,500
Xie Yuheng is meticulous

160
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
and leaves no room for error.

161
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,660
I've been investigating for three years

162
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,380
and still haven't found any evidence
to prove my father's innocence.

163
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,460
Yi'an,

164
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,460
I command you to return
to the capital this time

165
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,510
to thoroughly investigate the case

166
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,780
of the Chief Minister's
family massacre.

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,820
This case is full of suspicions
and is by no means simple.

168
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,260
The intricacies involved

169
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,620
are unfathomable.

170
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,940
You must proceed with caution

171
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,820
to ensure your own safety
and fulfill your mission.

172
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
I'll return the jade pendant to you.

173
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,900
It's said that Chief Minister Su
was upright and incorruptible,

174
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,340
and would never betray the nation.

175
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,900
There's definitely
something suspicious about this.

176
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,020
I'll take advantage of my status

177
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,180
to help you
investigate the case thoroughly.

178
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,980
What did you feed me?

179
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
The Seven-Day Cold Heart Pill.

180
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,460
As the name suggests,

181
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,500
within seven days,
you must take the antidote,

182
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,580
or else you will die a violent death.
