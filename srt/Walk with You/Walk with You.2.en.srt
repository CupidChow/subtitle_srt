As the name suggests,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,540
within seven days,
you must take the antidote,

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,620
or else you will die
a violent death.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,540
As for the antidote,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,820
I am the only one
who has it in the entire world.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,220
You...

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,940
I'll give you seven days

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,020
to find the evidence
that can prove the innocence

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,820
of the Su family and my father.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,900
Otherwise, you'll assassinate
Xie Yuheng with me.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,540
You...

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,420
It's in complete disorder,
sometimes strong, sometimes weak.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,620
I've never encountered
such a peculiar pulse.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,500
Your Highness, your days are numbered.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,100
Can I be saved?

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,500
Forgive me,
but there isn't much I could do.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,860
You quack.

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,540
What's the use of having you
in the Imperial Medical Bureau?

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,460
Go away, now!

23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,500
What are you looking for?

24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,540
I...

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,620
I wanted to tell you

26
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,940
that I've found a way to investigate
the case of Chief Minister Su.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
What way?

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Tomorrow morning,

29
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,740
let's go together to the archive
of the Three Judicial Departments.

30
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,980
There might be case files

31
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,340
related to Chief Minister Su.

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,700
Until you prove my father's innocence,

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,620
don't expect
to get the antidote from me.

34
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,940
Otherwise, don't blame me
for being ruthless.

35
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,460
Of course.

- Greetings, Your Highness.

38
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,740
You may rise now.

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
This is the archive
of the Three Judicial Departments,

40
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,900
storing all case files

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
from all over the country.

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,420
Here, we should be able to find

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,940
relevant clues

44
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,540
about Chief Minister Su's
alleged treason.

45
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,420
My father appointed me
to be in charge here

46
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,700
and organize the case files.

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,580
I found it boring,
so I haven't been here.

48
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,340
Unexpectedly, it comes in handy today.

49
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,340
There are too many case files,

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,740
and I have no idea how long it will take
to go through them.

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,020
How about I go find something
for you to eat?

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,980
I don't even know
who's serving whom now.

53
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,220
You take your time.

54
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,380
I'll go find something for you to eat.

55
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,340

with this golden cicada bracelet.

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

59
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,100
Oh no, why does Yuheng come here?

60
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
They can't meet each other.

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,260
Who's inside?

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,540
If you kill him now,

63
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,500
nobody will know

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,460
what happened to Chief Minister Su.

65
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,860
It's better to first clear
Chief Minister Su's name,

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,820
then kill him.

67
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,900
Don't be hasty for now.

68
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,540
Your Highness,

69
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,140
His Majesty urgently requests
your presence at the palace.

70
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,100
Got it, you may leave now.

71
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,900
Yes.

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,820
Don't chase him.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,060
Have you forgotten

74
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,500
what I just told you?

75
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,900
Maybe we should go and find out

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,420
why Yuheng came here.

77
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
These are all minor cases.

78
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,300
Why is Yuheng
investigating them?

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,740
The Imperial City's
counterfeit banknote case.

80
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
Father mentioned the case to me
when he was alive.

81
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,140
Every year, citizens came
to lodge complaints.

82
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,500
They offered gold, silver,
other treasures,

83
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,580
properties, and lands
as collateral for loans,

84
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,420
but found out

85
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,900
that half of the banknotes
they received were counterfeit.

86
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,820
These borrowers claimed

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,700
to be from the Ren family,
the wealthiest in the country,

88
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,220
but when the officers
conducted searches, they found nothing.

89
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,700
This case seems to be ordinary,

90
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,420
but it surely has
wide-reaching implications.

91
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,980
Otherwise, neither my father
nor Xie Yuheng

92
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,700
would care about it a lot.

93
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,140
I have a plan.

94
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,980

is greedy and lustful.

95
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Let's start with him.

Come on.

109
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
Your Highness,
I beg your pardon,

110
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,180
I accidentally broke
a string of the pipa,

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,740
disturbing your pleasure.

112
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,900
Please forgive me.

113
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,740
I've taught you thousands of times.

114
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,380
Why are you
still causing trouble for me?

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm not bringing you out here

116
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,820
to embarrass me.

117
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,980
Your Highness, spare me.
I'm truly sorry.

119
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,460
she was not on purpose.

Can you forgive her this once?

122
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,260
What? Do you have a crush
on this maid?

123
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,500
No.

124
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,270
How could I dare have a crush

125
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,740
on a woman
that belongs to you, Your Highness?

126
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,980
I invite you here for a drink

127
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,740
to make a friend with you.

128
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,140
She's just a maid.

If you like her,

130
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,780
you can take her.

I'll ask them to leave now.

and find out the mastermind

145
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,580
behind the counterfeit banknote case,

146
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,220
I'll know

147
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,420
why my father was charged with treason,

148
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,100
and why he investigated
this case before.

149
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,620
