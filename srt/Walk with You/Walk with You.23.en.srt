Have you really decided to leave?

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,480
I have already decided.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,840
Since you've already made up your mind,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
I won't detain you any further.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,480
You're leaving?

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,680
Take care,
you can see yourself out, right?

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,280
Feel free to visit my place again.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,720
You...

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,880
Darling.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,720
Let's go.

Ying.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,400
Hua Mengchu has pushed it too far.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,760
Ying,

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,240
is it really okay for us

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
to just walk away like this?

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,200
Don't forget,

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,800
Xie Yuheng is not dead yet.

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,640
Now, the most important thing
is revenge.

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,880
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,760
So? Have you managed
to capture that traitor yet?

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Your Majesty,

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,480
the hiding place of the Crown Prince
has been located.

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,400
The Three Judicial Departments
have already sent people to catch him.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
What about Yian?

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,040
His Highness

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,960
is about to get married.

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Getting married?

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
At this time?

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
What on earth is Yian thinking?

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Hua Mengchu,

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,240
you are already married to me.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
You have achieved your goal.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,280
Hurry and save Ying.

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,400
Although you are already married to me,

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,280
I cannot sleep with you.

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,720
My heart and soul belong to Ying.

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,200
Please, hurry and save Ying.

46
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Why can't you understand?

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,480
You saved Ying's life once,

48
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,600
and I'm grateful for that.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,280
But the one I love is Ying,

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,680
and I can only love her.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,960
No matter what you do,

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,440
I'll never fall in love with you.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
So, marrying me

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
will only bring you more trouble.

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,520
Please go save Ying now. Otherwise...

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
Hua Mengchu!

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,240
How come it's you?

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,800
Your bride has always been me.

[Three days ago]

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,560
What are you here for?

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm here to detoxify you.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,480
Once all the poison
in your body is cleared,

63
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,840
you'll be able to regain
your inner strength.

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
Why are you helping me?

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,840
I never liked Xie Yian anyway.

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm just helping my sister

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,080
and giving you both
a little punishment.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,560
But

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm not helping you for nothing.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,200
You must do something for me.

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
What is it?

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
Get married for me.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,840
So Hua Mengchu detoxified you
from the very beginning

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,440
and asked you to marry me instead.

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,640
She actually just helped her sister,
Hua Chanjuan,

76
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,720
and got back at us.

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,960
These two

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,440
really do have similar personalities,

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
both so eccentric.

80
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,800
It turns out people who are meant
to be family share common traits.

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,640
But why didn't you tell me?

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
I thought I was marrying Hua Mengchu.

83
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
I was so disheartened.

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,840
Since we've had the ceremony
and got married,
