[The Crisis]

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,340
Heng,

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,140
why did the plum blossom mark
on your body disappear?

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,500
Your Majesty,

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,620
Xie Yuheng is not of royal blood at all.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,940
You are Su Yingying,
the daughter of Chief Minister Su.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,220
Father, don't listen to their nonsense.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,580
They're just trying to frame me.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,780
Your Majesty,
do you recognize this official seal?

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,940
The official seal of Chief Minister Su
was bestowed by me.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,620
Yes, this is my father's official seal.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,940
They stole my father's official seal
back then,

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,300
forged documents
of my father's aid to the enemy

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,700
and falsely accused my father
of treason.

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,020
Who framed Chief Minister Su?

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,020
It was the Crown Prince.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,780
Nonsense!

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,740
How does one official seal
prove anything?

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,460
She can testify.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,740
Greetings, Father.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,820
Greetings, Your Majesty.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,180
What's going on here?

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,860
I'm Xu Wan, the head
of the Vermilion Bird Pavilion.

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,660
I was coerced by the Crown Prince

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,260
to steal
Chief Minister Su's official seal,

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,540
forge documents of his aid to the enemy,

28
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,300
and falsely accuse Chief Minister Su
of treason.

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,860
I also killed the Left Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Revenue

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,180
and other court officials.

31
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,860
Your Majesty, please punish me.

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,940
Father,

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,620
they conspired together

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,140
to slander me.

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,460
In our Xie Family,

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,820
everyone has had the plum blossom mark
since childhood.

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,180
But now, the plum blossom mark
on your body has disappeared.

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,100
Clearly, you are not of royal blood.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,940
Relay my decree.

40
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,500
Xie Yuheng has deceived me

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,020
and plotted against loyal subjects.

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,700
Arrest him!

43
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,420
Ying!

44
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,500
Don't come any closer!

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,060
Don't harm Ying.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,100
Xie Yuheng,

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,940
surrender yourself.

48
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,220
I haven't failed yet.

49
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,340
I won't surrender so easily.

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Get out of my way!

51
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,780
Ying!

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,020
Stop!

53
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,820
Ying!

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,260
Ying!

[Prince Jing's Mansion]

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,900
How is she?

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,940
That palm strike
has already injured her heart,

58
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,260
and she's on the verge of death.

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,180
But her wish is unfulfilled,
and she's unwilling to leave this world,

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,380
so she's holding onto her last breath.

61
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Can she still be saved?

62
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,900
Her days are numbered.

63
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,420
Your Highness, please excuse me.

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,700
Your Highness,

65
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,660
there's a renowned physician
outside the palace

66
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,100
seeking an audience.

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,740
Your Highness.

68
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,380
Hua Chanjuan?

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,700
That's my sister.

70
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,220
Your Highness,
allow me to introduce her to you.

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,660
This is the renowned physician
Hua Mengchu.

72
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,860
I've heard that Miss Suying
has been severely injured

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,740
and unconscious,

74
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,900
so I specially invited Ms. Hua

75
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,420
to come to your residence
to take a look.

76
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,220
I can save her,

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,820
but I have one condition.

78
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,020
What condition?

79
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,140
As long as you can save her,

80
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,220
I'll agree to anything.

81
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,180
You

82
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,140
marry me.

83
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,060
What?

84
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,540
What kind of trick is this?

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
Are you a quack or something?

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,580
You...

87
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,340
Get out.

88
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,420
We don't need your treatment.

89
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,980
I don't believe

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,380
that only you

91
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,940
can save Su Yingying in this world.

92
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,620
You...

93
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,300
You have my word.

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,060
Really?

95
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,700
But you have to save her first.

96
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,940
Alright. Please step outside, everyone.

Everyone will die eventually.
