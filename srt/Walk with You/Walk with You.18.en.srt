[The Truth]

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,900
Although I've regained my memory,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,100
I have no martial arts skills left.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,940
Given the current situation,

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,020
I can only return to Xie Yuheng's side.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,500
Only by catching him off guard

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,940
can I avenge my father.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,580
You can't even keep an eye on a person.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,020
What use are you to me?

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm willing to accept my punishment,
Your Highness.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,340
Let it go.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,140
Heng.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,060
You may leave now.

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,460
Yes, Your Highness.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,020
Where did you go?

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,220
Why didn't you tell me?

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,140
I was worried sick.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,380
I wanted to have Qian's candied fruit,

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,660
but I couldn't find any maids,

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,860
so I went to buy it by myself.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,540
Look, I brought some back for you too.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,220
Yuheng.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,300
Heng, who is he?

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,700
Even if she hasn't regained her memory,

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,700
we just met yesterday,

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,420
why she doesn't recognize me today?

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,260
Something's not right.

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,020
Ying.

30
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,980
Let's play a game, shall we?

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,940
What game?

32
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,500
He's the Seventh Prince, Xie Yian.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,300
He just returned from the border

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,220
and hasn't met you.

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,980
He also doesn't know
you're the Chief Minister's daughter.

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,380
Let's pretend to be master and maid

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,740
and deceive him

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,780
and see how he reacts.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,340
What do you think?

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,220
Okay.

41
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,380
He's the Seventh Prince,

42
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,740
you should bow quickly when seeing him.

43
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,660
Greetings, Your Highness.

44
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,740
This is...?

45
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,100
This is my newly recruited maid.

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,300
My name is Ying.

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,940
Ying?

48
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,540
You don't look like a maid,

49
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,420
but more like a young lady
from a wealthy family.

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,140
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

51
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,740
But I am indeed just a maid.

52
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,420
Just a mere maid,

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,940
yet you are so close
to the Crown Prince.

54
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,900
Have you forgotten
about your engagement

55
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,860
to Princess Furong, Yuheng?

56
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,460
If Father finds out

57
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,420
about this maid by your side,

58
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,460
what do you think he will think?

59
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,420
Thank you for the reminder.

60
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,940
I will explain everything
to him myself.

61
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,620
You needn't worry about me.

62
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,460
Heng,

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,140
does His Highness dislike me?

64
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,740
Is he going to send me away?

65
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,700
No one can send you away.

66
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
Don't bother with him.

67
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,220
Yian,

68
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,340
I have important matters to attend to.

69
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,220
You may leave the Eastern Palace now.

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,420
Sorry for not seeing you out.

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,620
Take care, Your Highness.

72
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,820
Alright.

73
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
You are cheeky indeed, Yian.

74
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,660
Of course. How else can I become

75
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,980
the leading playboy in the capital?

76
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,900
This maid seems rather special.

77
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,820
Her features resemble someone
I've seen before.

78
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,140
Yuheng, do you know who it is?

79
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,820
By chance, I saw

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,220
a portrait of Su Yingying, the daughter
of Chief Minister Su.

81
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,900
This maid looks exactly like her,

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,380
even sharing
the same "Ying" in her name.

83
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Are you done talking?

84
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,820
Now, I'm in charge
of the Three Judicial Departments

85
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,060
and often review case files.

86
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,820
I even came across the case

87
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,140
about Chief Minister Su three years ago.

88
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,860
Ying, let's go.

89
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,740
Don't listen to his nonsense here.

90
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,500
Yian has a mischievous nature.

91
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,580
Don't mind him.

92
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,700
I don't mind at all.

93
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,100
I find what he said quite amusing.

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,260
He seems to have a way with words.

95
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,420
Of course,

96
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,420
you are still the best in the world.

97
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,340
By the way, Heng,

98
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,060
you work tirelessly
for the national affairs

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,140
every day.

100
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,420
You must be exhausted.

101
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,540
I'll prepare some hot water for you,

102
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,940
so you could relax and unwind.

103
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,180
Yuheng, let me join in.

104
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,180
Heng, I've prepared
the hot water for you.

105
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Enjoy it with His Highness.

106
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,540
Thank you, Ying.

107
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
You may leave.

108
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,380
Okay.

109
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,020
Yuheng, what are you standing there for?

110
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,940
Come into the pool now.

111
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,780
The hot water provided by Ying

112
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,980
is so comfortable.

113
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,700
Su Tu said Xie Yuheng
is not of royal blood,

114
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,960
but members of the Xie Family

115
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,420
all have a plum blossom mark
on their bodies.

116
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,340
A simple check will reveal the truth.

117
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,140
You have a really good physique.

118
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,220
Lean yet muscular,
toned and strong.

119
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,780
He has a plum blossom mark.

120
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,660
He is from the Xie Family.

121
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,780
Could Su Tu be wrong?

122
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,260
You're not bad either.

123
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,260
Broad shoulders, narrow waist,
and fair skin.

124
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,180
How do you manage to maintain

125
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,740
such a physique

126
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,620
despite your busy schedule?

127
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,380
I often go horseback riding and hunting
when I have free time.

128
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,860
Then we must have
a hunting trip together in the future.

129
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,660
Sure.

130
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,780
By the way,

131
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,780
We'll have a competition.

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,260
Please go easy on me then.

133
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,820
Who's there?

134
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,660
Heng,

135
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,500
are you inside?

136
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,340
Heng,

137
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,460
open the door.

138
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,620
Ying.

139
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,820
What's wrong?

140
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,620
I'm afraid of thunder.

141
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,140
Alright.

142
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,380
You are the best!

143
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,340
Yuheng.

144
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,300
I'm also afraid of thunder.

145
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,100
You are already a grownup,

146
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,900
yet you're still afraid of thunder?

147
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,340
I'm afraid of many things.

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,500
