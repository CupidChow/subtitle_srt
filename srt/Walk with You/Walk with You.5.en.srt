[The Disguise]

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,340
Let me go!

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,140
Let me go! Let me out!

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,260
Is she awake?

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,260
Let me go!

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,980
Let me out!

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,060
Let me go!

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,860
Now she's unconscious.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,580
Yep.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,180
Qing interrogated the Banjiu couple
with torture

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,220
and got the truth
of the counterfeit banknote case.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,060
What's the truth?

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,340
The Banjiu couple said

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,260
that they concealed
their identities from each other

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,540
to avoid exposure
and implicate each other.

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,340
However,
on the first day of each month,

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,060
they would meet

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,820
because they needed to hand

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,780
over the real banknotes obtained
by exchanging fake banknotes

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,100
to get the antidote.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
The antidote?

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,780
They were both poisoned

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,740
by someone behind the scenes,
which is why they were being compelled.

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,260
But I have an idea.

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,860
Since our appearances
are similar to the Banjiu couple,

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,980
why don't we disguise ourselves as them

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,020
and infiltrate their circle?

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,740
Ying, are you ready?

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,420
Come in.

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,220
Let me put it on for you.

32
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,980
Okay.

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,660
Done.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,540
Thanks.

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,140
Let's go.

36
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,140
What?

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,260
Since we're pretending
to be a married couple,

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,260
we should at least make ourselves
look like a real couple.

39
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,500
Otherwise, it's easy for people
to see through it.

40
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,380
What should we do then?

41
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,700
I think

42
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,780
most married couples

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,140
would do this.

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,900
Sure.

45
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,980
Can you let go of my hand now?

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,780
Sorry.

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,500
I didn't expect the meeting place
to be in the brothel.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,300
Perhaps because there are
many people here,

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,340
and it has a strong makeup smell.

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,540
They can both cover their tracks

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,340
and mask the scent of banknotes.

52
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,140
Indeed.

53
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,460
It's impossible to find Hua Chanjuan.

54
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,980
Ghosts knock on the door at midnight.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,540
The passers by are in deep sorrow.

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,980
Where's the stuff?

57
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,180
Where's the antidote?

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,940
Oh, look at me.

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,380
My memory is failing

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,380
as I age.

61
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Wait a moment,

62
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,780
I remember that the Banjiu couple

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
used to be very fond of kissing.

64
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,900
They used to kiss after every word.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,580
And repeat that over and over again.

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,180
They were always kissing.

67
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,300
Why don't you kiss today?

68
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,500
We can't let our efforts go in vain
at this point, can we?

69
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,340
Come on, the antidote is more important.

70
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
My wife is right.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
The antidote is more important.

72
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,660
Yes.

73
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,820
Please wait a moment.

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,940
I'll go up and get it for you.

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
See you.

76
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,620
Where did she go?

77
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,420
You are finally awake, Your Highness.

78
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,500
Where's Suying?

79
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,940
Where did you hide her?

80
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,900
Your Highness, don't be so impatient.

81
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,580
I just interrogated her with torture.

82
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,100
Who exactly are you?

83
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,780
I am the Seventh Prince's maid.

84
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,580
Although the Seventh Prince
is known as a coxcomb,

85
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,500
he never keeps
a personal maid by his side.

86
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,660
You know a little bit of kung fu

87
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,820
and disguise you and the Seventh Prince
as the Banjiu couple

88
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,380
to investigate
the counterfeit banknote case.

89
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,180
All this shows that you have
and unusual background.

90
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,780
Don't forget

91
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,660
that I'm the owner of this brothel.

92
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,460
I know precisely how to deal with women.

93
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,700
You better think it over
and tell me the truth.

94
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,580
Otherwise,

95
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,500
I'll make you suffer.
