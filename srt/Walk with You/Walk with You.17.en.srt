[Mutual Understanding]

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,660
You're lying.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
Heng and I are about to get married.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,540
How could he possibly
have killed my entire family?

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,900
I need to go see him.

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,700
You can't go back to that place.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,180
Where I go is my business.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,700
What does it have to do with you?

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,220
Who are you to me?

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,380
I can't believe I actually trusted you

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,100
and came out with you,

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,860
only to listen
to your made-up stories here.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,580
Let go!

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,260
Su Tu.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,900
You...

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,300
Get out of the way.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,220
Did Xie Yuheng send you here?

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm not Yang Ding,

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,580
I'm Su Tu.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,700
Leave.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,820
We have to leave together.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,540
I'm your sister, Su Tu.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,060
Su Tu.

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,620
It's not possible.

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,180
At the bank, you were clearly...

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,100
Move aside.

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,700
Su Tu.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,060
You're finally back.

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,260
I've been looking for you for so long.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
I'm sorry, Ying.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,140
I came back late.

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,300
You didn't. As long as you're back.

34
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,340
What exactly was going on?

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,820
The day the Su Family was massacred,

36
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,780
I was supposed to be killed
by Xie Yuheng.

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
But Xu Wan, the head
of the Vermilion Bird Pavilion, saved me.

38
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,500
She used the Memory Erasing Liquor
to erase my memory

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,580
and had me replace
the original chief guard of the bank

40
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,940
to serve Xie Yuheng.

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,300
So, during our time at the bank,

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,620
Su Yingying didn't mistake you.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,820
How did you regain your memory then?

44
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,300
That night, I was severely injured
and unconscious.

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,660
I dreamed about my past with my sister.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,060
When I woke up, I began to investigate

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,420
and then learned
about what happened to the Su Family.

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,500
Severely injured?

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,860
Yes.

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,260
We can't use this method.

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,260
I know.

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,020
When we were little,

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,820
my sister and I often sneaked out

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,860
to set off fireworks
outside the mansion.

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,820
Perhaps if we set off fireworks
in the bamboo forest,

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,100
it might help her regain her memory.

57
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,020
Perhaps it's also a good thing

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,820
if she doesn't regain her memory.

59
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,340
That way, she can live happily

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,700
without remembering

61
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,100
all the pain and hatred.

62
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,460
I will avenge my sister.

63
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,300
You must not act rashly.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,700
Xie Yuheng is deep one.

65
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,620
If something happens to you,

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,460
how can I face your sister?

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,500
Don't worry.

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,820
I'll be careful.

69
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,860
After being seriously injured,
I pretended that I didn't recover.

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,620
I lurked in the Eastern Palace
and secretly investigated.

71
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,980
I discovered a secret of Xie Yuheng's.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,620
Secret?

73
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,460
Every new moon,

74
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,020
he holds a ceremony.

75
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,700
It's a ritual from the previous dynasty.

76
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,660
So Xie Yuheng

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,340
is very likely not of royal blood.

78
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,780
If that's the case,

79
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,900
you should return to the palace first.

80
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,620
Keep an eye on Xie Yuheng for me

81
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,900
and observe his every move.

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,460
We'll keep in touch.

83
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
But my sister...

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,300
Don't worry,

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,740
I'll take good care of Ying.

86
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,660
Thank you.

87
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,540
Then, I'll take my leave.

88
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,020
Ying.

89
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,220
Have you remembered something?

90
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,420
No, nothing.

91
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,820
What are you doing?

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,900
I'm going to marry Heng.

93
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,220
Hurry up and get dressed properly.

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,420
She doesn't even remember
the plum blossom mark.

95
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,940
Be it the Su's Mansion, Su Tu,
or the fireworks,

96
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,220
none of them can trigger her memory.

97
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,420
It seems there's only one option left.

98
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,460
Oh no,

99
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,340
I'm about to have an episode.

100
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
Please, leave quickly.

101
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,620
Ying.

102
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,740
Ying.

103
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,020
I told you to leave!

104
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,460
I'll hurt you. So leave!

105
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,220
It's fine.

106
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,820
Ying.

107
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,900
How are you feeling?

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,060
I saw your plum blossom mark,

109
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
it looks like the plum blossom candy
I used to have when I was a child.

110
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,100
So,

111
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,740
if I bite you and it hurts,

112
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm really sorry.

113
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,140
Ying.

114
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,020
