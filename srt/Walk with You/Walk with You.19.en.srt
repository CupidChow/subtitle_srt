[Episode 19]
[Scheming]

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
Yuheng,
don't you think it's a bit cramped?

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,060
How about I sleep in the middle?

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,220
It's more spacious in my position.

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,220
Let me switch with you.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,740
Such a good position

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,860
should be left for you, my brother.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,940
No need to be so polite with me.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,860
You are the Crown Prince, after all.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,500
You should sleep somewhere
more spacious.

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,620
You've been busy managing
the Three Judicial Departments.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,780
You should take a good rest

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,420
on the outer side of the bed.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,300
You guys...

16
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,900
There must be some secret

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,420
hidden in Xie Yuheng's room.

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,340
Open the door.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,700
Why is the door locked?

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,140
Open the door.

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,300
His Highness has instructed us

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,420
to not let you go out.

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,340
Could it be that Xie Yuheng
has noticed that I'm pretending?

24
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,100
Come with me.

25
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,580
Xu Wan.

26
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,740
You once saved my life.

27
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,900
I don't want to fight you.

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,180
This is...

29
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,940
Father's official seal.

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,540
Back then, Chief Minister Su found
that the mastermind

31
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,660
behind the counterfeit banknote case
was the Crown Prince.

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,920
The Crown Prince then ordered me

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,340
to steal
Chief Minister Su's official seal,

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,660
forge documents of treason,

35
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,420
inform His Majesty,

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,700
and falsely accuse Chief Minister Su
of treason.

37
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,700
It was you!

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,300
Ying.

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,620
It was you who framed my father!

40
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,580
Xie Yuheng is highly skilled
in martial arts.

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,980
It's hard for me to defy his orders.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,700
But you can at least
come out and testify

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,060
to prove my father's innocence.

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,170
In these years, Xie Yuheng
has amassed wealth

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,300
through counterfeit banknotes,

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,420
which allowed him to bribe
civil and military officials.

47
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,100
I am just a commoner.

48
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,740
Even if I stand up,

49
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,860
no one will believe what I say.

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,660
If you want to bring him down,

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,140
you might as well start
with his background.

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,460
As far as I know,

53
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,780
Xie Yuheng is a royalty
from the previous dynasty.

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
Then why does he
have a plum blossom mark?

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,580
His mother was worried
about his true identity being exposed,

56
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,020
so she used a special powder
as ink on him

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,340
since the day he was born

58
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,300
and had a mark tattooed on his body

59
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,900
that is identical

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,180
to the plum blossom mark
of the Xie Family,

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,260
thus creating a convincing counterfeit.

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,700
Now I understand.

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,300
The Seventh Prince is in danger now.

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,660
Xie Yuheng is highly skilled
in martial arts.

65
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,500
Take this bag of powder with you.

66
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,620
It will ensure your safe escape.

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,300
Okay.

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,140
Xu Wan, let's leave together.

69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,580
No. Someone needs to stay behind

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,020
to deal with the Crown Prince.

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Let's go.

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,580
Drop the act.

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,580
What act?

74
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,180
When did you find out?

75
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,380
In the gazebo.

76
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,180
You are truly observant.

77
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,380
I'm thoroughly impressed.

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,100
Su Yingying inexplicably disappeared
overnight.

79
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,660
Just as she returned
to the Eastern Palace,

80
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,940
you came as well,

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,900
and you shamelessly insisted on staying
in the Eastern Palace.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,780
Your behaviors may seem unrelated,

83
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,580
but in fact, you two
are secretly cooperating

84
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,820
to deceive me,

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,420
waiting for an opportunity
to strike against me

86
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,100
when my guard is lowered.

87
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,500
Your suspicion of me

88
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,980
is truly disheartening.

89
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,260
I was merely staying overnight
as a guest.

90
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,980
Is that so?

91
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,700
Well, then I'll go back and see

92
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,300
what Su Yingying is doing right now.

93
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,700
Your internal strength
is truly profound.

94
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,460
For saving me,

95
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,860
you endured humiliation
and risked everything

96
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,460
to obtain the antidote from your enemy,

97
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,020
thereby losing your martial arts skills.

98
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,620
You've shown me immense kindness.

99
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,020
Given all that has happened,

100
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,820
I'd gladly die for you.

101
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,380
But you,

102
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,620
having regained your memory,

103
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,740
why didn't you tell me?

104
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,660
I was afraid you would stop me.

105
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,980
But when we were in the Eastern Palace,

106
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,620
you were afraid I would discover
your memory had returned,

107
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,020
so you chose to remind me instead.

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,260
Now that I've lost
my martial arts skills,

109
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,500
the only way
to catch Xie Yuheng off guard

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,860
and strike unexpectedly
is to get close to him.

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,380
Luckily, after all that's happened,

112
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,020
we've made some achievements.

113
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,260
At least, we've exposed
Xie Yuheng's true colors

114
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,260
and uncovered the truth
about the Su Family's massacre.

115
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,260
Now, we're just one step away.

116
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,460
Musk can help restore memory.

117
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,660
Perhaps it can also help restore
martial arts skills.
