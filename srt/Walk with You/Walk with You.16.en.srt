00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,380
Just as you said,

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,740
Suying really is in the Eastern Palace.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,940
Let's go.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,460
You may leave now.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,940
Heng, come join me on the swing.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,060
Sure.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,860
What did that woman say to you just now?

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,340
You mean Princess Furong?

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,020
She said a lot of strange things to me

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,420
that I didn't understand at all.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,460
Heng,

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,780
isn't Princess Furong
supposed to be far away at the border?

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,380
How did she suddenly come
to the Eastern Palace?

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,020
She's been betrothed to me
by His Majesty.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,780
Heng, what did you say?

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,820
Wasn't I the one supposed to marry you?

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,660
How did it suddenly become
Princess Furong?

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,740
This won't do,

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
I have to go see Father and His Majesty
to get this straight.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,540
Wait.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,340
Ying,

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,580
don't worry.

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,340
The one I love is you,

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,060
and the one I will marry is only you.

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,540
But the marriage bestowed by His Majesty
is not a trivial matter.

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,740
Moreover, we were already engaged.

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,420
Why did it suddenly change
to Princess Furong?

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,140
If His Majesty
breaks his promise like this,

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,780
I will definitely
seek justice for myself.

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,260
Alright,

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,420
don't worry.

34
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,420
I will explain this matter to him

35
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,740
and persuade him to retract his decree.

36
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,100
The one I will marry can only be you.

37
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,980
Really?

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,340
Yes.

39
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,780
When have I ever broken my word?

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,580
I'll trust you then.

41
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,620
Heng,

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,540
you must marry me.

43
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,540
Got it.

44
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,940
Come on.

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,500
I wonder why you suddenly paid a visit

46
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,700
to the Eastern Palace.

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,740
I heard that you wish to review
the case records in the Archive,

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,700
so I personally brought them here today.

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,860
It's such a trivial matter.
You shouldn't have gone to the trouble.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,100
Partly, I'm here to deliver the records,

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,380
and partly, it's been a while
since we last saw each other.

52
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,420
I'd like to have a drink with you.

53
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,060
You and I just met not long ago.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,820
It hasn't exactly been a while.

55
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm tired today.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,620
Come back another day.

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,700
Yuheng...

58
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,780
Please go back.

59
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,100
I'll take my leave.

60
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,620
Your Highness,

61
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,050
the ceremony
for the New Moon Ancestor Worship

62
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,580
is ready.

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,660
Good.

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,140
You won't let me in, huh?

65
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,820
But I can always scale the wall
and get in.

66
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,380
Ying.

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,700
Who are you?

68
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,420
I'm Xie Yian.

69
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,940
So, you're the Xie Yian

70
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,100
that Princess Furong mentioned,

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,340
the Seventh Prince from the border city.

72
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,820
I've heard about you.

73
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,020
When your mother passed away,

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I wanted to see you.

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
I was going to give you

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,900
the talisman my mother left me.

77
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,980
But you left in a hurry,

78
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,460
and I missed the chance.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,020
Seeing you today,

80
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,620
I think you and Heng

81
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,700
look nothing alike.

82
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,900
Has her memory returned to the past?

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,300
So she doesn't remember
her family's massacre

84
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,660
and the fact
that she used the alias Suying

85
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,500
to assassinate Xie Yuheng
and avenge her father.

86
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,820
Come with me.

87
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,860
I'll take you to see the best physician.

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,060
Let go of me.

89
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,500
You're really strange,

90
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,900
grabbing my hand when we've just met

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
and taking me to see a physician.

92
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,780
Maybe you're the one who's sick.

93
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,860
I can't believe I sympathized with you

94
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,940
for losing your mother like me.

95
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,740
I don't know what method Xie Yuheng used

96
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,100
to make her lose her memory,

97
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,980
but if Ying finds out

98
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,780
she's staying by her enemy's side,

99
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,020
she'll be in extreme pain.

100
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,780
You must come with me.

101
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,300
You mustn't stay in this place.

102
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,140
What happened to my martial arts skills?

103
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,100
How come I've lost them?

104
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,900
I...

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,780
Not only has she lost her memory,

106
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,900
but she has also lost
her martial arts skills.

107
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,460
What's going on here?

108
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,500
Anyway,

109
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,420
I'll get her out of here first.

110
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,980
How about I take you to see Su Tu?

111
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,340
Su Tu?

112
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,180
You know Su Tu?

113
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,940
Then take me to see him now.

114
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,900
Ying,

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,140
I don't mean to lie to you.

116
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,580
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,180
Sure.

118
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,060
When will you take me to see Su Tu?

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,260
I'll take you to see him very soon.

120
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,860
Okay.

121
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,980
Mr. Ren.

122
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,700
Have some more if you find it tasty.

123
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,540
She has not only lost
her martial arts skills

124
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,620
but also her memory.

125
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,420
Mr. Ren, do you have any solutions?

126
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,660
As that old saying goes,

127
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,580
"It's easy for cats to hop
onto the stove and the girls

128
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,820
to return to their parent's house."

129
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,780
Take Miss Suying

130
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,660
to see some people
she's familiar with,

131
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,260
things she's familiar with,

132
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,620
and places she once knew.

133
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,900
Perhaps with a little stimulation,

134
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,940
she'll recover.

135
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
This method sounds good.

136
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,460
Thank you, Mr. Ren.

137
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,140
Give it a shot.

138
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,460
Let's go.
I'll take you home to see Su Tu.

139
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,620
Okay.

140
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,180
Ying.

141
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,700
Why has my home become like this?

142
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,260
Father, Su Tu.

143
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,100
Ying.

144
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,580
Father.

145
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,420
Su Tu.

146
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,940
Ying.

147
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,700
Father.

148
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,940
Su Tu.

149
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,460
Father.

150
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,420
Su Tu.

151
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,940
What happened to my home?

152
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,060
Where is my father?

153
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,020
Where is Su Tu?

154
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,740
Didn't you say you've met Su Tu before?

155
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,660
I never met Su Tu.

156
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,860
I lied to you.

158
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,700
Why did you lie to me?

159
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,820
If I tell you the real reason,

160
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,180
