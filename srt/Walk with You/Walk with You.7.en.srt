00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,300
You have feelings for me too, right?

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,300
I...

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,780
You don't need to say it;
I already know.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,420
Your eyes have already told me.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,900
You... You let me go first.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,940
I know what you're worried about.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,220
You're afraid

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,980
of falling in love

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,060
and forgetting your hatred.

Don't worry,

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,940

What exactly happened?

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,140
I don't know what method
the Seventh Prince used

20
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,550
to find out the connection
between Hua Chanjuan

21
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,460
and the counterfeit banknotes.

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,020
It's him.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,500
Isn't he just a playboy?

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,180
Why did he start investigating a case?

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,660
And it's the counterfeit banknote case.

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,300
Previously, he refused to take charge

at the Three Judicial Departments,

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,740
but now he suddenly accepted it.

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,140

I won't. We have to leave together.
