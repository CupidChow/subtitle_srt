He's New WOOZI.

4088
02:26:21,351 --> 02:26:26,320
I think I am going to put "New" in front of my name and promote.
[We are looking forward to the music that NEW WOOZI will make us]

4089
02:26:26,903 --> 02:26:29,909
This vacation was so much fun for me.
[JEONGHAN]

4090
02:26:29,909 --> 02:26:32,148
I already planned a vacation!
[(Next)]

4091
02:26:32,148 --> 02:26:33,479
- Oh! Really?
- Yes.

4092
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:37,655
I just want to go by myself. Just...
[Vacation that he goes by himself]

4093
02:26:37,655 --> 02:26:42,609
- I am thinking of going to a small village and go. / - Nice.
[JEONGHAN who is planning a vacation to a small town]

4094
02:26:42,609 --> 02:26:43,533
Nice!

4095
02:26:43,619 --> 02:26:44,477
Nice, nice.

4096
02:26:44,477 --> 02:26:48,695
The environment at the wine festival was so nice.
[JUN]

4097
02:26:48,695 --> 02:26:49,792
- JUN really liked the wine festival. / - He really likes the wine festival.
[JUN really liked the wine festival]

4098
02:26:49,792 --> 02:26:51,448
He enjoyed it well. Enjoyed it well.
[JUN really liked the wine festival]

4099
02:26:51,448 --> 02:26:53,412
Instead, there...
[At the place where there was a lot of people]

4100
02:26:53,412 --> 02:26:55,739
That feeling where no one knew me was really nice.
[Nice that he was able to enjoy the festival with people he doesn't know...!]

4101
02:26:55,739 --> 02:26:56,854
It's been such a long time.
[Nice that he was able to enjoy the festival with people he doesn't know...!]

4102
02:26:56,854 --> 02:26:58,201
- Yes, we...
- Really! It's been such a long time.

4103
02:26:58,201 --> 02:27:01,792
If we are in Korea,

4104
02:27:01,792 --> 02:27:04,968
we honestly can't go to a festival.
[Couldn't even try to go watch a soccer game]

4105
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:05,940
It's fun.

4106
02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:08,585
[Vacation, allowed him to fulfill his small wish]

4107
02:27:08,592 --> 02:27:11,812
It seems like an animation. It's so nice.
[Vacation, allowed him to fulfill his small wish]

4108
02:27:13,045 --> 02:27:16,591
While promoting as SEVENTEEN, you call it work and life balance?
[SEUNGKWAN]

4109
02:27:16,591 --> 02:27:21,145
- Our work and life balance is not that well balanced.
- Work life balance.

4110
02:27:21,145 --> 02:27:23,845
So, we have always
[After debut for 10 years]

4111
02:27:23,845 --> 02:27:27,350
- spent it with 90% work. / - Yes.
[After debut for 10 years, SEVENTEEN came running nonstop]

4112
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:32,925
I think I realized a lot that this was a time
[HOSHI]

4113
02:27:32,925 --> 02:27:34,109
that SEVENTEEN needed a lot right now.

4114
02:27:34,109 --> 02:27:37,655
I think we needed a tempo where we rest.

4115
02:27:37,655 --> 02:27:40,694
It's been a while where the members played around

4116
02:27:40,694 --> 02:27:44,860
with no worries like real friends and family.

4117
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:47,120
I think this kind of emotion is the first...

4118
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:51,295
I think these members are even more precious.

4119
02:27:51,570 --> 02:27:54,275
While being on this trip and seeing the members,
[VERNON]

4120
02:27:54,275 --> 02:27:58,999
I think we were all able to get some more peace of mind.

4121
02:27:58,999 --> 02:28:03,715
I think thanks to that, we were able to have some solidarity again.

4122
02:28:03,715 --> 02:28:06,975
More importantly, I want to say thank you for that.

4123
02:28:07,175 --> 02:28:13,245
It's been a while that I was able to talk about sincere things with the members.
[DINO]

4124
02:28:14,682 --> 02:28:17,162
[That night of the talent show]

4125
02:28:17,727 --> 02:28:21,786
[Members who are gathering around the living room]

4126
02:28:22,075 --> 02:28:24,220
[REC]
[While we were switching the camera memory card]

4127
02:28:24,226 --> 02:28:26,277
[NO SIGNAL]
[While we were switching the camera memory card]

4128
02:28:26,675 --> 02:28:28,473
I think so.
[Things they couldn't share due to the busy schedules]

4129
02:28:28,473 --> 02:28:31,102
- I think so. / - I think I know what you mean.
- I know what you mean.
[Started talking about things they couldn't share due to the busy schedules]

4130
02:28:32,170 --> 02:28:35,904
[Time to let go of old stories]

4131
02:28:36,275 --> 02:28:38,553
Thank you so much for telling us.
[JOSHUA] [To us]

4132
02:28:38,553 --> 02:28:41,527
We will try harder from now on since you told us.
[JOSHUA] [To us]

4133
02:28:41,527 --> 02:28:42,670
- Good thing you told us.
- Good job. / - Good job.

4134
02:28:42,670 --> 02:28:44,981
If you don't talk about it in the first place, misunderstandings will continue to arise.
[JEONGHAN]

4135
02:28:44,981 --> 02:28:46,451
- Thank you! / - Thanks so much.
[(For telling us)]

4136
02:28:46,451 --> 02:28:50,278
Whether you get hurt or not, you need to solve it with words.
[THE 8] [(Through talking)]

4137
02:28:50,278 --> 02:28:50,841
Yes.

4138
02:28:50,848 --> 02:28:53,318
Whether you fight or talk.
[THE 8]

4139
02:28:53,516 --> 02:28:56,584
When things are really hard, even small things can upset you...
[THE 8]

4140
02:28:56,584 --> 02:28:57,834
Yes, it would be strong.

4141
02:28:57,834 --> 02:29:00,399
- If it's okay, no matter what you do... / - But this...
[THE 8] [(Doesn't matter)]

4142
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:03,796
- But the arrow eventually goes back to you. "Am I the problem?" / - Yes.
[SEUNGKWAN] [If you can't take the joke]

4143
02:29:03,796 --> 02:29:06,452
- Why can't I take this as a joke? / - Yes, yes.
[SEUNGKWAN] [(These jokes)]

4144
02:29:06,452 --> 02:29:08,478
- Am I the problem? I thought about this a lot. / - That's possible.
[SEUNGKWAN]

4145
02:29:08,478 --> 02:29:12,512
To be honest, since we like each other so much,

4146
02:29:12,512 --> 02:29:15,569
- there is a fact that we don't want to point fingers at each other.
- Yes, yes.

4147
02:29:15,569 --> 02:29:17,346
- And it goes to yourself.
- So... So...

4148
02:29:17,521 --> 02:29:23,010
We are all just going together.
[Just...]

4149
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:25,166
Literally, there is no one here without any hardships.

4150
02:29:25,166 --> 02:29:26,145
We are all having a hard time...

4151
02:29:26,145 --> 02:29:27,615
We are all holding back on things that are hard.

4152
02:29:27,615 --> 02:29:32,285
But since the timing is different, we might hurt each other

4153
02:29:32,285 --> 02:29:34,560
and we might be more sensitive.

4154
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,410
Just talk more when that's the case.

4155
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:39,810
- Like we just said, we are the same.
- We don't know.

4156
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:43,185
If we say it, we can know.
[We] [Each other]

4157
02:29:43,185 --> 02:29:45,760
And honestly, we are getting older

4158
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:48,785
and we each have our own pride.

4159
02:29:48,785 --> 02:29:52,935
- To be honest, we can't make jokes for no reason now.
- Yes, yes.

4160
02:29:52,935 --> 02:29:56,310
We can't make jokes that cross the line.

4161
02:29:56,310 --> 02:29:59,235
But in our situation now,

4162
02:29:59,235 --> 02:30:02,210
- I think that misunderstandings are just misunderstandings.
- Yes.

4163
02:30:02,210 --> 02:30:05,585
- With this much respect and consideration... / - We are people that are good at not crossing a line.
[(We're that team)]

4164
02:30:05,585 --> 02:30:07,110
Oppositely, when I had a hard time,

4165
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:10,685
it was really nice when the members came and just acted like normal.

4166
02:30:10,685 --> 02:30:14,984
Since I also had hardships and have also been a person who was there for someone suffering,

4167
02:30:14,984 --> 02:30:19,060
I just think that I want to keep on talking to them.

4168
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:21,075
To be honest, it's a difference in views.

4169
02:30:21,075 --> 02:30:23,185
- We have different personalities and vibes. / - Yes, yes.
[(Everyone)]

4170
02:30:23,185 --> 02:30:28,003
I think that talking a little at a time like this is practice.

4171
02:30:28,003 --> 02:30:31,472
We didn't talk like this for a while.

4172
02:30:31,472 --> 02:30:36,232
Whether it's by group, three people or two,

4173
02:30:36,677 --> 02:30:39,826
I want to talk about these small things and emotions.

4174
02:30:39,826 --> 02:30:41,229
- So nice.
- With the members.

4175
02:30:41,229 --> 02:30:47,851
We need to always live by repaying each other's hardships.

4176
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:49,025
Good job.

4177
02:30:49,025 --> 02:30:49,764
You're the best.

- You're the best.
- What is happening?

02:30:53,380 --> 02:30:54,996
No, we were all talking together.

Just go back inside.

- Sit. What do you mean? Sit.
- No, no, no. Here.

I'm kidding. Kidding.

Did you wash up?

4187
02:31:03,619 --> 02:31:04,535
I washed up and came.
[Couldn't hear them gather because he was washing up]

02:31:04,535 --> 02:31:05,115
Good job.
[Couldn't hear them gather because he was washing up]

4189
02:31:05,115 --> 02:31:05,881
While I was doing this...

4190
02:31:05,881 --> 02:31:07,423
You were flustered, right? I saw.
[Again, doesn't know that the deep night is passing]

"Why is he doing that much?"
[Again, doesn't know that the deep night is passing]

4192
02:31:08,582 --> 02:31:11,732
"Really." I saw that.
[Again, doesn't know that the deep night is passing and talks]

4193
02:31:11,732 --> 02:31:12,816
It was a joke.
[Again, doesn't know that the deep night is passing and talks]

But, me too.
[Again, doesn't know that the deep night is passing and talks]

To be honest, this is why we made the monthly gathering...

I'm jealous. It's not that I am grateful because you looked like a fool.

- It's being brave. / - It's being brave.

You are really nice to the staff, too...

Our writers were so surprised and said that you're so nice.

This is the biggest strength that you have!

We can't have that strength even if we wanted to.

- It's not something that comes with effort.
- It's not.

The problem is that I want to be like this all the time but I can't sometimes.

It's okay because that's being in reality.

That's reality. Since we are in reality,

"NANA TOUR" is the best.

4724
02:59:12,370 --> 02:59:14,460
- Salute.
- Salute.

4725
02:59:18,804 --> 02:59:26,348
After CARAT seeing us do all these things on "NANA TOUR",

4726
02:59:26,565 --> 02:59:30,442
even if you don't get happier,

4727
02:59:30,517 --> 02:59:32,765
I think it would be really nice

4728
02:59:32,765 --> 02:59:37,580
if it was a time where you smile or laugh even for a little bit.

4729
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:38,610
And

4730
02:59:39,287 --> 02:59:41,684
I don't know if this is the right expression.

4731
02:59:41,728 --> 02:59:47,611
We are trying to have more fun together like this.

4732
02:59:47,611 --> 02:59:54,201
The ultimate reason why I try to cherish these moments more

4733
02:59:54,351 --> 02:59:59,568
is eventually because we want CARAT to be happier

4734
02:59:59,568 --> 03:00:02,567
Because of that, we hope that you see us laugh

4735
03:00:02,567 --> 03:00:04,802
and that would be doubled

4736
03:00:04,829 --> 03:00:10,019
and I always think how it would be nice it that was relayed to CARAT.
[Hope that CARAT will laugh with us...]

4737
03:00:10,044 --> 03:00:13,500
CARAT, be happy.

4738
03:00:13,790 --> 03:00:15,277
And enjoy "NANA TOUR".

4739
03:00:15,277 --> 03:00:16,651
Thank you.

4740
03:00:19,512 --> 03:00:20,558
[Lastly, S.COUPS]

4741
03:00:20,558 --> 03:00:21,533
To CARAT.
[Lastly, S.COUPS!]

4742
03:00:21,533 --> 03:00:26,708
I feel like they would be more upset
at the fact that I couldn't go...

4743
03:00:26,980 --> 03:00:30,485
I am planning on coming out little by little
[S.COUPS was with "NANA TOUR" through interviews and etc.]

4744
03:00:30,485 --> 03:00:33,785
through interviews or whatever
[S.COUPS was with "NANA TOUR" through interviews and etc.]

4745
03:00:34,075 --> 03:00:36,525
so don't be too upset...

4746
03:00:39,290 --> 03:00:46,235
I always want to say thank you to CARAT.

4747
03:00:46,235 --> 03:00:48,080
While watching this show,

4748
03:00:48,105 --> 03:00:53,455
I hope that it can be a time where CARAT can heal.

4749
03:00:53,895 --> 03:00:57,905
Have you ever though about want to go somewhere with SEVENTEEN...?
[Thought it was over, right?] [Q.]

4750
03:00:58,092 --> 03:00:59,626
Oh...?

4751
03:01:01,269 --> 03:01:02,907
Just us...?

4752
03:01:03,335 --> 03:01:06,400
I think it would be hard with just us without a production crew.

4753
03:01:06,827 --> 03:01:08,590
If we think about it realistically!

4754
03:01:08,590 --> 03:01:11,001
We will go with "NANA TOUR" next time.

4755
03:01:11,221 --> 03:01:12,621
We have the heart

4756
03:01:12,621 --> 03:01:13,746
but I think it's going to be a mess.

4757
03:01:13,771 --> 03:01:16,219
- Someone needs to drag us!
- Yes.

4758
03:01:16,219 --> 03:01:18,402
That's true. That's really true.

4759
03:01:18,402 --> 03:01:20,341
- This is really...
- There are a couple of members who don't go out.

4760
03:01:20,341 --> 03:01:22,846
It would have been impossible if it wasn't for "NANA TOUR"...

4761
03:01:22,846 --> 03:01:24,057
- A schedule.
- Really.

4762
03:01:24,057 --> 03:01:26,521
All of the 13 members' hobbies and tastes are different.

4763
03:01:26,667 --> 03:01:29,479
Once we say let's go, "I can go then".
[Vacation]

4764
03:01:29,479 --> 03:01:31,325
"I can do this time..."

4765
03:01:31,325 --> 03:01:33,535
- We're going to waste all the time matching the schedules.
- It's kind of hard. Yes.

4766
03:01:33,535 --> 03:01:35,260
It's not easy. Not easy.

4767
03:01:35,459 --> 03:01:37,431
It's hard to get together once a month, too...
[(Other than schedules)]

4768
03:01:37,431 --> 03:01:41,625
- But I think that I really want to come back here again.
- Yes.
[Italy]

4769
03:01:42,056 --> 03:01:43,580
Later on when I have time...

4770
03:01:43,580 --> 03:01:46,511
I kind of want to live in Italy. Really.

4771
03:01:47,486 --> 03:01:49,672
- Really?
- We need to leave him. We should leave him here!

4772
03:01:50,288 --> 03:01:51,762
Should we leave you?
[Left in Italy]

4773
03:01:51,762 --> 03:01:54,362
I am in urgent need of a dermatologist...

4774
03:01:54,412 --> 03:01:57,145
I need to go a dermatologist.

- Do I need to do a cooking show? / - I think you would do well.
[On the day we ate hamburger deliciously in Panzano]

"Man, it's good."

4785
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:24,015
I'm sure that I can't do this well.

4786
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:25,045
I need to do ones that I have done!

4787

[(At the failure of his talent) (Demoralized)]

4788
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:30,025
I guess you are not in the talent field.

4790
