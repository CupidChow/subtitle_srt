1025
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:05,640
It's so easy.
[Full body into the tub]

1026

I just did it right away because it was too easy.
[Mission that was too easy for THE 8]

1034
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,660
One bottle?
[Just a wine bottle?]

1035
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:26,200
That?
[No way]

1036
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,615
- Drink a bottle? / - Just that bottle of wine?
[Yes, it's me]

1037

How do you drink all of it?!

1038
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:32,125
Isn't that not a bottle?

[(Strictly) One bottle]

1040

There are times when you crave it.
[Just wanted to drink this]

1056
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,625
MINGYU, you must be stressed. Have a glass of wine.
[Ending: got his wine stolen]

1057
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:11,005
