- We will talk about it slowly and prepare it.
[Came to keep the promise]

174
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,993
But about you not coming because you hurt your leg...
[PD Na]

175
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,968
Proof of content might be sent to you!

176
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:54,995
Proof of content? Why?
[Going to sue you]

177
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:56,735
You got hurt when we were supposed to go...!

178
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,875
To be honest, he wants to go so bad...
[PD Na] [Together]

179
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,257
To be honest, you needed to come with us...
[PD Na]

180
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,100
- We bought all the flights, too. / - I got hurt, right?
[Even bought all of the tickets]

181
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,737
[The sudden news of S.COUPS' injury]

182
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,075
To be honest, we were going to push it back.
[Plans]

183
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,891
- It's going to take a long time. / - To fit each other's schedule...
[S.COUPS needs enough time for his rehab]

184
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:15,382
It would have been really nice to go together. I'm so sad about that.
[There's nothing we can do that S.COUPS can't go]

185
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,560
- Show the Colosseum to S.COUPS.
- Do you want me to show you the Colosseum?

186
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,643
Show me some.

187
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,458
[Makes sure to show their brother when they go to a nice place]

188
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,575
It's big, right?
[Makes sure to show their brother when they go to a nice place]

189
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,375
- S.COUPS quiz for iced Americano. / - Okay.
[Play games with(?) S.COUPS]

190
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,710
What is S.COUPS doing right now?
[ex)]

191
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,380
- In detail.
- MINGYU!

["We won't make you feel like you're alone" -"NANA TOUR"]

195
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,802
Do you normally talk about that?
[PD Na]

196
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,392
About "Youth Over Flowers"...
[PD Na]

197
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:47,553
To be honest, we only said, "Won't we not be able to go?"

198
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,818
So, our album needs to come out.
[At the time of the kidnapping, the album is releasing soon]

199
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,074
You guys are busy.
[At the time of the kidnapping, the album is releasing soon]

200
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:53,315
And then, we need to do an award ceremony and stuff.
[When it's the end of the year]

201
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:57,275
- Eventually... We thought that it would just disappear.
- It's going to naturally disappear.

202
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,448
- Wow... I didn't know that we would go like this.
- Oh, it did.

203
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:01,434
- The members have no idea. / - No clue.
[Current situation other than S.COUPS: SEVENTEEN has no idea]

204
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:04,601
And even if we do do it, they have no clue that it's going to happen right now...?

205
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,221
Because our schedule is packed.

206
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,741
A couple of days ago at "The Game Caterers",
[During SEVENTEEN's 8th year live]

207
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,530
we got the "Youth Over Flowers".
[Congrats on SEVENTEEN's 8th year]

208
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,710
Yes, yes, yes!

209
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,610
But normally, "Youth Over Flowers" is just...

210
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,279
- Do you go all of a sudden?
- Suddenly...

211
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,084
So, even if we do go... I don't think we will know when we go.

212
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,800
- We don't know?
- We might.

213
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,655
That would be so much fun.

214
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,226
But I think we will know.
[(Don't know where the confidence is coming from]

215
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:28,145
When we will be going...

216
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,015
- Since our schedule is so packed.
- Because we have never had a break in our schedule...

217
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:31,599
There was never a break!
[Schedule]

218
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,451
- No, so... I'm sure they will get a fake schedule.
- First, looking at S.COUPS...
[Schedule]

219
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:37,200
- "What is this?" / - This then, this then. It's going to be scheduled.
[Schedule]

220
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,005
There might be a fake schedule in there.
[(Knows PD Na very well)]

221
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:41,206
Pretends not to know if it looks like that...
[(???)]

222
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,288
- You pretend not to know and go.
- Yes, pretend not to know.

223
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,738
Because we talked about that amongst ourselves.
[WOOZI]

224
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,394
- Because we...
- Don't think they can fool us.

225
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,935
We are people who always look and see the schedule.

226
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,689
We expected it because there was a gap.

227
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:55,199
So, we looked at each other a bit.

228
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,694
Kind of ruining...

229
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:58,174
- Ruin it...
- Ruin it.

230
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:00,071
We need to act like we're getting taken.
[Do we need to pretend that we're getting taken...]

231
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,834
- We didn't want that. / - Yes, hated that so much.
[Do we need to pretend that we're getting taken...]

232
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,875
[That's why we worked harder in preparing perfectly]

233
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,083
- Your schedule is packed after the Tokyo Dome, right? / - Yes.
[Concert] [Staff]

234
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,683
[September 2023, SEVENTEEN's monthly schedule]

235

[SEVENTEEN's schedule that's not different from any other time]

236
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,194
- With practice... / - It's a fake schedule.
[All of that]

237
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,622
- Then, we have no schedule?
- No.

238
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,197
[(Loving eyes) (toward the manager)]

239
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,292
[Crazy]

240
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:18,929
What do they say?

241
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,667
- They don't know? / - They don't know.
[Of course, the members don't know]

242
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,360
Only S.COUPS knows right now.
[You are the only one out of SEVENTEEN that knows...]

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,505
- I heard you told them not to tell you.
- Yes. / - We kept on saying that.
[SEVENTEEN asked them to not tell them ever]

244
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:28,659
Please don't get caught...

245
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,800
And don't tell even one member!

246
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,635
- Yes, that's right. That's a no-no!
- Yes.

247
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,073
So, it's not that they know and I don't know...

248
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,012
None of us know?

249
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:38,101
No one knows? Not at all right now.

[Only two people who know about this truth!]

- I know.
- It's so hard, right?

255
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,409
In our staff's K*kao chatroom,

256
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:57,705
"We're in trouble!", "They picked 'Youth Over Flowers'"!, "What is happening?"

257
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,365
They picked "Youth Over Flowers" but we didn't even know.
[Situation where the staff was surprised, too]

258
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,757
"Why is 'Youth Over Flowers' coming out here?"
[Director Shim Jae Hyun] [- SEVENTEEN's general manager]

259
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:04,305
I went home as soon as I saw them pick that from the set.
[Director Shim Jae Hyun] [- SEVENTEEN's general manager]

260

Really no one is following?
[(PLEDIS staff)]

[CEO doesn't know either...]

267

- That's why we called. / - Yes.
[To make them that reason]

273

You might honestly think that we are being over exaggerating...

296

We don't think it's an exaggeration.

297

Will they be fooled if we do this much?

298

Don't you need to do more? This is what I think.

I think I can add about three or four.

MINGYU is definitely going to be drunk.

- I think...
- But I don't think they would sleep.

323
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,000
I think we do need to see the situation.
