EPISODE 14

2
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,320
The next volume. Where is it?

3
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,451
How could she end it here?

4
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,133
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
So what happened next?

5
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,176
Are they going out?

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,637
Come on. I want to know what happened.

7
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,687
NA HEE-DO, BACK YI-JIN

8
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,777
UBS ANCHOR BACK YI-JIN
HIGHLIGHTS DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,782
So they weren't involved in any scandals.

10
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,701
SPECIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN
NA HEE-DO AND REPORTER BACK YI-JIN

11
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,370
In 2009?

12
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,001
SPECIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN
NA HEE-DO AND REPORTER BACK YI-JIN

13
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,214
Today is July 10th, 2009.
Welcome to UBS News.

14
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,468
We have won another gold medal
in San Francisco.

15
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,515
Today, the "King of Fencing" Na Hee-do won
her third gold medal for Korea.

16
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,770
We will connect live to San Francisco
to speak with her.

17
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,734
Ms. Na Hee-do?

18
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,493
It's nice to see you.

19
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,539
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,295
Thank you.

21
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,133
Have you been doing well too?

22
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,305
Yes.

23
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,682
I've been well.

24
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,564
Ms. Na was the first athlete
I was in charge of covering

25
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,232
when I was a sports reporter.

26
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,904
It brings back old memories
to see her again for this occasion.

27
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,366
Starting from Madrid, Prague,
and now in San Francisco,

28
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,994
you have won three golds in a row.

29
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,496
Please tell us how you feel.

30
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,082
It is a great honor,

31
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,836
and I would like to thank you all
for cheering me on.

32
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,007
Your matches are
always the talk of the town.

33
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,053
You gave another
impressive performance in San Francisco.

34
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,597
Were there any difficulties
in winning the gold medal?

35
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,642
Well, let me see.

36
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,561
All matches are difficult to some extent,

37
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,022
but I've fenced
in many challenging matches.

38
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,193
So, to be honest, I found this match
the easiest compared to the others.

39
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,986
I see.

40
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,741
Then can you tell us
which one was the toughest?

41
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:09,290
That would be
the first time I won gold in Madrid.

42
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,796
By Madrid, are you referring to
your match in 2001

43
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,465
when you were in the finals
against Ms. Ko Yu-rim?

44
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,842
Yes, that's right.

45
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,640
The final women's fencing match will
begin now.

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,233
Introducing the two impressive players
who have made it to the finals.

47
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:45,827
An imposing rookie
that has reached the finals

48
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,621
in her first appearance on the big stage.

49
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,457
From Korea, Na Hee-do.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,753
Now, let me introduce her opponent.

51
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,924
The reigning champion.
From Russia, Julia Ko.

52
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,508
En garde.

53
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,928
Prêtes?

54
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,099
Allez.

55
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,315
FEBRUARY 2000

56
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,234
Yes, I got you! Drink up.

57
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,444
Aren't I good at this?

58
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,571
You should have lifted a thumb.

59
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,364
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

60
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,289
It hasn't been long since I turned 20,

61
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,041
but why am I so used to drinking?

62
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,171
That's called having talent.

63
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,130
Congratulations.

64
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,426
This game is more fun with more people.
Why aren't they coming?

65
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,305
Hold on.

66
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,516
What do we have here?

67
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,029
Hi, guys.

68
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,914
It just happened.

69
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,919
-Say something.
-Right.

70
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,004
-Hee-do is too good for you.
-What?

71
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,881
No, Yi-jin is too good for her.

72
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,509
He is truly beautiful.

73
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,554
-What do you mean by that?
-Cut it out.

74
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,890
I feel so bad for myself.

75
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,561
What good does it do to me
to be here among the couples?

76
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,983
-My gosh.
-Stop it right there.

77
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,027
Everyone, raise your glasses.

78
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,654
Let's make a toast.

79
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,407
To what?

80
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,242
To our beginning?

81
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,661
Don't be ridiculous.

82
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,040
To Ji Seung-wan!

83
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,667
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

84
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,379
One, two, three!

85
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,297
Four!

86
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,339
Five, six, seven!

87
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,507
Eight, nine, ten!

88
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,718
-Eleven, twelve!
-Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen!

89
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,304
-Sixteen, seventeen!
-Eighteen, nineteen, twenty!

90
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,851
Wait, where were we?

91
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,769
Gosh.

92
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,855
Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven!

93
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,109
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

94
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,780
Thirty.

95
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,325
Drink up!

96
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,534
-Drumroll!
-Drumroll!

97
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,915
-Horse number one!
-Horse number two!

98
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,374
-Horse number three!
-Horse number four!

99
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,043
-Horse number five!
-Let's start.

100
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,128
Horse number one!

101
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,715
-Drumroll!
-Drumroll!

102
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,802
-Noonchi game's on. One!
-Two!

103
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,554
-Three!
-Four!

104
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,555
Yes!

105
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,681
-Drumroll!
-Drumroll!

106
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,361
Words starting with the "Sh" sound, go!

107
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,406
-Shoes.
-Shave.

108
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,534
-Sherbet.
-Shelf.

109
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,369
-Ship.
-Shop.

110
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,538
-Shark.
-Short.

111
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,999
**it.

112
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,252
Did you say that to me?

113
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,462
-I'm older than her.
-There are other words left, right?

114
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,838
-This is okay, right?
-Yes.

115
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,090
Shoes?

116
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,260
-It's already been said!
-Come on.

117
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,636
-Drumroll!
-Drumroll!

118
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,770
No pushing!

119
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,487
Guys, stop running. It's dangerous.

120
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,447
Hey!

121
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,785
Let's go for another round!

122
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,787
Let's do that!

123
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,291
Let's go to Yi-jin's place

124
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,210
and the one who gets there last

125
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,796
buys everyone ice cream!

126
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,424
-I'm going first!
-Stop!

127
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,509
Let's go!

128
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,970
Hey, Back Yi-jin!

129
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,848
Did you say "Hey, Back Yi-jin"?
That's way too casual.

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,684
So Hee-do can call you that, but I can't?

131
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,144
Isn't that obvious?

132
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:08,316
I'll kill you if you make Hee-do cry.
Do you understand?

133
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,530
Wait for me!

134
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,990
Hurry up!

135
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,452
Hee-do sure is lucky.

136
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,288
Wait for me.

137
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,457
Let's go together.

138
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,168
It's freezing.

139
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,463
I'm cold.

140
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,341
Guys.

141
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,719
I think I have had enough.

142
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,180
-Hey!
-Gosh.

143
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,849
You're not alone in this.

144
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,727
This is tough for me too.

145
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,271
All of us here are in the same boat.

146
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,774
Have a drink.

147
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,861
Let's eat pajeon and makgeolli next time.

148
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,446
-What do you think?
-Sounds good.

149
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,824
That's a good idea,
but let's also go on a trip.

150
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,161
Like the one we went on in summer.

151
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,956
That's a great idea.
I want to go to Jeju Island.

152
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,459
I've never been there before.

153
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,630
For me, I want to go to Jeongdongjin,
where they filmed Sandglass.

154
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,466
Sandglass. Jeongdongjin is good.

155
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,843
Seung-wan, what about you?

156
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,850
I…

157
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,229
want to go to college.

158
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,025
I really don't want to study.

159
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,322
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

160
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,407
Don't cry.

161
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,784
-She's drunk.
-Don't cry.

162
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,453
-Stop.
-She cries when she's drunk.

163
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,498
It's a bummer.

164
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,086
I'm so upset. This is so sad.

165
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,804
HEE-DO'S

166
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,099
Hey.

167
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,060
What is he doing right now?

168
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,271
I guess he knows
how to comfort a crying girl.

169
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,857
Yi-jin must have gone around
making a lot of girls cry.

170
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,693
Hey!

171
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,653
-Yi-jin.
-Calm down, Hee-do.

172
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,363
Hey, you.

173
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,490
Tell me, who was it?

174
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,617
Who was it?

175
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,995
Was it Da-eun? Min-young?

176
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,414
-Did you make Min-young cry?
-Please stop.

177
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,708
-Who was it?
-Please don't hit me.

178
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,627
Who else is there?

179
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,757
-Did you make a lot of girls cry?
-Please, don't.

180
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,884
Give me their names!

181
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,597
-Did you make them cry?
-Please let me go home.

182
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,474
-Please stop.
-What a mess.

183
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,393
Please, I didn't do anything.

184
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,978
-I don't know!
-Let's go home.

185
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,022
-Okay.
-Please!

186
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,111
I like going back home

187
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,655
while the others are on their way to work.

188
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,032
-Right?
-Agreed.

189
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,744
I hope they all work hard today

190
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,787
while I go home and sleep.

191
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,586
In the evening

192
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,048
-And in the morning
-Wait. Whose voice is this?

193
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,510
There wasn't any day

194
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,180
That you and I

195
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,934
Didn't share our worries

196
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,562
-Our worries
-Listen.

197
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,439
-Dad.
-Yes?

198
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,150
-I have a boyfriend.
-He's your dad?

199
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,235
What?

200
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,947
What do you like about him?

201
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,783
Well, he is sweet like you

202
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,117
and he treats me well.

203
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,162
Still…

204
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,499
no one can love you more than I do.

205
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,794
Yu-rim, you know that
I'm the record holder on this, right?

206
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,422
Of course! Your record will stay
unbroken forever.

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,840
No one can break it.

208
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,426
Absolutely. You can't find anyone
like your dad.

209
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,720
That's what I'm talking about!

210
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,185
I'll break that record.

211
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,855
Good luck.

212
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,169
-Oh my!
-This is a major accident!

213
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,505
-Sir, do you have a cell phone?
-A phone?

214
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,465
-Are you okay?
-Call 911.

215
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,594
Is this 911? I'm reporting an accident.

216
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,304
-A car accident.
-My goodness.

217
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,734
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

218
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,079
Where is the patient
that just came in from a car accident?

219
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,290
He's in the operating room.

220
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,848
OPERATING ROOM

221
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,062
Dad.

222
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,239
Are you the one
who hit my son with your car?

223
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,533
-I'm sorry.
-What are you going to do?

224
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,661
What are you going to do about my son?

225
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,870
I am so sorry.

226
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,248
You had better take responsibility
for what you've done!

227
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,251
How could you do this!

228
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,089
You should die!

229
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,132
Let my son live and you should die.

230
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,634
What will you do?

231
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,761
Please, save his life.

232
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,263
-I'm sorry!
-What are you going to do!

233
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,848
I'm sorry!

234
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,184
-I'm so sorry.
-How could this happen!

235
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,024
Yu-rim, let's go.

236
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,777
Let's go. Come here.

237
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,488
What should we do?

238
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,574
How could this happen to us?

239
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,169
This issue won't solve itself
from drinking every day.

240
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,174
Then what should I do?

241
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,011
No one is willing to lend me money,

242
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,680
and I can't take out any more loans.

243
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,892
What else can I do?

244
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,646
Let's sell our shop.

245
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,357
We should be able to get a premium
since it's in front of the school.

246
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,193
And if we put that together
with the deposit for this house--

247
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,321
What do you think we can do with that?

248
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,408
Would that barely cover
the victim's medical bills?

249
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,493
We should do what we can

250
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,746
at all costs!

251
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,332
They say you could go to jail
if we can't settle on an agreement.

252
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,626
Honey.

253
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,629
Our daughter is on the national team.

254
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,218
Are you going to tarnish our girl's name?

255
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,974
Do you think…

256
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,311
I want to do this?

257
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,773
Do you think…

258
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,151
this is what I want to do?

259
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,029
Hi, Yu-rim. Are you here to pack, too?

260
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,242
Did you hear that I will be the coach
for the national team?

261
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,953
So I'll see you
when you're at Taereung NTC.

262
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,706
It's good news, isn't it?
I hope you're not sick of me.

263
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,584
Coach Yang.

264
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,128
What is it?

265
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,716
Do you want to talk?

266
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,011
I need money.

267
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,180
And I need a lot.

268
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,727
So I won't be able to sign the contract
with the team you've introduced me to.

269
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,396
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
TAEREUNG NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

271
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,558
Aren't you getting on?

272
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,865
Hey!

273
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,659
Is this a surprise?

274
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,369
Where have you been?

275
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,748
I kept my promise.

276
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,835
What promise?

277
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,588
About diving.

278
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,468
I promised I will never go diving again.

279
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,851
Just promise me one thing.

280
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,855
Diving. Don't ever do that again.

281
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,775
It's too dangerous.

282
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,367
What's wrong, Yu-rim?

283
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,875
Hello sir, how are you?

284
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,920
Now that Ko Yu-rim will join our team,

285
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,339
reporters are
particularly interested in us.

286
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,298
Please.

287
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,549
Congratulations.

288
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,802
Are the Manager and the Coach inside?

289
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,720
Yes, they're in the office.

290
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,222
All right. Are you going out for a meal?

291
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,682
-Yes.
-I see.

292
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,059
-Please cover our story nicely.
-I will. Take care.

293
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,188
-Hello.
-Hello.

294
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,569
That's total nonsense.
Where did you hear that from?

295
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,697
I just met the head of the agency.

296
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,657
Yu-rim is looking into going to Russia.

297
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,327
Russia? That's completely ridiculous.

298
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,705
Why on earth would she do that? What for?

299
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,790
She won countless gold medals for Korea.

300
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,458
Why would she change her nationality?

301
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,503
I don't know. I'm trying to find out why--

302
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,673
She was going to finalize her contract
next week. How could she?

303
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,135
-Have you tried calling her?
-She's not answering.

304
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,348
What are you saying?

305
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:51,935
Well…

306
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,145
Is Ko Yu-rim

307
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,939
going to change her nationality?

308
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,862
The other driver got severely injured.

309
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,782
He won't be able to recover fully.

310
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,745
We need money for the settlement.

311
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,835
Once you join a professional sports team
and start earning money--

312
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,670
That salary is hardly enough.

313
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,842
It was my first time
seeing my parents fight like that.

314
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,013
It can't get any worse than this.

315
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,642
For me, seeing my parents suffer is
the worst that can happen.

316
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,271
I know, Yu-rim.

317
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,567
But can't there be another way?

318
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,944
If you change your nationality,

319
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,655
people will speak ill of you.

320
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,034
I know because I've been there.
Why would you have to go through that?

321
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,161
I don't care what the others say.

322
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,706
I've never fenced for them anyways.

323
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,541
For me,

324
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,169
fencing is just a means.

325
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,755
It's a means to protect my family.

326
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,805
Ma'am!

327
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,600
Yu-rim! Is anybody home?

328
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,813
ELEPHANT SNACKS

329
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,939
Yu-rim!

330
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,900
The person you have called…

331
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,955
How is he doing?

332
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,959
You're asking how he is?

333
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,630
How can you even ask that?

334
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,761
Why does it have to be my son
lying in bed like that?

335
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,598
You should have been the one
to get injured!

336
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,184
-I'm truly sorry.
-I'm sorry.

337
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,355
This is like a bolt from the blue.

338
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,775
Gosh. I'm in utter shock.

339
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,987
It must be a lot of work
looking after him.

340
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,573
My wife made a few dishes

341
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,701
so that you can eat during meal times.

342
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,288
And if you could please wait
for the settlement--

343
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,837
Do you think a few pennies
from the settlement will do?

344
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,132
I'm going to put you behind bars.

345
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,887
You're going to pay the price
for doing that to my son!

346
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,956
Hello?

347
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,168
Yes, how are you?

348
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,714
Excuse me?

349
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,927
What are you saying?

350
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,184
Yu-rim!

351

ELEPHANT SNACKS

352
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,436
Ko Yu-rim!

ELEPHANT SNACKS

354
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,529
Ji-woong.

355
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,366
I couldn't get in touch with you.

356
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,369
I was getting too many calls
so I had my cell turned off.

357
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,373
I heard from Hee-do.

358
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,001
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in person.

359
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,964
Things have been hectic
since my dad's accident.

360
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,007
That's okay.

361
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,552
Are you…

362
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,266
really going abroad?

363
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,352
Yes.

364
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,814
I see.

365
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,610
Then does this mean
you will go to that country…

366
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,446
and live there?

367
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,579
That must have been
a hard decision to make.

368
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,249
You're super cool, Yu-rim.

369
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,711
Thank you.

370
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,133
For saying that you're proud of me
and that I've made a great decision

371
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,760
instead of saying that I shouldn't

372
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,471
or being worried about me.

373
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,058
I really wanted to hear those words.

374
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,104
And you said them just now.

375
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,611
Throw a farewell party for me,
together with our friends.

376
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,781
Sure.

377
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,577
It's as simple as it sounds.

378
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,204
I want to change my nationality.

379
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,458
I've already done my research
through the agency.

380
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,501
Russia made the best offer.

381
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,503
They will give me a house and a car,

382
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,672
not to mention a high salary.

383
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,924
-And if I win a medal--
-Yu-rim.

384
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,010
Mom.

385
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,764
Do you have money to settle?

386
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,684
What about the victim's medical bills,
and the cost to repair the car?

387
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,979
What about the money we owe
because of the surety?

388
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,148
Has that been taken care of?

389
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,983
Yu-rim.

390
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,944
You shouldn't do this.

391
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,367
How could you break our hearts like this?

392
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,993
Don't give me that.

393
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,496
I asked if you have a way to fix this.

394
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,170
I can fix this.

395
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,299
I have a way to protect my family.

396
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,678
If I go to Russia, I can fix everything.

397
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,848
The debt, settlement,
medical bills, and repair costs.

398
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,558
I can take care of that at once.

399
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,104
There's no reason I shouldn't.

400
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,689
Still, no.

401
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,902
You've worked so hard to be where you are.

402
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,364
We don't want to send our child away
to repay our debt.

403
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,991
You both sacrificed
your entire lives for me.

404
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,788
Now it is simply my turn
to make that sacrifice.

405
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,542
I already have all that I want
by not losing you from that accident.

406
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,001
Changing my nationality?

407
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,712
I can do it a hundred times
with a grateful heart.

408
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,469
I want to put an end to this misery.

409
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,930
So please…

410
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,892
respect my decision.

411
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,650
Please, just this once.

412
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,183
I'm sorry, Yu-rim.

413
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,481
I'm sorry, my girl.

414
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,534
GUIDE TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY

415
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,079
They will provide full support
to cover your living costs, translation,

416
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,541
and any other costs on the ground,
so you don't have to worry.

417
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,336
Of course, they should.
She is one of a kind.

418
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,339
She won the world championship
at the age of seventeen.

419
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,382
Even I couldn't do that, you know.

420
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,384
As you can see from the conditions,

421
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,303
it's the best there is.

422
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,891
And this is a list of documents
you have to prepare.

423
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,602
-Take a look.
-Yes.

424
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,234
All right, then. I will get going.

425
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,777
Thank you.

426
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,242
Hey, I'm relieved that
you're getting the best offer.

427
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:33,456
I knew you would always have
the word "best" to describe you.

428
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,045
I wouldn't have known where to start
if it wasn't for you.

429
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,381
You've been a great help,
and you also came today.

430
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,509
Thank you so much.

431
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,096
Even after I go,
I'll remember everything you've taught me

432
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,390
to become a better fencer.

433
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,230
I am so sorry

434
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,400
that this is all the help
I can give you as a coach.

435
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,693
I mean it.

436
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,990
As you said,
I'm getting the best deal there is.

437
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,033
Please be happy for me.

438
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,245
Right.

439
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,498
That's what I had expected,
so I'll take it for granted.

440
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,667
You'll forever be my mentee.

441
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,212
Wherever you are, let me know the instant
you come across any difficulties.

442
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,424
You know, I used to be world-famous.

443
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,177
I have connections in every country
if it's related to fencing.

444
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,721
Do you understand?

445
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,015
Yes, Coach.

446
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,603
Excuse me, sir. Are you Kim Seung-ho?

447
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,521
Yes. Do I know you?

448
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,232
I'm Back Yi-jin, a reporter from UBS.

449
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,985
I wanted to ask you about Ko Yu-rim.

450
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,112
Gosh, how did you know?

451
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,116
This is strictly confidential for now.

452
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,132
Yi-jin.

453
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,344
ELEPHANT SNACKS

454
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,142
How is your dad doing? Is he all right?

455
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,605
He's fine. You don't need to worry.

456
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,901
-What about you?
-Sorry?

457
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,154
Are you all right?

458
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,744
I'm feeling rather more at ease.

459
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,373
The only thing left now is
to fix everything.

460
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,214
I can't do this.

461
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,219
I shouldn't have come. I should go.

462
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,432
Reporter Back Yi-jin.

463
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,192
Tell me what you have prepared.

464
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,903
Yi-jin, you have to.

465
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,627
Please come in.

466
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,054
Jung-hyuk.

467
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,807
It's a reporter's job to be thick-skinned,

468
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,768
but drinking two bottles alone
at a place like this isn't right.

469
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,812
You look like a man with a story to tell.

470
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,524
A story?

471
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,902
I guess I do have one.

472
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,743
I didn't know that
this job would involve so much drama.

473
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,415
I've become a reporter,

474
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,170
not knowing what I'm getting myself into.

475
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,338
Did something happen?

476
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,550
I can do this

477
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,094
because I'm a reporter.

478
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,098
I can do it.

479
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,311
What do you have to do?

480
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,858
I will have to…

481
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,321
stab a dagger in the hearts
of people I love…

482
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,077
and hurt them.

483
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,248
I will have to…

484
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,128
disappoint them…

485
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,926
and make them uncomfortable.

486
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,896
But…

487
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,486
I can do it.

488
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,246
I mean it.

489
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,091
We were just going to
order in some chicken.

490
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,177
Why would you order in
when she's going abroad?

491
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,428
She should have a home-cooked meal.

492
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,681
Is that so?

493
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,558
I feel sorry for her.

494
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,644
I can't imagine
what her parents must be going through.

495
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,481
Seung-wan!

496
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,485
Later, when Yu-rim's here,

497
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,196
I want us to laugh
and chat like how we always do.

498
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,368
This will be our last memory
before her departure.

499
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,620
Let's not make it a sad one.

500
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,331
I get what you're saying.

501
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,461
When you met Yu-rim the other day,
what did you talk about?

502
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,798
I couldn't tell her anything

503
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,384
I wanted to tell her.

504
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,053
You have to.

505
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,847
Or you're going to regret it.

506
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,807
I feel they're all selfish things to say.

507
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,394
Sometimes being selfish can be
the most considerate thing to do.

508
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,771
It was for me.

509
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,526
I think Yu-rim's here.

510
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,949
Rice brings out your inner-most power.

511
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,410
You have to eat rice to have strength.

512
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,373
Eat up and help yourself to some more.

513
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,418
Yes, I will. I feel stronger already.

514
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,836
Thank you for the meal.

515
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,214
I haven't prepared much.

516
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,632
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

517
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,467
-Thank you for the meal!
-Enjoy!

518
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,681
This reminds me
of the first time we ate here.

519
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,850
When we caught the loaches?

520
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,311
Yes. We didn't get along at all back then.

521
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,439
Right, but we refused to go home
because we were fighting.

522
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,941
That's right.

523
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,359
That was really awkward.

524
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,362
Putting what you two had aside,
all of us weren't close at all.

525
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,489
But I liked Yu-rim even back then.

526
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,159
-Did anyone ask?
-This wasn't for you to hear.

527
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,953
Then don't make me hear it.

528
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,913
Seriously? While we're eating?

529
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,334
Bring it on.

530
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,797
Promise you'll stay close like now
even when I'm gone.

531
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,677
I was very happy thanks to all of you.

532
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,805
I thought that
the only way to be happy was

533
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,182
to win a medal or earn money.

534
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,020
But neither money nor a medal
could give me this kind of happiness.

535
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,149
Thank you for that.

536
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,737
We've also prepared something.

537
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,449
KOREAN-RUSSIAN DICTIONARY
FOR BEGINNERS

538
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,743
What is this?

539
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,328
Nothing much.

540
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,415
This is a Russian dictionary
and a few simple phrases in Russian,

541
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,625
so that you can at least
introduce yourself.

542
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,085
This is my self-introduction?

543
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,964
SIMPLE RUSSIAN PHRASES FOR YU-RIM

544
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,466
Then is this how you guys think of me?

545
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,138
Yes. You should read it out loud.
There's pronunciation written in Korean.

546
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,100
My name is Ko Yu-rim.

547
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,604
I'm the best fencer in the world.

548
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,941
I love my family.

549
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,319
I have a lot of friends.

550
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,033
I can be a lot scarier than you think,

551
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,661
so you should watch your mouth.

552
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,705
I wrote that one.

553
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,546
But I'm a loyal person.

554
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:06,469
I have a boyfriend.
His name is Moon Ji-woong.

555
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,978
I can do great

556
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,775
as I always have.

557
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,583
Go for it, Yu-rim!

558
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,668
-You'll do great!
-You can do it!

559
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,587
I can do this!

560
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,640
Aren't you on the main news today?
Shouldn't you monitor?

561
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,643
I have a story to cover.
I'll head out now.

562
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,326
But come on!

563
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,578
-No way!
-Seriously.

564
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,331
-What?
-I mean it.

565
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,500
But it was so hilarious!

566
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,044
-What are you talking about?
-You said you knew how to drive!

567
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,174
Do you remember how scared Ji-woong was

568
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,343
behind the wheel so he kept on sweating?

569
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,387
He was sweating like a pig.

570
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,513
You're right!

571
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,848
I actually knew about it

572
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,766
-but I pretended that I didn't.
-What?

573
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,352
-You saw that?
-Yes.

574
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,021
I'm never driving again.

575
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,191
Gosh, driving is so scary.

576
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,945
It was really hilarious that day.

577
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,614
Actually, I had never thought

578
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,200
that we would actually
be able to lift that car.

579
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,326
I know.

580
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,954
It was a good thing that
Yi-jin wasn't around.

581
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,124
He would have parked the car
and that would have been the end.

582
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,502
By the way, isn't he joining us?

583
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,337
It would be good if he could come.

584
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,007
Right. I asked him to call me
even if he was running late.

585
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,134
But he didn't.

586
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,178
Wouldn't he be on TV though?

587
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,846
Let's have him join us like that.

588
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,514
Good idea.

589
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,267
But he won't be on
since there aren't any games.

590
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,561
And now isn't even the time
for sports news.

591
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,645
Let's see.

592
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,357
-Does anybody want more drinks?
-Me!

593
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,650
Me, too!

594
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,944
This is quite shocking news.

595
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,031
We have found out that
fencing gold medalist Ko Yu-rim

596
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,784
has decided to change her nationality
to become a Russian citizen.

597
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,121
In that case,
she will be representing Russia

598
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,708
instead of Korea
in international competitions.

599
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,170
To find out more, here's reporter
Back Yi-jin with an exclusive.

600
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,297
After her meteoric rise three years ago,

601
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,426
Ko Yu-rim has won a gold medal
for Korea and won our hearts.

602
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,428
But she will now become a Russian citizen.

603
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,807
Since two weeks ago,
Ko has been looking into several countries

604
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,935
with the help of a sports agency

605
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,481
and decided on Russia,
which made the best offer.

606
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:09,360
-Russia is known…
-We can't confirm anything yet.

607
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,111
-I'll hang up now.
-…for providing their athletes…

608
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,905
-We can't reach her at the moment.
-…with a handsome salary.

609
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,949
Ko was supported and beloved by the public

610
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,410
as the rising star of Korea's fencing,

611
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:23,165
but financial reasons seemed to have been
the key to why she had made the decision.

612
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,293
Ko Yu-rim, who once represented
the future of Korea's fencing,

613
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,256
will now be wearing a Russian flag
in her competitions.

614
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,677
It'll be a huge disappointment
for the public that has rooted for her.

615
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,720
With UBS news, this is Back Yi-Jin.

616
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,898
He's lost his mind.

617
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,322
Yi-jin!

618
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,834
The person you have called
cannot be reached right now.

619
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,920
Please leave a message after the beep.

620
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,493
Did you have to do that?

621
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,287
It's Yu-rim of all people.

622
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,332
I know you have to exploit
people's misfortunes,

623
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,042
but did it have to be her?

624
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,963
So I guess that's what I do.

625
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,885
To exploit people's misfortunes.

626
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,679
When I won the gold medal
at the Asian Games,

627
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,351
I clearly remember how everyone
loved to exploit my misfortune.

628
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,229
You saw what I had to go through
because of that.

629
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,899
You witnessed everything.

630
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,153
Then…

631
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,574
couldn't you have not done this to Yu-rim?

632
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,412
What should I have done?

633
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,960
I would have reported it right away
if it was someone else, but it was Yu-rim.

634
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,464
Should I have turned a blind eye to it
since we are close?

635
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,133
The least you could have done is
not to be the first to report it.

636
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,054
Then I should have gone second.

637
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,225
-Would that have been better?
-Hey.

638
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,477
Do you think you can keep seeing me?

639
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,900
Who knows?

640
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,196
I might even exploit your misfortune.

641
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,170
I'm afraid that might really happen.

642
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,841
Hee-do.

643
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,681
Are you all right?

644
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,812
I don't think so.

645
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,319
This could be the last time walking home…

646
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,324
holding hands with you.

647
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,494
What are you talking about?

648
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,797
Ji-woong.

649
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,469
I think I can be totally honest with you.

650
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,472
When someone asks how I am,

651
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:11,101
you are the only one
to whom I can say that I'm not fine.

652
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,523
So can I open up to you about how I feel?

653
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,362
Let's not make any promises.

654
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,239
What are you saying?

655
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,074
That we will still like each other,

656
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,535
that we will not break up,

657
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,705
and that nothing will change
although we are apart.

658
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,373
I don't want us…

659
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,667
making such promises.

660
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,004
Why not?

661
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:44,468
I don't know when or if I would
ever be able to come back to Korea.

662
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,222
I don't know
if I could ever see you again.

663
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,143
I can't promise you anything.

664
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:58,857
So if you fall for someone,
you should go out with that person.

665
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,693
It would be selfish of me
to hold on to you

666
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,655
when I can't promise you anything.

667
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,949
I don't want to do that.

668
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,702
That's not being selfish.

669
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,790
What you're doing right now is selfish.

670
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,918
Would the distance between us
drift us apart?

671
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,462
Yes, that could happen.

672
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,757
But you're already preparing
to go separate ways.

673
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,637
I've been preparing
so that we don't drift apart.

674
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,474
I got a part-time job
the moment I learned about your news.

675
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,727
"I could visit her three times a year
if I save up."

676
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,980
"Maybe four times if I get another job."

677
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,982
That's what I've been thinking.

678
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,403
But what now?
You don't want to make promises?

679
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,247
I don't want you to live for me.

680
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,166
I want you to live for yourself.

681
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,252
I already have a lot on my plate

682
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,547
dealing with my family who lives for me.

683
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,229
I got it, so let's go.

684
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,856
You're upset. You should go first.

685
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,149
Don't be ridiculous.

686
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,319
I won't leave you alone
under any circumstances.

687
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,210
I don't want you to be in my misery…

688
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,297
Ji-woong.

689
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,275
Back Yi-jin! You have an exclusive!

690
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,696
The other reporters must be in a rush
to make up for what you had covered.

691
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,947
Great work.

692
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:11,990
Thank you.

693
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,493
We should go out and celebrate.

694
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,495
An exclusive doesn't come that often.

695
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,080
-How about tonight?
-Tonight?

696
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,581
-Pork belly?
-Sounds good.

697
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,007
Speculations that Ko Yu-rim is changing
her nationality

698
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,220
for the unprecedented pay package
from Russia have proven to be true.

699
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,973
Controversy grows as she refuses to state
the reason for her decision.

700
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,102
Feeling betrayed, the public
that once supported her

701
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,980
is now denouncing her for her decision.

702
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,274
KO YU-RIM

703
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,707
I'M ON THE KOREAN NATIONAL TEAM!

704
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,445
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS

705
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,410
Attaque. Touche.

706
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,455
Please join us.

707
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,748
Please train with us!

708
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,249
What's with you?

709
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,792
The fencing team is united!

710
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,592
That was great!

711
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,968
See, you can do it if you try!

712
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,015
Good luck!

713
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,019
I like it. Let's try that again.
One, two, three.

714
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,395
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

715
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,710
She's here!

716
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,129
There she is!

717
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,589
Can you come out for a minute?

718
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,091
-Ms. Ko!
-Give us a comment.

719
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,594
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim, can we have a word?

720
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,429
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!
-Over here!

721
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,389
-Ms. Ko!
-Ko Yu-rim!

722
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,850
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

723
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,477
-Tell us!
-Ko Yu-rim!

724
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,064
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!
-Can you please come outside?

725
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,566
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!
-Yu-rim, please!

726
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,401
-Please!
-Can you please say a word?

727
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,737
-Ms. Ko!
-Ko Yu-rim!

728
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,074
-Please!
-Tell us why you made that decision!

729
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,206
-Tell us!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

730
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,708
-We will wait here!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

731
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:13,547
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL

732
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,651
-Who is that?
-Wait, isn't she…

733
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,111
Isn't that Na Hee-do?

734
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,988
-Ms. Na.
-Are you here to see Ms. Ko?

735
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,115
-Na Hee-do!
-Are you here to see Ko Yu-rim?

736
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,742
-Are you here for Ms. Ko?
-Ms. Na Hee-do!

737
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,911
-Please tell us!
-Take a picture!

738
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,290
Yu-rim. It's me, Hee-do.

739
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,751
-Why are you here?
-Are you here to talk to her?

740
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,129
-Ms. Na!
-Can we have an interview?

741
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,339
-Just a minute!
-Ms. Na Hee-do!

742
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,841
-Ms. Na Hee-do!
-Can I go first?

743
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,891
Everything will be fine.

744
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,978
You're going to be fine, Yu-rim.

745
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,486
All the reporters came out of nowhere
and started tapping on the windows.

746
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,779
It scared me.

747
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,366
I think they swarmed in here
because the snack shop was closed.

748
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,662
It's not like you've won a medal,
for god's sake.

749
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,582
They are much more enthusiastic
when it comes to bad news.

750
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,084
When do you think they'll leave?

751
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,088
They'll probably wait until you come out.

752
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,258
So do I have to just stay here then?

753
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,761
No, we can't do that.

754
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,055
We'll get out of here no matter what.

755
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,974
-But how?
-We'll have to find a way.

756
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:58,318
If we could only distract them
to look somewhere else for a second…

757
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,587
What are you going to do with that?

758
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,131
Fencing is a game of wits, right?

759
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,468
We've been playing that game
all our lives.

760
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,888
We're going to win.

761
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,733
Hold these.

762
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,610
Hey!

763
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,960
Maybe we've read too many comic books.

764
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,801
Is there anything like a wig?

765
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,471
Wait, the theater club performs here.
There should be wigs here.

766
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,973
Bring it here!

767
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,901
There we go.

768
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,780
We should tie the hair.

769
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,990
Yes, let's do that.

770
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,533
It's done!

771
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,951
-Let's put this on.
-Yes.

772
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,123
All done! It looks real.

773
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,167
This is perfect.

774
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,463
-We need a barricade.
-Three!

775
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,339
Let's place the balance beams here
and chairs there.

776
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,890
The reporters are wandering around the gym
looking for you.

777
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,476
I'll go out that entrance
to draw attention.

778
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,644
In the meantime,
you should escape through that door.

779
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,190
-What about you?
-I'll be right behind you.

780
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,368
Ms. Na what did you talk about?

781
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,620
Is Ms. Ko coming out?

782
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,539
She can't stay locked up in here forever,

783
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,417
and it's rude to keep you all waiting.

784
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,837
So I've persuaded Ms. Ko Yu-rim.

785
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:23,922
Really?

786
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,716
She will have a press conference.

787
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,261
Hey, come over here!
There will be a press conference!

788
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,304
Get the microphone!

789
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,017
Are you all here?

790
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,938
I'll open the door, so enter slowly.

791
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,106
Yes.

792
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,109
Hurry up!

793
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,985
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

794
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,197
Can you look here?

795
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,699
-Are we starting now?
-Can we ask her questions?

796
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,165
Ms. Ko, are you ready
for the press conference?

797
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,500
Ms. Ko Yu-rim?

798
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,254
Is that Ko Yu-rim?
Isn't that someone else?

799
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,672
Is that even a person?

800
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,300
-Ms. Ko!
-Can you please look this way?

801
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,678
-Here!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

802
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,555
-Ms. Ko?
-Can you please turn around?

803
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,767
Darn it! It's just a mannequin!

804
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,106
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL

805
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,666
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

806
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,002
-Wait!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

807
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,462
-Please wait!
-Ms. Ko!

808
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,590
-Please stop!
-Please, Ms. Ko!

809
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,341
-Ms. Ko!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

810
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,843
-Ms. Ko!
-Can you please stop?

811
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,596
Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

812
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,682
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!
-Where are you going?

813
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,268
-Please stop running away!
-Ms. Na Hee-do!

814
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,187
-Go after them!
-Ms. Ko Yu-rim!

815
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,980
-Ms. Ko!
-Run!

816
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,315
This way!

817
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,993
MIMI SUPERMARKET

818
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,747
They're gone.

819
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,626
Gosh, I was so nervous!

820
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,920
I told you we would beat them.

821
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,052
I didn't think that this would work.

822
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,263
If you always have to give it a go.

823
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,766
You can find the answer once you do.

824
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,268
Goodness. You saved me.

825
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,233
Hey.

826
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,528
-Do you want to take a picture?
-Yes!

827
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,617
Let's take a picture.

828
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,369
One, two, three!

829
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,456
Are we done? What's next?

830
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,666
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

831
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,381
But then my face won't show!

832
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,133
-This one looks nice.
-This looks funny.

833
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,843
-What?
-I want this one.

834
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,845
-This one!
-Wait.

835
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,389
-And this one.
-Jeez.

836
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,266
-This one too.
-Look at you.

837
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,768
Only you look pretty in those pictures!

838
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,520
You look pretty whatever you do.

839
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,441
Why is hearing this annoying me?

840
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,986
-Done!
-Yu-rim.

841
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,405
I'm starving.

842
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,615
How about jjajangmyeon?

843
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,499
Look, there's your signature!

844
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,960
Have you been here before?

845
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,588
Yes, once. They have good jjajangmyeon.

846
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,299
Here you go. What would you like to have?

847
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,467
Can we get two jjajangmyeon, please?

848
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,678
That will be 6,000 won to pay in advance.

849
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,930
I'm buying.
You've done so much for me today.

850
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,141
Yes, you should.

851
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,311
Here.

852
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,985
Isn't that Ko Yu-rim?

853
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,612
You're right.

854
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,822
Gosh, why is she here?

855
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,491
-What is that traitor doing here?
-I know, right?

856
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,578
-Should we go somewhere else?
-No, let's just stay and eat.

857
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,998
I'm glad we took the picture.

858
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,459
I know. We should have done it sooner.

859
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,256
-Give me your cell phone.
-What?

860
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,013
I'll do the same.

861
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,312
It's a good thing we got to do this
before I fly out.

862
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,026
When are you flying out?

863
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,863
I'm leaving tomorrow.

864
01:00:58,946 --> 01:00:59,947
Tomorrow?

865
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:05,161
Mom rescheduled the flight
after seeing me on the news.

866
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,956
I guess she knew this would happen.

867
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,421
This is so sudden.

868
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,095
It was hard for me
since I felt like I was in a long goodbye

869
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,389
so I think it's for the best.

870
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,481
Can I come to the airport?

871
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,483
Weren't you going to come?

872
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,404
Here is your order.

873
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,247
Excuse me, sir.

874
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,417
What is this? We've ordered two.

875
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,795
I serve food only for Korean customers.

876
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,089
I don't serve foreigners.

877
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,341
-What are you--
-I want jjajangmyeon.

878
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,676
Can't you hear me?

879
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,721
I'm not selling food to a traitor
who betrayed her country for money.

880
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,099
Did I sell our country?

881
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,060
So has our country been sold?

882
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,564
You've changed your nationality for money.
That's the same as selling the country.

883
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,815
It's not the same.

884
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,401
If there's anything I did sell,

885
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,903
I sold myself for money.

886
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,739
Money is important to me.

887
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,743
Just like how you earn money
selling jjajangmyeon,

888
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,203
I'm earning money by selling my abilities.

889
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,539
I have to earn money to make a living.

890
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,915
Having money…

891
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,586
will put our family out of misery.

892
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,299
Just because I changed my nationality,
our country didn't get sold.

893
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,051
And it did not cause your business
any trouble.

894
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,928
Give me my jjajangmyeon.

895
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,515
I'm not a traitor, but a customer.

896
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,265
Here, have some hot chocolate.

897
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,019
Stay here and go when it's late.

898
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,231
Reporters might still be
in front of your house.

899
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,607
Thank you.

900
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,573
What happened earlier
must have startled you.

901
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,367
That's just ridiculous.

902
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,744
How could he do that to your face?

903
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,121
I think the old me

904
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,457
would have walked out without eating.

905
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,585
Yes, I also thought you would do that.

906
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,214
This is all you. You've taught me
not to hold back and fight.

907
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,633
Not to just take it
when I've been wronged.

908
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,761
And also that you could gain things
by fighting and protesting.

909
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:15,893
I'll be okay on my own now, right?

910
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,905
Who am I going to talk to
about fencing now?

911
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,117
Who would I talk to
when I have a lot on my mind?

912
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,536
How will I stand being at the NTC…

913
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,414
without you?

914
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,637
To be honest, I don't want to go, Hee-do.

915
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,182
I want to stay in Korea

916
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,810
and be a Korean athlete.

917
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:02,815
I want to continue
to be on the national team with you.

918
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,056
Don't worry about me, Mom.

919
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,682
You know that I can take care of myself.

920
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,310
I know, Yu-rim.

921
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,104
I'm not worried.

922
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,319
Dad.

923
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,404
I hope your arm heals soon.

924
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,573
I'm going to call
and check on you every day.

925
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:55,743
I'm sorry, Yu-rim.

926
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,663
I told you not to apologize.

927
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,166
If you say that one more time,
I won't ever visit.

928
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,463
You also take care of yourself.

929
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,260
You're up next.

930
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,516
Don't come back too late.

931
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,476
We'll miss you.

932
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,980
I'll be back to see
if you have an SNU student ID.

933
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,982
Sure, that's not hard at all.

934
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,234
Just as I expected.

935
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,986
And stop crying after drinking.

936
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,237
All right.

937
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,116
I'll try to change that too.
So come back to check on that as well.

938
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,832
Now it's your turn.

939
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,210
No crying today.

940
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,753
Same here.

941
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,005
Gosh!

942
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,216
You…

943
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:56,262
You better get ready for Madrid next year.

944
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,889
See you at the finals.

945
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,308
Yes, it has to be at the finals.

946
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,893
I'm going to win the gold medal.

947
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,604
What? You can't hold a candle to me.

948
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:11,402
I'm going to work really hard,
so you better watch out. Got it?

949
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,029
What do you think I'll be doing?

950
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,932
Every moment that we spent together…

951
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,395
made me happy.

952
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,026
Let's continue to be happy.

953
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,283
Goodness.

954
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,035
Seriously.

955
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,038
All right. I should go now.

956
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,291
Take care.

957
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:10,878
I'm going.

958
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,172
-Take care.
-Call us when you land.

959
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:15,883
Yu-rim!

960
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,636
The gold medal is mine!

961
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,305
Don't cry because I'm not around.

962
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,475
-I won't.
-Can you wipe the tear off your face then?

963
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,853
Bye!

964
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,439
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

965
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,108
We would like two hot coffees…

966
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,735
-And a piece of strawberry cake.
-Sure.

967
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,946
Thank you. Please come again.

968
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,171
I don't want you to be in my misery…

969
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,841
Ji-woong.

970
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:11,564
Why aren't you coming?
Don't you know Yu-rim's leaving today?

971
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,857
Today?

972
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,067
Why?

973
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,267
GIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

974
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,273
Where do you go for departures?

975
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,441
Please go up one floor.

976
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:23,469
Ko Yu-rim!

977
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,607
You're so mean.

978
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,818
How could you think of leaving
without a word?

979
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,907
I'm going to be selfish too, so listen up.

980
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:49,453
I will wait for you, come to visit you,

981
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,996
and I'll endure no matter what.

982
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,625
I won't go out with anyone else.
I'm not even going to look at anyone.

983
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,794
So you shouldn't see anyone else either.

984
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,213
Don't even make eye contact.

985
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,885
-Ji-woong, I--
-Even if

986
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,222
all you can give me is misery,

987
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,349
I'm up for it.

988
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,727
I'm fine as long as we're in it together.

989
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,316
The Russian phrases we gave you.

990
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,737
Have you memorized them?

991
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,577
I have a boyfriend.

992
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,873
His name is Moon Ji-woong.

993
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,482
"Ko Yu-rim to become a Russian citizen."

994
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,193
"Yesterday's hero is now our enemy."

995
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,279
I wonder how much money she received.

996
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,489
For how much
would you change your nationality?

997
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,951
At this point, I think I can
if someone offers just 100,000 won.

998
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,872
We have with us here another traitor.

999
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,081
Thank you.

1000
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:29,047
KO YU-RIM IS A TRAITOR

1001
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,899
A lot of things have happened.

1002
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,527
You have overcome all the obstacles

1003
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,322
and won another gold medal
in San Francisco

1004
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:38,242
to give hope to many people.

1005
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,412
We are very grateful for your achievement.

1006
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,706
Ever since the beginning,

1007
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,794
I give you my unwavering support
to root for you, Ms. Na Hee-do.

1008
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:53,924
Same here.

1009
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,469
Wherever I am,

1010
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,474
I will give you
my unwavering support, Mr. Back.

1011
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,356
Wherever you are,

1012
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,401
I'll make sure my support reaches you.

1013
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,320
I'll take care of everything.

1014
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,491
See you then.

1015
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,000
Thank you.

1016
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:32,879
And I know it's a little late,
but congratulations on your wedding.

1017
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,007
Thank you.

1018
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,427
Next on the news.

1019
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:09,833
I don't want to be
an embarrassment to Hee-do.

1020
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,835
I'm going to share
everything that's yours.

1021
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,881
Everything, including your
sadness and happiness.

1022
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,760
I wanted to call you, but I couldn't.

1023
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,013
Why are you all here again?

1024
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,808
No other fencer…

1025
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,520
knows Yu-rim better than you do.

1026
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:33,023
Don't go hiding
because you're having a hard time.

1027
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,108
Make sure to save some for me.

1028
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,568
So we should

1029
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,029
love each other with no regrets.

1030
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:50,791
