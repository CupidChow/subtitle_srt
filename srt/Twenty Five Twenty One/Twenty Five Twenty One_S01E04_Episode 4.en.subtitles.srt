1
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,402
She was in the wrong.

2
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,698
Don't forget. I'm always on your side.

3
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,876
We should definitely meet someday.

4
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,756
I'm sure I'll recognize you at once.

5
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,802
INJEOLMI: I'M SURE
I'LL RECOGNIZE YOU AT ONCE

6
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,897
EPISODE 4

7
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,953
What is it? What's wrong?

8
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,330
Then…

9
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,417
can you say something, no questions asked?

10
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,420
What is it?

11
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,881
"Yu-rim was in the wrong."

12
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,179
You can't, can you?

13
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,973
I don't know what--

14
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,806
Ji-woong!

15
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,642
Are you a good dancer?

16
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,272
No, I quit dancing.
Forget what you just saw.

17
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,649
-Why?
-Because I'm in a band.

18
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,235
Come on. Can you teach me how to dance?

19
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,403
It's very urgent.

20
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,864
Sorry. There's no dancing
in rock and roll.

21
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,865
But it's music, too.

22
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,451
This dance isn't even that hard.
It's kind of hip-hop…

23
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,329
Sorry. Rock and roll doesn't think of
hip-hop as real music.

24
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,001
I'll do anything.

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,130
So please,

26
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,382
help me.

27
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,929
-Come on.
-Geez.

28
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,389
Where exactly are we going to practice?

29
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,937
You've been invited to a special place.

30
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,606
It's for members only.

31
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,819
Should I stand here?

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,294
Come in.

33
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,673
This is where we'll practice from now on.

34
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,049
Seung-wan?

35
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,217
We have a guest.

36
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,345
Guys, tell me. What is this place?

37
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,597
Our hangout.

38
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,267
My hangout, to be exact.
I decorated the place.

39
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,687
Is this like a top-student privilege?

40
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,146
Do the teachers know too?

41
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,648
No, and they shouldn't.

42
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,442
Who would turn a rooftop shed
into something this crazy?

43
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,821
She's been in charge of
cleaning this shed since last year.

44
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,448
Teachers assume that
the place is in good hands.

45
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,033
That's why reputation matters.

46
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,326
It's absurd, right?

47
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,411
I agree.

48
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,162
By the way,

49
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,206
aren't you a fencer?
Why the dance practice?

50
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,042
Well, beats me.

51
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,044
My coach said I should.

52
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,547
Okay.

53
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,632
Let's get down to business.

54
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,304
I'll teach you how to dance.

55
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,889
In return, you'll put
Yu-rim's favorite drink in her locker.

56
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,684
The pine-flavored one she likes.

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,145
Put a drink in that girl's locker
every morning?

58
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,187
"That girl?"

59
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,815
Do you have something against Yu-rim?

60
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,359
Then I can't teach you.

61
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,156
No way!

62
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,993
God knows how long
I've been obsessed with Yu-rim.

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,498
By the way, how did you know
she likes that drink?

64
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,500
How can you not?

65
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,711
No other 18-year-old would drink that.

66
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,715
Maybe she's a forest fairy.

67
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,896
Why don't you stay for a meal?

68
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
I have to get to a job interview.

69
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,445
I guess some places are still recruiting
despite the current situation.

70
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,239
I forgot to ask.
Can you come tomorrow and take your car?

71
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,159
We're repainting the garage,
so it can't be here.

72
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,579
My car? I thought it was seized?

73
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:16,167
Your dad put it under my name
before going bankrupt.

74
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,295
Maybe he sensed what was coming.

75
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,674
All right. I'll be here tomorrow.

76
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,261
-And this isn't a lot, but please take it.
-What? No, I can't accept this.

77
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,471
-For my sake?
-It's okay.

78
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,223
Please. This will put me at ease.

79
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,391
-You're listening to aunt, right?
-Yes.

80
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,978
Gosh, but I know you're just working
part-time jobs. You shouldn't have.

81
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,233
Well, I hope all goes well
with your interview. Good luck!

82
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,734
All right. Bye now.

83
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
-Goodbye.
-Thanks for this.

84
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,320
-Not at all.
-Goodbye.

85
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,076
You're really good at playing politics.

86
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,287
You gave money to her
in front of me on purpose.

87
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,747
You totally rock.

88
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,792
A 15-year-old shouldn't pick up on that.
Now I'm sad.

89
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,045
Don't be.
I'm just too smart for my own good.

90
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,839
So don't feel bad.

91
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,466
-I'll come by tomorrow.
-Hey!

92
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,301
-Yi-jin.
-Yes?

93
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,011
So…

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,597
when you take the car,

95
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,683
does that mean you're going to keep it?

96
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,768
Let go.

97
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,061
No?

98
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,855
No. It's not mine anymore. It's hers.

99
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,190
My guess is, Dad gave it to aunt

100
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,860
to thank her for doing him a favor
by taking you in.

101
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,695
Then I can look after your kid later.

102
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,781
-Then you can buy me--
-Stop babbling. Now get back inside.

103
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,325
-Bye.
-All right. Bye.

104
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,286
Good luck on the interview!

105
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,788
And I'm doing great,
so stop worrying about me.

106
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,290
I can take care of myself.

107
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,626
APPLICATION ID
BACK YI-JIN

108
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,421
Now, our last question is for all of you.

109
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,800
The world has changed dramatically
in the '90s.

110
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,720
When everything is subject to change,

111
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,265
what is the one thing
you believe will stay the same forever?

112
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,021
I believe that the love we have
for our family members is unfaltering.

113
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,190
For me, it's the way I dream.

114
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,027
I'll continue to dream on and live
as I do now, even when I grow old.

115
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,158
I believe in gravity.

116
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,494
Excuse me?

117
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,954
The only thing I believe
that will be constant

118
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,207
in this world is gravity.

119
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,127
I don't believe that anything
stays the same forever.

120
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,838
Because believing in something like that

121
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,217
sets expectations
for how things should turn out.

122
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,386
However, gravity…

123
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,058
is constant
regardless of any expectations.

124
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,770
That's why I can believe only in gravity.

125
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,237
Did you ask for me?

126
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,781
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL FENCING TEAM

127
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,662
Did you go against Da-seul?

128
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,413
Yu-rim told me.

129
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,175
Yu-rim, what happened?

130
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,972
Tell me what happened.

131
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,893
As I see it,

132
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,855
the seniors shouldn't stop us
from training at night.

133
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,984
I think it's unfair.

134
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
So?

135
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,778
What's your plan?

136
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,656
I'll continue to train at night.

137
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,491
And if they keep stopping you?

138
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,951
Do you have a plan B?

139
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,914
You've lost your game already.

140
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,834
You're already behind in your thinking.

141
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:50,423
I bet Da-seul already has planned out
what to do with you the next time you try.

142
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,342
But you've got nothing.

143
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,760
Do you also think

144
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,639
it's wrong for me to train at night?

145
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,103
That's not the point. Do you think
I'm doing this to set discipline?

146
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,023
I'm talking about fencing.

147
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,483
Remember when you first came to see me?

148
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,112
Even back then,
you forced your way in without thinking.

149
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,199
Look at what you're doing now.
You haven't changed at all.

150
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,952
You jump into things without a plan.

151
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,413
That kind of attitude…

152
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,958
shows in your fencing.

153
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,964
Hee-do, you think of fencing
as a sword fight.

154
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,759
You're wrong. Fencing is a game of wits.

155
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,054
You have to be able to read the game.

156
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,722
That is strategic thinking.

157
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,851
And I don't see this in your fencing.
Just like now.

158
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,227
Then what should I do?

159
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,688
Teach me. I'll do anything.

160
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,440
That kind of training is over.

161
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,026
It's now up to you

162
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,363
to figure out what you need to do.

163
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,497
Strategy?

164
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,500
Think strategically?

165
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:14,173
INTERVIEW ROOM

166
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,549
EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

167
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
Everyone.

168
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,555
The final result will be out
right after the interviews are done.

169
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,890
Please wait here.

170
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,058
-Yes.
-Yes.

171
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,519
Ms. Son?

172
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,397
Sir, can I help you with anything?

173
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,274
Is Mr. Kim still doing the interviews?

174
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,442
Yes.

175
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,825
Back Yi-jin?

176
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,746
Hey.

177
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,958
Wait.

178
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,210
Are you here for the interview?

179
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,170
Gosh.

180
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,923
You should have told me
about your situation.

181
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,634
My father was really worried
about your father.

182
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,885
Where is he now?

183
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,096
I don't know for sure.

184
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,683
Please thank your father
for thinking of us.

185
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,769
Gosh. You always wanted to work at NASA.

186
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,105
Here you are,
applying to a trading company.

187
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,930
CHECK
100,000 WON

188
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,023
-Candidates number three.
-Yes.

189
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,733
-Seventeen.
-Yes.

190
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,485
-Twenty-four.
-Yes.

191
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,569
Twenty-nine.

192
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,154
Yes.

193
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,447
You've passed.

194
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,916
This is why you should've called me.

195
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,668
Other opportunities will come up.

196
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,253
Thanks for being so considerate.

197
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,172
Hold on a second.

198
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,760
Take a taxi back home, okay?

199
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,261
No, that's fine.

200
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,763
-Here.
-No, I'm fine.

201
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,723
-Take it.
-That's okay.

202
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,601
Sir, were you looking for me?

203
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,602
Yes.

204
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,772
-Thanks for running the interviews.
-Wait…

205
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
Not at all.

206
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,026
-Have you eaten anything?
-Yes, I have.

207
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,738
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WON

208
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,920
Can I get another bottle of soju, please?

209
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,841
I can't give up on you until the end

210
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,260
"Until the end."

211
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,344
Until the end

212
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,057
Until…

213
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,311
Darn it.

214
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,855
Until the end

215
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,449
You're ignoring me,
but I see you're wearing those slippers.

216
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,701
Thanks.

217
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,336
Why are you smiling?

218
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,880
Since I got to see you.

219
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,718
You put a smile on my face.

220
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,389
Have you been drinking?

221
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,810
Yes, you sure did.

222
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,023
Did something happen?

223
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,359
Yes.

224
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,403
I had a job interview today…

225
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,114
but I didn't make the cut.

226
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,993
That company made a wrong decision.

227
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,958
What does that make me
if you side with me so easily?

228
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,501
What do you think?

229
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,963
That makes you a petty person
who couldn't say something this simple.

230
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,510
Right.

231
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,098
That does make me a petty failure.

232
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,148
Don't feel so bad.

233
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,860
Today, I was told that
I've made no progress

234
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,155
and have no brain for strategic thinking.

235
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,326
Who told you that?

236
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,370
My coach.

237
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,207
Don't try to comfort me.
I want you to just make fun of me.

238
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,752
Make fun of you?

239
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,965
That's right. It feels better
when I turn my tragedy into a comedy.

240
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,226
Why did you transfer
if you weren't going to improve?

241
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,564
Can you call yourself a fencer
when you can't strategize?

242
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,026
Like this?

243
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,068
Hey.

244
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,904
That's too mean.

245
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,740
But you asked for it.

246
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,202
Darn it.

247
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,875
Gosh, that was so pointed.

248
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,963
That wasn't teasing.
That just broke my heart.

249
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,881
Geez.

250
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,719
You're right.

251
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,683
I heard that every tragedy in life is
a comedy if you see it from afar.

252
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,563
That means we have to live
as if we're seeing ourselves from afar.

253
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,484
Your dream was to be in space.

254
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,445
Let's live as if
we see ourselves from there.

255
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,827
I'm happy to watch from where I am.

256
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,499
You're fun to watch…

257
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,878
even when up close.

258
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,885
That's good to know.

259
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,764
It was only a month ago

260
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,434
when I was told that the times we live in
took my dream away.

261
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,855
Then recently, I heard that
the times had given me an opportunity.

262
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,237
So if you think about it,
there's no such thing

263
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,489
as a pure tragedy or comedy.

264
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,663
Still, I hope the road ahead of us

265
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,750
is filled with more comedy.

266
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,635
Wait, are you asleep?

267
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,638
I just said something really important.

268
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,142
He is so ridiculous!

269
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,356
Mister. You could freeze to death
from sleeping outside.

270
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,110
Hey.

271
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,612
Get up.

272
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,282
It gets chilly at night.

273
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,999
Fine, whatever.

274
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,253
For someone like him,
this should be a rewarding experience.

275
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,673
I'm going now. Goodnight.

276
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,604
FAILED AT AN INTERVIEW TODAY
DO NOT "DISTRUB"

277
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,322
NURTURING THE STRONGEST

278
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,301
Gosh, I can't stand doing this.

279
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,745
KO YU-RIM
LET'S GO FOR GOLD

280
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,625
-Hey.
-Yes?

281
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,876
You didn't get the job?

282
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,420
No.

283
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,005
AHYEON SUPERMARKET
RICE

284
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,882
You should have tried harder.

285
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,051
Well, I did try hard.

286
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,929
Yi-jin, I heard you failed your interview.

287
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,390
Well, yes.

288
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,940
You failed an interview,
and now the basket fell off too.

289
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,822
Cheer up, okay?

290
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,950
Poor thing.

291
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,377
Hello, sir. I hope your day is
off to a great start.

292
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,586
What is this?

293
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,380
You saw it, too?

294
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,215
No? See what?

295
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,260
Never mind, if you didn't see anything.

296
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,554
Were you here for me?

297
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,514
Yes. I wanted to see your beautiful face

298
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,474
on this great morning
to start off the day.

299
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,061
Please have this before you eat
to work up an appetite.

300
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,479
I've warmed it up for you.

301
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,776
Thanks.

302
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,862
Sir,

303
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,199
I've been getting up
15 minutes early to shower.

304
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,367
Anything else I can do?

305
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,911
I find this uncomfortable.
Why are you doing this?

306
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:15,876
I feel sorry to have caused you
so much inconvenience until now.

307
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,588
I heard that you're close to Hee-do.

308
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,592
Me too. We're friends.

309
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,510
-Is that so?
-Yes.

310
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,596
So you two are close.

311
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,514
Hey, listen.

312
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,727
Today…

313
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,355
I'm very upset because of Hee-do.

314
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,941
And here you are, bringing up her name.

315
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,694
Are you two very close?

316
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,408
Now that I think about it,

317
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,787
my definition of a friend
may have been too broad.

318
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,205
Right?

319
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,041
I've barely just met her.

320
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,210
So technically speaking,
she's not a friend.

321
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,170
I hope there's no misunderstanding.

322
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,173
All right then. Get to school safely.

323
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,132
Yes, sir.

324
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,597
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH FENCING TEAM

325
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,141
I was livid when I walked inside the gym

326
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,936
and found Yu-rim
and Hee-do training at night.

327
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,063
What? Those two are crazy.

328
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,858
But you know what?
Yu-rim at least apologized,

329
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,318
but Hee-do didn't do a thing.

330
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,531
If I catch them training again tonight,

331
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,159
I'll have the entire team punished
for her selfishness.

332
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,661
Are you going to hit me?

333
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,291
Da-seul, I want to apologize to you
for what I did.

334
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,961
It was so rude of me
to talk back to you like that.

335
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,421
I'm terribly sorry.

336
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,631
What are you doing?

337
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,383
I just started here

338
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,011
and wasn't aware of how things worked.

339
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,722
I'm so sorry for stirring up the club.
Please forgive me.

340
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,017
What the heck?

341
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,189
You asked if I wanted to do well so bad
as to throw you under the bus.

342
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,233
Not at all. Never.

343
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,320
I want all of us to do well together.

344
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,282
I assure you,
I will never train at night alone.

345
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,286
Fine, Hee-do.

346
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,496
-I got your message, so--
-Instead,

347
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,043
I would like to train
at night with everyone.

348
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,672
What did you say?

349
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,007
If we all train together,

350
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,009
it will boost our morale and efficiency.

351
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,845
It will be good for all of us!

352
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,849
Are you insane?

353
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,937
I'm begging you. Please join us!

354
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,024
My gosh. You're such a freak.

355
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,484
Join you for what?

356
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,652
Night training.

357
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,530
Hey, you can go ahead.
Just go ahead and train at night.

358
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,449
Do whatever you want, on your own.

359
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:38,620
No way. I need your guidance.
Please join us.

360
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,580
Please train with us!

361
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,082
What's with you?

362
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,625
The fencing team is united!

363
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,835
-What is this?
-Please, let's train together.

364
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,004
Let me go! I said get off me!

365
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,090
-No I won't!
-Hey, that's enough.

366
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,550
-Please!
-Stop it!

367
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,928
-I'm begging you.
-Go away!

368
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,554
-Please?
-I said, let me go!

369
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,682
Are you out of your mind?

370
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,309
-You have to!
-Let go of me!

371
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,769
Leave me alone!

372
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,479
Have you all warmed up?

373
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,819
We have a series of competitions coming up
after the tryouts.

374
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,362
Stay on your toes. Got it?

375
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,822
-Yes!
-Yes!

376
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,200
Coach, it's been confirmed.
I'll be at the NTC starting next week.

377
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,244
You're finally going back.

378
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,288
What about your ankle? Is it better now?

379
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,165
Much better. It will be fine
as long as I'm careful.

380
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,794
All right. I guess
I won't get to see you for a while.

381
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,255
No, wait. I will see you.

382
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,841
Is the national team coming
to watch the tryouts?

383
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,135
I will be going to Hwaseong with Hee-do.

384
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,848
Yes, I think we will be there.

385
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,905
Let him know the garlic scapes are salty,

386
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,365
so he doesn't have to eat it
if he doesn't like it.

387
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,493
I will. So is Dad coming this Sunday?

388
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,705
I don't think so. It's cargo all the way
from Geoje to Incheon,

389
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,540
so I told him to take it easy.

390
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,544
Of course.
He shouldn't push himself too much.

391
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,922
Are you sure you can carry this?
Yi-jin could come by.

392
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,799
No worries. I want to go myself.

393
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,635
-See you.
-Be careful, okay?

394
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,803
-I will.
-All right.

395
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,866
No, I'm fine. You can keep your seat.

396
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,784
Please sit here.

397
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,328
Thank you.

398
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,246
Oh, it wasn't for me.

399
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,129
You have a pretty face and a pretty heart.

400
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,383
How did you know? I go by
the nickname, class seven's pretty boy.

401
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,011
That being said,

402
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,555
could you hold onto this pretty package?

403
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,723
Sure.

404
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,100
Thank you.

405
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,768
Thank you.

406
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,492
Hello, Yu-rim.

407
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,578
Hello, Ji-woong.

408
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,248
Where are you going?

409
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,835
I'm going to Ahyeon-dong
to deliver some food.

410
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,877
Really?

411
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,630
I'm also going there to return these.

412
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,924
Really?

413
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,928
Are you sure
you didn't just change your destination?

414
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,138
Come on.

415
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,473
I like you, but not that much.

416
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,893
My bad.

417
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,979
I'm kidding.

418
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,856
About what?

419
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,858
That I don't like you as much.

420
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,997
Remember that girl last night?

421
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,332
-She was hot.
-Totally.

422
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,542
-She ruled.
-The best.

423
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,420
Hey, isn't she that kid
from the other day?

424
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,005
The one who hit you with an umbrella.

425
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,381
You're right.

426
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,133
Damn it.

427
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,677
Hey, you!

428
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,348
Do I know you?

429
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,558
"Do I know you?"

430
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,227
Geez, that's disappointing.

431
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,189
You punched several holes in my body.

432
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,191
How could you forget?

433
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,414
Hello.

434
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,834
How have you been?

435
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,464
I had to do that at the time.

436
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,427
But now I can't afford to be
in anything like that, in any way.

437
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,139
Let's pretend we didn't see each other
and just walk on by.

438
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,393
Do you think you are the only one
with a story to tell?

439
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,398
Go, get her!

440
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,446
Get her!

441
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,282
Hey!

442
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,700
You stop right there!

443
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,744
Hey!

444
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,207
Hey!

445
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,792
-Go after her!
-She's so fast.

446
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,173
What are you?

447
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,758
Hey!

448
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,510
Darn it!

449
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,556
I'm so fast without the weights!

450
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,685
Hey, go get your motorcycle.

451
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,937
-Go, bring them.
-Gosh.

452
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,530
What? Yi-jin?

453
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,539
It's you! Where did you get that car?

454
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,082
Why are you being chased?

455
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,709
Did you do something again?

456
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,295
I didn't do anything!

457
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,464
And shouldn't you offer me a ride
if you think I'm being chased?

458
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,425
But I'm sure no one can catch you.

459
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,719
Doesn't it occur to you how tired I am?

460
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,769
-Do you want a ride?
-Yes, please.

461
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,689
Then apologize to me

462
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,442
for embarrassing me by telling everyone
I failed the interview.

463
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,236
I don't have time for that now.

464
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,113
Can't you see them chasing after me?

465
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,281
This way!

466
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,368
They are on motorcycles. I'm serious.

467
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,246
Open the door. Please!

468
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,248
You could have said you're sorry instead.

469
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,875
Seriously?

470
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,549
Go! Hurry!

471
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,427
-Put your seatbelt on.
-Hey!

472
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,785
SLOW DOWN

473
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,381
Let's see.

474
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,635
They're gone now.

475
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,138
They've been gone for a while.

476
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,685
So say it.

477
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,645
-Say what?
-That you're sorry.

478
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,195
And what's with "do not distrub"?

479
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,366
It's not spelled D-I-S-T-R-U-B.

480
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,077
It should be spelled D-I-S-T-U-R-B.
Disturb.

481
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,248
On the page you drew to make up
for the torn page in Full House,

482
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,463
you wrote "liek" instead of "like".
Every word was misspelled.

483
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,176
Afterward, all I could think about
for three days in a row was "liek".

484
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,678
Answer me.

485
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,848
You owe me an apology for that too.

486
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,350
What's so wrong
with misspelling a few words?

487
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,103
You still understood everything I wrote.

488
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:29,358
Let me add here how I saved you
from freezing to death with a blanket.

489
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,110
That night was scorching hot.

490
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,490
Anyway, where did you get this car?
Is this yours?

491
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,283
Don't change the subject.

492
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,746
Is this a trace
of your past glamorous life?

493
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,539
To reminisce about the good old days?

494
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,794
Can you exclude me
from the tragedies into comedies thing?

495
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,338
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,133
I have to admit, it worked.

497
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,349
FAILED AT AN INTERVIEW TODAY
DO NOT "DISTRUB"

498
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,433
Gosh.

499
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,519
It's hot.

500
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,158
"Failed at an interview today."

501
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,663
"Do not distrub."

502
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,126
It's not "distrub".
It's spelled "disturb".

503
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,961
How can she get this wrong?

504
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,880
Geez.

505
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,467
It made me laugh.

506
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,096
After that, failing the interview
didn't seem like a big deal.

507
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,892
I could relate to why you turned
a tragedy into a comedy.

508
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,689
How did you first come up with that?

509
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,277
Because I lost in so many matches.

510
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,780
I couldn't let every day be tragic
just because I lost every time.

511
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,992
Laughing makes it easier to forget.

512
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,661
You have to forget to move on.

513
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,293
That was cool, right?

514
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,380
You know what?

515
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,548
What?

516
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,841
It's raining.

517
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,224
Oh no. This is bad.
I can't close the roof.

518
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,893
Why not?

519
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,771
It's broken. Otherwise, why would I be
driving like this and embarrassing myself?

520
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,484
-Gosh.
-Awesome!

521
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,072
This is our chance
to be happy when we're alone.

522
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,909
I love getting wet in the rain!

523
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,621
The lights changed. Let's go!

524
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,010
It's raining!

525
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,137
Are you having fun?

526
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,098
Yes, this is so much fun!

527
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,589
You look silly.

528
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,164
It's not raining anymore.

529
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,209
Right. It stopped.

530
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,550
That's where I am going to drop this off.

531
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,888
To who?

532
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,182
I'm going there too.

533
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,727
That's where Seung-wan lives.

534
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,562
Seung-wan lives there?

535
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,250
Hey.

536
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,045
Look at your bag. It's soaked.

537
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,172
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

538
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,965
That was really fun.

539
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,179
Yu-rim, I didn't know you were coming.

540
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,058
Mom asked me to bring you side dishes.

541
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,392
I see.

542
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,935
Ji-woong, why are you here?

543
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,938
To return food containers
to Seung-wan's mom.

544
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,734
Right. Did you know the daughter
of this house is in the broadcasting club?

545
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,861
-I do.
-Oh, okay.

546
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,530
What about your car? You kept it?

547
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,033
I thought it was sold off,
but my aunt had it.

548
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,785
She left it with me for a bit.

549
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,869
I see.

550
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,127
Where have you two been?

551
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,214
Nowhere. We just ran into each other.

552
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,300
Why do you talk to me
only when Yi-jin is around?

553
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,302
I was asking Yi-jin, not you.

554
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,346
-Why you…
-Guys, please.

555
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,514
Hold on.

556
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,809
How come you both know him?

557
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,060
Is he someone important?

558
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,230
You can say that.

559
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,067
What am I looking at right now?

560
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,953
-Hello, sir.
-Yes, hi.

561
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,579
You look handsome as always.

562
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,292
But tell me,

563
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,420
why are you all here?

564
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,634
What's that sound?

565
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,595
It sounds like your mom.

566
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,681
Gosh.

567
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,643
-Oh dear, what should I do?
-Oh my.

568
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,562
-What's going on here?
-Oh my gosh.

569
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,523
I thought you were making loach soup?
What are you doing?

570
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,985
Stop nagging and come over here
to catch the loaches!

571
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,404
Oh dear.

572
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,702
-Here, catch this one.
-Oh my gosh.

573
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,995
Catch that one too.

574
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,337
No!

575
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,010
Mom, they're alive!

576
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,970
Of course! Why would they be dead?

577
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,686
Hey, don't throw it.

578
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,229
Oh, I'm sorry.

579
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,275
This is easy.

580
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,780
You two boys should lift the fridge.

581
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,657
There are a few underneath it. Look!

582
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,911
One, two, three!

583
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,330
One, two, three!

584
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,919
Thank you.

585
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,962
But who are you?

586
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,965
Hello, I'm Na Hee-do.

587
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,717
I'm Seung-wan's classmate.

588
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,512
Hello, I'm Ko Yu-rim.

589
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,932
So are you the classmates who voted
Seung-wan to be the class president?

590
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,810
I missed the vote
because I'm on the fencing team.

591
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,230
I only transferred recently.

592
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,856
I also didn't vote for her.

593
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,566
Then who did?

594
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,984
Why didn't you vote for me?

595
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,528
It's boring when you're busy.

596
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,907
Hey there, why am I the only one
lifting this? Can you try harder?

597
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,033
I'm doing my best.

598
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,201
Lift it up a bit more.

599
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,869
Are there still more?

600
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,082
I got it!

601
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,178
Thank you all so much.

602
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,931
If it wasn't for you
I would have had to work all night.

603
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,391
Thanks to you too, Yi-jin.

604
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,725
Enjoy.

605
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,936
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

606
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,658
Does anyone here like loach soup?

607
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,164
I apologize on behalf of my mom.

608
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,791
That's okay. I can eat.

609
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,792
It's delicious.

610
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,718
I thought you didn't like it.

611
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,013
I can stuff myself with anything.

612
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,889
That's a talent.

613
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,064
So how long have you been friends
with Seung-wan?

614
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:33,027
-Is she a family friend?
-Since forever. Our moms are friends.

615
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,279
She has been there
ever since I can remember.

616
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,530
Did you two date?

617
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,616
Don't talk nonsense while eating.

618
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,410
I couldn't go out with anyone
because of her.

619
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,996
Everyone always assumes that
we're together.

620
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,042
But we're just friends.
I hope we're clear on that point.

621
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,423
Why are you saying that to Yu-rim?

622
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,133
It matters to me that she knows.

623
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,886
But why are you here with us?

624
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,806
Hey, he has way more seniority over me
at the broadcasting club.

625
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,350
Watch it!

626
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,602
But he graduated,
so we can drop the formality.

627
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,022
So what's your relationship with Yu-rim?

628
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,192
We've known each other for a long time,
like you and Seung-wan.

629
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,987
-Ji-woong.
-Yes?

630
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,281
Aren't you curious about how I know him?

631
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,616
Not at all.

632
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,537
-This tastes so good, right?
-It's good.

633
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,833
Ji-woong, is this the manual film camera
you had asked to borrow?

634
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,336
Yes, that's the one. You still have it.

635
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,421
I'm not sure if this works though.

636
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,968
SEPTEMBER 1998
OUR FIRST GROUP PICTURE

637
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,096
Look at how young Back Yi-jin is.

638
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,016
Grandma. Tell me, who is Yi-jin?

639
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,644
That's Yu-rim,

640
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,064
Ji-woong, Seung-wan,

641
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:53,982
your mom,

642
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,735
and this is Yi-jin.

643
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,405
So that's Back Yi-jin.

644
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,531
That's right.

645
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,950
Do you know him?

646
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,244
Me?

647
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,955
No, I don't know him.

648
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,749
Did you come to tell me that
it's time to eat?

649
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,959
Yes.

650
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,176
Gosh.

651
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,639
What do you have there?

652
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,395
Min-chae was looking at this photo
from your album.

653
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,731
When was this?

654
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,361
We all look so young.

655
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,324
At the time,
I thought Yi-jin looked pretty mature.

656
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,244
But now that I look at this,
he was just a kid.

657
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,331
He was only 22 back then.

658
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,586
I met him last month.

659
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,512
I can't believe how much time has passed.

660
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,766
I see you're here eating with Yu-rim.

661
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,059
Were you two close then?

662
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,562
No.

663
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,565
This was when I absolutely hated her.

664
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,955
What do you think you're doing?

665
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,248
What?

666
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,461
This is…

667
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,671
Was it you who put drinks in my locker?

668
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,842
I thought you had decided to hate me.

669
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,678
This isn't what it looks like--

670
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,597
You have to stop liking me.

671
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,642
Being two-faced like this

672
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,228
creeps me out.

673
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,112
PINE FLAVORED DRINK

674
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,199
I do like this drink a lot,

675
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,409
but not anymore, all thanks to you.

676
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,849
Gosh.

677
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,478
Why is she holding onto
that umbrella so tightly?

678
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,397
I'm the one who gave you that!

679
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:49,825
I can't give up on you until the end

680
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:54,788
Don't hesitate

681
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:59,251
To make sure that we don't fall again

682
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,045
We have to get back up

683
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,964
What has happened with society?

684
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,675
There are no guarantees in life anymore

685
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:11,054
Having no money leads to
Having no heart for the others

686
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,808
There's no one to trust
You can't give way to the others

687
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,394
The world is already a tough place to live
For myself

688
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,813
Everyone is greedy
So greedy

689
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:24,151
Nobody cares for the others anymore
Others are choking you for being kind

690
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,529
Everyone stood to watch the tower
You built collapse

691
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,364
-Watch it collapse
-Watch it collapse

692
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,282
-Yes!
-You did it!

693
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,285
That was awesome!

694
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,746
-Na Hee-do!
-Yes!

695
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,918
Ji-woong.

696
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,087
I realized something.

697
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,339
Stop.

698
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,674
You shouldn't fall for me.

699
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,179
Sorry. Tell me, what is it?

700
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,640
Now I know
why Yu-rim's fencing is so elegant.

701
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:58,977
And why coach wanted me to dance.

702
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,855
Why?

703
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,857
You won't get it.

704
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,611
As a way to say thank you, listen up.

705
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,197
Yu-rim is returning to NTC next week.

706
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,324
What?

707
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,118
Then she's not coming to school?

708
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:19,581
Another thing. She caught me this morning
putting the drink inside her locker.

709
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,249
Can you clear that up with her?

710
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,753
She thinks I'm still obsessed with her.

711
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,298
That was humiliating.

712
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,261
Yu-rim, is packing going well?

713
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,346
Yes, Mom.

714
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,432
-Come and have dinner?
-In a minute.

715
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,770
Yu-rim, I'm home!

716
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,896
Dad!

717
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,314
Yu-rim!

718
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,235
I thought I'd leave without seeing you.

719
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,071
I hit the gas a little
to see my lovely daughter.

720
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,949
You shouldn't have.
What if you had gotten into an accident?

721
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,284
All right. I promise
I won't do that again.

722
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,496
-Come and have dinner.
-Okay!

723
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,456
Dad bought some fried chicken.

724
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,833
Thanks, it looks delicious.

725
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,085
Please drink only a little.

726
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,169
Yes I will.

727
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,547
Go ahead.

728
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,968
Honey, you should join us.

729
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,137
That's okay.
I already ate back at the shop.

730
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,431
You have some father-daughter
quality time.

731
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,350
I'll drop by the shop.

732
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,435
All right.

733
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,648
How about a drink? It's been ages.

734
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,817
But don't tell Mom.

735
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,486
You'll get in trouble with Mom again.

736
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,906
Later, when Mom isn't around.

737
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,461
I won't get to see my little girl again
for some time.

738
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,714
So how is everything?
Are you having a hard time?

739
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,634
There are things I am struggling with.

740
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,262
But I'm not the only one.

741
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,264
You and Mom are going through a lot too.

742
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,684
Don't be such a grown-up.

743
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,060
Yu-rim.

744
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,563
You can whine about having a hard time.

745
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:12,360
I'm just worried about a lot of things.

746
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,658
What if that is the only gold medal
I'll ever have in my entire life?

747
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,870
What if this isn't the start of my heyday

748
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,706
and it has already come to an end?

749
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,832
Things like that.

750
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,626
Well, then let it be.

751
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,379
Remember, not many people win
a gold medal in their life.

752
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:36,176
I respect you,
not as your dad, but as a person.

753
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,013
Your mom and I are already
so proud of you.

754
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:49,523
But I want to do better and provide you
and Mom with a comfortable life.

755
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,652
Hey, then we will have
to walk on eggshells around you,

756
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,488
and I don't want that.

757
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,162
That's it. Dad, can you pour
just one glass for me?

758
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,249
Of course.

759
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,169
My gosh. Honey!

760
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,338
You're giving alcohol to her again!

761
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,382
-Hurry. Drink up!
-Stop it.

762
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,800
No, you're not drinking this.

763
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,510
This is for me.

764
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,680
What should your mom have with the drink?

765
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,681
Fried chicken?

766
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,266
-This hits the spot.
-No, she likes pickled radish.

767
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,642
Pour me another glass.

768
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:34,776
ELEPHANT SNACKS

769
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,403
Ji-woong.

770
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,322
Were you here waiting for me?

771
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,951
PINE FLAVORED DRINK

772
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,578
I wanted to give this to you myself today.

773
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,583
Hee-do has been doing me a favor

774
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,210
to put this in your locker every day.

775
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,671
It was you? My goodness.

776
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:58,717
Then I've made a complete fool of myself
without knowing.

777
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,761
That's okay. I'm sure you would have
still looked pretty anyway.

778
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,013
What?

779
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,935
You are just so weird.

780
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,520
I think I'm weird too.

781
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,648
I found myself waiting here
for an hour to see you

782
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,985
since I won't get to see you much
from now on.

783
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,863
It's weird, right?

784
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,117
I'll be at school at times
for attendance requirements.

785
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,994
So I'll see you then.

786
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,791
I bet there are
a lot of tall and handsome guys at NTC.

787
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,128
Many of them will be your fans.

788
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,547
You also have a lot of fans.

789
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,382
You have that nickname.

790
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,928
-And you get asked out every day.
-But I don't date my fans.

791
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,391
Do you?

792
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,228
I don't, either.

793
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,360
You're late.

794
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,111
You should go.

795
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,323
All right, then.

796
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,492
See you.

797
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,203
Yu-rim.

798
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,041
I'm not one of your fans.

799
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,890
NURTURING THE STRONGEST

800
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,809
Coach!

801
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,228
I've mastered the dance.

802
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,109
You don't have to show it to me.

803
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,070
Why not? Please watch.
I tried my very best.

804
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,363
That's fine.

805
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,532
Tell me about what you learned.

806
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,125
Now I know

807
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,128
the difference between me and Yu-rim.

808
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,632
The reason why Yu-rim's fencing
looked elegant

809
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,384
was that she had rhythm.

810
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,969
However, my fencing

811
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,722
had no sense of rhythm.

812
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,060
You can't gain a sense of rhythm
by mastering a single choreography.

813
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,771
However, I still asked you to do it…

814
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,358
so that you know what good fencing is.

815
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,028
Improve your perspective.

816
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,990
That will help you
to see yourself objectively.

817
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,494
Yes, understood.

818
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,039
This is the last training
before the tryouts.

819
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,291
Put on your gear.

820
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,678
I will be your sparring partner
for your last practice match.

821
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,847
-Really?
-Normally…

822
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,308
coaches don't do this.

823
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,603
There's nothing to gain by winning
and a lot to lose by losing.

824
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,188
But nothing I do

825
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,899
can make me lose face.

826
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,402
Ye-ji, you can be the referee.

827
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,196
Yes.

828
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:16,790
VICTORY

829
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,023
En garde.

830
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,275
Prêtes?

831
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,735
Allez.

832
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,867
We have to embrace the times we're in.

833
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,619
Some things just have to change.

834
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,288
Even so,

835
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,374
our test isn't some joke.

836
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:03,503
We can't let high school graduates apply
to be a reporter at our network.

837
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,425
Didn't you watch the news
I covered yesterday?

838
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,760
Due to the IMF crisis,

839
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,638
a total of 450,000 college students have
taken a leave.

840
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,431
They will lose out on an opportunity

841
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,309
if we limit our openings
only to college graduates.

842
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,020
I'm not sure what talent
we could find in that pool,

843
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,606
but if it doesn't matter, go ahead.

844
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,650
I get your point,

845
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,862
but this is unprecedented
in the history of our newsroom.

846
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,906
To be honest,
what have undergraduates been doing?

847
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,285
They neither study nor manage grades.

848
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,328
They would just party and date,

849
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,415
but were still wooed into
major companies after they graduated.

850
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,876
Does the bachelor's degree matter?

851
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,005
It's time for the news.

852
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,470
After the IMF restructuring,
the number of homeowners living in…

853
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,429
Hello, I'm here.

854
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,014
Yi-jin. What brings you here?

855
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,348
I wanted to return these.

856
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,603
I'm not much of a cook,
so I couldn't make anything in return.

857
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,813
Not at all. Did it all taste okay?

858
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,648
They were all very tasty.

859
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,942
Thank you for always taking care of me.

860
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,111
I'm glad you've enjoyed them.

861
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,281
-I'll get going now.
-All right.

862
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,617
-Take care.
-Bye.

863
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,333
You lost

864
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,504
because you thought you'd lose,

865
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,798
and I caught you thinking this.

866
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:36,221
No one you come across during the tryouts
will be a better fencer than me.

867
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,389
So don't be scared.

868
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,018
Even if you're scared, don't let it show.

869
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,729
Do you understand?

870
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,690
Yes, understood.

871
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,196
Your training is complete.

872
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,493
Good work, Hee-do.

873
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,182
It has been a great honor,

874
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,018
Ms. Yang Chan-mi.

875
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,349
Isn't anyone here?

876
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,938
Gosh, that startled me.

877
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,132
BANANA MILK

878
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,596
What?

879
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,930
Hey.

880
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,891
You gave me a fright!

881
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,935
What were you doing there?

882
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,562
I was in the area

883
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,648
and I saw the lights were on.
So I thought it might be you.

884
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,899
I got you a refill.

885
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,069
I was startled to suddenly find a straw.

886
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,488
I thought I had finally lost it
before the tryouts.

887
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,991
Aren't you happy to see me?

888
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:08,998
Come inside.

889
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,835
I can't stand how we're here
like a scene from Romeo and Juliet.

890
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,761
It's my first time seeing you
in fencing gear.

891
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,971
You look different.

892
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,849
Like how?

893
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,562
Like I shouldn't be teasing you.

894
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,731
That's good.

895
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,448
Can I touch it?

896
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,908
Sure.

897
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,954
It's thicker than I thought.

898
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:48,996
-Is it?
-It is.

899
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,040
It hurts when you get hit.

900
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,376
Isn't that thing heavy?

901
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:56,212
I'm used to it. It weighs about 500 grams.

902
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,846
It doesn't feel that light.

903
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,646
I'm curious.

904
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,066
Why is the inside of the handle red?

905
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,317
The rest aren't.

906
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,486
That one belongs to Yu-rim.

907
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,572
What? Is hers different?

908
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,616
That means she has been
in an international competition.

909
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,662
And that means
she was on the national team.

910
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:34,584
At international competitions, you have to
color the handle red or blue.

911
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,669
-Why?
-Inside the guard…

912
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,379
Here, hand it over.

913
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,468
The light could come on
when the opponent's sword touches here,

914
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,595
so coloring it cuts off the electricity.

915
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,804
I see.

916
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,771
If it were you,
what color would you choose?

917
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,107
For me…

918
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,651
I want blue.

919
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,740
Can you breathe with that mask on?

920
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,410
You sure have a lot of questions.

921
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,622
Do you want to try it on?

922
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,706
The fencing gear?

923
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,792
We had a boys' team until two years ago.

924
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,919
I can find something if I dig around.

925
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,483
Is this how you put it on?

926
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,945
Come over here.

927
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,147
We should have a match
now that you're dressed for it.

928
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,481
What?

929
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,903
If you want to beat me up, just go ahead.

930
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,362
Don't turn it into a sports thing.

931
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,865
Don't be intimidated.
I'll put myself at a disadvantage.

932
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,827
I won't attack at all
and will only play defense.

933
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:19,665
If you can hit or slash me
at least once in three minutes, you win.

934
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,753
-Deal?
-Geez.

935
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,048
That sounds doable.

936
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,300
What's the bet?
I play only when there's a bet.

937
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,011
Sure. What do you want to bet on?

938
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,932
The loser has to grant the winner a wish.

939
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,476
It's on.

940
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,895
-Testing.
-Testing?

941
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:41,979
Hit me.

942
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:46,943
Let's start.

943
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,487
Ready, go!

944
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,178
Hold on.

945
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,607
I can do this. Please!

946
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,276
You have 30 seconds left.

947
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,362
Okay, 30 seconds.

948
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,700
Full House.

949
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,619
-What about it?
-Volume 13 is out.

950
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,121
Really?

951
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,289
Yes, I win!

952
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,834
Has volume 13 really been released?

953
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,961
-No.
-Hey!

954
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,672
How could you!

955
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,830
Are you sure you can do well
when your level of concentration

956
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,749
can be taken down by Full House?

957
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,419
But Full House is an exception!

958
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,922
And this is against the rules!

959
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:32,923
You can't talk to me!

960
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,009
Talking during the match isn't cheating.

961
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,887
And if so, why did you say something back?

962
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:40,973
Gosh.

963
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,685
This is unfair! Seriously!

964
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,646
-Back Yi-jin!
-I'll think about the wish and tell you

965
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,440
since this is a rare opportunity.

966
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,317
No way!

967
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,070
Honestly, how could you do that!

968
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,154
Do what?

969
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,657
This isn't fair!

970
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,536
Hey, you lied to me! That's unfair!

971
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,835
Hello, sir.

972
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,378
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

973
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,463
Did you have dinner?

974
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,672
Yes, I have.

975
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,384
By the way, we will leave at 7 a.m.

976
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,805
to watch the tryouts,
so can you notify the others?

977
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:21,972
I will.

978
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,268
Who do you think will
make the national team?

979
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:31,232
Well, Hye-ju ranked ninth,
so I think she's the strongest candidate.

980
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:33,400
Yes, Hye-ju.

981
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,903
Was it Na Hee-do?

982
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,697
She's from your fencing team. Is she good?

983
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,158
She's mentored by Chan-mi, right?

984
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,079
But she ranked 26th.

985
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,832
She barely made it to the tryouts
due to two empty slots.

986
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:52,878
Hey, you know that an athlete's ability
doesn't develop steadily.

987
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,922
It hits them out of nowhere.

988
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,216
That's what's scary.

989
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,526
I'm ranked 26th.

990
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,863
Realistically speaking,

991
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,449
I shouldn't be dreaming of
coming first place at the tryouts.

992
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:25,327
But you are dreaming.

993
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,832
Right.

994
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,503
See, I don't get disappointed
when my dreams don't come true.

995
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,634
I'm used to losing and failing.

996
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,222
That's called

997
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:48,475
having mental fortitude.

998
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,605
Everyone wants to be
as strong-minded as you.

999
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:57,067
They don't want to be scared
of losing and failing.

1000
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,161
Sometimes I wish I could take it from you.

1001
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,668
I think that explains…

1002
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,715
why I miss you when I feel mentally weak.

1003
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,280
It must be 11 p.m.

1004
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,408
That's when the lights go out.

1005
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:34,123
You are by far the most experienced fencer
when it comes to losing.

1006
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:39,586
Those losses were blocks
to build yourself stairs leading up.

1007
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,423
Think about it.

1008
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,467
Now you’ve got the highest staircase.

1009
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,519
Take your time to climb it

1010
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,314
and take whatever you want.

1011
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,297
Why do you root for me?

1012
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,676
Even my mom doesn't.

1013
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,146
Because you give me hope.

1014
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,412
And I want more for you.

1015
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:30,697
Can I borrow some of Yi-jin's recordings?

1016
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,868
You're one of a kind.

1017
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,996
I'm going to take in all your support.

1018
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,748
Let's become great together.

1019
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:41,834
Ji-woong.

1020
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,336
I know you saw me.

1021
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,423
Na Hee-do, a member of the national team.

1022
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:54,012
Wait for me, Hee-do.

1023
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:54,972
1998 HWASEONG
NATIONAL FENCING TEAM TRYOUTS

1024
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,392
-Prêtes? Allez.
-Coach.

1025
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,018
I won't lose a single match today.

1026
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:11,822
