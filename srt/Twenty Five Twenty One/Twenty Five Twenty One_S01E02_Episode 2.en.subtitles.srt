00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,695
EPISODE 2

2
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,075
What were you doing up so late?

3
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,868
I saw the lights were on.

4
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,455
Oh, I just watched a few things.

5
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,623
I couldn't fall asleep.

6
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,418
Leave the little ones.
Harvest only the big leaves.

7
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,669
I will.

8
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,759
But you don't suit this garden.

9
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,762
I was never a housewife before.

10
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,889
Now I find such chores enjoyable.

11
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,979
We used to have a pond there.

12
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,731
And a statue?

13
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,901
How did you know?

14
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,069
What?

15
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,781
Oh, I think Mom told me about it.

16
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,285
-Grandma.
-Yes?

17
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,872
In the past, did you also participate
in the gold collecting campaign?

18
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,000
I learned about the IMF crisis at school.

19
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,670
Is that in the textbook these days?

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,630
Of course, I took part.

21
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,634
Then did you really sell all your gold?
Even jewelry?

22
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,969
Like your wedding ring?

23
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,930
I sold everything but that.

24
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,808
Oh, you didn't sell your ring?

25
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,157
I know they look out of style,

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,576
but these were in vogue back then.

27
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,953
Not at all. I think they're very trendy.

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,042
I'm going to the grocery store.

29
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,627
Get ready if you want to go too.

30
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,045
Yes, Grandma.

31
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,804
MOM

32
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,769
Are you really not coming back?
Do you plan to live there?

33
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,942
She didn't even check
if Grandma had sold the rings.

34
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,112
I felt bad for her last night for nothing.

35
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,244
I'm checking out Grandma's wedding ring.

36
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,370
Let me be.

37
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,540
What? She still has those rings?

38
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,877
Gosh, Ms. Shin. I'm so sick of her.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,004
She should have told me
she hadn't sold them.

40
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,049
I feel awkward, after all this time.

41
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,432
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go!

42
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,186
Can you get me a coke?
I can drink whatever since I quit ballet.

43
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,822
YEAR 1998

44
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,045
Yi-jin!

45
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,926
Back Yi-jin!

46
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,640
I'm finally going to a new school today!

47
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,976
And it's Tae Yang High School!

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,645
I can continue fencing!

49
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,523
Hey, are you still there?

50
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,608
Did you hear me?

51
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,986
That's okay.

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,738
I can forgive anyone for anything today.

53
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,702
Because I'm so very happy right now!

54
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,832
Congratulations.

55
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,965
Who are you yelling at?

56
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,009
Oh, never mind.

57
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,386
Are you off to work already?

58
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,930
I'll go with you.
It's your first day at a new school.

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,516
To school? Don't bother.
I can go by myself.

60
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,144
What have you ever done by yourself?
Go to clubs?

61
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,193
Oh dear.

62
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,780
What happened to that statue?

63
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,115
Did you do that?

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,285
Why on earth would I touch it?
You're insane.

65
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,955
I brought it home to
balance out the yin energy.

66
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,665
Now we have a yin-yang imbalance.

67
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,251
You say that and still call yourself
a news anchor?

68
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,130
Then where else would I say this?
On the news?

69
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,716
Come on.

70
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,760
Jeez.

71
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,847
I can go to school by myself!

72
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,392
NO NEWSPAPERS

73
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,686
-Did you hear me?
-Hurry up!

74
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,898
You look much better in person.

75
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,234
I find it unfair that I appear much fatter
on the screen.

76
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,322
-Gosh, you have such a great voice.
-Oh, please.

77
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,326
We thought Hee-do would come alone
since we know how busy you are.

78
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,498
It's my daughter's first day of school.
Of course, I should come.

79
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,666
She has a lot to learn,

80
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,336
so please take good care of her.

81
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,339
Oh my! Who do we have here?
Ms. Shin Jae-kyung?

82
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,217
Hello, I'm the headmaster of the school.

83
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,302
Glad to meet you. I'm Shin Jae-kyung.

84
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,471
Of course. We all know who you are.

85
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,349
It's an honor to have you visit us.
Rather than sitting here,

86
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,809
please join me in my office.

87
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,310
-Sure.
-Great.

88
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,687
Excuse me.

89
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,273
I need to use the bathroom.

90
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,528
Please, this way.

91
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,325
Did you know girls in the senior class
call you "class seven's pretty boy"?

92
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,869
The rumor finally caught on.

93
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,540
You know that I've had my eyes on you
before any of this.

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,334
It's as if it's her first day here.

95
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,461
I have a college entrance exam soon,

96
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,213
but I can't focus because of you.

97
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,174
So how about we date?
I'll be a sweet girlfriend.

98
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,804
But I like things the way they are now.

99
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,849
Are you saying no because of Ji Seung-wan?

100
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,519
What's going on between you two?

101
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,771
Friends since diapers.

102
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,690
But boys and girls can't be friends.

103
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, is that so?

104
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,695
Then she and I aren't friends.
I worship her.

105
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,488
That's not funny, Ji-woong.

106
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,992
Listen, I don't want a girlfriend.
All I need are fans.

107
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,078
And I don't date my fans.

108
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,090
Gosh, I love being in a coed school.

109
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,011
Class, we have a new student joining us.
Her name is Na Hee-do.

110
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,346
She's in the fencing team,
so she'll be out a lot due to practice.

111
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,474
Make her feel welcome to the class, okay?

112
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,933
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

113
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,893
Introduce yourself.

114
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,103
Hello, I'm Na Hee-do.

115
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,817
You can sit in that empty seat.

116
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,405
-Class president, give her a school tour.
-Yes, ma'am.

117
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,616
-Who is in charge of class chores today?
-I am.

118
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,784
-Come by to collect the graded papers.
-Yes.

119
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,785
Enjoy your classes.

120
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,287
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

121
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,342
Hello, newcomer.

122
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,640
Are you the class president?

123
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,807
No, I'm the cool kid.

124
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,519
What do cool kids do here?

125
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,605
I do things like this.
Engage in small talk with the newcomers.

126
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,649
And then? Bullying and taking lunch money?

127
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,151
No way. You're new here.
We should all get along.

128
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,531
So if you're in the fencing team,
are you friends with Yu-rim?

129
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,699
Well, I just got here.

130
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,743
Do you plan on becoming her friend?

131
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,370
Because I like her.

132
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,294
I like her way more than you do. Trust me.

133
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,797
What do you like so much about her?

134
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,007
Her techniques? Speed?

135
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,801
Strong willpower?

136
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,511
I like her image.

137
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,680
That's right. Her image as a pretty girl.

138
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,354
I agree.

139
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,356
She's so perfect.

140
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,612
Go back to your seat, Ji-woong.

141
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,780
Got it.

142
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,782
School tour. Let's go.

143
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,950
Are you the class president?

144
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,744
Yes. I'm Ji Seung-wan. Nice to meet you.

145
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,622
Oh, you're his diaper buddy.

146
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,423
Why did you become the president?

147
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,550
I didn't want to.

148
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,344
But as always, someone who hates
that duty ends up doing it.

149
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,887
So you didn't want this?

150
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,807
It's fun making someone do something
when they don't want to.

151
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,143
And sadly, I was elected
the class president.

152
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,188
You were forced to be
class president for a year

153
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,940
because they found it funny?

154
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,067
So what?

155
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,321
It should be fine as long as it's fun.

156
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,285
Jeez. I think you have a very big heart.

157
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,329
Where should we start?

158
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,041
Let's skip the science lab and art studio
since you won't be in class much.

159
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,002
I can show you the bathroom and infirmary.

160
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,670
Bathrooms should be at the end of the hall

161
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,380
and the infirmary should be
on the first floor.

162
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,050
What I'm curious about is at the gym,

163
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,843
so I'll get going now. Thanks!

164
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,346
Hee-do, you forgot to ask
the most important question.

165
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,558
The cafeteria is on your left
on the way to the gym.

166
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,237
Ko Yu-rim, so this is your world.

167
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,075
And now it's mine too.

168
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,538
Like I've mentioned yesterday,

169
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,998
this is…

170
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,958
Where is Yu-rim?

171
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,920
She's at the Federation
for something urgent.

172
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,129
She'll be here soon.

173
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,507
She's a star. No wonder she's busy.

174
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,301
Then let's introduce ourselves.
Ye-ji can start.

175
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,137
Yes. I'm Lee Ye-ji, a sophomore.

176
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,766
My name is Park Han-sol, also a sophomore.

177
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,309
I'm Lee Da-seul, a senior.

178
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,520
Kang Ji-soo, a senior.

179
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,109
Hello?

180
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,944
It's your turn.

181
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,364
Yes.

182
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,408
Hello. I'm Na Hee-do, a junior.

183
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,660
I transferred from
Seon Jung Girls' High School.

184
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,929
I'm sorry for being late.

185
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,857
That's fine. Since you're sorry,
you can be in the practice match.

186
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,900
What practice match?

187
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,695
A match against our newcomer.
Let's see what she's got.

188
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,204
Why should I? I don't even know her name.

189
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,497
I'm Hee-do.

190
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,168
That's my name.

191
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,462
Na Hee-do.

192
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,092
I hadn't introduced myself to you yet.

193
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,057
All right then.

194
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,101
You know her name now, so we're set to go.

195
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,147
Hee-do, I'll give you three days
to ease yourself into our team.

196
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,692
If you win in a bout against Yu-rim,

197
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,819
I'll give these back to you.

198
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,404
You're wearing them for real.

199
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,491
It's from a good brand.

200
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,498
NURTURING THE STRONGEST

201
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,500
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH

202
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,545
Ye-ji, you need to lower your balance.

203
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,349
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS

204
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,146
Da-seul, you'll be in interval training
if I catch you lose balance again.

205
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,405
I can't believe I'm training with Yu-rim.

206
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,661
I've finally made it
to your world, Ko Yu-rim.

207
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,876
KO YU-RIM
AIM FOR THE GOLD MEDAL

208
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,317
Hey.

209
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,114
How is your ankle?

210
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,285
I read in your interview about the injury.

211
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,746
That's why you pulled out
of the national team.

212
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,046
This feels surreal.

213
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm a fan of yours.

214
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,011
I watched every bout you've played in

215
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,888
because I wanted to become like you.

216
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,350
I don't know what this may sound like--

217
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,102
You sound like an idiot.

218
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,399
I've seen many kids like you.

219
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,944
We have three to four students
that come in annually

220
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,446
to train with me and our coach.

221
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,532
But no one has lasted
more than three months

222
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,784
because they couldn't catch up.

223
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,164
Still, the coach continues
to welcome students like you.

224
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,541
Why do you think that is?

225
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,252
Because you are good?

226
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,879
Because you have potential?

227
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,964
Because we need someone like you?

228
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,050
Don't delude yourself.

229
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,930
It's to secure more funding
from the school budget.

230
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,601
You're worth the budget we get
per student. You're nothing more or less.

231
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,608
Did I do something wrong?

232
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,817
Yes.

233
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,821
You believe that you can do it
and that you'll make it.

234
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,660
Back there, I didn't say I didn't know
your name out of curiosity.

235
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,789
The fact that I don't know who you are
in this small fencing community

236
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,832
means you're nothing.

237
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,127
I think your beliefs are wrong

238
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,463
when as a fencer,
you haven't achieved anything.

239
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,774
Yi-hyun, what are you doing here?
When did you come?

240
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,068
I stopped by to see your new place.

241
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,321
So is this where you live?

242
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,075
Why didn't you ring the doorbell?

243
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,078
I wasn't sure which one to ring
out of the two doorbells.

244
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,705
I didn't want to pick the wrong one

245
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,708
and get you into any trouble
with the landlord.

246
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,214
Mine is on the left.
Just ring the bell next time.

247
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,424
All right.

248
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,261
Hey, that looks hideous on you.

249
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,846
-Come here.
-Back off.

250
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,056
It's a hairpiece.

251
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,350
You just clip it on.

252
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,602
What?

253
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,522
I saw that.

254
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,983
Those punks picked a fight.

255
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm begging you. Please don't go astray.

256
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,738
If that had happened,

257
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,991
I would be friends with them
instead of fighting them.

258
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,118
Why did you fight?

259
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,494
I don't know.

260
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,581
Let's see.

261
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,917
They mocked me for pretending to be rich
when our family is bankrupt.

262
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,627
Whatever.

263
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,131
That's a harsh thing to say to you.

264
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,385
-If it happens again--
-It won't.

265
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,720
So don't worry.

266
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,389
I'm fine.

267
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,310
How is aunt doing? Is she well?

268
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,312
Yes.

269
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,231
Did you send her money?

270
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,358
She complimented you.

271
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,323
Once I get a job,
I will bring you to stay with me.

272
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,283
Until then, listen to what aunt says.

273
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,160
I will.

274
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,455
Were you going somewhere?

275
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,792
Yes. I was going to Yu-rim's snack shop.

276
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,460
Okay.

277
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:12,049
ELEPHANT SNACKS

278
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,231
Come on in.

279
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,486
Look who's here!

280
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,904
How have you been?

281
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,117
Where were you?

282
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,701
Where have you been until now?

283
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,038
I couldn't reach your mother,
and your number wasn't valid.

284
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,040
I saw the news about the bankruptcy,

285
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,169
and I felt my heart sink.
I was so worried.

286
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,383
How is Chairman Back?

287
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,385
How is your mother?

288
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,557
We are all in different places,
and it's hard to keep in touch.

289
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,768
Good heavens.

290
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,397
How could this happen to
good people like your family?

291
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,399
Goodness.

292
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,029
I'm sorry Yu-rim had to lose her sponsor.

293
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,240
Don't you ever say that.

294
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,492
How do you think she got to
where she is now?

295
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,287
What do you mean?
Yu-rim earned it all herself.

296
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,002
THE RISING STAR OF KOREA'S FENCING,
KO YU-RIM WINS THE FIRST GOLD MEDAL

297
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,340
-Too bad.
-That was close!

298
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,805
Excuse me. Can you pass the ball here?

299
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,104
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

300
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,705
How have you been?

301
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,421
You're leaving?

302
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,715
Yu-rim.

303
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,935
Come on.

304
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,358
Please forgive me for this once.

305
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,950
I told you everything.

306
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,911
I whined on about how hard it was
to become a national athlete.

307
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,580
I told you
how lonely I felt at Taereung NTC,

308
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,333
and how much pressure I was under
when preparing for the games.

309
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,044
I also told you how upset I was
because of my ankle.

310
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,923
But what about you, Yi-jin?

311
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,551
Tell me, what am I to you?

312
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,889
Do you find this funny?

313
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,433
How could you laugh in this situation?

314
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,978
You haven't grown at all.
I thought you'd be taller by now.

315
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,145
Where did you go?

316
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,731
I stopped growing
because I was worried about you.

317
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,992
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,164
It was difficult for me.

319
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,418
I was also scared…

320
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,587
and afraid.

321
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,011
I still am.

322
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,356
You were supposed to say "I'm fine."

323
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,151
If you were going to show up like this,

324
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,321
you should have said
everything is fine now.

325
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,533
You're an athlete,
so stop beating up someone who isn't fine.

326
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,704
Darn it. I didn't want to cry like a baby
in front of you.

327
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,384
This is the second time
you're avoiding me. That hurts.

328
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,849
Did you hear what I just said? I'm hurt.

329
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,520
I didn't know you knew Yu-rim.

330
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,189
You suddenly feel so distant.

331
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,445
So is this your way

332
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,739
of expressing the distance you feel?

333
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,953
Starting today,
I'm on the same team as Yu-rim.

334
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,794
Aren't you surprised?

335
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,048
You already told me that this morning.

336
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,678
So you did hear me.

337
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,055
Yes. I also replied.

338
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,640
Congratulations.

339
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,102
But I didn't hear a thing.

340
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,688
Well, you did now.

341
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,359
Thank you.

342
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,492
You can sit. I'll respect the elderly.

343
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,869
Someone taught you well.

344
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,745
Very well.

345
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,882
How do you know Yu-rim?

346
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,466
Are you two dating?

347
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,053
High schoolers should date
other high schoolers.

348
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,972
Grown-ups should date other grown-ups.

349
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,808
Then why was she in tears?
I thought you made her cry.

350
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,228
Well, I did.

351
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,980
I've never seen her cry before.

352
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,524
She didn't cry
even when she won the gold medal.

353
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,984
She often gets teary-eyed.

354
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,278
She has a lot to cry about.

355
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,239
But she couldn't cry
because she had no shoulder to cry on.

356
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,825
What? Are you saying she cries
only in front of you?

357
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,871
That's right. Unlike someone I know.

358
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,540
You cry even in the middle of a street.

359
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,876
Darn it.

360
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,545
This is so humiliating!

361
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,301
That was so humiliating.

362
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,719
That's what I like about you.

363
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,096
You don't hide your tears.

364
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,734
Sorry!

365
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,196
-Jeez.
-What was that?

366
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,615
You've got good reflexes.
You should be an athlete.

367
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,618
Do you know what's good about
not being an athlete?

368
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,373
It's okay to get injured.

369
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,166
Sit. It's for athlete protection.

370
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,501
Sit down.

371
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,199
Hello. Do you live in the room next door?

372
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,618
I'm the landlord's daughter.

373
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,579
Oh, I heard you're a top student.

374
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,126
I think you've fallen victim
to my mom's hobby.

375
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,461
Anyway, I wanted to ask you something.

376
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,172
-Yes.
-You shower every morning at 6:50 a.m.

377
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,424
Is there a reason?

378
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,552
That's when I come back
after delivering the papers.

379
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,679
Is there something wrong?

380
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,431
Due to the structure of the house,

381
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,725
we lose water pressure when you use water.

382
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,144
My school is far away,
so I wash every day at that time.

383
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,022
Since you've moved in,
I'm having water issues every morning.

384
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,648
If you're free afterward,

385
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,484
could you please shower 15 minutes later?

386
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,070
I think that will make everyone happy.

387
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,823
Good water pressure leads to happiness.

388
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,825
Right.

389
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,702
I'll do that.

390
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,163
I hesitated a lot
before approaching you about this

391
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,999
because I didn't want you
to think of me as a spoiled brat.

392
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,168
I appreciate your understanding.

393
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,880
-Thank you so much.
-Welcome.

394
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,432
She sure is smart.

395
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,318
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH

396
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,716
Hello.

397
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,176
Hello, Ye-ji.

398
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,636
Oh, hello.

399
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,228
She was…

400
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,437
Get a big spoonful.

401
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,481
…very different from what I had imagined.

402
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,568
I'm going to try that.

403
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,406
I thought I could get close to her,

404
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,408
but that was not allowed.

405
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,752
Did you know you can read
a person's face from behind?

406
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,004
Her expression

407
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,590
kept on hurting me.

408
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,646
Why are you two here?

409
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,983
Who said you can train at night time
without permission?

410
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,278
Sorry. We'll clean up
and leave immediately.

411
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,040
Are we not allowed to train at night?

412
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,793
Why not?

413
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,302
I realized I would only be able
to look her in the face

414
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,721
during bouts.

415
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,932
BRAVO ICE CREAM

416
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,520
I think I was closer to her

417
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,689
when I watched her from afar.

418
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,444
I felt a little sorry for myself

419
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,488
for admiring her so much.

420
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,412
INJEOLMI: DO YOU WANT TO MEET UP?

421
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,794
INJEOLMI: I KNOW WE PROMISED
TO KEEP OUR PERSONAL INFO A SECRET

422
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,464
INJEOLMI: BUT I WANT TO
BE THERE FOR YOU IN PERSON

423
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,141
Do you think our relationship will change

424
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,684
if we meet in person?

425
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,608
INJEOLMI: I THINK SO

426
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,861
INJEOLMI: WE'LL LIKE EACH OTHER
EVEN MORE THAN NOW

427
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,560
MATH ACADEMY

428
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,024
No!

429
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,776
DOOR LOCK QUESTION
SOLVE THE QUIZ TO GET THE CODE

430
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,613
What is all this gibberish,
you crazy math academy!

431
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,117
How could they do this?
What's this lock doing here? And a quiz?

432
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,703
One-three-four-zero.

433
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,249
What?

434
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,502
The code is one-three-four-zero.
Aren't you in hurry?

435
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,212
Right.

436
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,173
One-three-four-zero.

437
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,593
Yes!

438
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,471
It really worked!
Did you solve this in your head?

439
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,974
You rock. You're the best.
Wait here for me, okay?

440
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,027
What a surprise!
You appeared out of nowhere.

441
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,280
I was on the fourth floor
to print something.

442
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,948
Why are you all dressed up?

443
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,284
Are you going to a club?
It's too early for that.

444
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,911
No, a job interview.

445
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,331
Why were you upset at this bathroom?

446
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,293
I regularly use this bathroom
when nature calls and I'm in a rush.

447
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,630
But they decided to lock it up
all of a sudden so I was irritated.

448
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,298
They must be out of their minds.

449
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,802
I think it's an attempt to get students
to solve more math problems.

450
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,182
That's unfair for athletes like me.

451
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,601
Some athletes are good at academics,

452
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,770
so don't make it sound
as if every jock is bad at math like you.

453
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,982
It's not because you're an athlete
that you're bad at math and grammar.

454
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,150
You're just not that bright.

455
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,573
Oh my gosh. Everything you said
is correct and makes perfect sense.

456
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,452
This explains why you are close to Yu-rim.

457
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,788
What do you mean?

458
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,874
Yu-rim is just like you. It puts me off.

459
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,794
She has no idea how much I liked her.

460
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,505
She isn't like that.

461
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,926
Don't be ridiculous.
You know absolutely nothing about her.

462
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,970
Gosh, I have to go and warm up.

463
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,721
Today is a big day for me. See you!

464
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,652
We'll follow the official game rules.

465
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,947
The first to reach 15 points wins.

466
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,574
Don't take this practice match lightly.

467
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,786
Promise to do your best
on your honor, okay?

468
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,745
-Yes.
-Yes.

469
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,747
Okay. Get ready.

470
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,947
En garde.

471
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,367
Prêtes? Allez.

472
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,495
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

473
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,997
Attaque. Touche.

474
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,290
That was a good move.

475
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,877
Prêtes?

476
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,003
Allez.

477
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,838
Parade. Touche.

478
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,302
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

479
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,013
Touche.

480
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,475
Prêtes? Allez.

481
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,977
You missed. One point for Yu-rim.

482
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,646
Allez.

483
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,150
Back to your positions.

484
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,991
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

485
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,161
Prêtes? Allez.

486
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,706
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

487
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,417
One point for Hee-do.

488
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,964
Prêtes?

489
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,800
Allez.

490
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,345
Attaque. Touche.

491
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,504
Allez.

492
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,133
5 YEARS AGO

493
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,056
NA HEE-DO

494
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,738
Is she Na Hee-do?

495
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,615
I heard that she's a fencing prodigy.

496
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,325
She's so talented.

497
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,286
She will probably win today.

498
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,539
The opponent couldn't score at all.

499
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:12,336
THE 32ND NATIONAL JUNIOR SPORTS FESTIVAL

500
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,213
There's always a next time, Yu-rim.

501
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,048
Don't be so upset.

502
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,593
I was scared.

503
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,136
What?

504
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,472
Why were you scared?

505
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,232
I was scared of Hee-do.

506
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,695
I was too afraid to do anything.

507
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,084
En garde.

508
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,671
Prêtes?

509
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,465
Allez.

510
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,183
Attaque. Touche.

511
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:14,273
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

512
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,743
En garde.

513
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,587
Prêtes?

514
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,006
Allez.

515
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,892
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

516
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,352
One point for Hee-do.

517
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,562
NA HEE-DO, KO YU-RIM

518
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,662
Attention.

519
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,872
Salut.

520
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,187
Hee-do.

521
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,690
How does it feel to defeat Yu-rim?

522
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,443
It was just a practice match.

523
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,903
A single win doesn't mean
I am better than her.

524
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,947
Just a practice match? Stop being modest.

525
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,241
Come on. Be honest.

526
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,079
I'm happy I won.

527
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,291
But do you have to ask
in front of everyone?

528
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,375
Yes.

529
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,919
This is what makes sports exciting.

530
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,465
The winner and the loser are
in the same room.

531
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,926
You should enjoy this moment fully,
and feel the full despair of it too.

532
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,762
That way you can move on.

533
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,724
Hee-do, did you study Yu-rim's skills?

534
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,560
I didn't study for the match.

535
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,021
I was familiar because I'm a fan.

536
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,318
Yu-rim. Do you know why you lost today?

537
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,821
I didn't do well.

538
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,323
That's not true.

539
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,243
You didn't know about Hee-do.

540
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,917
Do you know who fencers find
to be the trickiest opponent?

541
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,002
High school athletes like yourselves.

542
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,463
Since there's no information,

543
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,882
they have zero clue
who they will go up against.

544
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,346
That is one of the reasons why
you won the gold medal in the last games.

545
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,848
And because of the same reason,

546
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,433
Hee-do won today.

547
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,978
Hee-do knows everything about you,

548
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,564
but you know nothing about her.

549
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,150
This is why

550
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,860
I forced you to a bout

551
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,488
against a newcomer

552
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,492
Listen, Yu-rim.

553
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,704
Your matches will only get
more difficult from now on.

554
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,667
Why? Because everyone knows your moves.

555
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:24,463
And athletes like Hee-do,
who you know nothing about, will line up.

556
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,341
So work hard.

557
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,010
And you come get your shoes.

558
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,032
I know you don't like me talking to you,

559
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,784
but let me just say how I feel.

560
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,705
It was my first match
against a gold medalist.

561
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,874
It was an honor.

562
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,381
Why do you like me?

563
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,016
Your footwork is quick
and you use delicate tactics.

564
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,727
You skillfully control the distance,
and can read spaces.

565
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,563
Your fencing is rhythmic and graceful
as if you're dancing.

566
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,440
And…

567
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,442
you always win.

568
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,696
Does this answer things?

569
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,658
No, you're wrong.

570
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,328
Do you know why you like me?

571
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,456
You'll have to accept you're not that good
if you want to hate me.

572
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,918
I guess it's easier to like me
than to face reality.

573
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,629
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

574
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,673
What do you know about
my feelings for you?

575
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,679
Stop the nonsense
and take care of your ankle.

576
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,848
I know you were playing safe
because of that.

577
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,447
Are you sure you know what we do here?

578
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,284
Yes. I understand you're hiring cleaners
for the hotel rooms.

579
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,411
But why are you so dressed up?

580
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,164
Because this is a job interview.

581
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,375
I'm aware of the jobs crisis,

582
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,585
but you look overqualified
to be working here.

583
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,382
Are you trying to create a labor union
with the workers here, by any chance?

584
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,133
No, not at all.

585
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,720
I applied because I don't have to
interact with people.

586
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm strong and a fast learner, so--

587
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,641
Stop.

588
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,310
I don't know what your story is,

589
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,105
but we don't need this kind
of prestigious education here.

590
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,275
I was there for only two years,
and I probably won't be going back.

591
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,734
So I'm a high school graduate.

592
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,946
But you were an engineering major
at Yonsei University.

593
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,741
We don't need someone as qualified as you.

594
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,909
Go find work elsewhere.

595
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,172
A man came by earlier, looking for you.

596
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,011
Me?

597
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,306
Yes. He asked
if a young man was living here.

598
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,642
He asked where you had gone,
so I said I don't know.

599
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,228
I was home alone when he came.

600
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,273
He started banging on the door
so it was frightening.

601
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,901
Please make sure this never happens again.

602
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,154
I'm sorry.

603
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,971
My mom asked you to
bring back the food containers.

604
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,350
Right. Mom gave me those,
but I forgot to bring them with me.

605
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,519
Why are moms obsessed
with food containers?

606
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,981
What are you filming?

607
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,776
A music video for our band.

608
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,235
Are you still working on it?

609
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,737
I'm editing it now.

610
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,906
Then I came up with
this cool method to film.

611
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,908
I want to test it.

612
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,166
-Rock, paper, scissors! Again!
-Rock, paper, scissors! Again!

613
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,720
-Does it taste delicious?
-Why ask?

614
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,013
You know how they taste.

615
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,892
Show me your new filming technique.

616
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,317
Hey, I'll be coming through
for ten seconds.

617
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,361
Please stand aside.

618
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,750
Nice.

619
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,385
You startled me.

620
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,680
Thank god we both had good reflexes.

621
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,975
Look at that. Two aces cross paths
and avoid getting in an accident.

622
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,775
Did you know we're in the same class?

623
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,735
No.

624
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,446
We are both in class seven.

625
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,072
My name is Moon Ji-woong.

626
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,159
Oh, so you're the pretty boy
from class seven.

627
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,995
-That's right.
-But you don't look that pretty.

628
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,580
But the things I do are.

629
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,000
All right.

630
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,668
You'll find out soon.

631
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,253
Just wait and see.

632
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,800
It's dangerous. Please walk this way.

633
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,142
-Oh my gosh!
-Ji-woong!

634
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,102
-What was all that?
-What did you say?

635
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,228
-Tell us!
-A date?

636
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,313
-Jeez.
-You're lucky!

637
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,610
You defeated Yu-rim,
so here are your belongings.

638
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,820
Thanks.

639
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,490
Great job, Hee-do.

640
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,245
As you said,
I won because I know her skills.

641
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,580
It happened once by chance.

642
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,665
By chance?

643
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,294
Hey.

644
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,881
Stop looking down on Yu-rim.

645
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,843
No one has ever won against Yu-rim
by chance.

646
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,428
Not even internationally.

647
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,431
Who do you think you are to say
you've won by chance?

648
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,643
What I meant was--

649
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,436
Don't belittle your achievement.

650
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,563
Or I'll kick you out.

651
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,315
I can't stand that kind of attitude.

652
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,733
Yes, Coach Yang.

653
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,820
Listen to me.

654
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,240
You've defeated a perfect player.

655
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,327
That means you were more perfect
in at least one way.

656
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,332
What do you think that was?

657
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,335
I'm not sure.

658
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,922
Your strength.

659
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,136
Continue to eat well, okay?

660
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:29,930
I will.

661
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,099
I have an errand for you.

662
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,726
-Take this to the broadcasting club.
-Okay.

663
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,727
And eat well!

664
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,020
Yes.

665
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,919
Hey, the fencing coach asked me to give--

666
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,213
Hey. Were you in the broadcasting club?

667
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,423
Yes.

668
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,550
Is that the team history?

669
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,136
Yes. Coach asked me to get this to you.

670
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,387
Thank you.

671
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,018
I've never been in here before.

672
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,144
Take a look around.

673
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,605
Can I?

674
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,109
What is all this?

675
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,904
They're the recordings
from the past lunch hour programs.

676
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,783
They date back to 1991.

677
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,537
It's amazing to see
a collection of living history.

678
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,624
This club deeply cares
about upholding tradition.

679
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,834
The older members are condescending jerks.

680
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,712
What? Back Yi-jin?

681
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,465
Do you know him?

682
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,675
Yes, I know him,

683
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,470
but I'm not sure
if this is the same person.

684
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,598
Let's listen and find out.

685
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,976
I've never met him,

686
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,645
but I heard that he was famous.

687
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,607
He was rich, fun, and handsome,
which is why he was so popular.

688
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,573
The season of lush greenery.

689
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,034
May is known as the month of youth.

690
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,829
-Nature's greens are about to flourish.
-Gosh.

691
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,706
This is the Yi-jin I know.

692
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,667
-Really? So you know him.
-And that resembles us.

693
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,876
This is a beautiful season,

694
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,461
-the midst of May.
-Is he good-looking?

695
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,088
His voice sure is.

696
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,757
-And an important event occurred.
-You know what?

697
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,550
-Finally…
-He sounds different.

698
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,928
…we've completed our midterms.

699
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,348
-He sounds much more cheerful.
-Some of us must be satisfied,

700
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,392
and some of us must be disappointed.

701
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,936
What matters is that this midterm

702
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,648
isn't going to shape our entire life.

703
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,026
The results don't matter.

704
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,863
What matters is that
we are done with our midterms

705
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,366
and that we'll soon have
the school festival.

706
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,078
Everyone, it's time for some fun.

707
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,331
Let's waste our time and energy a little.

708
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,877
After all, we have so much youth to spare.

709
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,671
This is our first song.

710
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,633
This is a song by
our proud school band, The Jungle Prince.

711
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,468
"Starlight."

712
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,856
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL BAND
THE JUNGLE PRINCE

713
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,162
Here I am

714
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,332
I am running on my way to you

715
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,420
Running out of breath

716
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,006
That is fine

717
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:55,427
Because I will see you soon

718
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:00,432
My heart
It's racing fast, about to explode

719
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,184
Oh my gosh.

720
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,312
Here you go.
A college acceptance gift from me.

721
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,316
-But Dad.
-Yes.

722
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,110
I thought you were going to buy me
a German car.

723
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,739
That was if you got into
Seoul National University. Did you?

724
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,657
No, I didn't get accepted.

725
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,369
So what? I'm so happy, Dad!

726
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,706
You've worked hard the past few years.
Great job, Yi-jin!

727
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,957
Thank you.

728
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,798
Let's see.

729
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,385
I'll start the car now.

730
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,529
Hey!

731
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,326
Pick up when it rings.

732
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:17,509
Last night, the government requested
a 20 billion dollar loan package from IMF.

733
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,638
Therefore, an IMF delegation group
will visit Seoul tomorrow.

734
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,104
Honey.

735
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,359
I understand the situation, but a divorce?

736
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,279
I can't do that.

737
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:38,864
It's all my fault.

738
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,284
I don't want you to suffer from my debt.

739
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,328
This is a classic sham divorce.

740
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,874
No, I don't want to. I can't.

741
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,794
Honey.

742
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,131
Let's hold out for a while.

743
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,175
I'm going to try my very best.

744
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,932
Yi-hyun.

745
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,562
We'll need to stay apart for some time.

746
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,481
Aunt will be here for you soon.

747
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,568
Stay at her place for a while, okay?

748
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,570
Okay.

749
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,160
I'll take care of the debt,

750
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,870
so don't worry too much.

751
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,163
Yes.

752
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,790
Your mom will be at Pohang,

753
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,626
and I plan to go to Gunsan.

754
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,256
Where should I go?

755
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,760
One, two, one, two.

756
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,596
One, two, three, four.

757
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,307
One, two, three, four.

758
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,517
One, two, three, four.

759
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,896
-One, two, three, four.
-Faster!

760
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,565
Halt!

761
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,319
-Back Yi-jin.
-Private Back Yi-jin.

762
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,737
-Sideline.
-Sideline.

763
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,906
Ready.

764
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,074
Run.

765
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,374
Your family called.

766
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,417
Your father's company

767
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,753
declared bankruptcy.

768
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,511
Hanbo Steel, which suffered
from financial difficulty,

769
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,097
declared bankruptcy today.

770
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,057
The company had loans amounting to…

771
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,351
Onnuri Travel,
Korea's largest travel agency,

772
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,061
has declared bankruptcy today.

773
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,688
For the first time,

774
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,940
Coryo Securities, a financial institution,
has declared bankruptcy.

775
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,276
REQUEST FOR MILITARY EXEMPTION
DUE TO LIVELIHOOD DIFFICULTIES

776
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,075
It's time for you to protect your family
instead of the country.

777
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,618
This is your country's order.

778
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,499
Can you do that?

779
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,752
I'm not sure.

780
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,726
I am unavailable right now.

781
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,394
Please leave a message.

782
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,688
Hello, this is Taegyeong Corporation.

783
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:20,567
Thank you for applying to our company.

784
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,361
I regret to inform you that
your application has been unsuccessful.

785
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,406
I wish you all the best. Thank you.

786
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,722
-Hello, sir!
-Hey.

787
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,140
Where's the part-timer?

788
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,393
I let him off early
because we weren't busy today.

789
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,479
-Why?
-I have something to give him.

790
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,730
Go over to his house.

791
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,356
Wait a second.

792
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,693
While you're at it,
can you also give him this?

793
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,861
He left it behind.

794
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,072
Where does he live?

795
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,710
The third house after turning right.

796
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,552
Tell us where your dad is!

797
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,765
Stop saying you don't know.
That doesn't solve anything!

798
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,768
I had to sell my house
because of your dad.

799
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,561
Now I have to pay rent.

800
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,315
If only your dad could help us out
just a little,

801
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,653
that would mean so much to us.

802
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,200
Please. I also don't know where he is now.

803
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,245
He didn't tell you
because he knew we would look for him.

804
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,457
Goodness.
There's nothing more we can do. Let's go.

805
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,877
He even divorced his wife on paper
so his family wouldn't suffer.

806
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,797
This family has fallen apart too.

807
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,593
Chairman Back's precious eldest son is
staying in a tiny room.

808
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,304
The chairman probably didn't have
any other choice.

809
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,015
But what about us?

810
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,269
What about our families?

811
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,150
I'll try to get a job as soon as possible

812
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,818
and pay you back little by little.

813
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,111
It will take you forever

814
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,448
to pay us back with your meager salary!

815
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,117
My child is in senior year,

816
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,078
studying day and night
to go to a good university.

817
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,164
My mouth goes dry seeing him study

818
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,959
because I don't have any money
to pay for his tuition.

819
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,422
A part of me is hoping that
he fails the exam this year

820
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,299
so that there's an extra year

821
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,718
to make things better.

822
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,722
I am a father who is wishing

823
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,225
for his child to fail.
That's how pathetic I am.

824
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,103
And you…

825
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,816
How can you go to bed every night
as if nothing's ever happened!

826
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,526
Answer me!

827
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,944
Hey, stop it.

828
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,863
What's the point? He's a kid.

829
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,031
I am so sorry.

830
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,158
Apologizing to me doesn't cut it.

831
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,911
Gosh, stop doing this to him.

832
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,038
Come on. Let him go.

833
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,333
What should I do?

834
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,464
There's nothing I can do now.
I'm so sorry.

835
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,094
But I promise.

836
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,973
I will never be happy again.

837
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:49,025
I'll spend my entire life thinking
of all the pain you're going through.

838
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,576
I am truly, deeply sorry.

839
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,957
I will never be happy,
not even for a single moment.

840
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,834
I am terribly sorry.

841
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,971
Come on, let's go.

842
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,015
There's no point in talking to him.
Let's go.

843
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,267
This way. Let's go.

844
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,686
Staying here doesn't do anything.

845
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,025
Gosh, let's go.

846
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,335
I'm here…

847
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,009
with money

848
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,638
to give back to you.

849
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,184
I have 3,000 won for the comic book.

850
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,526
Can you give me something else in return?

851
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,533
As you can see,
I am tired of talking about money.

852
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,710
COVER LETTER
MY DREAM IS

853
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,926
SUPERMARKET

854
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,386
Here you go. Enjoy.

855
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,845
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

856
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,684
Here.

857
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,728
You have 2,000 won left.

858
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,773
Buy me another one next time.

859
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,358
Sure.

860
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,194
Oh, this is for you.

861
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,281
The book rental shop owner
asked me to give this back to you.

862
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,703
Throw it in the trash for me.

863
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,185
There were only three words on the paper.

864
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:13,896
"My dream is."

865
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,524
Tell me what comes next.

866
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,402
I was going to throw it away
since I didn't know what to say.

867
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,196
It didn't feel right
to start off with my dream.

868
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,407
You don't have a dream?

869
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,243
What is your dream?

870
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,369
Me?

871
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,955
I have a very big dream.

872
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,334
I want to become Yu-rim's rival.

873
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,009
I once had a big dream.

874
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,724
My dream was to be up there in space.

875
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,809
In space?

876
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,521
That's right. I wanted to work at NASA.

877
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,816
I see.

878
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,998
You have no idea what it is.

879
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,459
I do!

880
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:21,672
It's where you build spaceships
and go to space.

881
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,591
That's a part of it.

882
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,014
But isn't NASA in the US?

883
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,268
Were you good at English too?

884
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,396
You must have been a top student.

885
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,275
You're also good at solving
math problems and lecturing others.

886
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,276
You're smart.

887
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,323
That must be why you were
so popular back in high school,

888
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,741
Yi-jin?

889
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,286
I was popular?

890
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,289
You went to my school.

891
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,669
A friend at the broadcasting club
said that you were famous and popular.

892
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,507
I was there yesterday,
and I listened to your radio program.

893
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,134
Why did you do that?

894
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,388
I wasn't sure
if you were the same Yi-jin on the tape.

895
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,601
But you sounded like a different person.

896
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:24,235
You didn't sound like the Yi-jin
who promised to never be happy again.

897
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,614
You were a totally different person.

898
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,169
Did I speak too recklessly?

899
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,966
I like the fact

900
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,386
that you're so reckless.

901
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,271
Looking at you reminds me of myself.

902
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,613
You're like me at 18.

903
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,626
Do you want to turn back time?

904
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,128
Desperately.

905
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,010
What do you miss the most?

906
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,888
You know,

907
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,267
I miss the things I used to worry about.

908
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,521
It was about having too much homework,

909
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,274
scary seniors at the broadcasting club,

910
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,070
in case I make a mistake on stage
during the festival,

911
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,199
or what if the girl I liked

912
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,785
didn't like me back.

913
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,870
Worries like that.

914
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,775
Come with me for a second.

915
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,194
But it's getting late.

916
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,656
Hurry up.
You said you liked me for being reckless.

917
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,868
Let's go!

918
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,419
Why are we here?

919
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,255
This isn't your school anymore.

920
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,590
This isn't allowed at Tae Yang High,

921
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,843
but it is here.

922
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,387
What is it?

923
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,974
It's something exciting and uplifting.

924
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,789
Now watch.

925
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,175
What do you think? Isn't this fun?

926
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,218
Does it cheer you up?

927
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,847
I feel so happy when I watch this.

928
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:56,906
What is it?

929
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:58,741
Don't you like it?

930
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,829
I think one isn't enough to make me happy.

931
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:32,024
Way to go, grown-up!
You've taken this to a whole new level.

932
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,111
I had never thought of
turning on all the faucets.

933
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:37,988
Now I'm a bit excited.

934
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,616
Only a bit? This is way more than that!

935
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,910
I feel elated!

936
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,403
I'm going to get you!

937
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,805
Hey!

938
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,307
What are you doing here?

939
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,186
I'm sorry, sir.

940
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:53,981
We're sorry!

941
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:57,026
Stop apologizing. We've got to run!

942
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,528
Stop right there!

943
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,780
Hey, stop there!

944
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,566
Let's stop running.

945
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,244
Oh my gosh, this is hilarious.

946
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,497
Why did you keep running
when we could have stopped?

947
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,582
Look at us.
We are both soaked and panting.

948
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,252
Still, it was fun!

949
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,005
Let's do fun things together
from time to time.

950
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,842
-What if I don't want to?
-Still, you have to.

951
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,261
You have no choice.

952
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:07,721
Why?

953
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:11,267
Remember what you said
to those men earlier today?

954
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,936
You said you'll never be happy again.

955
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,980
I'm against that.

956
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:19,275
The times took everything from you.
You can't give up on happiness.

957
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:23,070
But you already gave your word to them.

958
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,739
How about this?

959
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,827
From now on, when you hang out with me,

960
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,247
you can be happy and keep it a secret.

961
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,260
When it's just us two,

962
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,888
let's be happy when we're together,
albeit temporarily.

963
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,684
So this can be our little secret.

964
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,305
Whether it was from running
or because I was excited,

965
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,849
I was out of breath.

966
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:39,480
The green leaves rustled
from the blowing wind.

967
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,109
It was the peak of summer.

968
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,928
What's your relationship with him?

969
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,221
I don't know.

970
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,307
You're still waiting for your first love.

971
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,558
Isn't that exciting?

972
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,019
Guys, let go.

973
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,021
I'm begging you. I'm sorry.

974
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,607
Hee-do, the times have presented
an opportunity for you.

975
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:26,402
I'll watch the counter,
so stay there and hide.

976
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,446
-I don't like her.
-You're being childish.

977
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,033
I've failed to keep the right distance
with everyone I Iike.

978
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,620
That's exactly how much
I can loathe you from now on.

979
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,665
What would have happened
if you hurt your ankle?

980
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,709
How long have you been running
to have ended up here?

981
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:52,928
