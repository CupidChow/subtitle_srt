00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,450
Dear Reporter Back Yi-jin.
How have you been?

2
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,787
New York is still filled with grief,

3
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,206
but time goes by
as if nothing ever happened.

4
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,335
My colleague could not come back
in the end.

5
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:30,799
But thanks to you,
many have expressed their condolences

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,468
and said that he will be remembered.

7
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,845
Thank you for everything.

8
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,224
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,480
UBS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT APPLICATION FORM

10
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,613
FINALE

11
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,532
Take a look at the printed materials
and do a fact-check.

12
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,034
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,459
APPOINTMENT TO NEW YORK OFFICE
BACK YI-JIN

14
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,797
Congratulations.

15
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,968
I feel much at ease now
since this position will be in good hands.

16
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,263
Thank you.

17
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,183
I had not expected this.

18
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,768
You've had a hard time.

19
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,062
Will you be okay?

20
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,939
Well…

21
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,359
maybe it's because
I still have a lot to learn.

22
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,903
I still have hope for this world.

23
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,112
That's good.

24
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,907
Have you told your family?

25
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,784
What about your girlfriend?

26
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
I haven't told anyone yet.

27
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,039
You didn't think you'd get it.

28
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,643
HEE-DO

29
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,528
Hee-do.

30
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,155
It's me.

31
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
You're up early.

32
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,035
Yes. Have you had dinner?

33
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,954
Yes, I had it earlier.

34
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,250
I think I'll be back in Korea next month.

35
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,961
Really?

36
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,715
I won't be here though.

37
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,137
Do you have a match?

38
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,638
Yes.

39
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,267
The Grand Prix and the World Championship
are happening back-to-back,

40
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,312
so I'll be in Europe
for more than a month.

41
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,188
I see.

42
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,861
Hee-do.

43
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,035
Actually…

44
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,123
I applied for a correspondent position
in New York and I got it.

45
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,962
That…

46
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,717
That's great news.

47
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,262
I'm happy for you.

48
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,100
I'll be in Korea
to wrap things up because of that.

49
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,522
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

50
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
Yi-jin.

51
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,824
I want you…

52
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,165
to stop feeling sorry for me.

53
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,340
I'll hang up now.

54
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,777
2 MONTHS LATER

55
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,946
One, two, three.

56
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,698
One, two, three.

57
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,368
Yes, very good.

58
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,913
Thank you. So you're really going to
post this on Moonstreet?

59
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,207
I go on that website like every day.

60
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,543
Thanks. It'll be there tomorrow,
so you can check.

61
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,502
All right.

62
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,048
It feels surreal to meet you in person.

63
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,508
I'm a huge fan.

64
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,884
-Really?
-Yes.

65
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,764
Real recognize real.

66
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay. I'll check tomorrow then. Take care.

67
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,025
Can you take a picture of me, too?

68
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,409
Am I dreaming?

69
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,957
Come on. That's not going to hurt
even if you're awake.

70
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,715
Moon Ji-woong!

71
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,265
This isn't a dream.

72
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,519
What is this?

73
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,688
Weren't you coming next week?

74
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,983
I came straight to Korea
without stopping over in Russia.

75
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,112
Seung-wan told me you were here,
so here I am.

76
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,156
Do you have some time today?

77
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,700
Of course. My time is all yours.

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,704
Do you want to have dinner at my house?

79
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,747
At your house?

80
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,547
Ji-woong.

81
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,466
What do your parents do?

82
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,385
Mom is a head nurse
at a teaching hospital.

83
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,598
As for my dad…
My parents got divorced when I was young,

84
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,266
so I'm not in touch with him.

85
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,569
It must have been hard for you as a child.

86
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,488
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,073
You should be good to your mom.

88
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,701
I'm sure she went through a lot
to raise you on her own.

89
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,040
Yes, I should.

90
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,379
But now I'm doing my best for Yu-rim

91
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,547
so I feel bad for her.

92
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,008
He says things so nicely.

93
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,635
He's also a nice person.

94
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,846
All right. Gosh.

95
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,391
Is Hee-do back in Korea too?

96
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,850
You two had the same schedule.

97
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,978
Yes, she's coming tomorrow.

98
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,286
Yes, I've just arrived.

99
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,246
Yes.

100
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,624
Right. Yes, I think I have the file.

101
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,626
Yes.

102
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,920
Okay. I'll look for it
and get back to you.

103
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,130
Yes.

104
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,049
Sorry sir, but could you pull over
for a minute?

105
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,010
I have to get my laptop from my suitcase.

106
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,094
Sure.

107
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,262
Thank you.

108
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,796
There must have been a mix-up
because they look the same.

109
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,882
Did she leave it here?

110
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,301
Yes. She told us your name

111
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,428
and that you'll come back to get it.

112
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,182
To be honest, the airline isn't at fault
for what has happened.

113
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,268
It seems like you know each other.
Do you want to call her?

114
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,606
Or would you like for us to call her?

115
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,196
I'll leave it here. Please let her know.

116
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,482
Yi-jin.

117
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
Why are you leaving like that?

118
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,834
Because…

119
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,090
I think I know what this means.

120
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,639
Then you should have also left it there.

121
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,979
I couldn't.

122
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,699
Did I mess this up?

123
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,576
Neither of us is at fault here.

124
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,538
And yet we've grown this much apart.

125
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,711
It just happened.

126
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,384
I thought you wouldn't want me
to drop everything…

127
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,473
and come back to Korea.

128
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,975
No, I don't.

129
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,102
Then what should I have done?

130
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,395
Yi-jin.

131
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,565
I'm not trying to say

132
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,068
who is right or wrong.

133
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,197
It's just that…

134
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,827
this love isn't supporting me anymore.

135
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,666
We're making things difficult
by blaming one another.

136
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,795
I want it to stop.

137
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,259
You and I…

138
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,141
both mean a lot to each other.

139
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,234
Can you do that?

140
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,868
Breaking up, I mean.

141
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,167
We were already in the middle of it.

142
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,963
We won't be able to avoid each other.

143
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,633
We have a lot of mutual contacts

144
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,552
and we live in the same area.

145
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,809
Let's say hello then.

146
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,481
This is where
I met you for the first time.

147
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,574
And this is where we end.

148
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,709
I guess so.

149
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,259
I should go.

150
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,537
Back Yi-jin speaking--

151
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,211
I'm sorry. I will look for it right away.

152
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,588
Yes, sorry. I'll get back to you shortly.

153
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,673
Yes.

154
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,128
Shut the door, check.

155
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,635
Oh my gosh! Look who's here!

156
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,679
Sir.

157
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,348
When did you get back?

158
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,393
A few days ago.
Where are you coming back from so early?

159
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,939
I went out yesterday
and came back in today.

160
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,567
It's so good to see you

161
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,903
after such a long time, sir.

162
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,905
Sir!

163
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:18,328
Sir, you look sharp.

164
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,374
Sir, it was nice meeting you.

165
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,170
You're drunk. You should go in.

166
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,215
Right. Did you know that Hee-do
and Yu-rim are also back in Korea?

167
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,593
How long has it been?

168
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,636
We should get together.

169
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,348
We should all have a drink, sir.

170
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,350
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

171
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,353
So you have
more than 3,000 visitors a day?

172
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,272
Yes, that's just the start.

173
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,567
So many people are interested in fashion.

174
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,986
What are your plans
when the website becomes famous?

175
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,530
I'll try selling clothes
since they come to look at clothes.

176
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,032
You're awesome.

177
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,034
Well…

178
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,244
it's just a dream for now.

179
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,331
It might not go as planned.

180
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,459
We sound like grown-ups
talking about these kinds of things.

181
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,670
We used to put
watermelon seeds on our faces.

182
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,759
You're right. Now that I think about it,
Yi-jin really put up with us.

183
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,847
Is Yi-jin not coming today?

184
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,349
I asked him to come.

185
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,603
He sent a text.

186
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,771
He says he can't come.

187
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,064
Why did he text you?

188
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,909
We broke up.

189
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,253
I was busy with my matches,

190
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,671
and Yi-jin…

191
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,508
is now a New York correspondent.

192
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,801
Really?

193
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,013
Then will he be living in New York?

194
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,390
Yes.

195
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,894
With all that happening,

196
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,897
it was hard to set up any plans.

197
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,818
I couldn't see our future.

198
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,739
I've never imagined you two breaking up.

199
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,869
After a certain point,
I could just picture that happening.

200
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,917
What I had imagined
eventually became reality.

201
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,008
You did good.

202
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,136
That must have been tough.

203
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,890
So the five of us
can't get together anymore?

204
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,187
That's why dating
within a friend group can break the group.

205
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,731
-What about you two?
-We are not breaking up.

206
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,067
We won't, for the sake of this group.

207
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,445
Cut it out, and fill up your glasses.

208
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,363
Mine is already full.

209
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,783
Yu-rim, can you
get my cell phone from my bag?

210
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,410
Yes.

211
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,460
So is there no chance
of you two getting back together?

212
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,170
We're done for good.

213
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,426
I guess your cell phone
is done for as well.

214
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,431
This is the latest model.

215
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,391
It features a 40-chord polyphonic ringtone
with a color display.

216
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,101
-Isn't it awesome?
-It is.

217
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,562
I will take that.

218
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,856
-Really? Just like that?
-Yes.

219
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:39,529
All right then.
The plan we would like to recommend…

220
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,826
Miss, I see you're on a plan for couples.

221
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
You're keeping that. Right?

222
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,292
No, please cancel that.

223
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,004
To do so,
you need consent from the other party.

224
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,925
I can't cancel it on my own?

225
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,551
That's nonsense.

226
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,806
You opted to cancel upon mutual consent
when you had signed up for this plan.

227
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,149
Can I please borrow your phone?

228
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,456
I need your consent
to cancel our phone plan.

229
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,419
We'd have to do it at some point.

230
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,138
So tell me.
Do you both need more time to think?

231
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,514
For about four weeks?

232
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,600
That's okay.

233
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,811
All right.

234
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,857
Once you cancel this plan,
you will have to sign up for a new line,

235
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,610
and free unlimited calls
between you two will no longer apply.

236
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,945
Do you both agree?

237
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,197
Yes.

238
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,076
Yes.

239
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,872
Okay. Then please sign here.

240
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,499
Once you sign, you can't take it back.

241
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,335
Are we doing the right thing?

242
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,224
Yes, we are.

243
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,770
I've thought about it for six months.

244
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,940
You've been thinking without me.

245
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,902
You've been thinking by yourself.

246
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,324
I know.

247
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,829
What have you been doing for six months?

248
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,124
What were you doing
while we were growing apart?

249
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,959
You pretended not to know.

250
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,002
No, I didn't.

251
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,965
I just didn't have anything to say.

252
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,591
Why not?

253
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,927
I didn't want to drag you into
what I was going through.

254
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,096
Is that all?

255
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,934
"Is that all"?

256
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,105
Hee-do, I…

257
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,030
I'm sorry if I upset you.

258
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,244
But there I was,
doing my best to hang in there.

259
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,165
Dead bodies were recovered
from the site every single day.

260
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,500
I met with
bereaved families and survivors…

261
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,256
Every day I met people who were suffering.

262
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,051
The city was like a living hell.

263
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,680
Another terrorist attack
could happen anytime.

264
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,266
It broke me down.

265
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,853
I missed you,
but I couldn't go to see you.

266
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,356
People were dying before my eyes.

267
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,693
Being able to
even miss someone felt like a luxury.

268
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,537
Everything was new to me.

269
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,500
And frankly, your support was burdensome.

270
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,630
I couldn't cheer up no matter what.

271
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,300
But you were rooting for me,

272
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,263
so I wanted to show you
that I could do well.

273
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,811
I didn't want to complain.

274
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,817
Weren't you listening to me at all?

275
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,155
I said I was going to share
everything that's yours.

276
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,742
Everything, including your sadness,
frustration, and happiness.

277
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,663
When you went AWOL
because of Yu-rim going to Russia,

278
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,582
I said it right here
as we wiped the graffiti off the wall.

279
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,835
How could I,
when that doesn't change anything?

280
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,966
I'd have done it
if I could solve my issues

281
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,635
by sharing them with you
and making you worry with me.

282
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,928
But that's not it!

283
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,807
Two people will then have to struggle
instead of one.

284
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,225
Is that what you want?

285
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,644
Is it?

286
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,400
Do you think I could have chosen
to bring you down with me?

287
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,571
You're right.

288
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,118
And that is why we are breaking up.

289
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,705
Can't you see?

290
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,500
We're lovers only during the good times,

291
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,169
and a burden to each other
in the bad times.

292
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,036
"Don't hurt yourself."

293
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,790
"I'm protecting an athlete."

294
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,759
Our relationship should have stopped
at that level.

295
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,182
I could root for you
even when you disappeared without a word…

296
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,104
and I could reach you
even though we were apart.

297
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,401
Then I wanted to have you.

298
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,036
But now that I have,
we have all these problems.

299
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,832
I think…

300
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,127
we shouldn't have been
in this kind of love.

301
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,880
We didn't know how

302
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,508
but we went ahead with it anyway.

303
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,385
Don't jump to conclusions.

304
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,680
We were fine before I went to the US.

305
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,685
Is that what you really think?

306
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,654
Maybe I'm the one with issues.

307
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,992
When Mom didn't show up for Dad's funeral,
there was a news flash.

308
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,082
"So when there's a news flash
she will even skip her husband's funeral."

309
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,377
I had to teach myself things like that.

310
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,130
Because my mom never explained.

311
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,178
Yet here I am, dating someone like her.

312
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,143
Waiting, then being let down,
and eventually giving up.

313
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,730
That's what I have been doing all my life.

314
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,776
And you're making me do that again.

315
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,492
I don't want that for my future, Yi-jin.

316
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,001
Don't you have any room
to try and understand me?

317
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,545
You're not trying to understand me either.

318
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,256
Understand?

319
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,509
Is that too much to ask for?

320
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,178
Did you ever really love me?

321
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,683
Watch what you say.

322
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,395
You once said
you liked me for being reckless!

323
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,490
All right.

324
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,702
Let's end this. I guess that's right.

325
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,457
What more can we do
when you're disappointed in me?

326
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,876
You better not regret it though.

327
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,963
Is that a promise?
Forget it if that's your advice.

328
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,632
Hee-do, really?

329
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,925
I know.

330
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,302
I guess this is how we end.

331
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,932
I should go.

332
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,937
Hee-do.

333
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,485
Na Hee-do!

334
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,419
-One, two!
-One, two!

335
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,963
-One, two!
-One, two!

336
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,131
-One, two!
-One, two!

337
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,304
That's not how you do it.

338
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,764
Hey, Hee-do. You should try.

339
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,642
Should I show you?

340
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,695
-Stop it.
-Let it go.

341
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,072
-Stop taking my stuff.
-Just this once.

342
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,824
That's mine. I'm serious.

343
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,410
-Look, mine's gone.
-Why do you always do this?

344
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,995
-Highlights?
-Coach will scold you.

345
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,497
Let's hide it.

346
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,582
Highlights?

347
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,501
-Would she still notice?
-That's so old-fashioned.

348
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,836
Prêtes? Allez.

349
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,469
Hey, that hurt a lot.

350
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm sorry. I lost control for a second.

351
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,650
What's the matter?

352
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,697
-Oh my goodness.
-Na Hee-do!

353
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,325
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong with her?

354
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,337
Mom.

355
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,054
Are you all right?
Tell me, how are you feeling?

356
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,221
Yes.

357
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,559
Where am I?

358
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,313
The hospital?

359
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,400
You passed out.

360
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,152
What happened?

361
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,738
We ran tests and there's nothing wrong.
What's going on?

362
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,281
I have no idea.

363
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,242
This is ridiculous.

364
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,538
How can you laugh right now?

365
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,168
What is it? Are you stressed?

366
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,545
Maybe.

367
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,549
I…

368
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,429
broke up.

369
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,266
Why I ought to…

370
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,686
Should I get Yi-jin to come?

371
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,064
-Is this because you miss him?
-That's not it. Stop.

372
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,941
You've been fine
no matter how hard you trained.

373
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,442
But you passed out due to a breakup?

374
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,320
Are you sure you can do this?

375
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,618
I have to.

376
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,163
It's the right thing to do.

377
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,960
But Mom…

378
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,089
I don't think…

379
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,972
we should have ended like that.

380
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,771
What did you do
while we were growing apart?

381
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,773
You pretended not to know.

382
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,943
Can't you see?

383
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,321
We're lovers only during the good times,

384
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,949
and a burden to each other
in the bad times.

385
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,301
Yi-jin.

386
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,929
I didn't mean to say those things.

387
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,522
What I really wanted to tell you…

388
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,278
wasn't anything like that at all.

389
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,241
This stop is Seon Jung Girls' High School.

390
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,981
My diary.

391
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,445
Sorry, sir. Could you give me a minute?

392
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,783
I'm sorry. Please wait a moment.

393
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,123
Thank you!

394
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,336
In case someone finds it and reaches out,

395
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,090
can you please give me a call?

396
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,508
I'm sorry.

397
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,592
Yes.

398
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,969
Thank you.

399
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,693
It's a congratulatory gift.

400
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,237
Is it a pencil case?

401
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,157
Hey, that's too lame
for a New Yorker to use.

402
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,366
Thank you.

403
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,911
Back Yi-jin, you're making history in UBS

404
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,538
becoming a correspondent at your age.

405
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,542
Who would want
to go to New York these days?

406
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,835
But why are you going?

407
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,047
Because it feels as if

408
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,718
I could become
a real reporter if I go to New York.

409
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,305
I hope I can be someone
that I can approve of.

410
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,142
You're growing up so fast.

411
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,896
Right. Have you met the trainee reporters?

412
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,813
No.

413
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,150
They reminded me of you
when you first came.

414
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,695
Call me before you fly out.

415
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,783
Thanks for the present, Jung-hyuk.

416
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,814
Are you a trainee?

417
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,776
I'm trainee reporter Shin Jun-hyeok.

418
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,320
I'm Back Yi-jin from the Local News.
Nice to meet you. I don't think we've met.

419
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,698
No, sir. I saw you on the news
covering the September 11 attacks.

420
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,783
Why are you crying?

421
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,661
Oh, it's nothing.

422
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,916
Did you lie about securing a landline
and get caught using a cell phone?

423
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,418
How did you know?

424
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,003
You look like you'd do that.

425
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,968
Seriously, there were no phones available.

426
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,804
I couldn't find any payphones either.

427
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,848
I'm so pathetic.
How will I ever become a reporter?

428
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,560
But you're trying your best.

429
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,231
I'm doing my best,
but the results aren't great.

430
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,650
I get told off every day.

431
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,446
In some moments,

432
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,241
we're always doing our best…

433
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,870
but all of that is just practice.

434
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,460
That sounds too sad.

435
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,010
It is.

436
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,361
Back Yi-jin!

437
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:16,038
Jeez, you're almost done packing.
You're leaving tomorrow morning, right?

438
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,123
Yes.

439
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,794
I'll be out early tomorrow
so I came by to say goodbye.

440
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,711
I see.

441
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,593
Gosh. Why do I feel so sad?

442
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,346
Same here.

443
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,976
It was nice staying here, thanks to you.

444
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,854
Thank you for looking after me.

445
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,232
Come to visit when you're in Korea.

446
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,112
I'm sad that you're leaving,
but I can't ask you to live here again.

447
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,407
I hope you get a nicer place

448
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,659
and live a great life.

449
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:59,623
Thank you. Please stay healthy, ma'am.

450
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,043
Gosh, I'll get going.

451
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,838
I'll drop by to see you on my way out.

452
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,006
All right.

453
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,271
FROM: KIM EUN-SU
TO: BACK YI-JIN

454
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,340
BACK YI-JIN'S
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

455
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,803
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

456
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,972
Why do you have two?

457
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,850
I thought I lost it, so I got it reissued.

458
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,812
-Then I found my old one inside a pocket.
-Really? Then give me one.

459
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,189
What for?

460
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,358
Nothing. Just for a keepsake.

461
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,527
Because I love you.

462
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,054
We couldn't find the time
to see each other again this week.

463
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,265
Darn it, boot camp!

464
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,976
A surprise in the middle of the night.

465
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,104
We got matching travel bags
at the night market.

466
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,607
It's going to be our first trip together,
just the two of us.

467
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,192
I'm looking forward to it.

468
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,948
COMPARED TO THE DAYS WE HAVE AHEAD OF US,
600 DAYS IS JUST AN INSTANT

469
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,333
THANK YOU AND SORRY, AND I LOVE YOU

470
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,880
Did you go straight back home that day?

471
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,552
Yes, I did.

472
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:24,059
Please give me the strength
to not be emotionally exhausted.

473
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,900
I'm alone again on our anniversary.

474
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,195
But I'm fine. We understand each other.

475
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,032
I can't tell since when,
but you sound more genuine

476
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,743
in your apologies
than when you say you love me.

477
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:45,372
I know how much pain
you're in growing up, Yi-jin. Cheer up.

478
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,043
My support isn't reaching him anymore.

479
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,806
Yi-jin. I didn't mean to say those things.

480
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,101
What I really wanted to tell you

481
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,188
wasn't anything like that at all.

482
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:40,135
GOOD LUCK TO OUR NATIONAL TEAM

483
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:45,474
TAEREUNG NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

484
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,410
Hee-do, do you know that
Yi-jin is moving out today?

485
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,114
BUS STOP

486
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:48,120
Everything was new to me.
And frankly, your support was burdensome.

487
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,456
I couldn't cheer up no matter what.

488
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,876
Don't you have any room
to try and understand me?

489
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,547
What more can we do
when you're disappointed in me?

490
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,549
You better not regret it though.

491
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:15,189
That can't be how we end our relationship.

492
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,817
We shouldn't have been
in this kind of love.

493
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,113
I don't want that for my future, Yi-jin.

494
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,534
I can't let you go
after saying such hurtful things.

495
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,210
Na Hee-do!

496
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,961
Back Yi-jin!

497
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,775
YI-JIN

498
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,560
You weren't at home.

499
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,815
I was out walking

500
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,193
and saw this here.

501
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,987
It looked like yours.

502
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,785
You left this here unattended.
Someone could have taken it.

503
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,669
Do you have back-to-back competitions?

504
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,634
Don't get sick.

505
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,346
Don't get hurt.

506
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,687
You shouldn't rely so much on alcohol.

507
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,524
Get therapy if you're having a hard time.

508
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,194
I heard it's easy
to get that kind of help in the US.

509
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,240
All right.

510
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,204
Your shoelace.

511
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,801
It's from running around.

512
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,765
And I knew you would get mad
if I wore slippers.

513
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,163
Let's not put ourselves through
too much hard time.

514
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,841
Goodbye, Yi-jin.

515
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,934
Take care, Hee-do.

516
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,759
We did it.

517
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,553
We've reached the World Cup semi-finals…

518
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,180
The Cheonggyecheon restoration project
was finally launched today…

519
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,766
Typhoon Maemi has struck
the southern coast…

520
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,726
The era of high-speed trains is here.

521
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,937
The film, The Host,
reached ten million viewers…

522
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,273
A fire broke out at Sungnyemun,
the first national treasure of Korea…

523
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,525
The first Black president Obama…

524
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,526
7 YEARS LATER

525
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,528
We don't have any candidates.

526
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,906
Jang Yeon-seo is great,
but her pronunciation isn't good.

527
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,450
And her voice isn't like a news anchor.

528
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,036
Any thoughts?

529
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,374
Did you ask me to join in discussing
who my successor will be?

530
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,710
Then don't quit. Continue as our anchor.

531
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,337
Why do you think we're in this meeting?

532
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,883
I'm old now. I need to get some rest.

533
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,219
That's why I'm saying, get some rest
after choosing your replacement.

534
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,346
You should do that much at least.

535
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,022
Are you willing to accept
whoever I recommend?

536
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,815
Who do you have in mind? Tell me.

537
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,150
Back Yi-jin.

538
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,361
Back Yi-jin?

539
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,448
Isn't he too young?

540
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,449
That's why.

541
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,410
He's young
but he's been with us for ten years.

542
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:29,080
But the news has to be
something the viewers can rely on.

543
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,750
Why wouldn't he be reliable?
He's got the looks.

544
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:37,088
And isn't the goal of this reform
to open a new era with a new face?

545
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,882
Innovation was the keyword.

546
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:43,011
A couple of days ago,
Obama became the president at age 47.

547
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:48,683
Do you have a better card to play
than youth to highlight innovation?

548
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,774
-Be careful.
-Please hand it over here.

549
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,192
-Yes.
-I'll put it here.

550
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,031
Yi-jin!

551
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,914
-You're here.
-Hey.

552
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,168
This is such a nice, quiet neighborhood.

553
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,878
And there's a big park.

554
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,589
I'm glad you like it.

555
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,424
Thanks for all the hard work, Yi-jin.

556
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,054
You must have gone through a lot.

557
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,015
It's very small compared to our old place.

558
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,560
What's important is
that our family is back together.

559
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,981
For the first time in 11 years.

560
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,526
I'm so sorry

561
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,195
and thank you.

562
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,575
So, did you buy the house?

563
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,494
I took out a loan.

564
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,997
That means…

565
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,375
-you've bought this place.
-Mom.

566
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,170
When are you starting work?

567
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,256
From tomorrow.

568
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:20,817
All right.

569
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,112
Starting today, I'll be hosting UBS News.

570
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,864
I'm anchor Back Yi-jin.

571
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,198
Nice to meet you all.

572
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,619
-Welcome!
-Awesome!

573
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,628
Congratulations. I'm counting on you.

574
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,969
How do you feel?

575
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,513
I wanted to be like you.

576
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:55,769
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to dream.

577
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:06,446
Five, four, three, two, one.

578
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,532
Good evening.

579
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,745
I'm anchor Back Yi-jin, who will be
the host for UBS News starting today.

580
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,208
UBS News will continue
to deliver fast and accurate news.

581
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:22,837
We will try our best to deliver news
from a unique perspective

582
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,006
to look into the core of the issues.

583
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,384
Our first news.

584
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,764
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL
FENCING COACH YANG CHAN-MI

585
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,602
Did you turn down the national team
coach position to come back here?

586
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,647
The national team is boring.

587
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,567
Everyone, including you, is grown up
and won't listen to a word I say.

588
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:50,573
But it's fun here
and I have a lot of good memories.

589
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,248
Coach.

590
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,085
I'm thinking of retiring

591
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,004
once I'm back from San Francisco.

592
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,051
Why?

593
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,638
I'm tired of competing.

594
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,974
I've been in this field for over 20 years.

595
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,601
I know everyone

596
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,771
and the stories behind each of them.

597
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,773
Winning isn't as much fun

598
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,193
as it used to be anymore.

599
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,655
When an athlete retires…

600
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,452
It feels amazing.
You don't have to train anymore.

601
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,873
That does sound great.

602
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,918
You have the whip hand,
so what are you worrying about?

603
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,215
Let's decide by odds or evens

604
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,719
whether you will retire
after your match in San Francisco.

605
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,054
All right? Retire when it's odds.

606
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,307
Continue when it's evens.

607
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:00,977
Okay.

608
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,158
I'm not going to show you.

609
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,118
Why not?

610
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,453
Don't you remember?

611
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,788
When you came begging me to accept you,

612
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,500
we played this game
and you lost all three times.

613
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,293
And yet, I still took you in.

614
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,630
The answer isn't here.

615
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,715
It's up to one's will.

616
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,635
How much you were willing
to transfer schools.

617
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,222
And how much I was willing to accept that.

618
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,559
You idiot.

619
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,441
INTO THE WATER

620
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,652
Assistant director!

621
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,946
Hey, Ji Seung-wan!

622
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,156
Where are you?

623
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,242
-Set up the spinning wheel!
-Ma'am.

624
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,620
Ma'am! A message.
They need the spinning wheel.

625
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,164
I'm on my way!

626
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,416
INTO THE WATER, SLEEPING OUTSIDE,
NO FOOD FOR 24 HOURS

627
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,339
I heard you only got
two hours of sleep last night.

628
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,258
That's how it is for variety shows.

629
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:17,220
It's only fun watching them on TV
and not for people making them.

630
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,641
Hold on a minute.

631
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,725
Okay.

632
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,314
Yes, Mom.

633
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,989
Okay.

634
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,366
Don't cry, Mom.

635
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,036
I'll be right there.

636
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,999
FROM ANCHOR BACK YI-JIN
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

637
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,711
FROM MOONSTREET CEO MOON JI-WOONG

638
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:53,423
FENCING CLUB CEO KO YU-RIM
NA HEE-DO

639
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:58,386
Look at that. They've sent flowers
but no one showed up.

640
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,182
We can hear you.

641
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,687
What?

642
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,695
Who do we have here!
Our national team members.

643
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,614
It's been so long, ma'am.

644
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,240
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

645
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:23,369
Auntie, can't you see me?
It's also been a while for us.

646
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,580
Gosh. Thank you all for coming.

647
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,957
-How have you been?
-Good.

648
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:28,958
Are you okay?

649
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,962
Now we only get to see each other
when someone passes away.

650
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,883
How are you holding up?

651
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,304
He was in bed for two years.

652
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,764
I guess he got tired of it.

653
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,851
My dad is giving me some time off
so that I can take some rest.

654
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,227
I only get two hours of sleep these days.

655
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,897
Two hours? That's terrible.

656
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,024
You should take care of
your parent's health.

657
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,611
I can't believe we're at this age.

658
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:03,743
But is it okay to come to a funeral
when you have your wedding soon?

659
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,286
It's us. Don't worry about it.

660
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,874
If we called off the wedding off because
of a jinx, then we weren't meant to be.

661
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,835
How could you say that so easily?

662
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,879
You haven't even proposed to me yet.

663
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,673
So there's nothing wrong with that.

664
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,555
Breaking an engagement is
less complicated than getting a divorce.

665
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,182
Keep that in mind.

666
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,392
Hey.

667
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,187
It sounds serious
since it's coming from a married person.

668
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,356
I'm totally serious.

669
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:36,526
You never know
until you actually walk down the aisle.

670
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,444
That's true.

671
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,365
Right. When are you flying out
to San Francisco?

672
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,617
In two weeks.

673
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,121
-You will win the gold medal, right?
-Then who else will?

674
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,164
Ko Yu-rim isn't there anymore.

675
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,208
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

676
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,376
Stop being so arrogant.

677
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,675
DONATION BOX

678
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,223
OH JUN-SEOK, LEE GYEONG-MIN
KO YU-RIM, MOON JI-WOONG, NA HEE-DO

679
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,612
Sir?

680
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,658
How long has it been?

681
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,994
I only get to see you on TV.

682
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,328
It's been a long time.

683
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,039
I see the others already came by.

684
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,709
Yes, you are a step behind.

685
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:40,089
Mom would be happy to see you here,

686
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,634
but she is asleep now.
She's totally exhausted.

687
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,806
Thank you for coming.

688
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,685
Look at the time.
Did you come straight after the news?

689
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,061
Yes.

690
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,856
Right, I heard that you are with LBS.

691
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,232
How is it going?

692
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,527
-Entertainment is tough, right?
-Yes.

693
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,572
Life isn't fun at all.

694
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,619
Gosh, you said the exact same thing
ten years ago.

695
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,040
Is everyone the same?
How are they all doing?

696
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,585
They're all surprisingly doing well.

697
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,463
Ji-woong used to run
a street fashion website,

698
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,089
and he turned that into a business.

699
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,802
He started off
uploading pictures of good dressers,

700
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,678
then he moved on to selling clothes.

701
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,642
The list of brands
on his website is pretty impressive.

702
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,352
He also has his own brand.

703
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,145
I don't know about the composition.

704
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,898
Is there anything with more Tencel?
I want it to be softer.

705
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,693
Sir, we keep getting calls asking about
the brands that have been selected.

706
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,862
-We'll get back to them by this weekend.
-Yes, sir.

707
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,864
Let's have a final screening
at four o'clock.

708
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,282
One.

709
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,953
-Two. Point your toes.
-Yu-rim retired two years ago

710
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,996
-and opened a fencing club.
-One.

711
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,666
It's close to an international school,
so she's making a fortune.

712
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,750
One.

713
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,169
-Apparently, learning to fence is a plus
-Two.

714
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,213
when applying for
Ivy League schools or something.

715
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,507
Yes, this is Ko Yu-rim Fencing Club.

716
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,928
I'm sorry,
but all the classes are fully booked.

717
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,137
Yes.

718
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,390
One!

719
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:17,353
I'm just happy
that Yu-rim is earning a lot of money.

720
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,022
Agreed.

721
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,650
I'm glad to hear that.

722
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:27,238
And, would you like to hear
about your ex-girlfriend?

723
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,994
I'll see it on the news.

724
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,540
At times,

725
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,002
I miss the old days.

726
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,463
We had fun.

727
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,093
Of course, it was a lot of work for you

728
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,762
to look out for a bunch of clueless kids.

729
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,390
I liked you guys.

730
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,686
You would get into trouble all the time,

731
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,147
annoy me,

732
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,233
and make a big fuss over nothing.

733
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,820
Thanks to that,
I could forget all my worries.

734
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,406
I could forget when I was with you guys.

735
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,872
Sir, now that I think about it,
you were the only real adult in the group.

736
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,793
No wonder I couldn't relate to
all you troublemakers.

737
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,798
Is it okay for you to drink?
Didn't you bring your car?

738
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,177
It's fine. I can call up a driver.
I have my own.

739
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,346
I think your driver is here.

740
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,521
Come and say hello.

741
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,359
Wanseung.

742
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,446
It's been so long.

743
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,240
Who…

744
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,910
I'm Baekho. That was my nickname.

745
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:58,996
Back Yi-hyun?

746
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,499
Your younger brother?

747
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,667
Yes.

748
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,254
Your height…

749
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,173
You…

750
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,551
grew up really well.

751
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,345
You said you'd wait for me.

752
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,472
Haven't you kept me waiting long enough?

753
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,557
I'm already 26.

754
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,023
My life is about to become fun.

755
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,652
What's your number?

756
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,320
Hey, wait.

757
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,657
You're supposed to be
the next of kin in mourning now.

758
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,076
Attaque. Touche.

759
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,996
Hyeon-jeonng, your arm was a bit slow.

760
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:40,997
Good work.

761
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,042
Coach. Can you please be my partner
for a practice match?

762
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,545
I have to win a medal
in the match next week.

763
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,213
All right. Go put your gear on.

764
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,297
Thank you.

765
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:52,758
En garde.

766
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,763
Prêts? Allez.

767
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,099
Halte. Attaque. Touche.

768
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,518
Prêts? Allez.

769
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,688
Halte. Attaque. Touche. Point.

770
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,652
Parade. Riposte. Touche. Point.

771
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,155
Hey, what are you doing?

772
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,408
You're not using anything I've taught you.

773
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,660
You're not ready
for a competition or a medal!

774
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,872
What is it that you know?

775
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,022
The only thing
I know how to do is to love you.

776
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:51,776
Hey, you…

777
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,570
What is this? Where did you come from?

778
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,837
It doesn't matter where I came from.

779
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,632
What matters is where I will go.

780
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:40,991
Yu-rim.

781
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,994
No one else can make me happier

782
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:47,498
or sadder than you can.

783
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,751
Wherever it is, we'll go together

784
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,295
like we've been for the past ten years.

785
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,298
Will you marry me?

786
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,398
Congratulations!

787
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,161
Gosh, you startled me.

788
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,203
I love you.

789
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,382
The fencing finals will end soon.

790
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,718
If Na Hee-do wins gold,

791
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,803
we'll push aside other news
and cover her first.

792
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,013
It'll be an exclusive interview.

793
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,681
Are the questions ready?

794
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,851
This is what we've come up with for now.

795
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,895
Let us know if you want to add anything.

796
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,900
Let's take out the fifth question.

797
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,068
She doesn't like questions
about her personal life.

798
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,154
EXPERIENCE SAN FRANCISCO WITH UBS

799
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,495
When I was a reporter,
I was in charge of covering her.

800
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,665
SAN FRANCISCO TASK FORCE

801
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,877
Na Hee-do has won the gold medal!

802
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,596
I'll keep my cool.

803
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,307
What do you think?

804
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,229
Well, my left side looks better on camera.

805
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:37,191
Is that so?
You really are a star to know all that.

806
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,402
Someone told me.

807
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,696
All right. We'll be
on standby in ten minutes.

808
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,618
I haven't been on live news
for a while so I'm nervous.

809
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:57,127
We have won another gold medal
in San Francisco.

810
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:02,049
Today, the "King of Fencing" Na Hee-do won
her third gold medal for Korea.

811
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:07,680
We will connect live to San Francisco
to speak with her.

812
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,854
Ms. Na Hee-do?

813
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,232
It's nice to see you.

814
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,568
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

815
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,531
Thank you.

816
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,953
Have you been doing well too?

817
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,684
FAILED AT AN INTERVIEW TODAY
DO NOT "DISTRUB"

818
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,900
Just as you rooted for me without reason,

819
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,069
it's my turn to root for you.

820
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,530
Wherever you are,

821
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:09,074
I'll make sure my support reaches you.

822
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,618
I'll take care of everything.

823
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,413
I've missed you.

824
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,373
But I saw you

825
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,459
because you showed yourself to me.

826
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,670
So, I got to smile today.

827
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,508
I'll show up before volume 15 comes out.

828
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,719
Wait for me, Hee-do.

829
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,221
Allez.

830
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:43,150
KO YU-RIM IS A TRAITOR

831
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,277
-Three!
-Three!

832
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:46,862
-Two!
-Two!

833
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:48,906
One!

834
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,640
Yes. I've been well.

835
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,437
2009 NATIONAL OPEN
FENCING CHAMPIONSHIPS

836
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,193
That was your last bout before retirement.
Tell us how you feel.

837
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,986
Well…

838
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,447
I thought I would get teary-eyed,

839
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,783
but that's not happening.

840
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,121
I have mixed feelings,
but I feel relieved the most for now

841
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,665
since I won't have to train from tomorrow.

842
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,919
A lot of things have happened.

843
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:47,631
Fencing has made me cry a lot

844
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,800
and also laugh a lot.

845
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,221
Thank you all for rooting for me.

846
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:01,854
Throughout your career,
what would be your most honorable moment?

847
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,276
I was most honored to be…

848
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:14,616
Ms. Ko Yu-rim's rival.

849
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:18,662
Me too.

850
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,748
Me too!

851
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,085
I feel the same, Hee-do.

852
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,605
Congratulations on your retirement.

853
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,065
You've done great.

854
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,904
Hey, you didn't tell me you were coming.

855
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,324
How could I not when my rival is retiring?

856
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,046
It was our time.

857
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:11,798
Right?

858
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:22,351
It was an honor, Hee-do.

NA HEE-DO RETIRES

861
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,810
Goodness.

862
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:10,357
Let's see what is in this box.

863
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:13,944
Sir.

864
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,571
Are you closing down?

865
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:20,284
Yes. Not many people are
interested in books.

866
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,327
Goodbye.

867
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,537
Thank you. Bye.

868
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,540
Gosh.

869
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,295
I guess I've stayed in business
long enough.

870
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:35,257
First I started a book rental store,
and now a used bookstore.

871
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:40,804
Goodness, what is all this?

872
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,351
What is this?

873
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,771
"Na Hee-do"?

874
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,232
She's our regular customer.

875
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,404
Yi-jin. It's been ages since we last met.

876
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,282
I saw you on the news in New York.
Did you come back?

877
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:01,533
Yes, sir.

878
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,620
But I'm leaving today.
I'll be working in the US for some time.

879
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,830
I see.

880
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:08,707
That's good news, right?

881
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,834
Congratulations.

882
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,297
I need to ask you for a favor.

883
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,883
Can you give this to Hee-do
when she's here?

884
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,969
NA HEE-DO

885
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:24,640
Oh, dear. That's right.

886
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,143
Goodness. I can't believe I still have it.

887
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,479
Can I ask what brings you here?

888
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:35,192
So you see,
I'm the owner of that used bookstore.

889
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:37,653
Does Ms. Na Hee-do still live here?

890
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,363
She used to live here.

891
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,616
She's my mom.
Can I ask why you're looking for her?

892
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,950
NA HEE-DO

893
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,953
I've kept this for too long.

894
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,247
Please give this to her.

895
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,833
Tell her I'm sorry
for returning it so late.

896
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,049
No way! Her diary?

897
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,219
Oh my gosh!

898
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,979
Mom, I want to do ballet again.

899
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,982
Why all of a sudden?

900
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,485
I'm just bored now that I'm not doing it.

901
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,446
And I also want the experience.

902
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,533
I want to cry and laugh,

903
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:27,244
and be happy and disappointed
because of ballet.

904
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,203
I'll give it a go.

905
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,166
I'll get going.

906
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:36,962
That's right.

907
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,215
Here. Some man wanted to give you this.

908
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,886
He said he was
the owner of Myeongjin Book Rentals.

909
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:50,058
For your information,
I wanted to take a peek but I didn't.

910
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,936
Now I'm going to write my own story.

911
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:54,521
An even better one.

912
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,448
How did this…

913
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,535
That's strange.

914
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:42,277
I also didn't mean to say those things.

915
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,654
Hee-do.

916
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,575
I'm sorry.

917
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:00,670
My old diary found its way back to me,

918
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,342
bringing back past regrets
that I had forgotten about.

919
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:12,057
The moment of our break up haunted me
and I had wished to have it altered.

920
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:26,196
I've kept you standing here for too long,

921
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,198
Yi-jin.

922
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,060
This is what I really wanted to say,

923
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,812
Yi-jin.

924
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:02,858
You…

925
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:07,320
comforted me just by being there.

926
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:10,490
I grew up alone

927
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,034
and I was lonely.

928
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:17,330
You held me in a warm embrace.

929
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,212
You helped me get back on my feet

930
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,466
during the hardest times of my life.

931
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,845
If it wasn't for you,

932
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:36,308
I wouldn't be where I'm now.

933
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,487
At times when I didn't believe in myself,

934
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:52,532
I believed in you who believed in me.

935
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,287
That made things possible.

936
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,878
You made me smile.

937
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,047
With you…

938
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,593
I felt like I was on top of the world
even when I had nothing.

939
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:14,554
That's right.

940
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:18,767
At times…

941
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,896
the world seemed complete

942
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,565
because we were together.

943
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:28,318
Right.

944
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,780
I now know…

945
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,075
what perfect happiness is.

946
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,703
I learned what love is, thanks to you.

947
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,290
Now I know what a breakup is.

948
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,794
You will have no idea

949
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,546
how much your love has…

950
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,968
brightened up my life.

951
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,055
Thank you for everything.

952
01:22:58,682 --> 01:22:59,891
Thank you.

953
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:09,275
I have loved you with all my heart.

954
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,740
Goodbye, Yi-jin.

955
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:20,370
Goodbye, Hee-do.

956
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,503
Today…

957
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,594
you should be the first to go.

958
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:46,855
Okay.

959
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,357
Back then, I believed
I could have everything.

960
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:34,819
There were so many things
I wanted to have.

961
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,493
I had thought love and friendship
were mine to have for a brief moment.

962
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:50,752
What? It's my diary!

963
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:52,754
Hey, hurry up!

964
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,172
Let's go!

965
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:58,218
Looking back, every day was a practice.

966
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:02,639
The moments when I dared to say
everything would last forever.

967
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,645
-I loved living in that illusion.
-Come on!

968
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,647
Wait for me!

969
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:15,819
Right, there was still one thing
that we could have.

970
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:26,412
We're going to the beach!

971
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:34,212
This is awesome!

972
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,049
I can see the ocean!

973
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,802
Look at the sea!

974
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,473
We're at the beach!

975
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,006
The summer belongs to us!

976
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,272
That summer

977
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:37,192
was ours to keep.
