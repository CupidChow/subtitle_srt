EPISODE 5

2
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,498
Good night.

3
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,876
Have a safe trip tomorrow

4
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,087
and do your best.

5
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,049
And don't forget what I said earlier.

6
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,926
You said a lot of things earlier.

7
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,844
Which one should I not forget?

8
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,263
Whichever struck you the most.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,028
Why do you root for me?

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,449
Even my mom doesn't.

11
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,453
Because you give me hope.

12
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,544
And I want more for you.

13
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,552
And it makes me want to do well too.

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,112
What part of me makes you feel like that?

15
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,616
I don't know. It's just…

16
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,954
When you try hard,
it makes me want to try hard too.

17
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,333
When you accomplish something,
it makes me want to accomplish something.

18
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,628
You make

19
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,340
other people do well, not just yourself.

20
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,641
I praise you for it.
That's why I root for you.

21
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,061
So, take it all.

22
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,816
I'm going to take in…

23
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,738
all of your support.

24
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,076
And let's become great together.

25
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,087
You are…

26
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,301
one of a kind.

27
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,099
Go in. I should go.

28
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,893
Okay.

29
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,354
-That's right. Hold on.
-What?

30
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,155
Keep it. It's the sword you used earlier.

31
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,117
To keep you safe on your way home.

32
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,786
Fight off the bad guys if you meet any.

33
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,125
Can I really keep this?

34
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,505
It's my first time giving away a sword,
so don't you forget it either.

35
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,884
I won't.

36
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,057
Go in. I should go.

37
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,897
Bye, Yi-jin.

38
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,038
Oh my gosh!

39
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,208
Gosh, you scared me.

40
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,460
That was a long goodbye.

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,296
You must have hated to see him go.

42
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,302
-Were you eavesdropping?
-What should I have done?

43
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,636
Give you some privacy?

44
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,061
You must be very close
if you gave him a sword.

45
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,483
Who is he?

46
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,904
Someone who roots for me
when even my own mom won't.

47
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,781
How could I?

48
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,908
I let you transfer
so that you could fence,

49
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,452
but you hang out with a boy.

50
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,211
You have no faith in me.

51
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,298
How can I have faith in you
when this is all I see?

52
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,508
Would you have faith in you
if you were me?

53
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,057
I'm going to Hwaseong tomorrow
to try out for the national team.

54
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,561
Why are you going there?

55
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,813
I'm going to give my all tomorrow.

56
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,650
But you're not the reason
why I'm going to give my all.

57
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,070
I'll give it my all for myself.

58
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,404
Because only I know…

59
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,910
how hard I've tried.

60
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,807
When I was a child,
my mom was my pride and joy.

61
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,815
SWAN CHILDREN'S BALLET TEAM RECITAL

62
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,781
It's so nice to meet you.

63
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,158
You're so cool. This is amazing.

64
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,828
-Mommy!
-Hi, Min-chae.

65
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,373
It's such an honor to meet you.

66
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,126
-I know.
-You look the same.

67
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,919
What's your secret?

68
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,379
Thank you.

69
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,591
And I was jealous of her.

70
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,720
She was always glamorous
and it seemed like a given.

71
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,682
Like she was born that way.

72
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,977
But…

73
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,313
at the bottom of
every single page of her diary

74
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,441
were records of her practice that day

75
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,317
and her self-reflection.

76
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,404
Not a single day was missed.

77
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,364
WHAT I FELT
STRAIGHTEN THE BACK LEG WHEN DOING A FENTE

78
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,324
TRAINING LOG

79
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,784
CONTROL THE DISTANCE
DON'T FEAR THE OPPONENT

80
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,538
What shocked me wasn't Mom's love story,

81
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,374
but her efforts.

82
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,795
Her efforts that only she knew about.

83
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,047
I saw how hard she worked

84
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,050
rather than her glamor for the first time.

85
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,807
1998 HWASEONG
NATIONAL FENCING TEAM TRYOUTS

86
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,646
Hee-do, luck got you here.

87
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,648
But when you leave,

88
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,151
you'll reap the fruit of your efforts.

89
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,111
Do you think you can do it?

90
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,780
Coach.

91
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,991
I won't lose

92
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,577
a single match today.

93
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,459
Catch.

94
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,127
Come on.

95
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,131
Over here. Throw it to me. Here.

96
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,556
What the heck?

97
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,725
It wasn't intentional.

98
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,024
My brother asked yesterday
how you guys were asking.

99
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,401
It wasn't on purpose.

100
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,945
Seriously. Sorry.

101
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,072
Let's go.

102
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,175
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

103
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,511
What is it this early? Is something wrong?

104
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,846
No. I was on my way to school,

105
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,391
and I saw a coin on a payphone,

106
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,767
so I thought I'd call.

107
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,060
What a lucky day.

108
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,812
I know. Totally.

109
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,855
I hope you have a super lucky day too.

110
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,816
Okay. Get to school.

111
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,818
Okay. Bye.

112
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,966
You have a super lucky day too.

113
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,595
The Women's National Fencing Team Tryouts

114
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,638
round of 16 will begin.

115
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,310
1998 HWASEONG
NATIONAL FENCING TEAM TRYOUTS

116
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,539
I'm positive that I've worked the hardest

117
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
out of all the fencers here.

118
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,087
That is why it's only natural that I win.

119
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,467
Today, I will join the national team.

120
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,344
En garde.

121
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,554
Prêtes?

122
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,015
Allez.

123
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,652
Do you know Yi-hyun?

124
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,530
Hey, kid. Do you know Back Yi-hyun?

125
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,823
Yes, I do.

126
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,367
Over there.

127
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,703
What? That kid at the crossing?

128
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,954
Yes, that's right.

129
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,331
Okay, thanks.

130
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,973
En garde. Prêtes?

131
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,642
Allez.

132
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,395
Where's your dad?

133
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,730
Hey, where's your dad?

134
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,482
-Spill it.
-You punk.

135
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,818
-Hey.
-Hey.

136
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,195
-Hey.
-How dare you try to run?

137
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,488
Listen to me, you punk.

138
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,448
-What are you doing?
-Tell us.

139
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,368
-How dare you try to run?
-Let go of him. Just talk to him.

140
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,703
-Tell us now.
-Stop it.

141
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,790
Where's your dad?
Hey, tell us. Where's your dad?

142
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,501
-Tell us right now.
-Spill it.

143
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,423
Hello?

144
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,801
Yes.

145
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,317
Come on! You're doing great!

146
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,948
En garde.

147
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,784
Prêtes? Allez.

148
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,716
Halte. Attaque. $$

149
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,384
Attaque. Touche. Point.

150
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,677
JANG EUN-GYEONG, NA HEE-DO

151
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,137
No.

152
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,099
No. There was no contact.

153
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,522
En garde. Prêtes?

154
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,648
Allez.

155
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,085
Come with us. Let's go.

156
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,839
Halte. Attaque. Touche. Point.

157
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,890
KIM SEUNG-HEE, NA HEE-DO

158
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,433
You can do it!

159
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,809
En garde.

160
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,478
Prêtes? Allez.

161
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,031
Halte. Point.

162
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,871
-Nice!
-Okay, to the center.

163
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,623
Salut.

164
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,606
You did all the research
but the order is a mess.

165
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,983
There's too much being said.

166
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,568
Just state the facts. That's all.

167
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,611
It's not true, so how…

168
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,821
Show me.

169
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,366
Chief, I'll put Park Chan-ho's 15th win
of the season as the fourth item.

170
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,617
Fine.

171
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,495
Also, I'll put McGwire's 70th home run
right after that.

172
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,122
What's gotten into you?

173
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,291
You used to say we were too into sports.

174
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,751
Na Hee-do?

175
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,129
Who's Na Hee-do?

176
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,215
Okay.

177
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,969
Kim Jeong-hyeon and Na Hee-do
are in the finals.

178
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,680
Really? Kim Jeong-hyeon
used to be on the national team.

179
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,932
-Who's Na Hee-do?
-She's in high school.

180
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,935
Call the Fencing Association
and get a picture of her.

181
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,604
-And her bio.
-Okay.

182
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,524
Chief.

183
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,444
How long must I cover fencing?

184
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,238
I left the sports department long ago.

185
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,116
Regardless of what department you're in,
this is your home.

186
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,118
This is the first year

187
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,622
Kim Jeong-hyeon didn't make
the national team in the last eight years.

188
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,626
She has good speed, incredible focus,
and controls the flow.

189
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,461
She has two times the experience you have.

190
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,546
Are you trying to scare me?

191
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,673
No.

192
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,428
I'm saying a total newbie like you
is the toughest for someone like her.

193
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,180
She knows nothing about you.

194
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,060
So get up there
and just show her your fencing.

195
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,520
But remember one thing.

196
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,106
She'll do her best to get you flustered.

197
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,402
Don't get flustered.

198
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,154
Okay.

199
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,243
We will begin the final round
of the national fencing team tryouts.

200
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,204
Let's go, Hee-do.

201
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:07,257
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

202
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,350
En garde.

203
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,519
Prêtes?

204
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,604
Allez.

205
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,025
Halte. Attaque. Touche. Point.

206
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,280
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

207
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,331
Halte. Attaque. Touche. Point.

208
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,546
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

209
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,383
Hee-do.

210
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,179
Don't tell me…

211
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,684
I'm done analyzing her.

212
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,188
Okay, then.

213
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,316
I'll show you my fencing now.

214
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,903
En garde.

215
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,157
Prêtes? Allez.

216
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,041
NA HEE-DO

217
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,835
That crazy girl.

218
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,512
Prêtes? Allez.

219
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,974
Let's go, Hee-do!

220
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,937
Yes! Good!

221
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,898
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

222
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,858
That's it. You got it.

223
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,494
Yes! All right!

224
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,210
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

225
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,127
Halte.

226
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,213
She's crazy.

227
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,840
I fought her once last year.

228
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,051
She's not the same person from back then.

229
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,970
Yu-rim. She goes to your school, right?

230
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,682
-Yes.
-She got so much better.

231
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,768
Is it because of you?

232
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,396
En garde. Prêtes?

233
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,356
Halte.

234
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,943
-Let me test my blade.
-Sure.

235
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,992
It clearly hit you.
How dare you say it hit your blade?

236
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,954
She's a natural-born actress.

237
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,081
En garde. Prêtes?

238
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,168
-Halte.
-Her hair came loose.

239
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,753
Tie your hair.

240
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,907
I got something on my shoe.

241
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,669
Don't get flustered, Hee-do.

242
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,673
En garde.

243
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,842
Prêtes? Allez.

244
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,597
Halte. Attaque. Touche. Point.

245
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,146
En garde.

246
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,190
Prêtes?

247
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,985
Halte. My shoelace came untied.

248
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,572
Sir, aren't you going to
give her a warning?

249
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,158
She's delaying the bout.

250
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,284
Okay.

251
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,244
-Watch it.
-Yes, sir.

252
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,126
I'm going to wipe my face.

253
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,550
Hee-do. I told you not to get flustered.

254
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,386
She's doing it intentionally
but the referee isn't warning her.

255
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,764
That's part of controlling the bout.
You know that.

256
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,396
How did you beat the seniors…

257
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,235
who didn't let you train at night?

258
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,737
I just did as I prepared
regardless of what she said.

259
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,949
Exactly. That's how to keep from
letting her take control.

260
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,244
Fencers who can't be controlled

261
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,121
make fencers
who are usually in control flustered.

262
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,792
Come up.

263
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,878
Listen carefully.

264
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,965
Ignore everything she says.
Just do what you prepared.

265
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,549
You can do it, right?

266
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,555
Hey, Hee-do.

267
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,352
Trust me if you can't trust yourself
because I chose you.

268
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,063
You won't lose.

269
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,899
I don't choose fencers who lose.

270
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,072
Okay.

271
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,866
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

272
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,994
She's right.

273
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,830
I still don't trust myself.

274
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,751
But I have faith in her,
who saw my potential.

275
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,005
En garde.

276
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,756
Prêtes? Allez.

277
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,892
Nice! That's it!

278
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,935
KIM JEONG-HYEON, NA HEE-DO

279
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,898
Prêtes? Allez.

280
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,696
Yes!

281
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,947
It's obvious with you.

282
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,701
I can tell you'll do well,
although you don't see it.

283
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,870
Take your time to climb it

284
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,581
and take whatever you want.

285
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,463
And…

286
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,883
I have faith in you
since you have faith in me.

287
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,304
I put my faith in the two of you.

288
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,556
Prêtes? Allez.

289
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,285
Attaque!

290
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,474
Come together.

291
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,312
Salut.

292
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,529
Come here, Na Hee-do,
a national team member!

293
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,133
Hey. You were awesome today.

294
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,593
This is just the beginning.

295
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,512
Make the world bow at your feet!

296
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,018
NA HEE-DO

297
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,812
Sports News Brief.

298
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,439
Na Hee-do won the qualifier

299
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,608
for the Women's National Fencing Team

300
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,569
and joined the national team.

301
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,737
Na Hee-do defeated Kim Jeong-hyeon,

302
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:12,200
a former member of the national team
15 to 12 in the finals,

303
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,910
-to win.
-What's with that picture?

304
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,788
In the beginning,
Na Hee-do gave up five points

305
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,623
and seemed to be losing,

306
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,085
-but came back with a vengeance.
-No way!

307
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,129
She really made the national team.

308
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,173
Hee-do really pulled it off.

309
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,260
-She really is an odd one.
-She was impressive and won.

310
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,887
Why? Does she go to your school?

311
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,389
She caught loaches with us last time.

312
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,682
Don't you remember the fridge?

313
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,269
Yes. That transfer student?

314
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,063
Don't tell me you didn't know the girl
who was next to her.

315
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,608
Who? The little girl
from the fencing team?

316
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,902
Gosh, Auntie.

317
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,362
She's not just a little girl.

318
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,615
She's not on some
dinky school fencing team.

319
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,035
She's the gold medalist Ko Yu-rim.

320
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,913
What? Ko Yu-rim?

321
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,290
She was Ko Yu-rim?
The gold medalist fencer?

322
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,625
That's right!

323
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,251
Oh my gosh.

324
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,962
So, two members of the national team
were in my house

325
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,215
catching loaches?

326
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,468
No wonder my joints don't hurt anymore
after having that soup.

327
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,178
They're all better.

328
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,598
Oh my goodness!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

329
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:23,021
-You were really awesome today.
-Yes!

330
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,106
You should dance on a day like this.

331
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,234
Go on and dance.

332
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,403
Go on. Dance.

333
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,490
Okay, that part?

334
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,575
-Okay, and down!
-And down!

335
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,994
Yes, that's it.

336
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,538
-That's it.
-Nice, Coach.

337
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,167
Coach. Go in first.
I need to make a call first.

338
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,794
I want to tell someone.

339
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,003
Your mom?

340
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,922
No.

341
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,883
You two are still as cold as ever.

342
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,177
-Make it quick.
-Okay.

343
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:04,104
PAYPHONE

344
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,193
I don't know his pager number.

345
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,114
I guess we're not close at all.

346
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,289
See you tomorrow.

347
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,041
I'll run to you first thing tomorrow.

348
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,224
-Here's to Na Hee-do!
-Na Hee-do!

349
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,355
Ms. National Team, please eat up.

350
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,649
-Coach, act normal.
-My arm is getting tired.

351
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,234
You're making me uncomfortable.

352
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,777
Look at you.

353
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,197
Are you keeping a distance
now that you're on the national team?

354
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,324
Here.

355
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,078
Tell me. How did you get on
the national team?

356
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,918
Did you gloat like this before?
Was that how you ended up taking a bribe?

357
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,795
What was that? Why you…

358
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,465
Just kidding. Go easy on me.
I'm on the national team.

359
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,426
-Ms. Yang.
-Hey.

360
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,512
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

361
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,222
Hi. Eat up.

362
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,058
-Eat up.
-Enjoy.

363
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,809
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

364
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,480
-Hey, Yu-rim.
-Enjoy your dinner.

365
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,065
-Thanks. You too.
-Thank you.

366
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,367
Come on, let's eat.

367
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,202
You need to eat a lot.

368
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,637
Congratulations. Your dream came true.

369
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,644
Now that I'm on the national team,

370
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,479
Ko Yu-rim talks to me first.

371
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,233
Don't be sarcastic
since I'm congratulating you.

372
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,694
I wasn't. I was sincerely shocked.

373
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,197
I checked the mirror
every time you ignored me.

374
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,782
I thought I was invisible.

375
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,661
And to clarify,

376
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,497
my dream wasn't to be
on the national team.

377
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,833
My dream is

378
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,168
to become your rival.

379
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,464
You can congratulate me then.

380
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,550
I hope you mean it when the time comes.

381
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,058
GUSAN-DONG TO SANGDO-DONG

382
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,023
Thank you!

383
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,827
Yi-jin!

384
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,375
Sir. Is Yi-jin off today?

385
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,878
He quit.

386
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,090
What do you mean? Why did he quit?

387
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,842
Who knows?

388
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,969
Maybe he got a full-time job.

389
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,763
He said something urgent came up.

390
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,069
Yi-jin! Are you home?

391
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,362
Hey, Ms. National Team.

392
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,531
Congratulations, Hee-do.

393
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,325
There's a banner on the school gate.

394
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,953
Gosh. You were on TV and everything.
I'm so jealous.

395
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,997
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

396
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,500
Anyway, I came to see Yi-jin,
but he doesn't seem to be in.

397
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,210
He quit his job at the bookstore.

398
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,586
He quit?

399
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,172
Yi-jin.

400
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,350
What's going on?
I didn't know he was moving out.

401
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,812
-Ask your mom.
-Okay.

402
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,025
Did Yu-rim say anything? She may know.

403
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,693
I'll ask her.

404
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,220
Yu-rim.

405
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,859
Who saw him last?

406
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,652
Seung-wan's mom must know.

407
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:11,619
Are you in touch with Back Yi-jin
from the 20th class?

408
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,416
Okay. I see.

409
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,750
Thank you.

410
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,045
Who saw him last?

411
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,630
I can't reach my mom.

412
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,632
I saw him on my way to school yesterday.

413
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,386
He said hi like normal.
I didn't notice anything weird.

414
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,641
Hee-do. Did you check your pager?

415
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,060
I didn't get anything.

416
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,022
When will your mom come home?

417
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,190
She should be back soon.

418
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,779
He's an adult. He must have his reasons.

419
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,157
He's not a kid. Why are you fussing?

420
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,659
-Stop talking.
-I guess I should.

421
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,708
Mom. Why weren't you answering your phone?

422
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:02,045
My cell phone battery died
after just a few calls. Damn it.

423
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,758
Look who's here.
A pair of national team members.

424
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,260
-Hello.
-That's not important.

425
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,597
Where's Yi-jin… I mean, the tenant?
Did he move out?

426
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,017
Yes. He said something urgent came up
and moved out this morning.

427
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,021
He moved out?

428
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,439
Why so suddenly?

429
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,232
How would I know?

430
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,028
Who doesn't have problems
during these times?

431
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,740
Strange men came by
looking for him before.

432
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,534
That was why he always looked down.

433
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:39,207
Anyway, our gold medalist Ko Yu-rim.

434
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,834
And the new national team member
Na Hee-do.

435
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,920
Mom, cut it out. We're not in the mood.

436
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,255
What's wrong?

437
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,437
Yu-rim.

438
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,819
You know Yi-jin's pager number, right?

439
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,489
May I have it?

440
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,700
I tried beeping him. He didn't respond.

441
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,660
Still.

442
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,329
Give me the number.

443
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,331
Sorry.

444
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,057
Let me know

445
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,185
if you hear from him.

446
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,260
If it were you,
what color would you choose?

447
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,597
For me…

448
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,183
I want blue.

449
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,908
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER NA HEE-DO

450
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,433
He really left.

451
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,746
Gosh.

452
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,707
It's so far.

453
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,420
We'll be in Pohang in about 30 minutes.

454
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,631
Gosh. He must have been very tired.

455
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,175
Your brother's asleep.

456
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,055
He's had a long day.

457
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,104
You weren't even packed properly.

458
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,316
I guess you had to move
at the last minute.

459
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,026
That's right.

460
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,030
Because I tried to be a good big brother.

461
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,701
Two years ago,

462
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,080
your father, Back Seong-hak,
started a company in your brother's name.

463
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,374
The creditors found out

464
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,127
and went to his school
and caused that commotion.

465
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,549
But that company in your brother's name
made no profit.

466
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,551
He couldn't do anything with it.

467
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,556
Well, there are so many companies
like that these days.

468
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,521
Anyway, you do know
that your father is a financial criminal.

469
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,860
Yes, I do.

470
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,082
Yi-jin. Where are you going?

471
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,591
I know school isn't over yet,
but I can't go tomorrow.

472
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,177
-Everyone saw.
-Give me your pager.

473
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,097
Why?

474
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,474
Here.

475
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,397
Yi-hyun. Listen up.

476
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,317
Don't contact anyone.
Don't respond to anyone.

477
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,694
I'll do the same.

478
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,365
-I need to contact the kids at school.
-You're not going back there.

479
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,451
Don't go to the academy or anywhere.

480
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,039
But I promise…

481
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,003
at least one thing.

482
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,588
I promise

483
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,509
you'll never go through this again.

484
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,847
Sorry, Yi-hyun.

485
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,900
But…

486
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,739
the only thing I can do…

487
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,994
as a big brother is run.

488
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,208
Mom.

489
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,211
Oh my gosh.

490
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,841
Boys.

491
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,026
I…

492
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,654
I miss your dad.

493
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,996
I miss him so much.

494
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,457
Pat her on the back.

495
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,794
Honey!

496
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,546
Seriously.
Are you crying for your love again?

497
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,048
-Hello.
-Hey.

498
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,925
Hello, Uncle.

499
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,927
You must be tired from the trip.

500
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,179
Let's go in. Come in.

501
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,099
-Here.
-Come in.

502
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,601
There.

503
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,561
Here.

504
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,147
Eat before it gets cold.

505
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,108
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

506
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,366
Yi-jin. You said you saw Dad, right?

507
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,243
How did he look?

508
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,454
Did he age a lot?

509
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,376
I told you dozens of times over the phone.

510
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,545
I miss him, that's why.

511
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,423
At least you got to see him.

512
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,092
Try caring that much about your sons.

513
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,761
It's okay, Uncle. We're used to it.

514
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,722
I gave birth to them.

515
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,642
They'll take care of themselves.

516
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,602
A husband isn't the same.

517
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,690
That's right.

518
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,985
What do you know about love?

519
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,655
That's why you're still single.

520
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,284
-Sorry.
-Seriously, you little…

521
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,330
May I give my opinion?

522
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,748
Sure, go ahead.

523
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,005
If you're okay with it,

524
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,716
I'd like Yi-hyun to finish
middle school here.

525
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,468
What? That's not right.

526
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,804
Not in this hick town.

527
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,891
Do it. You look like a hick anyway.

528
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:24,023
Also, I'd like to stay here
for the time being

529
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,858
until things get better.

530
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,154
I'll help out and do my best
not to be a burden.

531
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,114
You're family. How could you be a burden?

532
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,617
I'm glad you came. You've done enough.

533
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,166
What is it this time?

534
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,421
Yi-jin is all grown up.

535
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,050
It's because he suffered so much.

536
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,219
Honey.

537
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,767
Gosh. Seriously.

538
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:07,525
BROADCASTING ROOM

539
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,326
Hee-do. Didn't you move into the NTC?

540
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,370
I'm going tomorrow.

541
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,705
Anyway…

542
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,000
can I borrow some of Yi-jin's recordings?

543
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,503
Will this do?

544
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,797
Yes. Thanks.

545
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,424
What do you want with them?

546
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,552
To listen to them at NTC
when things get hard.

547
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,637
I'll need his support.

548
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,514
You two were really close.

549
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,849
Aren't you mad that he took off?

550
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,435
No, I'm not.

551
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,438
You have faith he'll come back.

552
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,149
No, not exactly.

553
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,738
I have faith
that he made the right choice.

554
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,244
I'm sure he went somewhere better.

555
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,830
Somewhere less tiring.

556
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,457
And somewhere he'll get hurt less.

557
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,712
It's now my turn…

558
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,048
to root for him.

559
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,977
-Bye.
-Bye.

560
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,479
Take care.

561
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,695
Okay, here we go. One, two.

562
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,032
Can't you smile?

563
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,620
You have a good eye since you're on TV.

564
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,996
Not at all.

565
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,164
Okay, now.

566
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,042
Absorb your mother's energy
and let's try that again.

567
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,961
Chin down. Shoulders straight.

568
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,922
Smile subtly.

569
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,344
Okay.

570
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,139
-Thank you. Please make her look nice.
-Sure.

571
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,185
I'm so busy. Why did you insist
I get a picture taken?

572
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,811
Seriously.

573
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,314
How can you say that?
You saw your photo on the news.

574
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,858
What are you, a wanted fugitive?

575
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,986
How could you let the whole country
see that horrible photo?

576
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,907
It's not right for broadcasting.

577
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,868
Go to the association
and submit a new photo. Got it?

578
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,039
Why are you staring at me?

579
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,210
You're amazing.

580
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,343
I got on the national team,
but you still manage to find a flaw.

581
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,888
I didn't expect you

582
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,891
to congratulate me.

583
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,061
But I didn't expect to be scolded.

584
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,479
You really are amazing.

585
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,481
I'm not someone who congratulates you.

586
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,192
I'm here to make people congratulate you.

587
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,779
I don't know. I can't relate.

588
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,614
Why you little…

589
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,619
How about a photo together?
It's on the house.

590
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,287
-No, thank you.
-No, thank you.

TAEREUNG NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

592
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:17,548
WE'LL REPAY YOU WITH MEDALS
FOR YOUR SUPPORT

593
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,393
TAEREUNG NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

594
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,854
Hello. I'm Na Hee-do.

595
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,772
I'm 18 years old and…

596
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,194
I'll do my best!

597
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,952
Unpack and settle in.

598
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,913
Yu-rim's roommate is gone,
so you can share the room with her.

599
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,040
Ask her if you have any questions.

600
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,169
Don't bug her too much though.

601
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,590
-Yes, sir.
-Make sure you don't get in her way.

602
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,675
Understood?

603
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,053
-Yes, sir.
-Also…

604
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,972
stop by the office for your clothes.

605
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,849
Yes, sir.

606
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,684
We'll carry on training.

607
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,436
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

608
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,522
I'm really on the national team.

609
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,452
Gather in the field at 6 a.m.
for group warm-ups.

610
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,955
Breakfast at 7 a.m.,
morning training at 9:30 a.m.

611
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,415
Lunch at noon,
afternoon training at 2:30 p.m.

612
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,625
Dinner at 6 p.m.

613
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,961
The dining room is
to the right of the dorm.

614
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,090
Ask now if you have any questions.

615
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,970
So…

616
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,557
when do we get the national uniform?

617
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,309
The one with "KOR" on the back.

618
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,104
Why? Do you want one?

619
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,939
You said to ask if I had questions.

620
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,860
The uniforms are only for fencers
who make it into competitions.

621
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:49,658
Fencing isn't a team sport
where all eight members compete together.

622
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,828
Only four compete in the most important
international competitions,

623
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,997
so they only make four uniforms.

624
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,040
If you want to be one of them,

625
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,294
you'll have to do well
in every competition starting next year.

626
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,088
Thanks for letting me know.

627
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,676
I have a question too.

628
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,638
Do you snore?

629
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,850
Sometimes if I'm tired.

630
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,644
I'm a light sleeper,
so be mindful of that.

631
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,567
What? You're a light sleeper?

632
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,535
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL BROADCASTING CLUB

633
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,589
The college entrance exam is coming up.

634
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,800
Hang in there. You can do it.

635
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,595
But can we really do it?

636
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,813
Sometimes, saying that we can do something

637
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,232
can be more discouraging.

638
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,820
We haven't learned about a world
in which you don't have to do well

639
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,240
-Are you Yi-jin?
-and can fail.

640
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,993
Still, let's do the most we can.

641
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,621
Let's do our best.

642
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,667
But I still hope that even if we fail,

643
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,128
we'll be strong enough

644
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,964
to get back up again.

645
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,442
You're right, Yi-jin.

646
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:32,070
We have the strength to get back up again.

647
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,908
So let's be as frustrated as we want
when things are tough.

648
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,577
Let's be as sad as we want.

649
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,922
And let's get back up together.

650
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,133
PAYPHONE

651
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,344
Even if we're not together,
let's get back up together.

652
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:04,728
I'll be your strength
to help you back up again.

653
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,315
I'll make sure it happens.

654
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,837
-Hey, hold on.
-What?

655
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,006
-Hold on.
-Why?

656
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,148
Why? Do I smell like fish?

657
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,488
I can't get the smell out
even if I wash it.

658
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,242
Let's go.

659
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,995
And keep your promise
to get me an ADSL connection.

660
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,790
That was the only reason I transferred.

661
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,874
Okay.

662
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,628
-Let's go.
-Okay.

663
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,006
-Let's go.
-Coming.

664
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,856
CONGRATULATIONS NA HEE-DO
ON MAKING THE NATIONAL TEAM

665
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,944
CONGRATULATIONS NA HEE-DO
ON MAKING THE NATIONAL TEAM

666
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,178
Ji-woong.

667
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,351
I know you saw me.

668
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,609
I wanted to try that.

669
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,653
To see how it feels to ignore someone
saying hi to me.

670
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,199
It's not for me.

671
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,995
What do you mean?

672
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,039
You don't remember? Forget it.

673
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,503
Yu-rim.

674
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,516
I'll help you.

675
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,445
Sorry. I couldn't think straight
because of Yi-jin.

676
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,574
You two must be very close.

677
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,627
I was able to fence because of him.

678
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,633
I almost quit fencing
because my family was poor,

679
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,679
but his family's company sponsored me.
That was how I was able to continue.

680
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,980
It's the first time
telling anyone about that.

681
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:39,109
Sorry for making you tell me something
you didn't want to.

682
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,074
I peed in class in the first grade.

683
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,246
I fought a girl in my class
in the seventh grade and lost.

684
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,956
She beat me to a pulp.

685
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,333
And…

686
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,254
I was mugged on the street last year
by kids in middle school.

687
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,426
What are you doing?

688
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,846
Sharing things I don't want to.

689
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,181
We're even now.

690
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,145
Let's go. First period is gym.

691
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,772
Hold on. You were mugged
by middle school kids?

692
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,025
Why are you at school?
To meet your minimum attendance?

693
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,568
How did you find out their age?

694
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,695
Are you good at basketball? Let's play.

695
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,155
Did they hit you?

696
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,366
One, two, three, four.

697
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,369
One, two, three, four.

698
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,997
One, two, three, four.

699
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,958
One, two, three, four.

700
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,836
One, two, three, four.

701
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,881
One, two, three, four.

702
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,550
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

703
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,511
One, two, three, four.

704
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,055
One, two.

705
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:55,560
3 MONTHS LATER

706
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:59,355
One, two. One, two. One.

707
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,545
WE WISH OUR ATHLETES ALL THE BEST

708
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,922
Are you okay?

709
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,219
Yes, I'm fine.

710
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,639
You don't look well.

711
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,778
What did the doctor say?

712
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,364
Lie back down.

713
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,991
He says it looks like a cold.

714
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,411
Gosh. When can you return to training?

715
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,833
I'll make sure I'm back tomorrow.

716
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,293
Stay in another room if you have a cold.

717
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,588
Don't give it to Yu-rim. Got it?

718
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,174
Rest up.

719
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,779
Hello.

720
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,999
Yi-hyun!

721
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,625
-Yi-hyun!
-It's nice.

722
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,052
What are you doing?

723
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,516
Are you done? I'm done.

724
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,268
Let's go.

725
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,770
Must we come here?
The place by the school is good.

726
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,607
Hey. This place is 100 times better.

727
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,650
You don't know anything, Seoul Boy.

728
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,736
Did you really live in Apgujeong?

729
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,488
Isn't that where HOT live?

730
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,365
-No, not Apgujeong--
-His family is super rich.

731
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,076
Your brother drives a sports car, right?

732
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,454
-Yes.
-For real? That's awesome.

733
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,457
Can he give us a ride?

734
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,666
Right. Ask him.

735
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,002
I'll ask him.

736
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,256
Hey. Will your parents buy you
a sports car if you go to college too?

737
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,550
I'm not sure.

738
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,011
I don't know.

739
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,263
Let's eat and go.

740
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,811
Shall we go? Let's get going.

741
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,563
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

742
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,774
-Come back. I'll make it even tastier.
-Okay.

743
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,912
Hey. Let's have filefish
while watching the video. It looks good.

744
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,038
Let's just go.

745
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:05,124
Ji-hye and I bought tteokbokki,
so you get the filefish.

746
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,459
Let's get some.

747
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,424
How much is the filefish?

748
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,803
It's 1,000 won for 3.

749
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,016
I'll take three.

750
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,233
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

751
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,265
Yi-hyun.

752
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,684
What?

753
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,522
What was that earlier?

754
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,650
Are you embarrassed of me?

755
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,486
Because I move boxes of fish

756
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,865
instead of driving a sports car?

757
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,452
That's not it.

758
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:27,290
Then why do your friends still think
I drive a sports car?

759
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,170
Why are you lying to make new friends?

760
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,341
So that I could be friends with them.

761
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,885
In case the kids harass me again

762
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,596
if I say I moved here
because our family went bankrupt.

763
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,808
Drop the excuse.

764
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,108
Do you know what upsets me?

765
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,904
That you care about
a person's job and status.

766
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,324
That you're ashamed of poverty.

767
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,911
Your head is filled with that garbage.

768
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,996
That's why you lie to your friends

769
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,999
and do what you did today.

770
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,752
-Am I wrong?
-Fine.

771
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,381
To be honest,
I liked it when you drove a sports car

772
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,257
and went to a good college.

773
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,887
I always thought you were really cool,
but you're not anymore.

774
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,971
You're embarrassing.

775
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,892
I hate that you work
at a stinky fish market

776
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,560
and that you do hard labor.

777
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,237
The work isn't what's hard.

778
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,199
Something like this is hard.

779
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,620
Being treated like this
by my one and only brother.

780
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,751
I wanted you to grow up
without being hurt,

781
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,504
so I left everything and moved.

782
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,091
Because that was the most important.

783
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,135
Please stop saying it was because of me!

784
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,429
I didn't do anything.

785
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,931
I never asked to leave Seoul.

786
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,975
I never asked to transfer schools.

787
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,894
You said to cut all ties,
so I lost all of my friends in Seoul.

788
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,688
Even my close friends.

789
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,567
You decided on your own to move,

790
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,277
so don't say it was because of me.

791
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,864
Stop using me as an excuse.

792
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,366
It's cowardly.

793
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,831
It's cold out.

794
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,175
I'll leave. You stay.

795
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,124
Yi-jin.

796
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,377
What are you doing out here?

797
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,509
It's okay. One hand is fine.

798
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,099
Why did you fight?

799
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,938
How could you fight a 15-year-old?

800
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,779
When did you start smoking?
After you moved here?

801
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,698
Yes.

802
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,244
Let's see.

803
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,248
You've been down here
for three months, right?

804
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,381
Work is hard, isn't it?

805
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,219
I don't think it's the job.

806
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,226
Earlier…

807
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,396
Yi-hyun said not to use him

808
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,774
as an excuse for coming here.

809
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,281
I think he's right.

810
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,788
I kept failing interviews

811
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,083
again and again…

812
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,463
so I wanted to run away.

813
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,261
I was the one

814
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,139
who wanted to run away…

815
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,977
but I used Yi-hyun as an excuse.

816
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,650
I'm a real loser.

Yi-jin, it's me. Hee-do.

I'm sad that you disappeared,
but I don't resent you.

822
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,211
Just as you rooted for me without reason,

823
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,630

841

We're leaving for the competition soon.
Come out.

842
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,298
Okay.

843
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,398
Coming through. Excuse me.

844
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,401
Here you go. Thank you.

845
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,486
Here.

846
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,863
-How much do you want?
-A bunch.

847
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,740
-What?
-These.

848
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,867
You want these?

849
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,160
These are alive.

-Thank you.

851
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,184
I'd like this please.

852
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,685
-Do you want that fish?
-Yes.

853
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,437
How many?

854
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,168
Next, we have fencing news.

855
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:55,172
At the Presidential Cup
Fencing Competition held today,

856
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,884
Ko Yu-rim won as expected.

857
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:03,681
She defeated Lee Sang-eon
in the finals and took first place.

858
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,516
In second place was Lee Sang-eon,

859
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:08,060
and in third place was the newest member

860
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,104

861
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,030

01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,814
Congratulations…

866
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,191
Hee-do.

867
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,586
What are you doing over there?

868
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,549
Sorry!

869
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,137
I've missed you.

870
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:56,932
But I saw you

871
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,184
because you showed yourself to me.

872
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,314
So, I got to smile today.

873
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,238
Did Full House volume 14 come out yet?

874
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:15,617
It did.

875
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,745
I'll show up before volume 15 comes out.

876
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,956
Wait for me, Hee-do.

887
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,149
It's your first time
coming to school this year.

888
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,944
-Hi.
-Are we in the same class again?

889
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,946
I'm counting on you
for the Asian Games too.

890
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,573
And please look after
the person who gave you to me.

891
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,743
Being teammates

892
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:41,620
and then enemies at the finals

893
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,288
