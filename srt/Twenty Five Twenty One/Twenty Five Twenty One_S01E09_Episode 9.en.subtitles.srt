1
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,322
-Hee-do.
-Injeolmi.

2
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,616
No.

3
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,744
Yi-jin.

4
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,040
I…

5
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,502
have to have you.

6
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,094
You told me

7
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,224
that we were destined to meet eventually.

8
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,309
But you were wrong.

9
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,063
We had met already way beforehand.

10
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,232
Can you believe this?

11
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,900
It's unreal.

12
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,109
How…

13
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,071
How are you Injeolmi?

14
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,704
Is Injeolmi a username?

15
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,294
I guess so.

16
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,049
I'm not Injeolmi.

17
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,970
Are you disappointed

18
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,222
that I'm Ryder37?

19
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,016
Is that why?

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,394
No. That's not it.

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,105
Regardless, I'm not Injeolmi.

22
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,982
Stop talking nonsense.

23
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,026
We agreed to meet today,
each carrying a yellow rose.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,779
It's the same spot,
the same time, and the same flower.

25
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,948
Are you trying to say it's a coincidence?

26
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,202
The truth is…

27
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,668
Anyway, it really isn't me.

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,420
So…

29
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,924
I bought this on my way to an interview

30
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,844
because I didn't want to go empty-handed.

31
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,020
It's really…

32
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,148
a coincidence?

33
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,735
Yes.

34
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,784
Then what did I say

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,329
just now?

36
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,372
Just now? Well…

37
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,419
You said you had to have me
and I was wondering how.

38
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,129
Be quiet!

39
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,261
I was speaking quietly though.

40
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,766
Darn it.

41
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,393
Gosh. What do I do now?

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,945
EPISODE 9

43
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,905
Sorry I couldn't make it today.

44
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,157
I had an emergency.

45
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,117
I'm really sorry.

46
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,214
It's okay. I didn't wait long anyway.

47
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,149
If your world is gone, go to her world.

48
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,946
Was the girl Hee-do talked about…

49
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,990
That is

50
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,535
how much I liked you, Yu-rim.

51
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,954
It was me?

52
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,291
Maybe we know each other already.

53
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,085
Perhaps we've crossed paths before.

54
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,254
No.

55
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,673
There's no way I wouldn't recognize you.

56
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,678
I'm sure I'll recognize you at once.

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,313
Like heck you'd recognize her,
you stupid idiot!

58
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,149
What am I supposed to do now?

59
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,068
What am I supposed to do?

60
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,828
"I have to have you"?

61
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:34,000
Have what? What was wrong with you?

62
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,753
Stop reading comic books.

63
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,547
I'm so humiliated!

64
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,219
Darn it.

65
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,272
What's that doing there?

66
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,780
Don't come out. Just listen.

67
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,075
I got it from Coach Yang.

68
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,371
I know I called it a stolen medal on TV…

69
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,753
but as your mom,
not as anchor Shin Jae-kyung,

70
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,256
I don't think you stole it.

71
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,843
I just want you to know that.

72
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,888
I still think your attitude
at the press conference

73
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,057
was stupid and uncultured.

74
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,561
But that has nothing to do
with your gold medal,

75
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,523
so take it.

76
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,585
What is this, a pawn shop?

77
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,023
Sorry for leaving you behind.

78
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,755
LIVING UP TO HIS NAME,
LOGAN CAME OUT THE VICTOR…

79
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,848
I have to have you.

80
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,024
Not even "I like you,"
but "I have to have you"?

81
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,735
Seriously, Hee-do.

82
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,577
Yi-jin!

83
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,205
What is it at this hour?

84
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,041
Obviously, I was going crazy.
That's why I'm here so early.

85
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,709
I couldn't sleep a wink.

86
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,003
Did you tell Hee-do everything?

87
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,923
I didn't.

88
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,966
Thank God.

89
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,511
What should I do?

90
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,471
Why are you asking me that?

91
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,099
You know that
I'm lying to her because of you.

92
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,728
What will you do?

93
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,233
She'll be disappointed

94
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,360
if she finds out I'm Injeolmi.

95
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,030
I feel so bad that I'm Injeolmi.

96
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,823
I was so mean to her.

97
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,951
What did you do?

98
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:01,374
You're worth the budget we get
per student. You're nothing more or less.

99
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,545
The fact that I don't know who you are
in this small fencing community

100
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,380
means you're nothing.

101
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,466
Then you should have just stayed a fan.

102
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,345
How dare you come all the way here
and cause trouble?

103
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,556
Why you…

104
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,892
You're just so horrible.

105
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,229
-She liked you so much--
-I know that.

106
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,648
I know better than anyone
how much Ryder37--

107
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,110
I mean, how much Hee-do liked me.

108
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,404
She loved Ko Yu-rim

109
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,739
and consoled Injeolmi.

110
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,785
I received both love
and consolation, but I…

111
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,745
Darn it.

112
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,498
What should I do?

113
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,334
Regardless, I can't lie anymore.

114
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,588
No, please. Give me just one week.

115
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,339
I need time to mull it over.

116
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,679
What's wrong with you?

117
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,319
Is she coming?

118
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,155
-She left.
-She left?

119
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,866
You're avoiding her

120
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,995
and she seems to be avoiding me.

121
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,269
Will you give me the lubricant?

122
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,481
Never mind.

123
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,910
What's up with you?
Do you feel guilty about something?

124
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,205
Or was it like a reflex
and you realized after the fact?

125
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,916
It's neither.

126
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,335
I'm just honored, that's why.

127
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,797
I'm grateful that you're not treating me
like I'm invisible.

128
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,175
Maybe you're born to serve others.

129
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,764
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 16 FINAL

130
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,392
Yu-rim!

131
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,645
Want to go to the snack shop with me?

132
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,980
Sure. What are you going to get?

133
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,650
Cup noodles to start
and ice cream for dessert.

134
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,402
Okay, let's go.

135
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,071
See you later!

136
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,451
Volume 16?

137
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,664
It's out.

138
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,584
The final volume.

139
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,712
It's out.

140
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,778
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 16 FINAL

141
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,989
I'm going to have three ice creams.

142
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,199
Wait. I forgot my wallet. Wait here.

143
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,077
-Okay. Hurry up!
-Okay.

144
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,615
Is that mine?

145
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,158
What? No.

146
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,784
I see.

147
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,289
Yes.

148
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,502
Did you steal that from my locker
to read it?

149
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,170
I didn't steal it.

150
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,299
The wind blew your locker door open.

151
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,260
It swung open really hard!

152
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,180
I walked over to close it
and saw the book.

153
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,807
I was pleasantly surprised
and took a look.

154
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,859
Satisfied?

155
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,862
And listen.

156
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:46,283
Don't you know you're not allowed
to bring comic books to school?

157
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,371
I know you're on the fencing team,
but you should abide by the rules.

158
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,920
Wait…

159
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,089
I don't mind her reading it.

160
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,011
Hee-do.

161
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,058
Coach! What are you doing there?

162
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,476
Photosynthesis.

163
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,072
Do you know what happened
to Yu-rim's family?

164
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,158
Their restaurant was closed for a while
then reopened today.

165
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,036
Do you not know since you're not close?

166
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,833
The kids say they stood surety for a loan
or something like that.

167
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,251
I don't know the details.

168
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,377
They what?

169
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,218
Gather the kids after afternoon training.

170
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,386
We're eating at Yu-rim's.

171
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,804
At a snack shop?

172
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,432
The tougher things are,
the busier you need to be.

173
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,435
You need to laugh
in order to forget more quickly.

174
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,231
And you need to forget
in order to survive.

175
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,364
I didn't know you liked our tteokbokki.

176
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,367
You know now. They're good.

177
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,038
Coach, may we order fish cakes too?

178
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,164
Of course.

179
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,540
-Yes!
-Sundae too?

180
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,167
Of course, you may.

181
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,379
First years, get anything you want.
Don't worry about it.

182
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,631
-Okay!
-Okay!

183
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,348
CONGRATULATIONS
NA HEE-DO GOLD, KO YU-RIM SILVER

184
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,398
Mom, the fencing team is here.

185
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,900
-Hello.
-Hello.

186
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,152
How have you been?

187
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,529
Look who's here. Hello.

188
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,531
We wanted to have a team dinner here.

189
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,659
You know how much they can eat, right?

190
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,702
You need to prepare like 20 servings.

191
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,996
You came on purpose to give me business?

192
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,915
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

193
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,249
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

194
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,668
-Sit down.
-Okay.

195
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,336
-Sit here, Coach.
-Thanks.

196
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,131
What do you want?

197
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,142
So you're the one who beat my daughter
and took the gold medal.

198
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,884
You must have been through a lot, Hee-do.

199
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,181
They said such terrible things.

200
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,475
Those nasty jerks.

201
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,359
It must have been hard for you.

202
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,746
You were scared, weren't you?

203
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,916
Is it a little better now?

204
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,380
Yes.

205
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,844
Oh my. You're much prettier
in person than on TV.

206
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,683
I'll give you a big serving
since you won a gold medal.

207
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,061
Congratulations on the gold medal.

208
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,824
Good work all of you.

209
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,704
You'll all be with Sports
until you receive new assignments.

210
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,997
Just so you know.

211
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,250
Anyway, when should we have a team outing?

212
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,169
Is that what today's meeting is about?

213
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,255
That's important too, but this first.

214
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,592
Let's make an Asian Games Special.

215
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,760
What kind of a special?

216
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,721
The event was a success
and we got good ratings,

217
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,348
so let's keep the momentum going.

218
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,227
We should use this to solidify
UBS Sports' position.

219
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,605
I'd like to film a few documentaries
and release them as a special.

220
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,690
Who wants to do it?

221
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,324
I don't know what that is,
but may I give it a shot?

222
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,623
Why did you take on something
you don't know?

223
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,501
I thought I'd learn something if I tried.

224
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,129
I wanted to put myself up to it.

225
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,090
I want to learn quickly
and improve quickly.

226
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,971
You enjoy this, don't you?

227
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,850
I do.

228
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,686
That's why I want to do it well.

229
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,196
I have more time than before,
so I'll call more often.

230
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,158
Did you see me on the news?

231
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,578
Of course. You were so nervous.
It was obvious you were new.

232
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,413
Do better, will you?

233
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,998
Are you doing well?

234
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,125
You got your report card, right?
How'd you do?

235
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,045
Bye. I don't want to talk to someone
to whom good grades define happiness.

236
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,215
How are Mom and Uncle?

237
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,259
Referee Smith asserted

238
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,386
-that his decision at the match was fair.
-Look at him.

239
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:43,390
He takes after his mom's side
of the family and looks just like me.

240
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,392
What are you talking about?

241
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,145
Yi-jin looks exactly like my darling.

242
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,606
-Nonsense.
-With UBS News, I'm Back Yi-jin.

243
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
Don't get me started.

244
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,694
He plays the video of your news clip
to anyone who comes over.

245
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,237
He's doing it now too.

246
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,073
No one asks to see it,
but he plays it anyway.

247
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,576
So? Do you find me embarrassing?

248
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,371
Not really. Just annoying.

249
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,457
Thanks for the compliment.

250
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,335
Tell Mom and Uncle that I say hi.

251
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,717
Hi.

252
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,429
Okay. Sure. Bye.

253
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,349
Hee-do!

254
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,019
Why that…

255
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,771
Hey!

256
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,252
Pick up.

257
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,045
Damn it.

258
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,799
Why won't he leave me alone?

259
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,264
NURTURING THE STRONGEST

260
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,849
Hi, Hee-do.

261
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,685
-Hi, Hee-do.
-Hi.

262
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,439
What's that?

263
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,156
What the heck?

264
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,951
What are you doing here?

265
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,703
We're doing a test shoot today.

266
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,830
A what shoot?

267
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,582
Didn't the federation tell you?
Didn't you tell her?

268
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,835
The federation called.

269
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,216
I see. I had a missed call.
I guess it was the federation.

270
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,926
Because you screen unknown numbers?

271
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,261
I do not.

272
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,309
You should have told me
ahead of time though.

273
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,894
As if you gave me a chance to.

274
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,066
What is the shoot for?

275
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,320
1999 ASIAN GAME SPECIAL
3-PART DOCUMENTARY SERIES

276
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,537
We're filming a three-part
documentary series on athletes

277
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,539
who made an impression at the Asian Games.

278
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,375
The two of you were selected
for the first part.

279
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,669
Why us?

280
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,130
There was drama surrounding your match.

281
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,217
So what do you want to film
in the documentary?

282
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,846
The fact that we're not close?
Us ignoring each other?

283
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,891
The way we treat each other
like we don't exist?

284
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,977
"They're like that
even outside of competitions."

285
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,815
You won't ask us to pretend to be close,
will you?

286
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,276
We're athletes, not actresses.

287
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,781
That's what the federation wants,
but I don't intend to.

288
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,700
I want it to reflect the truth

289
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,286
even if you don't get along.

290
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,287
For whose benefit?

291
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,373
So that people can hate me again?

292
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,921
Don't you have any faith in me?

293
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,549
Why do you keep disappointing me?

294
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,096
-What?
-What am I to you?

295
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,310
Have some faith.

296
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,314
I know both of you more than most people.

297
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,401
Once the documentary is completed,
I'll show it to you first.

298
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,863
If you don't like it, we won't air it.

299
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,198
I promise.

300
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,164
We want a scene of the team running
in the yard, so please come out.

301
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,165
-Okay!
-Okay.

302
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,543
-Which station are they from?
-UBS.

303
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,837
-What? UBS?
-We'll be on TV.

304
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,297
Hee-do, they're shooting in the yard.

305
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,061
Too bad you can't avoid me now.

306
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,316
That's not true.

307
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,193
Then why are you avoiding me?

308
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,280
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Tell me.

309
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,032
I need to hear it.

310
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,203
You're avoiding me
and ignoring all my calls and messages.

311
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,039
Am I supposed to just take it
without knowing why?

312
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,336
Have you thought about how I'd feel?

313
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,259
I was humiliated, that was why.

314
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,804
About what?

315
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,017
What you said that day?

316
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,151
You only said that
because you mistook me for Injeolmi,

317
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,569
who I am not.

318
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,905
So what's the problem?
It wasn't about me anyway.

319
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,407
Yes, it was. It was half about you.

320
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,371
If Injeolmi had been someone else,

321
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,540
I wouldn't have said
something that idiotic.

322
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,377
It was because it was you
that I said that.

323
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,008
That's why it was half about you.

324
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,930
So?

325
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,307
What was your plan?

326
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,393
Were you planning to avoid me forever?

327
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,562
Hoping we'd drift apart like this?

328
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,440
What do you think of our relationship?

329
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,567
What do you think it is?

330
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,655
Because of you, I'm…

331
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,661
I'm so confused.

332
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm jealous of you.

333
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,957
No. I like you.

334
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,209
But I have an inferiority complex
toward you.

335
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,962
What does that sound like to you?
You don't know, do you?

336
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,672
I don't either.

337
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,383
But I ended up saying I had to have you.

338
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,051
I must have lost my freaking mind.

339
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,554
I want to crawl into a hole and die.
My mind's completely blank!

340
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,391
I like being sure about things,

341
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,185
but everything is unclear
when I think about you.

342
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,690
That's why right now, I really…

343
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,776
hate you.

344
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,537
Seriously…

345
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,251
You're so honest. What the heck?

346
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,256
Why are you laughing?

347
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,511
Why are you laughing when my head's
about to explode from worrying?

348
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,310
Fine. You go on worrying.

349
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,022
I'm done worrying about it.
Not like I ever started, but still.

350
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,566
Gosh.

351
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,663
Sir.

352
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,043
What? Oh my gosh. Yi-jin.

353
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,587
How long has it been? My gosh.

354
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,757
I heard you became a reporter at UBS.

355
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,427
Wait. Are you the one
covering our fencing team?

356
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,555
Yes, I am.
Here's the request for your cooperation.

357
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,016
-I see.
-Thank you.

358
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,061
What do you mean? We want to thank you.

359
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,065
Gosh. It was tough, wasn't it?

360
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,484
I was shocked when I saw the news.

361
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,444
I see. Yes.

362
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,404
How are things now?

363
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,784
I'm just doing what I can.

364
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,702
You are?

365
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,373
Goodness. You were just a baby
but you're all grown up now.

366
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,625
Let me get you a cold drink.

367
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,543
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

368
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:06,393
FINAL EXAMS STUDENT RANKING
RANK 1, JI SEUNG-WAN

369
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,435
Where is she?

370
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,148
NA HEE-DO, RANK 320

371
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,733
"Rank 320"?

372
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,823
I guess her grades are the one thing
she doesn't worry about.

373
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,162
NA HEE-DO, RANK 320

374
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,833
COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM

375
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,178
Question one is two.

376
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,805
Hey.

377
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,225
Are you actually studying? What's wrong?

378
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,602
I have to do things that I hate
to achieve my goal.

379
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,688
What goal?

380
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,983
If you really decided to study,
just do social studies.

381
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,486
-That's the only one you can improve--
-Question eight is one.

382
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,957
DRIVER'S LICENSE TEST

383
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,753
Must you study this right now?

384
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,797
A hundred days should be plenty.

385
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,259
I want to pass something
when the others get into college.

386
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,969
You're really not going to college?

387
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,013
They don't teach what I want to learn.

388
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,811
The rankings are up on the bulletin board!

389
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,735
You're going to look? What for?

390
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,196
It feels good
to see my name on the bulletin board.

391
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,546
Ji-woong.

392
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,132
Hey, Yu-rim.

393
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,718
-Checking the results?
-Yes.

394
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,346
But I saw something shocking.

395
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,768
RANKINGS

396
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,770
RANK 321, KO YU-RIM
RANK 322, MOON JI-WOONG

397
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,940
You and I are the only ones
in that huge space.

398
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,234
Isn't it romantic?

399
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,195
You're in last place?

400
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,614
Yes. Is that bad?

401
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,908
No. I'm just grateful.

402
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,576
I was worried I'd be last.

403
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,703
So what if you're last?

404
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,122
Are you embarrassed?

405
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,626
Well, a little. Aren't you?

406
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,669
No.

407
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,172
It's obvious since I didn't try.

408
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,302
Not trying but hoping to do well
is more embarrassing in my opinion.

409
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,353
I'm home.

410
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,813
Welcome home.

411
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,774
Come here for a minute.

412
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,366
Tada. It's a gift.

413
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,703
A shop opened up in the market,
so I got you one.

414
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,497
I hear all the kids have one these days.

415
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,960
It would be good for you to have one
when you travel for competitions.

416
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,587
I can reach you right away then.

417
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,590
I won't be competing for a while.
You use it.

418
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,925
I'm always at the restaurant.

419
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,847
Then let's return it. I don't need it.

420
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,684
Yu-rim, it's a gift from your mom.

421
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,313
We have money problems.

422
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,441
You lost your savings
and stood surety for a loan.

423
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,401
That means we're in even more debt.

424
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,112
Shouldn't we save everything we can?

425
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,492
Can't you be happy like other daughters
if I buy you something?

426
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,994
How can I?

427
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,539
You cry all the time
and Dad's too busy working to come home.

428
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,626
My circumstances aren't the same
as other daughters.

429
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,878
How can I use this without feeling guilty?

430
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,553
I'm sorry I'm a bad mother
who makes her child worry about money.

431
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,014
I truly am.

432
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,976
But I got it
hoping I'd see you smile for once.

433
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,481
I wanted to be encouraged
by seeing you happy.

434
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,279
Can't you think about my feelings first
instead of money?

435
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,620
What can feelings do for us?

436
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,540
Feelings…

437
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,460
can't pay off our debt.

438
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,725
We can adjust the angle we want to take
as we're filming,

439
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,104
but I'd rather not make them
seem hostile or like enemies.

440
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,987
How can this documentary be
entertaining without that?

441
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,406
How about focusing
on the simultaneous touch?

442
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,742
The last point in the Asian Games

443
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,828
was supposedly a simultaneous touch.

444
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:21,040
That would imply we don't approve
of Na Hee-do's gold medal.

445
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,000
We can't do that.

446
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,504
Think about the ratings.

447
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,424
We need something dramatic
to draw viewers.

448
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,927
We can't exploit the athletes like that.

449
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,346
This isn't a variety show. It's sports.

450
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,860
Back Yi-jin speaking.

451
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,574
Yes, I have an article.
How much time do I have?

452
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,661
I can run over and do it right now. Okay.

453
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,546
Is something wrong?

454
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,175
Later. I have to deliver news
over the phone.

455
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,718
Over the phone?

456
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,429
Use our phone! It's for the news, right?

457
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,556
That's super urgent.

458
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,224
No one's home. Come on.

Thank you. Good night.

Thank God.

485
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,944
Thanks. You saved me.

486
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,906
I would have been a mess
if I had to run home and do it.

487
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,449
Does this happen often?

488
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,243
No. This is the radio.

489
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,036
It should have been a baseball recap,

490
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,956
but the game isn't over yet.
They're in extra innings.

491
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,375
That was why I had to fill in
with other news.

492
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,379
I see.

493
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,220
What's wrong?

494
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,723
Do you hate me again?

495
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,893
-Are you jealous? What is it?
-Damn it.

496
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,313
Goodness.

497
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,440
Did you worry about it some more?

498
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,859
About our relationship, I mean.

499
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,074
-There's no word that summarizes it.
-What?

500
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,952
A word that describes our relationship

501
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,871
doesn't exist yet.

502
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,959
Acquaintance. Friends. Lovers.

503
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,505
None of the words
that people have invented apply.

504
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,884
But I thought about it,

505
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,721
and only you and I know…

506
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,391
what our relationship is.

507
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,771
So, we can figure it out.

508
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,858
Although there's no word to describe it,

509
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,110
we can just make one up ourselves.

510
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,571
Make up a word?

511
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,910
Yes. For example,
our relationship is a phone.

512
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,204
It's a cup.

513
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,917
It's scissors.

514
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,838
Or it's a cloud, a rainbow…

515
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,925
We can just make it up.

516
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,722
I like rainbow.

517
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,433
Darn it. I like scissors.

518
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,231
Gosh, you…

519
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,950
Don't avoid me like that again.

520
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,618
I won't forgive you.

521
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,831
I guess you hated it.

522
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,459
The word "hate"
doesn't begin to describe it.

523
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,255
You helped me
get back on my feet numerous times.

524
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,383
You should take on the responsibility.

525
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,776
I should go. Thanks for today.

526
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,169
What about you?

527
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,720
You said you didn't worry about
what our relationship was.

528
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,022
What's your answer?

529
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,328
It's not a rainbow.

530
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,600
Hee-do.

531
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,953
Mom.

532
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,664
Mom?

533
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,416
Yi-jin.

534
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:24,004
Ma'am. Do you live here?

535
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,925
I mean, are you Hee-do's mother?

536
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,345
What are you doing here?

537
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,769
In other words,

538
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,480
you were the one who broke our statue?

539
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,024
That was how you two met.

540
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,820
Yes. I threw a newspaper. I'm very sorry.

541
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,030
I had him compensate me for it.

542
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,532
With what?

543
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,491
Full House.

544
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,536
-Are you mad?
-I'll pay for it now--

545
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,246
-Yi-jin.
-Yes, ma'am.

546
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,331
-Are you going out with Hee-do?
-Mom!

547
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,335
No, I'm not.

548
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,379
-Then what is it?
-A rainbow, okay?

549
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,716
-What?
-It's not what you think.

550
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,134
What do I think?

551
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,011
Your thoughts are always in the gutter.

552
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,016
Hey! How dare you talk to her that way?

553
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,189
What. Did you just yell at…

554
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,317
Are you taking my mom's side?

555
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,238
My professional life and my private life
are in conflict right now.

556
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,907
Please understand.

557
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,909
My point was…

558
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,454
was it because you knew Hee-do

559
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,123
that you interviewed the referee
at the Asian Games?

560
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,875
At the airport, at that.

561
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,047
No. I would have done that for anyone
even if it weren't Hee-do.

562
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,009
Don't apply to Sports for your assignment.

563
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,428
Pardon?

564
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,347
You two seem very close.

565
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,641
And you're in charge of fencing.

566
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,560
How could a reporter
and the subject be this close?

567
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,105
You'll be hurt and lose each other.
So apply elsewhere.

568
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,067
You don't think it'll happen, right?

569
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,318
It will.

570
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm saying this as a senior reporter,
not as Hee-do's mom.

571
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,662
And don't tell people
that I'm Hee-do's mom.

572
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,624
She'll be on the news more going forward.
It won't do her any good.

573
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,795
Jeez. It's all about work.

574
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,674
Do you have
absolutely nothing to say as my mom?

575
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,553
Get along.

576
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,399
Do you know why you're mistaken?

577
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,277
You failed to keep a distance
from the subject.

578
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,612
Was it because you knew Hee-do

579
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,282
that you interviewed the referee
at the Asian Games?

580
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,825
At the airport, at that.

581
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,044
Thank you.

582
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,005
You don't need to thank me.

583
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,090
I would have done the same for anyone.

584
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,294
Hey. Let's get tteokbokki for lunch.

585
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,171
Yu-rim's restaurant reopened.

586
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,465
Really? Didn't they go under?

587
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,010
I heard her parents stood surety
and went bankrupt.

588
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,303
Really?

589
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,348
I knew that bitch had it coming.

590
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,059
She pulled that crap
during the Asian Games about the call

591
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,061
and made Hee-do look like a jerk.

592
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,687
I know. That bitch.

593
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,856
Maybe she put on a show

594
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,609
for the gold medal pension
because her family needed money.

595
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,988
Yes, I guess so. She's so pathetic.

596
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,290
Come out.

597
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:32,419
-Get out here, you pieces of trash!
-Let go!

598
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,297
Say that again. Yu-rim what?

599
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,425
How dare you good-for-nothings
talk about Yu-rim like that?

600
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,843
You crazy bitch.

601
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,304
-Hey.
-Hey. Get her.

602
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,350
Are you okay? You bitch!

603
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,978
-Hey! I'll get you.
-Hey!

604
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,773
-Let go!
-Who the hell are you?

605
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,401
-Come on.
-Shit!

606
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,278
Yu-rim must have heard you!

607
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,415
Don't you run your mouths again.

608
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,709
You pathetic losers.

609
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,760
Hey, Hee-do.

610
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,681
Who are you to take my side?

611
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,519
I said I was fine.

612
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,605
Why'd you take my side
and make me look like an idiot?

613
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,914
Hey.

614
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,625
Why are you crying?

615
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,879
I don't know what to do

616
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,965
because you keep doing that.

617
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,845
Do you know how difficult things
have become for me because of you?

618
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,726
What did I do?

619
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,398
Just now, it was because
what they said made me upset and--

620
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,150
I'm Injeolmi.

621
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,330
Is Injeolmi a username?

622
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,916
I'm not Injeolmi.

623
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,544
Anyway, it really isn't me.

624
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,230
What?

625
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,481
Hey.

626
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,690
Hey, Yu-rim!

627
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,002
Say that again.

628
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,381
You're Injeolmi?

629
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,895
I'm sorry.

630
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,773
I'm sorry I'm Injeolmi.

631
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,069
I'm really sorry.

632
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,740
I didn't know you were Ryder37.

633
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,203
So I looked down on you
and was mean to you.

634
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,040
I'm so sorry, Hee-do.

635
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,548
I was so lonely and struggling.

636
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,219
You were always the one to comfort me.

637
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,306
But I had no idea.

638
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,522
Yu-rim.

639
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,485
It's okay.

640
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,574
Just promise me one thing.

641
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,669
Diving.

642
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,965
Don't ever do that again.

643
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,260
It's too dangerous.

644
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,100
Promise you won't do it again.

645
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,510
I'm so sorry.

646
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,138
I'm sorry too.

647
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,182
No, I'm sorry.

648
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,669
EDITING ROOM

649
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,588
You're still here.
Don't you have a shoot today?

650
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,133
Yes. I'm going to head out now.

651
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,300
Okay.

652
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,387
-Hey, Yi-jin.
-Yes?

653
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,264
I'm thinking of shooting the opening

654
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,558
in the public hall
when we interview the athletes.

655
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,728
On stage?

656
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,480
Do you have something in mind?

657
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,151
Of course. I'm the producer after all.

658
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,362
Well, we'll hang them using wires

659
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,991
and have them fly in
and stab each other like martial arts.

660
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,409
What do you think?

661
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,953
The stuff you shot is boring.

662
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,622
Let's make at least the opening exciting.

663
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,458
Well…

664
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,378
Not only is that
not the angle we're taking,

665
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,466
let's avoid anything
that may injure the athletes.

666
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,177
Come on. They're athletes for a reason.

667
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,764
If they're that frail,
how do they compete internationally?

668
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,433
No. I'm sorry, sir.

669
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,775
That young punk keeps saying no.

670
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,753
Are you okay, Yu-rim?
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

671
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,922
-What?
-I'm fine, Hee-do.

672
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,926
-What?
-Let me see.

673
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,302
I'm really okay.

674
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,473
Are you okay?

675
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,226
I'm fine.

676
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,188
Is your butt okay?

677
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,983
-Can you stand up?
-I'm fine.

678
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,783
-You must be hot.
-I'm fine. I don't get hot easily.

679
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,086
Let's share.

680
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,964
Okay.

681
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,225
You eat first.

682
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,061
No, you eat first.

683
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,486
-Hold on. Wait a minute.
-Okay.

684
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,737
Let's take a quick break.

685
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,579
What are you two doing?

686
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,372
Is this a blind date?

687
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,916
What?

688
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,043
You're not like this normally.

689
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,212
Why are you acting? I never asked you to.

690
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,630
We're not acting.

691
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,722
Hold on. Do you now know
who each other are?

692
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,223
That's right.

693
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,226
And I found out that you lied to me.

694
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,271
You bought a yellow rose for an interview?

695
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,648
I thought it sounded weird.

696
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,901
Have her apologize for that.

697
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,779
-She made me do it.
-What did Yu-rim do wrong? Whatever.

698
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,995
She made me do it.

699
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,420
It's so awkward chatting with you
now that I know who you are.

700
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,508
I know, but let's be
completely open and honest

701
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,011
with each other as we have been.

702
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,554
At least here.

703
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,353
Well, then I have something to tell you.

704
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,356
What is it?

705
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,986
I wasn't disappointed
that you were Injeolmi.

706
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,998
I also have something to tell you.

707
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,584
What is it?

708
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,681
I'm really sorry about the Asian Games.

709
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,767
I never imagined that would happen.

710
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,031
It's okay. I understand.

711
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,866
Yes, it hurt a lot,

712
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,119
but it healed a few days ago.

713
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,749
When your mom hugged me,

714
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,754
all of the hurt and sadness melted away.

715
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,593
What can feelings do for us?

716
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,098
Feelings can't pay off our debt.

717
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:23,737
Your mom comforted me.
Something even my mom didn't do.

718
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,865
I'm really grateful.

719
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,081
ELEPHANT SNACKS

720
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,000
Elephant Snacks.

721
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,085
Mom.

722
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,798
Yu-rim? Aren't you home?

723
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,468
I wanted to make a call on my cellphone.

724
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,595
I can hear you great.

725
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,266
You're right. It is good.

726
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,853
Mom. I didn't know,

727
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,398
but there are debts
that feelings do repay.

728
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,653
I'm sorry for getting mad
when I didn't know anything.

729
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,406
And…

730
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,326
I've always wanted a cellphone.

731
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,953
I love it, to be honest.

732
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,082
I'm glad.

733
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,168
That's enough for me.

734
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,517
You're still a student, so I'll do
just enough to look good on camera.

735
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,479
Do you like it?

736
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,155
It looks really different
having a pro do it.

737
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,826
When I went to the club…

738
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,579
Never mind.

739
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,295
Na Hee-do. Hello.

740
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,297
-Hello.
-Hello.

741
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

742
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,457
Yi-jin.

743
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,377
Mr. Back.

744
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,971
Come here.

745
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,108
You look pretty.

746
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,573
Will all of these people

747
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,326
watch me being interviewed?

748
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,620
I'm so nervous.

749
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:23,041
Then I'll ask them all to leave
during the interview.

750
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,251
We can be alone.

751
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,298
-Can we do that?
-Yes. Why not?

752
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,799
They'll leave if you want.

753
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,221
Don't be nervous, okay?

754
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,892
Okay. Did Yu-rim finish already?

755
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,353
Yes. She should be in the public hall.

756
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,482
-Should we get ready?
-Okay.

757
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,692
Sit here.

758
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,154
Yi-jin, which is her prettier side?

759
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,447
Her left side.

760
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,296
Where should I look? Into the camera?

761
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,465
Look at me.

762
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,388
Is this more comfortable?

763
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,682
Not at all.

764
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,311
But I like it more.

765
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,526
I have a question.

766
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,069
What is it?

767
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,905
Do I really look prettier from the left?

768
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,116
Yes. Am I wrong?

769
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,036
I never thought about it.

770
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,707
I'll be the one to think about it…

771
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,836
so trust me, will you?

772
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,424
I don't want you getting hurt.

773
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,099
Start with "Salut" when we begin.

774
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,267
Okay.

775
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,605
Hee-do.

776
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,441
Hey, Yu-rim.

777
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,570
-Hi.
-Yes, hi.

778
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,699
Are you coming from your interview?

779
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,658
Yes.

780
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,620
It was so awkward.

781
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,290
I still feel that way.

782
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:30,960
Me too.

783
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,771
Nice.

784
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,732
That was great.

785
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:58,071
Can we do a few more things?

786
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,322
Like what?

787
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:03,785
Remember that dispute you had
about the simultaneous touch?

788
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,662
It starts there,

789
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,372
so let's do a simultaneous touch.

790
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,832
The referee concluded
that it wasn't simultaneous.

791
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,418
Yes, I know that.

792
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,672
But we need it for the documentary
since that's our angle.

793
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:20,301
I think it would be great for the opening.
It'll be impactful and dynamic.

794
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,017
We want it to look good.

795
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,020
This documentary was created
for the two of you.

796
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,563
Can't you do that much for us?

797
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,444
Give us time to discuss it.

798
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,696
Sure.

799
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,281
Okay.

800
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,285
Okay.

801
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,497
Are you okay with it?

802
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,582
Yes, I am.

803
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,793
Let's keep a far enough distance.

804
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,587
-Should we aim for the shoulders?
-Yes.

805
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,131
I'll do my best to keep my distance.

806
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,260
-Please say, "Prêtes? Allez."
-Sure. Okay.

807
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,845
Let's begin!

808
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,683
En garde.

809
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,520
Prêtes? Allez.

810
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,025
Relax and with more power.

811
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,279
En garde.

812
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,281
Prêtes? Allez.

813
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,495
You're being way too cautious.
I want more power.

814
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,747
Again.

815
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,249
En garde. Prêtes?

816
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,876
Allez.

817
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,296
Again.

818
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,177
Again.

819
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,889
Make it look realistic, will you?

820
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,390
Again.

821
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,308
En garde.

822
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,894
Prêtes? Allez!

823
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,816
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

824
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,820
How long must we do this?

825
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,324
Exactly. How long will you fake it?

826
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,786
We could have finished in one take
if you did it right.

827
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,664
Do it like a real competition.
Why are you both being so cautious?

828
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,501
Do you think the program is a game?

829
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,337
Again.

830
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,678
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

831
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,649
Okay.

832
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,733
En garde.

833
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,111
Prêtes? Allez!

834
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,825
Are you okay?

835
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,328
Hold on.

836
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,788
Bring us a pain reliever!

837
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,957
-Where does it hurt?
-I think I twisted it.

838
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:56,999
Can you take off your shoe?

839
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,672
I think we should flip back and forth
after the same question.

840
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,507
-Like this?
-Yes.

841
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,010
Their personalities are different,
so showing them like that…

842
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,345
Excuse me.

843
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,848
Back Yi-jin speaking.

844
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:25,820
Damn it.

845
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,950
Hee-do, are you all right?

846
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,411
What? I hurt my ankle a little.

847
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,662
What happened?

848
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,664
During the simultaneous touch…

849
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,083
Simultaneous touch?

850
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,585
Yes, so…

851
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,421
We wanted to shoot the simultaneous touch

852
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,672
like at the Asian Games.

853
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,758
Didn't we agree to shoot
only the greeting?

854
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,512
I clearly said we won't shoot
the simultaneous touch.

855
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,392
Did I put them on wires
or make them do martial arts?

856
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,477
It was just a simultaneous touch--

857
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,897
Simultaneous touches
result in the most injuries.

858
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,690
Their hands collide and break!

859
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,401
Their ankles collide and get twisted!

860
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,862
Simultaneous touches
cause the most injuries.

861
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,033
Why did you make them do that?
You know nothing.

862
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,702
Hey you. Are you done?

863
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,831
I treated you with respect as a reporter,
you young punk.

864
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,042
Am I doing this for myself?

865
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,087
I did it for the program!
I'm doing my job!

866
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,425
What will you do
if we don't get the ratings?

867
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,053
I'll take responsibility.

868
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,599
But what if the athletes get injured?
Will you take responsibility?

869
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,017
How will you do that?

870
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,853
They have competitions lined up
starting next year.

871
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,356
How will you take responsibility?

872
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,942
Come on. Let's go.

873
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,954
Yi-jin.

874
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,457
Mr. Back.

875
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,214
I'm really okay.

876
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,052
Let's go to the hospital.

877
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,822
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

878
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,200
It isn't your fault.

879
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,079
If I hadn't fallen--

880
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,164
He shouldn't have made you do it.

881
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,628
It was okay at first,

882
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,090
but he kept saying
to do it like a real match.

883
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,554
It sounded like he was your senior.

884
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,306
Won't you get in trouble?

885
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,518
Who cares about rank in that situation?

886
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,859
I feel like
I should have been seriously injured.

887
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,029
But you know what?

888
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,115
I think I'm okay.

889
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:20,202
If you really did get injured,

890
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,705
I'll kill him.

891
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:29,712
I'm sorry.

892
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,591
I should have been with you.

893
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,846
You're with me now.

894
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,976
You always were and are now.

895
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,980
In the end, you're always with me.

896
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,247
What? Look, a rainbow.

897
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,292
That's so cool.

898
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,419
Can we pull over and look?

899
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,138
Gosh.

900
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,558
I've never seen a rainbow this big before.

901
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,228
Are you okay? What about the pain?

902
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,063
It's gone. It doesn't hurt.

903
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,358
We're still seeing a doctor.

904
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,070
Okay, so you should look too.

905
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,988
This is a rare opportunity.

906
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,244
Gosh.

907
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,673
It's pretty, right?

908
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,058
You have a knack
for leading me to a good place.

909
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,519
What do you mean?

910
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,148
I ran over because it was you.

911
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:13,941
Today?

912
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,944
No. During the Asian Games.

913
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,780
I ran to the airport
to interview the referee.

914
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,410
I thought about it,

915
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,164
and I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't you.

916
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,003
But I should have gone for anyone.

917
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,338
Because I'm a reporter.

918
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:42,970
You made me do
what was right for a reporter to do.

919
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,187
You always lead me to do what's right

920
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,814
and to a good place.

921
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,821
That's…

922
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,161
my definition of our relationship.

923
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:10,080
Also known as a rainbow.

924
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,925
Wait. You said it wasn't a rainbow.

925
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:24,678
You still haven't said what it was
if not a rainbow.

926
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:33,687
Love.

927
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,653
It's love.

928
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:50,079
I love you, Hee-do.

929
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,626
I don't need…

930
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,089
a rainbow.

931
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,052
What I had to give up for fencing?

932
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,512
Typical teenage memories.

933
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,431
But did something happen?

934
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,394
Jung-hyuk.
Do you think I'm doing a good job?

935
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,980
-Oh gosh, really?
-Do you know what makes you truly evil?

936
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,815
-That's awesome!
-I did it!

937
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,109
We can go to the beach!

938
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,238
It feels like I've found
all the missing pieces in my world.

939
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,823
I'm happy.

940
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,453
Why do I feel like
this moment will last forever?

941
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,580
Maybe it will be.

942
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:19,126
I think I can do anything
if I'm with Yi-jin.

943
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:30,929
