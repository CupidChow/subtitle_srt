1
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,504
Min-chae, Mom is here!

2
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,257
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,265
-Where's Grandma?
-She went out to meet a friend.

4
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,017
So what brings you here?

5
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,271
Your grandma wanted a new cutting board,
so I brought one.

6
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,233
What is that?

7
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,442
What?

8
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,279
Did you get a bruise?
When did this happen?

9
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,325
This? I don't know. I probably got it
while practicing for the contest.

10
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,536
Yet it's still there?

11
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,246
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,874
-Let's go to the hospital. Get dressed.
-I don't need to see a doctor for this.

13
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,167
I get it all the time.

14
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,461
It could get worse
if you leave it unattended.

15
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,796
It's okay.

16
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,007
You should know. You've had this
all the time when you were fencing.

17
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,175
Stop overreacting.

18
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,969
I am me and you are you.

19
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,262
Get ready so we can go.

20
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,988
I did go to the hospital,

21
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,365
but it was embarrassing
because I was totally fine.

22
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,743
Everything is all right.
I only got a bruise on my toenail.

23
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,745
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,916
Wait. Did that come out sounding weird?
To say I'm glad that it's a bruise.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,668
No, you're right.

26
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,713
It's not like
I ruptured a ligament or tore a muscle.

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,049
I know, right?
Still, keep a close eye on the bruise.

28
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,969
It could hurt
if a new toenail grows underneath that.

29
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,388
Yes, I know.

30
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,058
Why do we know about these things?

31
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,104
I was really worried about you.
You seemed to be in great pain.

32
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,693
Now I have someone who tells me
that they're worried about me.

33
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,070
And…

34
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,116
I also have someone
who tells me that they love me.

35
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,536
Love.

36
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,251
It's love.

37
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,636
I love you, Hee-do.

38
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,058
I don't need…

39
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,312
a rainbow.

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,075
You love me?

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,205
I…

42
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,257
I don't think
my feelings for you are that big.

43
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,346
Well, you see,

44
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,975
this has nothing to do with
what you think of me.

45
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,352
Whatever you do,

46
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,062
or no matter what you look like,

47
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,190
I'm in love with you for who you are.

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,112
Right. I couldn't ask for
anything more than to make you happier

49
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,073
by telling you how I feel about you.

50
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,285
Nothing more to ask for?

51
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,914
How is that possible?

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,251
Is that what love is?

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,256
For you, it is.

54
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,264
I'm happy.

55
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,238
It feels like I've found
all the missing pieces in my world.

56
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,783
I feel like
I can befriend anything unfamiliar,

57
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,871
and overcome difficulties
that will come my way.

58
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,789
I feel stronger.

59
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,710
Suddenly, I'm not afraid of anything.

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,799
I think I can do anything
if I'm with Yi-jin.

61
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,021
What I had to give up for fencing?

62
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,982
Typical teenage memories.

63
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,651
There are things
we can do only at our age,

64
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,779
like going on a field trip
or a school trip.

65
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,323
I've never been on any of those.

66
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,201
Well, I would like to go on a school trip.

67
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,330
On the morning of the trip,
I would see the buses lined up

68
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,123
and everyone so excited.

69
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,501
Yet I had to go to the gym.
That feeling was just…

70
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,011
Do you know about
the get-together tonight?

71
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,262
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,516
So how is Na Hee-do's ankle?

73
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,767
What did the doctor say?

74
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,726
She's fine.

75
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,562
But how did you know that she got injured?

76
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,606
You lashed out at the hall
and expected people not to talk about it?

77
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,109
-I see.
-Did you apologize to Mr. Park?

78
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,654
Do I have to?

79
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,823
No, you don't.

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,450
One of you can drop out of the series.

81
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,745
And be uncomfortable
every time you two are in the office,

82
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,374
while the rest of us are stuck in between,
trying to read the room.

83
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,629
In the real world, you make an apology

84
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,507
for the sake of everyone's peace.
It's nothing personal.

85
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:10,972
Society doesn't care at all
about an individual finding peace.

86
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,687
I wonder what we are having tonight.

87
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,441
I hope it's not pork belly. Right?

88
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,322
Thank you all for today.

89
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,324
-That was great, sir.
-Thank you.

90
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,244
-Great job!
-Thank you.

91
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,079
-That was good work.
-Thank you.

92
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,832
-Thanks for the hard work.
-Thank you, sir.

93
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
Do you want to talk to me?

94
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,301
I would like to apologize.

95
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,184
Hey, there's no need.
You're embarrassing me.

96
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,728
These things can happen
while working, right?

97
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,941
Why don't we talk outside?

98
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,818
Let's go.

99
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,665
Mr. Park has a big heart.

100
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,917
I'll say.

101
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,344
Say what you have to say.

102
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,846
I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,017
I shouldn't have done that yesterday.
I didn't think it through.

104
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,689
Has that got anything to do with
your low level of education?

105
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,361
Our network went nuts to hire
a high school graduate

106
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,821
and look what kind of mess
that has caused, right?

107
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,075
Wait, has this instead got to do

108
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,494
with you being a young master?

109
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:01,999
Hey.

110
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,045
Hey! What's with that attitude
when your family has been ruined,

111
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,880
you useless idiot.

112
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,050
I heard that even if the rich fails,
generations can live off of the fortune.

113
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,886
So you've still got some nerves
to talk back to me?

114
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,224
Your dad must be doing great, right?

115
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,688
What is it? What are you looking at?
Do you want to hit me?

116
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,066
Go ahead. Go on and hit me.

117
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,319
It's a win-win if one of us leaves.

118
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,447
Who do you think will, though?

119
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,950
Do you think it will be me?

120
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,289
I've moved heaven and earth
to keep this job.

121
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,930
-Cheers!
-Thank you.

122
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,892
-Is your dad doing well?
-Yes, sir.

123
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,812
-I love you, sir.
-It's okay.

124
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,065
You're a good drinker.

125
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,069
It's like yesterday
when you've joined as trainees,

126
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,490
but you all seem very at ease
after covering an international game.

127
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,120
But sir, it was really tough.

128
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,206
I can't even remember how it all ended.

129
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,585
Trainees who experience
covering for an international event

130
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,378
-learn quickly.
-That's right.

131
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,506
Yes, sir. They can also look experienced
to the newcomers next year.

132
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,674
-Right.
-I know.

133
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,343
Right. Did you hear that, sir?

134
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,929
They might put educational requirements
back in place when hiring next time.

135
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,475
Really? Then high school graduates
can't apply anymore?

136
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,101
Yes, that's under discussion.

137
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,355
Then we have with us here today

138
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,024
a high school graduate reporter
who will be living proof.

139
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,735
Congratulations, Back Yi-jin.

140
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,612
In that case,

141
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,658
I want our high school graduate reporter
to pour me a drink.

142
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,575
Here.

143
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,536
Here.

144
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,623
Hey, my arm is hurting.

145
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,875
Yes, sir.

146
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,587
Please allow a high school graduate
reporter to pour you a drink.

147
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,593
Look at that. He's become sassy.

148
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,429
All right. This time,
let's have a round of drinks

149
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,350
to an outsider to UBS
and our lucky adventurer,

150
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,436
a high school graduate, Back Yi-jin.

151
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,106
Come on. Cheers!

152
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,400
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

153
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,111
-Yes, Yi-jin!
-That's great!

154
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,321
Drink up.

155
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,659
I heard you fought with Park.

156
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,078
How did it go? Did you apologize to him?

157
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,082
Well, yes. And he accepted it.

158
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,959
That's good.

159
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,797
How about a karaoke bar after this?

160
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,300
-A karaoke bar!
-Yes!

161
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,303
-We have to take away his microphone.
-I'm sorry.

162
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,180
I should go home.

163
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,310
Taxi!

164
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,063
Someone's already in it.

165
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,903
Hey, Yi-jin. Stand up straight.

166
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,822
Gosh, you're such a nuisance.

167
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,245
Are you laughing?

168
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,959
Hey.

169
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,836
Are you all right?

170
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,383
Jung-hyuk.

171
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,804
Do you think I'm doing a good job?

172
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,308
Look at what you're doing now. Are you?

173
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,645
You're right.

174
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,359
I really have to do well, though.

175
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,906
You'll get better as you learn.
Why are you under so much pressure?

176
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,491
You haven't even worked for a year.

177
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,993
No, sir.

178
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,163
I really have to do a good job.

179
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,458
If I mess up,

180
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,170
the educational requirements
could be put in place again.

181
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,381
Then people like me

182
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,594
won't even get a chance.

183
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,466
Yes, Back Yi-jin speaking.

184
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,094
Hello. What are you doing?

185
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,138
Dad?

186
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,265
Are you

187
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,475
still at the office?

188
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,769
Then I should hang up.

189
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,022
No, I'm home. I got back home.

190
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,524
Did you drink?

191
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,401
You sound like it.

192
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,153
Yes, there was an office get-together.

193
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,363
I see.

194
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,242
How do you like your workplace?

195
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,496
Well…

196
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,166
Is something wrong?

197
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,668
It's just…

198
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,254
all these things happened,

199
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,216
but I'm fine.
I mean, that is life for everyone.

200
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,555
Are you having a tough time?

201
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,310
Dad…

202
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,021
Dad.

203
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,275
How did you do something like this
for over 30 years?

204
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,573
I tried for 30 years,

205
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,909
but the result wasn't great.

206
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,703
I failed.

207
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,415
It's not a failure

208
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,252
but just a hardship, Dad.

209
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,926
This is the price to pay for once being
much happier than the others.

210
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,266
This kind of hardship is nothing

211
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,102
compared to the happiness that
I've enjoyed.

212
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,817
You were my greatest consolation
ten years ago,

213
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,404
and you still are now.

214
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,242
I am glad
you still have a lot of love with you.

215
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,499
Thank you,

216
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,961
for raising me to be who I am.

217
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,360
Yu-rim, I'm home!

218
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,445
-I'm home!
-Dad!

219
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,782
-My daughter! How long has it been?
-Dad!

220
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,076
Why didn't you come home sooner?

221
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,578
I'm sorry. I was very busy.

222
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,456
Have you eaten?

223
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,458
Come on in. Let's eat together.

224
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,460
Before we eat…

225
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,381
this should come first.
This is for you, Yu-rim.

226
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,931
A CD player?

227
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,393
Yes. I heard that you listen to CDs
instead of cassettes these days. Right?

228
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,770
Well, you're right. But…

229
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,193
This is amazing.
How did you know I wanted this, Dad?

230
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,904
Hey, there's nothing
I don't know about you.

231
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,406
It's so obvious.

232
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,992
So, do you like it?

233
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,495
Of course, I love it! Thank you.

234
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,097
Hey, weren't you into rock music?

235
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,724
Why are you hanging around here?

236
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,642
I think the era of hip-hop is coming.

237
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,227
Really? Why?

238
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,772
I can feel it in my bones.

239
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,990
-Hey, can I borrow your cell just once?
-No.

240
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,242
Why you little…

241
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,846
Yes, can I ask who paged me?

242
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,307
This is me, Yu-rim.

243
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,435
Yu-rim.

244
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,354
Where are you now?

245
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,357
That doesn't matter.
Where do you want me to go?

246
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,399
Can you come?

247
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,734
Of course!

248
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,029
But did something happen?

249
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,950
I'm just a little upset.

250
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,415
Yu-rim!

251
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,470
Is that your number on my pager?

252
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,265
Yes, I got a cell phone.

253
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,228
I also got a CD player today.

254
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,188
That's nice!

255
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,190
But the thing is, I don't have any CDs.

256
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,443
You're supposed to get a CD

257
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,529
with a CD player when it's a gift.

258
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,573
Who is that bad at gift-giving?

259
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,532
My dad.

260
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,450
Geez.

261
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,620
That's very considerate of your dad.

262
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,039
Since we all have different music tastes,

263
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,002
he is showing how much he respects you
by not getting you a CD.

264
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,422
That's very meaningful
and thoughtful. Gosh.

265
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,052
You must have felt great
with all the gifts.

266
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,221
What upset you?

267
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,890
The thing is…

268
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,101
These gifts are the problem.

269
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,232
Did you hear too?

270
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
Our family stood surety
for a loan that's in default.

271
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,362
No. A loan that's in default?

272
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,239
So what's going to happen?

273
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,991
We will be in more debt.

274
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,244
But we're in a lot of debt already.

275
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,789
My mom skimps on even toilet paper,

276
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,792
and my Dad wears a pair of shoes
for more than ten years.

277
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,462
But for me, my mom got a cell phone

278
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,757
and my dad got a CD player.

279
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,259
Why?

280
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,596
So that I would buy them,

281
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,515
pretending that our house is fine.

282
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,394
They don't want me to worry about money
so that I can stay as their childish girl.

283
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,941
So what did you do?

284
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,068
I gave them what they wanted.

285
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,947
I overreacted with happiness and joy.

286
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,742
That's what they wanted to see.

287
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,535
You are such a grown-up.

288
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,081
My mom always cries because of me.

289
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,708
Does she? Why?

290
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,877
Just, you know.

291
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,505
I guess she doesn't like me.

292
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,813
To be honest, I felt pretty good today.

293
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,483
Because you called
when you were feeling down.

294
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,405
We promised.

295
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,616
You remembered.

296
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,577
I remember too.

297
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,373
Zero-one-six,
two-four-three, eight-four-three-nine.

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,502
What? Is that my cell phone number?

299
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,629
Even I haven't memorized it yet.

300
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,383
I don't know why I can remember
anything that's related to you.

301
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,263
How great would it be
if you were a school subject?

302
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,268
Yu-rim.

303
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,769
Yes?

304
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,233
Can I ask you out?

305
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,450
If not,

306
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,702
then I won't.

307
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,501
I think you can.

308
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,591
All right.

309
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,477
Don't get nervous. I won't do it now.

310
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,354
Come on!

311
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,533
-Hey, Seung-wan!
-Hey.

312
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,368
What are you doing here?

313
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,703
The same goes for you.

314
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,455
I was on my way home
after studying at school

315
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,582
and found these
thrown away in good condition.

316
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,752
So I was taking them to the hangout
and here I am.

317
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,214
-"The hangout"?
-Carrying all this to the rooftop alone?

318
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,591
Are you losing your mind
with the CSAT coming up in 100 days?

319
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,427
And we are graduating soon.
What's the point?

320
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,554
Because I feel empty inside.

321
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,681
You've got time, right?
Help me carry them.

322
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,683
-To where?
- To our hangout.

323
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,190
I'm getting a déjà vu.

324
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,983
This is my first time
coming to school at night.

325
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,151
Really?

326
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,612
It's okay.

327
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,786
Yu-rim, please stop doing that.

328
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,747
Those footsteps. Did you hear that?

329
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,166
No, you misheard it.

330
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,087
But I'm sure I heard something.
Or did I mishear it?

331
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,618
-Someone's here!
-Hurry up!

332
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,246
That's Dae Gyeong High uniform.
They're stealing something.

333
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,039
Hey, they're seat cushion thieves.

334
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,374
-The CSAT.
-The CSAT.

335
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,294
Why you little… Hey, stop right there!

336
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,590
Guys!

337
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,469
Seung-wan, give me a push!

338
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,933
Blast off!

339
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,400
-Who is this jerk?
-Get the cushions and get up!

340
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,402
Where do you think you're going, thieves!

341
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,737
-Ignore him.
-Give it back!

342
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,906
Our students need to do well on the CSAT.

343
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,657
-Let me go!
-Do you think I will?

344
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,870
Our school students studied really hard!
I won't let you take them!

345
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,126
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

346
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,713
Ko Yu-rim?

347
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,840
You know who I am, so this should be easy.

348
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,803
Leave the cushions and get out,
unless you want holes in your body.

349
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,225
By the way, that cushion is mine.

350
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,228
For your information,
I haven't washed it for a year.

351
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,731
It's covered in saliva.
Are you going to be okay with that?

352
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,942
Darn it. That's gross.

353
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,028
You've been caught,
so your plan has failed, nitwits.

354
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,864
Drop everything you have in your hands
and get lost.

355
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,283
I'll let this slide if you run now.

356
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,661
It will be worse
if I call over the security guard.

357
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,828
Darn it.

358
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,790
Why you…

359
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,336
Let's go.

360
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,383
Fail your test, you morons!

361
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,679
Please, let them fail.

362
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,933
Ji-woong, are you okay?

363
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,228
Yes.

364
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,439
-I'm fine.
-Are you running a fever?

365
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,530
-Get up, will you?
-Yes.

366
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,086
What's going on?

367
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,254
That's mine.

368
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,549
Everyone, come and get your seat cushion.

369
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,136
Thank you.

370
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,512
Thanks for the snack. Here.

371
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,888
Thanks.

372
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,517
I heard you caught
the Dae Gyeong High students.

373
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,644
-Thanks.
-Thanks for the snack.

374
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,731
Don't get it mixed up.
Collect them in order.

375
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,443
-Thank you.
-No problem. Slow down.

376
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,069
See you.

377
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,822
What is all this?

378
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,454
Seriously? You punks…

379
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,711
Ji-woong, it's you again.

380
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,798
Sir, I mopped up
the seat cushion thieves last night.

381
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,175
Why are you not studying

382
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,053
and doing something
no one has asked you to do?

383
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,221
Follow me.

384
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,769
Come right away!

385
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,148
Why were you at school at that time?

386
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,696
The evening study hours were over,

387
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,991
and you don't even come for that.

388
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,118
What were you doing at school?

389
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,245
Aren't you going to talk?

390
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,873
Look at you.

391
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,167
Get down on all fours.

392
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,547
Get down on all fours, you punk.

393
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,973
You're the bad apple that ruins the bunch.

394
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,145
If you get bad grades,
you should stay low-key.

395
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,607
It's not like anyone is
forcing you to study.

396
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,818
-You stupid…
-Sir!

397
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,448
Ji-woong was with me.

398
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,867
-With you?
-Yes.

399
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,994
Why?

400
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,789
I had left my workbook at school.

401
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,251
I was scared to come alone,
so I asked him to come with me.

402
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,837
Is that so?

403
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,926
Why on earth
do you hang out with a punk like him?

404
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,971
You should surround yourself
with people like you.

405
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,347
Get up.

406
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,191
You are lucky
Seung-wan came to save you today.

407
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,295
Gosh.

408
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,930
Hey.

409
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,641
I'm the one who got hit.
Why are you so worked up?

410
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,479
I'm fine.

411
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,564
This happens often.

412
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,865
Put on some ointment when you get home.

413
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,285
And don't get caught by your mom
while you're at it.

414
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,632
Today, my friend got hit
by a teacher for nothing.

415
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,425
I'm sure you all know

416
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,512
that the office of education
banned corporal punishment at schools.

417
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,639
But is it really being carried out?

418
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,974
Why aren't the teachers abiding by it?

419
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,644
Is that such a privilege?
Can't they just let it go?

420
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,272
This thought would have crossed your mind
when a teacher hit you.

421
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,150
"Do I deserve to be hit for this?"

422
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,865
It's true that we learn
a lot of things at school.

423
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,827
But one of them is violence.

424
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,913
We are learning from school
that it's natural

425
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,958
for a person to hit another person.

426
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,336
It's ridiculous.

427
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,966
And the place we call school…
don't you find it odd?

428
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,054
The only places on earth that
gather people and put numbers on them,

429
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,973
surrounded by walls

430
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,143
are schools and prisons.

431
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,191
DJ Wanseung's pirate radio show.

432
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,777
This is all for today.

433
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,543
As a punishment for being a student,

434
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,713
we are incarcerated
in a prison called school

435
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,383
and wear school uniforms,
which are prison garbs…

436
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,303
Mom, you have to knock!

437
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,263
Were you watching something inappropriate?

438
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,935
Did I interrupt your fun time?

439
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,187
Come on. It's nothing like that.

440
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,733
What is it?

441
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,234
Yi-jin is coming this weekend.

442
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,571
If you don't want him nagging at you,

443
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,865
clean up your room
and hide your report card.

444
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,909
I got it. I have it all under control.

445
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,747
Geez, you are going through
some puberty there.

446
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,054
How should I ask Yu-rim out?

447
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,181
Are you going to?

448
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,808
I already told her that I'm going to.

449
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,435
What is that?

450
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,107
-Great job.
-Thank you.

451
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,651
-During training?
-I'll be there in a minute.

452
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,194
-Yes.
-Yes, during training.

453
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,154
Excuse me, Coach Yang.

454
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,489
-Thank you for today.
-Sure.

455
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:33,493
I'm planning to go somewhere
this weekend with the athletes to film.

456
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,661
For what kind of shoot?

457
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,996
I want to shoot the athletes
with "school trip" as the theme.

458
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,708
They told me that
they've never been on one before,

459
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,045
so it would be a chance to film
nice scenes and also be meaningful.

460
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,256
I see, but I'm extremely busy these days.

461
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,301
I'm not sure if I can find the time.

462
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,886
You do need me to come, right?

463
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,013
No, that's fine.

464
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,057
I can chaperone.

465
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,642
You should get some rest over the weekend.

466
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,060
Is that so?

467
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:05,108
All right, then.
Please speak to the parents yourself.

468
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,526
Yes, I will.

469
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,028
-Take care.
-Yes, bye.

470
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,864
-Bye!
-Bye, Coach!

471
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,577
Really? Are we going on a school trip?
To where?

472
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,371
To the beach.

473
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,834
-The beach!
-The beach!

474
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,963
I'll share the details over the phone.
I need to get back to the station. Bye.

475
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,464
Call me!

476
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,883
When did he say we were going?

477
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,760
I think he said it's this weekend.

478
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,972
-Really?
-What is it? What school trip?

479
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,307
You guys are lucky.

480
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,018
I want to go to the beach too.

481
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,103
It would be great if you can come.

482
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,896
Then why don't you come with us?

483
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,940
It's weird to have
only the two of us go on a school trip.

484
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,526
Really? Can we really come?

485
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:52,321
Come. But wait.
Would your parents be okay with it?

486
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,199
We could ask Yi-jin
to get permission for us.

487
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,994
Can you talk to Yi-jin
to get permission from Auntie?

488
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,162
I get to go only if you go.

489
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,788
My mom is fine as long as I'm with you.

490
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,457
That's true,

491
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,751
but is there any reason
for Yi-jin to take us?

492
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,220
I'll make this work.

493
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,972
-Really?
-That's great!

494
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,932
-Awesome!
-Let's do this!

495
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,726
-Yes!
-Yes!

496
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,187
-We're going!
-Let's go!

497
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,774
We're going to the beach!

498
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,739
Sir, you must be tired after a long day.

499
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,993
Were you waiting for me?

500
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,579
What is it this time?

501
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:47,418
Sir, a school trip is something
you go on with all your classmates.

502
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,588
Is it a school trip when only
the two fencing team members are going?

503
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,216
Wouldn't that just be a boot camp?

504
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,759
Having said that,

505
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,054
how about Ji-woong and I, who aren't
fencing team members, join you?

506
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,055
How about no?

507
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,143
Why not? The shots will be more crowded,
and it would look nicer and be meaningful.

508
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,521
-You're going to need us.
-No, I don't.

509
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,025
Sir, please. I'll be on my best behavior.

510
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,362
I'm a great actor and I know how to film.
I'm in the broadcasting club.

511
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,199
If you could please
get my mom to let me go…

512
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,035
So is this what it's all about?

513
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,704
Then I can't accept this.

514
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,291
And you have to
break the habit of bribing people, okay?

515
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,669
Where did you pick up
such a bad habit at your age?

516
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,273
A KOREAN MEAL WITH 5 SIDE DISHES

517
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,610
What is this?

518
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,953
It's hard to break the habit
of using bribes.

519
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,998
Isn't this breaking and entering?

520
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,273
Gosh, how can I help her
break this bad habit?

521
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,993
What should I do about her?

522
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,343
Sausage? You've got to be kidding me.

523
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,059
Like a hamburger.

524
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,327
Seung-wan, come outside.

525
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,454
Gosh, the weather is so hot.

526
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,711
Sir, what is it?

527
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,380
Don't you want to go on the school trip?

528
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,007
No. I don't do
"the third time's the charm" thing.

529
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,093
What?

530
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,805
Do you know what makes you truly evil?

531
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,433
You've toyed with someone
who has to cook for himself using food!

532
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,394
I see.

533
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,981
So my sincerity
was just a prank for you, Sir.

534
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,775
Gosh, now I feel bad for my mom.

535
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,778
She went to all those lengths
cooking for her child,

536
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,530
yet she ended up feeding someone else.

537
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:08,244
I guess I should tell my mom
the truth and apologize. Right?

538
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,082
Are you now blackmailing me?

539
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,585
What are you two doing there?

540
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,671
-Mom.
-Hello, ma'am.

541
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,590
-Have you been grocery shopping?
-Yes.

542
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,093
It's as if a thief is coming in
and out of our house.

543
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,470
Whenever I cook,
all the food is gone in a flash.

544
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,723
She says it wasn't her. Then who…

545
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,767
-Mom, I can explain.
-I have something to tell you, ma'am.

546
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,270
I am currently filming a documentary.

547
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,064
-Really?
-Oh, gosh. Really?

548
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,984
Sir, what documentary is it?

549
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,123
Here it comes!

550
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,252
Let's try again.

551
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,215
-That's cool!
-I did it!

552
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
We can go to the beach!

553
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,594
My mom said yes!

554
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,179
-Really?
-Really?

555
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,022
This is great!

556
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,095
Gosh, Seung-wan.
You pulled off the Harajuku style.

557
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,554
And Hee-do…

558
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,808
What is this? What's with the sunglasses?

559
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,227
Come on. These are really expensive.

560
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,687
So it's people like you
who pay a fortune for those.

561
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,735
-Is it tacky?
-No, it's pretty.

562
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,737
-I get it.
-I think it looks cute.

563
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,783
Is this some kind of Taereung NTC style
that's the latest trend among fencers?

564
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,495
If it's a trend set by a national
team member, I should go with it.

565
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,205
Does it look that bad?

566
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,542
What are you talking about, Yu-rim?
You look very beautiful.

567
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,380
Maybe if I could just add a little bit of
my touch to your beauty?

568
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,924
Hold on.

569
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,970
Are you laughing at me?

570
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,642
-There you go.
-How do I look?

571
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,019
-You look pretty!
-It's pretty!

572
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,729
-You look like Chae Ri-na
-Really?

573
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,231
Three! Four!

574
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,526
So, do you like it?

575
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,695
I think you're a genius.

576
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,574
Does it really look nice?

577
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,460
Guys, look!

578
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,587
Seung-wan!

579
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,299
This is a year-old ginseng liquor.

580
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,467
Is this real alcohol?

581
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,218
Wouldn't you get in trouble
if your dad finds out?

582
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,804
Come what may,
you have to have alcohol on a school trip.

583
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,264
Guys, I'm good at drinking.

584
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,016
I drink with my dad
during meals sometimes.

585
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,854
I think I'll be able to drink like a fish.
I'm very confident.

586
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,523
Yes. We'll try tonight.

587
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,108
-Tonight.
-Awesome.

588
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,776
Hey, that's Yi-jin's car!

589
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,781
Yi-jin!

590
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,001
The trip's been canceled.

591
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,546
-No!
-Wait!

592
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,506
-Hey!
-No way!

593
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,132
-Stop!
-Back Yi-jin!

594
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,300
Where are you going?

595
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,970
Let's put yours in next.

596
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,640
Why do I have to be a part of this group?

597
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,724
This car isn't bad.

598
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,061
If you're done, let's get in the car.

599
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,103
All right.

600
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,272
Stop.

601
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,566
You'll sit in the back.
You don't know how to read a map.

602
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,736
How did you know that I don't know?

603
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,113
Seung-wan, sit in the front
and read the map.

604
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,365
Yes, sir!

605
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,620
Yu-rim, hop in.

606
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,038
-All right.
-Yes.

607
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,085
Be careful.

608
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,920
Hey, Hee-do. Come in.

609
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,213
Yes, Hee-do. Hop in.

610
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,632
Why is everyone doing this to me today?

611
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,808
It's cramped here.

612
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,812
-Buckle up.
-Yes!

613
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,815
We are all on board. Now, let's go!

614
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,900
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

615
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,331
I'm on a school trip!

616
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,292
Me, too!

617
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,881
Let's go to the beach!

618
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,383
Go! Giddy-up!

619
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,220
Hey Ji-woong,
that's too loud. Keep it down!

620
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,601
-Yi-hyun!
-It's so pretty here.

621
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,977
Mom!

622
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,896
-There they come.
-Yi-jin!

623
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,567
-You're here!
-You're here.

624
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,652
-Come on.
-Hello.

625
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,363
Gosh, you must be tired
coming all the way here.

626
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,032
-Hello.
-Hello.

627
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,576
Yes, hello.

628
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,078
Yu-rim!

629
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,624
It's been so long.
Have you been doing well?

630
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:51,128
Of course. I saw you win the gold medal
at the international tournament.

631
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,297
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

632
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,216
This is Na Hee-do.
She won a gold medal at the Asian Games.

633
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,426
Of course, I know.

634
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,762
I've enjoyed watching the game.
Nice to meet you.

635
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,765
Yes, hello.

636
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,979
How come all of you look so pretty?

637
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,689
You, especially.

638
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,609
I didn't know that
Yi-jin had an older sister.

639
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,778
-Oh my gosh!
-Why that little…

640
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,989
I'm Yi-jin's mom.

641
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,240
What a big fuss.

642
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,575
You're his mother?

643
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,202
Unbelievable!

644
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,288
Why did you rent a place
when you could stay here with us?

645
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,332
As you can see, we had more kids joining.

646
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,708
I've contacted Mr. Choi.

647
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,543
-I see.
-Yi-jin, you're here!

648
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:35,881
Thank you.

649
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,385
I doubt you would want to
end your life like this.

650
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,678
Am I right?

651
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,600
I doubt you would want to become
an immature person who can't apologize.

652
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,810
Am I right?

653
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,852
Right.

654
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:58,028
Let's unpack at first
then shoot at the beach.

655
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:58,946
Yes!

656
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,324
Wanseung?

657
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,537
You're DJ Wanseung, right?

658
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,913
It has to be you.

659
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,959
I've been listening to all of your shows
since the beginning.

660
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,877
I know your voice. You're DJ Wanseung.

661
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,006
So this is how I get found out.

662
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,634
Nice to meet you, listener.

663
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,263
I was right. She really is Wanseung.

664
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,475
DJ Wanseung? What is all this about?

665
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,769
Seung-wan has her own radio show online.

666
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,688
I think your brother is her fan.

667
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,566
Online? Which network? We're online too.

668
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,652
Don't they seem like the Nownuri type?

669
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,866
What kind of show is it?
Is it suitable for teens?

670
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,411
For junior high students,
it makes them want to change the world.

671
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,871
What?

672
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,457
-You've never missed a show?
-No.

673
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,584
-What's your nickname?
-I'm Baekho.

674
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,960
You're Baekho?

675
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,882
Baekho.

676
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,968
What an encounter.

677
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,805
Excuse me, but could I get a handshake?

678
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,016
I really am a big fan of yours.

679
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,478
How old are you?

680
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,646
I'm in grade nine. I'm sixteen years old.

681
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,981
So four more years to go.

682
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,692
I can wait for you.

683
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,968
Guys! You could get a heart attack
if you go in without a warm-up!

684
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,774
Here I come!

685
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,614
Hee-do is here!

686
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,366
Get in!

687
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,743
Is this what we're doing?

688
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,078
No!

689
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,668
Get him!

690
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,925
Wait!

691
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,681
What did you say?

692
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,767
-Let's get him!
-Let's go!

693
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,438
-One!
-One!

694
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,023
-Two!
-Two!

695
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,316
-Three!
-Three!

696
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,156
Here I come!

697
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,788
Hey!

698
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,074
What are you doing alone?

699
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,830
I'm recording.

700
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,041
What?

701
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,630
I'm recording right now.
We shouldn't be talking.

702
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,674
I see.

703
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,227
How do you like this trip?

704
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,651
I don't know about the school trips
other kids have been to,

705
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,404
but this one is way more fun.
I'm positive.

706
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:38,660
No, you're wrong.
The other ones are more fun.

707
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,418
But then you won't be there.

708
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,600
-What are you listening to?
-Come again?

709
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,603
What is that you are listening to?

710
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,772
This? Do you want to listen?

711
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,627
Listen with your eyes closed.

712
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,452
Aren't you thirsty?

713
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,788
Isn't it too hot?

714
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,665
What?

715
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,562
Let's go get something to drink. Okay?

716
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,112
Oh, all right.

717
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,154
Let's go.

718
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,376
My goodness.

719
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,675
This is good.

720
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,803
I have to say, banana milk tastes
the best after a shower.

721
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,017
Stop saying whatever
just because it's awkward.

722
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,519
That was my first time
showering with others

723
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,771
since I was in kindergarten.

724
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,235
Right. We are not close enough
to share a shower together.

725
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,154
Then we can become that much closer.

726
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,160
But if you think about it,
wouldn't they find this situation

727
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,953
more awkward than us?

728
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,122
Hey!

729
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,291
Haven't they met
only for the third time today?

730
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,376
-Awesome!
-What is?

731
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,419
Yi-jin.

732
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,671
He's amazing.

733
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,841
Hey, stop talking and clean the shower.

734
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,760
Yi-jin, what kind of workout do you do?

735
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,470
Do you think
this has to do with making an effort?

736
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,139
Gosh. You're just…
You're just not cut out for this.

737
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,057
Geez.

738
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,017
-But you are, right?
-Go!

739
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,394
Is he chasing after Yi-jin
because he's beautiful?

740
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,775
Ji-woong desires for
every pretty thing on the planet.

741
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,070
Is that why he is into me?

742
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,407
That's crazy.

743
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,992
Did I think out loud?

744
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,245
Hey, cut it out.
We have to get ready to eat.

745
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,539
You guys can wash the lettuce
and perilla leaf,

746
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,541
and get ready to cook the rice.

747
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,295
Do you know how to light a grill?

748
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,713
Of course.

749
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,757
Then you can do that.
I'll go buy some meat.

750
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,009
Got it? Let's move!

751
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,886
-Let's move!
-Let's move!

752
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,016
Do we use dish soap to wash lettuce?

753
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,017
I don't think so.

754
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,062
I think I saw people do that
on a TV commercial.

755
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,815
Yu-rim!

756
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,403
-What's going on?
-This came off.

757
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,948
-Really?
-Gosh.

758
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,033
I know that much.

759
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,285
Do you also know
how much rice we should put in?

760
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,621
There are five of us,
so we should put in five bowls.

761
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,250
You sure are the smartest kid at school.

762
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,835
Yeoju is famous for quality rice.

763
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,211
And pottery too.

764
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,505
Where do you learn all that from?

765
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,799
In grade school social studies.

766
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,010
Didn't you go to class back then?

767
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,305
That's two servings!

768
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,223
YEOJU RICE

769
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,687
Hey, what's this? What did you do?

770
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,064
Yi-jin, look at this blazing fire.

771
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,357
I can't help but stare at it.

772
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,859
Hurry and pull out the firewood.

773
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,486
That was for a BBQ,
but you'll set this place on fire.

774
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,531
Jeez. What are we going to do?

775
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,742
Try to put it out, okay?

776
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,202
Why can't I put it out?

777
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,954
Yi-jin, I can't put it out.

778
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,041
You can say that I did most of the work.

779
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,208
Why is that?

780
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,793
Because I gave you the recipe.

781
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,965
What do we have here?
How many servings did you cook?

782
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,175
Five servings.

783
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,802
Five servings?

784
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,639
Five servings.

785
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,769
Don't tell me
you used that bowl to measure the rice.

786
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,228
-Yes.
-Aren't we supposed to?

787
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,898
I guess we did it wrong.
We aren't tested on these things.

788
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,359
Smartest kid in school, my foot.

789
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,236
It's fine as long as it's tasty.

790
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,325
Ji-woong.

791
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,911
Gosh, Ji-woong.

792
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,831
Can you tell me why you went
to all that trouble to start a fire

793
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,916
only to end up using a frying pan?

794
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,167
Then where else would I?

795
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,044
This lettuce smells like dish soap.

796
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,962
-It really does.
-Right?

797
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,215
What are you talking about?
Why would it smell?

798
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,424
Did you wash that with soap?

799
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,301
Aren't we supposed to?

800
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,595
My gosh.

801
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,555
-A bug!
-Let me see.

802
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,433
-It's still good.
-Oh, no!

803
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,810
-But there's a bug.
-Freeze!

804
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,522
Gosh.

805
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,232
My goodness.

806
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:47,821
I wasn't thinking straight. This is on me.

807
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,949
You don't deserve to be
labeled as people not just yet.

808
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,826
All of you are

809
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,744
still critters.

810
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,372
What is a critter?

811
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,749
-I don't know.
-An animal.

812
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,381
Go sit yourselves at the table.

813
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,841
Go ahead and eat.

814
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,052
-Thank you for the meal!
-Thank you for the meal!

815
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,388
Gosh. Are you having your meal now?

816
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,889
-Hello!
-Hello!

817
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,142
Here. Have this for dessert.

818
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,769
-Thank you!
-You even brought two.

819
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,439
-Enjoy.
-Can you wait here for a second?

820
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,190
Thank you.

821
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,860
-Let's have this later.
-You've set the table nicely.

822
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,195
-Would you like some?
-You can go ahead.

823
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,447
This is for you.

824
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,908
-What is this?
-This is ginseng liquor.

825
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,036
Seung-wan here
brought it as a thank you gift for you.

826
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,331
Gosh, you really didn't have to
bring something so valuable.

827
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,332
Thank you for this.

828
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,334
My pleasure. I hope you enjoy it.

829
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,462
You should eat. Have fun!

830
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,380
-Yes. Take care.
-Bye.

831
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,218
Sir, what did you just do?

832
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,889
A school trip isn't complete
without drinking in secret!

833
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,641
Getting caught sneaking alcohol is
also a part of the school trip.

834
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:03,062
All of you were too busy playing
to get in touch with your parents, right?

835
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,900
Once you're done eating,
let them know that you've arrived safely.

836
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,693
Now dig in.

837
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,947
Yes, Mom. I'll call you again later.

838
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,115
Yes.

839
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,536
I've arrived.

840
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,710
Yes. We've just eaten. We had BBQ.

841
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,339
All right. Bye.

842
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,510
Ji-woong, your turn.

843
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,677
Thanks.

844
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,274
Hello?

845
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,109
Hi Mom, I have arrived safely.

846
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,444
Hey, Moon Ji-woong.

847
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,572
Are you really going to
disappoint me every time?

848
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,116
How could you be
at the bottom of the class?

849
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,493
Did you see the report card?

850
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,370
How are you so calm all the time?

851
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,163
Does this mean nothing to you?

852
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,500
Do you know what I had to do
to get you from your dad?

853
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,418
Yet this is how you live your life?

854
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,550
Seriously, what do you plan on becoming?

855
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,391
All right, Mom.
I won't be the class bottom again.

856
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,601
Did you get some sleep?

857
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,104
You're on the night shift tomorrow.

858
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,397
Yes.

859
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,816
Yes.

860
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,877
Gosh, Ji-woong!

861
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,213
Why did you put her on speaker?

862
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,424
I'm regretting it.

863
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,427
This is the kind of vibe I hate the most.

864
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,472
Why are you looking at me like that?

865
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,974
It makes me want to play the victim.

866
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,935
Are your parents divorced?

867
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,771
Yes, it happened when I was very young.

868
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,984
I heard that Dad and Grandma
insisted on not giving me up.

869
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,445
So Mom had to make a big effort
to take me with her.

870
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,197
I don't remember much though.

871
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,577
Every family has its own story.

872
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,706
I'm sure you've all heard
that we stood surety for a loan.

873
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,125
Still, your family seems so happy.

874
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,127
And you're close to your dad.

875
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,837
My dad passed away.

876
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,759
You didn't know?

877
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,138
Then again,
I've never told anyone this before.

878
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,849
Maybe because I didn't have any friends.

879
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,102
When did he pass away?

880
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,647
When I was in grade school.

881
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,065
Then you were really young.

882
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,734
It must have been so sad.

883
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,322
It was.

884
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,409
But what makes me really sad is,

885
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,831
that my Mom and I
don't talk about Dad at all.

886
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,708
-Why not?
-No reason.

887
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,920
We just never do

888
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,839
as if it had never happened.

889
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:21,511
But I want to.
I want to tell her that I miss Dad

890
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,180
and ask her if she misses him too.

891
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,227
Now Mom is the only person
who knows Dad as well as I do,

892
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,021
but we don't talk.

893
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,074
Are you crying?

894
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:44,951
No, I'm not.

895
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,911
Liar!

896
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,287
-What! No.
-Crying again?

897
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,581
-I'm not!
-Hey, stop crying.

898
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,791
Why is he crying?

899
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,001
He's such a crybaby.

900
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,378
Why are you crying?

901
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,089
I'm not crying.

902
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,049
What's that?

903
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,093
-What is it?
-Did you see that?

904
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,221
What? What is that?

905
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,181
-Teach me!
-How did you do that?

906
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,725
How do you do that?

907
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,893
Teach me too!

908
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,106
You have to go a little lower than that.

909
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,066
This is like a real school trip.

910
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,443
It's not working!

911
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,070
-Why don't you join in?
-It's not!

912
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,405
It's gross.

913
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,699
I mean, when the others were talking.

914
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,702
Don't you have that "teenage sentiment"?

915
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,167
-How do you do that?
-Well…

916
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,881
I wish that the things I worry about
are as realistic as theirs.

917
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:42,925
What do you mean?

918
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,510
I'm just saying.

919
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,476
I find life very boring.

920
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,898
I thought you were having
more fun than anyone here.

921
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,108
I come up with things

922
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,986
because it's no fun at all.

923
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,116
Still, it's fun
when I hang out with Ji-woong.

924
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,495
Something always happens.

925
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,538
Right. That's it!

926
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,957
Look where hanging out with him
has gotten me to.

927
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,126
I'm at the beach.

928
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,839
Seung-wan, when is sunset?

929
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,049
Let's all go and watch.

930
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,301
We are at the East Sea.

931
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,969
But the sun should set here too.

932
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,763
Daytime isn't forever, right?

933
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,307
You're right.

934
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,228
It will be soon. Let's go now.

935
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,312
-Come on!
-Let's go!

936
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,397
-Yes, let's go!
-Yes!

937
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,319
Wait for me!

938
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,960
-Let's write our names.
-Sure!

939
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,963
-Idiots!
-This is so pretty!

940
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,131
-Let's write something again.
-I can write "O."

941
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,508
Then I can do "V."

942
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:09,053
"Idiots."

943
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,097
"LOL."

944
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,642
Hey, look at this!

945
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,415
One, two, three!

946
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,587
This is so beautiful.

947
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,715
I get emotional
when I see things like this.

948
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,508
It is.

949
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,261
I want to buy it if I can.

950
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,680
How much would this cost?

951
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,057
How much do you have?

952
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:59,228
Me? I have 200,000 won
from handsel saved in my bank account.

953
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,898
That's cool!

954
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,525
My mom used all of mine.

955
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,613
Same here.
My mom also used all of mine too.

956
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,865
You used to be rich. Don't butt in.

957
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,117
Being bankrupt doesn't count?

958
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,830
Right. He is not rich anymore,
so he has no money.

959
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,084
All in all, none of us can buy that sky.

960
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,046
I guess we can't.

961
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,259
Why is it that none of us have money?

962
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,011
So what?

963
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,679
I like being me.

964
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,556
It's exciting to live as myself.

965
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,142
I'm jealous.

966
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,979
I'm jealous of your body.

967
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,566
Hey.

968
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,194
What do you mean we can't buy anything?

969
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,864
Summer is free. We should buy it.

970
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:54,909
You want to buy summer?

971
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,787
Yes. We will become the masters of summer.

972
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,539
Then the summer would be ours.

973
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,708
-That is romantic.
-Right?

974
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,002
That's not my style.

975
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:05,920
Darn it.

976
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,505
I like it.

977
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,385
The summer

978
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,346
belongs to us!

979
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,310
I'm a little

980
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,355
embarrassed!

981
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,649
What was that?

982
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,818
-I copied you.
-Totally.

983
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,891
Why do I feel like
this moment will last forever?

984
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,147
Maybe it will be.

985
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,410
Let's hope so.

986
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:17,218
Mom, can't we also go on a trip?

987
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:18,969
My break will end soon.

988
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,263
In a situation like this?

989
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,849
Didn't you see
there are more than 2,000 confirmed cases?

990
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,351
Just hang in there.

991
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,897
When I was in grade six, I couldn't go on
the school trip for a dance contest.

992
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,775
And it was canceled
due to COVID this year.

993
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,070
I've never been on a school trip
in my life.

994
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,530
Do you think I have?

995
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,199
I've also never been on one
because I had to train.

996
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,495
You've been to the beach with friends
when you were in high school.

997
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,455
I saw the photos in your album.

998
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,457
I went to the beach
when I was in high school?

999
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,877
Don't tell me you don't remember.

1000
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,922
You went with the people
who always show up in your album.

1001
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,551
When did I go to the beach with them?

1002
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,803
I don't remember.

1003
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:04,682
Gosh. I think it's you
who should see a doctor, not me.

1004
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,393
Did we go to the beach?

1005
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,395
Did we?

1006
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:14,024
You had all these pictures taken
as if that moment would last forever.

1007
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,695
Nothing lasts forever.

1008
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,573
Everything is momentary.

1009
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,117
They all flow away.

1010
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:30,040
And that's not always a bad thing.

1011
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,178
Why were you so mean to me at first

1012
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,889
when you're this friendly?

1013
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,183
I wouldn't be where I am today

1014
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,268
if it wasn't for you.

1015
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:52,188
Are you happy, Ji-woong?

1016
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,941
I used to be surrounded by fencers.

1017
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,568
I feel like I'm in another world.

1018
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,362
Back Yi-jin from class six.

1019
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,865
Let's hang out together.

1020
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,075
Can't you do this one thing for me?

1021
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,703
Ko Yu-rim, will you go out with me?

1022
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,832
Hee-do.

1023
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:25,930
