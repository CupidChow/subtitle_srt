1
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,995
Min-chae!

2
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,208
Wake up!

3
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,210
Min-chae! Wake up!

4
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,880
Min-chae! Wake up.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,423
Wake up.

6
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,636
Why are you still asleep?
It's almost 11 a.m.

7
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,930
Wake up!

8
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,561
Min-chae. Wake up now.

9
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,147
Why are you still asleep?
It's almost 11 a.m.

10
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,273
Whatever.

11
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,275
Get up.

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,736
Did you forget
you had manual therapy today?

13
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,114
I'm quitting ballet.

14
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,241
I don't need therapy anymore.

15
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,618
You're always complaining
about everything hurting.

16
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,203
Of course, you need it.

17
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,997
Even if you quit ballet,
you still need to walk.

18
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,207
Get ready and come out.

19
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,632
I saw the 18-year-old Hee-do.

20
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,342
I think I'm way too into this.

21
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,513
EPISODE 3

22
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,058
She can't even pack a bag properly,
but she wanted to run away from home?

23
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,520
Is it even considered
running away from home

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,105
if you go to Grandma's house?

25
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,649
Get up already!

26
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,578
Isn't Min-chae taking
a long break from ballet?

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,830
What if she gets out of shape?

28
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,624
You were obsessed
with trying to get me to quit fencing,

29
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,877
but you're worried
that Min-chae will quit.

30
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,674
Min-chae's good.

31
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,468
And I wasn't.

32
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,180
That was why
I made Korean fencing history.

33
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,519
The world is a mess.

34
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,404
Gosh. She seems a lot stiffer than before.

35
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,448
Has she been under a lot of stress?

36
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,659
No one gives her stress
other than herself.

37
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,539
You know so much about these things
since you were an athlete,

38
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,790
so it was going well.

39
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,877
Please don't regard me as an athlete.
I'm just her mom.

40
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,921
That stresses her out too.

41
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,839
I want to stop.

42
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,800
No. We're almost done, so be patient.

43
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,177
You're so spoiled.

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,970
I didn't have this back in my day.

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,348
Stop talking about
how things were in your day.

46
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,517
I wish there was a way
to fix that smart mouth.

47
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,269
Be patient.

48
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,271
We'll go to your favorite salad place.

49
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,607
My favorite salad place? Give me a break.

50
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,734
Who likes salads?

51
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm going to eat a burger.
A large combo with fries.

52
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,575
I'm going to have regular soda, not diet.

53
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,247
Min-chae,
are you really going to quit ballet?

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,126
Why didn't you quit?

55
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,881
Fencing, I mean.
You weren't even good at it.

56
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,342
Did your grandma say that?
That I wasn't good?

57
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,764
Well, it just seemed that way.

58
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,850
Why didn't you quit?

59
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,310
Because I liked it.

60
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,772
Standing on the piste with a sword…

61
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,151
made my heart race.

62
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,622
What was the code?

63
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,916
They changed the question.

64
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,632
DOOR LOCK QUESTION
SOLVE THE QUIZ TO GET THE CODE

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,093
It's one-seven-one-zero.

66
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,428
One-seven-one-zero.

67
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,930
It's one-seven-one-zero.

68
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,730
They changed the code to the bathroom.
It's one-seven-one-zero.

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,316
This is for making me happy yesterday.

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,104
-Hello.
-Hello.

71
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,077
Sorry?

72
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,838
What the…

73
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,425
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL BROADCASTING CLUB
TYBS 20TH CLASS

74
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,429
SOY MILK

75
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,725
What's with that shirt?

76
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,646
This? We made this in high school.

77
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,523
I went to your school too.

78
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,860
Hello, Mr. Alumnus.

79
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,072
I'm Ji Seung-wan,
TYBS producer, 24th class.

80
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,166
What class?

81
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,293
The 24th class, sir.

82
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,047
Nice to meet you.

83
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,467
I'm Back Yi-jin. Announcer, 20th class.

84
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,012
What? Back Yi-jin? You're Back Yi-jin?

85
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,180
I heard you were rich.

86
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,145
-That was in the past.
-Did you go bankrupt?

87
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,233
I'm sorry, sir.

88
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,238
If you're going to school now,
I can shower now, right?

89
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,325
Of course. You may shower
whenever you want from now on.

90
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,120
That's not right.
There's a shortage of water.

91
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,332
I'm just the tenant, right?

92
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,752
And I should be mindful of these things.

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,255
Have a nice day.

94
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,257
Damn it.

95
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,219
I heard Cho Hye-won is
off the National Team due to an injury.

96
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,471
What did she hurt?

97
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,473
She tore her meniscus.

98
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,850
Gosh. She'll be out for a year.

99
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,605
Then will the ninth-place fencer
automatically make the team?

100
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,690
No. I hear
they're choosing the replacement

101
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,358
at a qualifier next month.

102
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,444
They'll hold a competition.

103
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,905
They'll hold a competition.

104
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,490
That means

105
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,785
the top eight will make the national team

106
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,247
and up to 16 fencers from 9th place onward

107
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,291
can compete in the qualifier, right?

108
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,252
-What rank is that up to?
-The 24th.

109
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,297
The 24th. That means…

110
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,134
None of you qualify, do you?

111
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,555
Hee-do.

112
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,934
What's your rank out of 51?

113
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm 26th.

114
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,645
You're 26th?

115
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,899
What a shame. You fall short by two?

116
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,692
Gosh.

117
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,030
Still, you're the best here, after Yu-rim.

118
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,327
You need to meet
your minimum attendance today,

119
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,829
so study hard
in your respective classes this morning,

120
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,957
have lunch, and gather back here. Okay?

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,000
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

122
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,461
Louder.

123
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

124
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,354
PINE FLAVORED DRINK

125
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,984
Yu-rim. May I get your autograph?

126
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,612
What's your name?

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,365
We're in the same class.

128
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,409
Hee-do.

129
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,786
Did you get closer to Yu-rim?

130
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,374
It must be nice
training with your favorite fencer.

131
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,877
What's first period?

132
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,339
Korean history.

133
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,425
The bell rang. Why are you still standing?

134
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,467
Take your seats now!

135
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,887
You'll be seniors next year.

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,474
Do you still not understand reality?

137
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,560
Open your books.

138
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,687
Page 75.

139
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,691
Why don't some of you have your textbooks?

140
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,987
Yu-rim, I know you're on the fencing team,

141
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,490
but you need to perform your duties
as a student in the classroom.

142
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,618
Do you fence without your sword?

143
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,494
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,204
Being on a team doesn't excuse you.

145
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,833
Go outside. Kneel and hold your hands up
in the hallway.

146
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,343
Who else doesn't have their textbook?

147
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,930
KOREAN HISTORY

148
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,015
Sorry, sir.

149
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,229
That punk.

150
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,860
Okay. We'll learn about
the Unified Silla period.

151
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,199
Do you remember me?

152
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,743
Yes.

153
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,079
Do you remember my name?

154
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,292
What was it again? I only remember
"class seven's pretty boy".

155
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,293
Moon Ji-woong.

156
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,879
Moon Ji-woong.

157
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,172
Yes, Yu-rim. What is it?

158
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,431
How does winning a gold medal feel?

159
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,811
Why ask that while we're both
on our knees with our hands up?

160
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,105
Then ask me how I feel.

161
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:34,443
Ask me how it feels to be kneeling
with my hands up with a gold medalist.

162
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,321
How does it feel?

163
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,115
It rocks.

164
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,291
Is it uncomfortable?

165
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,128
I have a minor ankle injury, that's why.

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,012
Sir. Our nation's gold medalist fencer,
Ko Yu-rim,

167
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,766
has an ankle injury,
making it difficult to kneel.

168
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,979
Could you be generous enough
to permit us to stand with our hands up?

169
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,732
-Hey.
-It's okay, I got this.

170
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,487
-Sir.
-Just make yourself comfortable.

171
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,962
Thanks.

172
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,007
Did you see that?

173
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,136
Pretty boy isn't just pretty,
he's nice too.

174
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,350
Why don't you have your textbook?

175
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,481
What's important isn't in the textbook,
it's in the hallway.

176
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,363
UNIFIED SILLA'S SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT

177
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,536
I want to be on the national team.

178
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,054
Open it.

179
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,768
Let's have lunch together.

180
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,527
-It's been a while.
-It has.

181
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,614
Eat up, Miss Top of the School

182
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,282
Thank you.

183
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,744
You're number one?

184
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,746
Yes. It's a talent.

185
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,998
Like your talent in fencing.

186
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,503
You downplay something that huge
like it's nothing.

187
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,713
I haven't even begun what's really huge.

188
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,841
What will that be?

189
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,051
I don't know.

190
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,471
Whatever it is,
I'm going to do something amazing.

191
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,975
Something super fun and super great.

192
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,562
I can't wait.

193
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,605
I can't wait either, to see what I do.

194
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,483
Anyway, let's eat. It's good here.

195
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,818
I know.

196
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,695
You've been here?

197
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,741
I used to come here every Saturday.

198
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,995
-I'm back.
-My daughter's back.

199
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,454
You must be tired.

200
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,039
Can I help? I'll do the dishes.

201
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,333
No. You must be tired. Go rest.

202
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,879
Why can't you finish training early
and rest like other kids?

203
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,382
I wish you could finish early
and rest on Saturdays too.

204
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,885
-Goodness. Go home.
-More pickled radish, please.

205
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,386
You must be tired. Go home.

206
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,847
-It's fine.
-Did she not hear or is she pretending?

207
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,640
-No.
-Let's play rock paper scissors.

208
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,975
-Don't be silly.
-Let me stay if I win.

209
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,728
Rock, paper, scissors.

210
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,605
Pickled radishes are self-service.

211
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,565
Can't you read?

212
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,191
-What about rice?
-Rice?

213
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,777
-Cook for me. I'm really not tired.
-Go home and rest.

214
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,946
What's wrong with you? Listen to your mom.

215
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,203
The reason I asked you to lunch was…

216
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,498
You said you knew Back Yi-jin, right?

217
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,709
-Yes.
-What's your relationship with him?

218
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,837
I don't know.

219
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,008
We pursue happiness together.

220
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,844
That means you're friends. Good.

221
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,264
I lectured our tenant a few times.

222
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,849
But he's Back Yi-jin

223
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,352
from our broadcasting club, 20th class.

224
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,230
What? You're his landlady's daughter?

225
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,901
-I live right by you.
-Really?

226
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,653
-Yes.
-I used to live near the school

227
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,112
and moved there.

228
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,616
Anyway, that's not important.

229
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,996
You saw how antiquated
and uptight our club was, right?

230
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,166
-Yes.
-They're super into seniority.

231
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,752
I'm terrified of people
just one year ahead of me,

232
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,088
but I gave an attitude to an alumnus,

233
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,091
who I shouldn't even dare
to make eye contact with.

234
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,593
What do I do?

235
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,846
Come on. Don't worry.

236
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,058
Yi-jin may nag like crazy, but he's nice.

237
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,479
He's totally not the type
to do something like that.

238
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,109
I'll have a Special Bulgogi Burger. You?

239
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,694
I'll have

240
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,279
the IMF Burger, which is totally me.

241
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,447
Get the same as me.

242
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,033
You're so bossy.
Why did you even ask then?

243
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,619
We'll have two
Special Bulgogi Burger Combos.

244
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,787
Okay.

245
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,373
You wait for it.

246
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,717
-Here's your change.
-Thank you.

247
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,765
Did he grow?

248
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,434
Here's your food.

249
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,852
Enjoy.

250
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,732
Hey. Yi-hyun. What are you doing here?

251
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,068
Are you having the IMF Burger?

252
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,530
He has no money,
but he got the Special Burger.

253
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,323
Hey, you're right.

254
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,451
Just leave. I don't want to be humiliated.

255
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,494
Damn. He's scary.

256
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,247
-Humiliated in front of whom?
-Just leave.

257
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,666
Don't order us around.

258
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,173
So you're the assholes
who hurt my brother.

259
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,759
Your brother?

260
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,343
Yes. So?

261
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,222
What is it?
Didn't you know he had a big brother?

262
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,475
I guess that makes a difference.

263
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,311
Why is that?

264
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,315
Why are you afraid of his brother,
but not his parents? Come here.

265
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,650
Tell me.

266
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,694
You obviously know

267
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,530
that his brother will kick your ass
if he gets pissed off.

268
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,616
And you're right.

269
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,911
If I see any cuts or bruises
on my brother again,

270
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,871
Choi Won-hwan, Kim Jong-chan,

271
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,373
Hwang Hyeong-seok…

272
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,251
I won't tell your teacher or your parents.

273
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,464
I'll just kill you myself.

274
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,716
Yes, sir.

275
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,766
-Come here.
-Sorry?

276
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,142
Come here.

277
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,981
Give this back to Yi-hyun too.

278
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,525
It doesn't suit your skin tone.

279
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,112
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

280
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,488
Apologize properly.

281
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,824
I'm sorry, sir.

282
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,910
Go on.

283
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,161
I'm sorry, sir.

284
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,501
Then what? What should I have done?

285
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,755
Just watch you get hurt?

286
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,257
Must you do that to kids?

287
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,260
Who cares if they're kids?
I wanted to kill them.

288
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,722
I remembered that wound on your face
and I wanted to kill them.

289
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,974
Listen, mister.

290
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,727
I'm going through puberty.

291
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,397
You shouldn't be so overprotective.

292
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,524
It's really annoying.

293
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,734
Fine.

294
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,407
I was wrong.

295
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,830
-But seriously, if they--
-Come on.

296
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,958
Okay, fine.

297
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,383
Is everything okay otherwise?

298
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,218
Well…

299
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,097
-No.
-What's up?

300
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,140
It's just…

301
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,606
I miss Mom and Dad a lot.

302
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,616
What can I do?

303
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,004
I feel so bad for you.

304
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,217
Just two ranks higher,
and you'd make the qualifier.

305
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,386
It doesn't affect me at all, but…

306
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,139
It doesn't affect me either.

307
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,601
Which means you and I are the same.

308
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,607
You're on a whole other level.
I can tell when we spar.

309
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,952
Ye-ji.

310
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,582
Do you want to make the national team?

311
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,965
To be honest, I'm not sure if I want to

312
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,592
or if I can.

313
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,845
What about you?

314
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,681
I'm…

315
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,226
going to make it.

316
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,187
I can't right now,

317
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,606
but I'm going to make it someday.

318
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,443
Someday? I'm sure you will.

319
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,905
Hey.

320
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,035
Why won't she let us train at night?

321
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,204
She threw a fit when we did last time.

322
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,791
She can't stand to see others do better
or train harder than she does.

323
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,127
That's all?

324
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,921
She can't stand seeing others do well?

325
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
Can't we complain to Coach?

326
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,509
We did once before,
and we all got punished.

327
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,094
We were here until 11 p.m.

328
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,847
What the hell? That's ridiculous.

329
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,935
I have big news!

330
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,939
Full House volume 12 is coming out today!

331
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,067
-Really?
-Really?

332
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:12,205
YURAM BOOKS AND STATIONERY

333
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,931
You have the number for the store
where Yi-jin works, right?

334
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,226
I do. Didn't you say
you had training tonight?

335
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,352
Give it to me.

336
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,331
I'm sorry!

337
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,598
MYEONGJIN BOOK RENTALS
WHERE GEN-X GATHERS

338
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,642
WE HAVE THE LATEST ROMANCE COMIC BOOKS

339
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,149
Full House volume 12.

340
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,613
Yes. It did come out,
but they've all been rented.

341
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,496
Volume 12 came out…

342
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,791
but you didn't expect me?

343
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,046
Is that all I mean to you?

344
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,551
Sorry. I'll save you one
once it comes back.

345
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,138
Do you want Dragon Raja instead?
It's really popular.

346
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,064
Fine. Where is it?

347
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,482
Wait here. I'll get it.

348
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,291
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 12

349
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,715
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 12

350
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,766
-Where's Dragon Raja?
-Stop right there.

351
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,646
I'm experiencing what it means
for my blood to run cold.

352
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,149
Explain yourself.

353
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,781
The thing is…

354
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,826
Yi-jin, volume 12!

355
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,757
What's this?

356
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,802
Was it you? Did you ask him to hold it?

357
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,306
Yi-jin, tell me straight.
Did she ask you to hold it?

358
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,975
Do you know each other? How?

359
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,394
Can't you tell?

360
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,564
He's an employee at a book rental store
and I'm a regular.

361
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,359
But that employee
screwed over a loyal customer

362
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,153
and gave special treatment
to someone from another town.

363
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,905
Girls, calm down. Let me explain.

364
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,907
What is there to explain?

365
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,659
I called and reserved it first.

366
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,579
You can't reserve books here.
It's first come, first served!

367
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,830
If you put it that way,

368
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,583
I gave you special treatment
for Full House volume 11.

369
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,542
What now?

370
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,588
-What was that?
-Whatever. You choose.

371
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,258
Who will you lend it to? Me or her?

372
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,844
No! Don't choose. You have no authority!

373
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,888
It's obvious I should get it--

374
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,474
Stop it! If you two keep it up,
I'll rip it up!

375
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,059
Are you insane?

376
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,396
Girls. We can't bend the book.

377
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,856
Guys, let go.

378
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,733
I'm begging you. I'm sorry.

379
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,820
Darn it.

380
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,616
I admit I broke the rule.

381
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,869
I'm truly sorry
for bringing upon this result.

382
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,788
But Yu-rim…

383
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,292
I'm really sorry,

384
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,961
but this store is run
on a membership system,

385
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,005
so this copy of Full House…

386
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,136
will have to go to Hee-do.

387
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,723
That's right.

388
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,226
Do you know how much money
I've spent here?

389
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,353
How could you do this?

390
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,521
Sorry.

391
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,942
But strictly speaking,
you have a membership with our competitor.

392
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,541
Do you want to read Dragon Raja?
It's very popular.

393
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,544
Seriously!

394
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,212
Hello?

395
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,132
Full House volume 12?
The last one was just rented.

396
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,637
How long does it take by bus? 20 minutes?

397
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,601
How close are you and Hee-do?

398
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,102
You two seemed really close.

399
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,397
I owe her a favor.

400
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,399
And I'm grateful to her.

401
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,361
You know she transferred
into my school's fencing team?

402
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,612
I know.

403
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,239
I even know what she did
in order to transfer.

404
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,202
I don't like her.
She rubs me the wrong way.

405
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,372
So don't get too close to her.

406
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,458
You're being childish.

407
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,460
You were my first love.

408
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,965
So you should do that much for me.

409
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,261
I was your first love?

410
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,309
Past tense? Not anymore?
Because my family went bankrupt?

411
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,561
-Hey.
-When you were in the ninth grade, right?

412
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,524
Shall I tell you the truth
about your first love?

413
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,948
ELEPHANT SNACKS

414
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,784
Yu-rim. Are you heading to practice?

415
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,662
Hop in. I'll drive you there.

416
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,920
Your first love wasn't me,

417
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,172
but my sports car.

418
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,385
You thought I was a pathetic loser
before then.

419
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,431
-I did not.
-Yes, you did.

420
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,102
I did.

421
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,689
Damn it. How annoying.

422
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,275
That means my first love wasn't a person.

423
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,906
Hey. What's annoying?

424
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,909
It means
you're still waiting for your first love.

425
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,622
Isn't that exciting?

426
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,002
Really?

427
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,507
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 12

428
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,692
Hello?

429
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,943
Hee-do?

430
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,529
Yes, speaking. Who's this?

431
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,489
Yang Chan-mi.

432
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,367
Coach.

433
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,871
But I'm ranked 26th.

434
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,500
Someone from our team will compete
for a spot on the national team

435
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,751
next month.

436
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,046
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH FENCING TEAM!

437
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,215
Hee-do.

438
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,634
-Yes?
-It's you.

439
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,970
Me? Why?

440
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,641
Two fencers above you dropped out.

441
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,937
One quit fencing because her school
got rid of their fencing team.

442
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,105
One quit
because her family couldn't afford it.

443
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,818
That's why you qualify
although you were ranked 26th.

444
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,949
You were given a chance
because you didn't quit.

445
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,868
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Hee-do.

446
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,127
Hee-do, the times have presented
an opportunity for you.

447
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,603
I didn't crush your dreams.

448
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,730
The times did.

449
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,818
Hee-do, the times have presented
an opportunity for you.

450
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,043
You need to be careful.

451
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,629
You're competing for the national team.

452
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,719
Darn it.

453
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,762
Gosh.

454
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,390
He's in his 20s

455
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,018
and his name is Back Yi-jin.

456
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,812
Does he live here?

457
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,443
Well, you must be here for our tenant.

458
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,111
That's his name.

459
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,239
But he's not home. He's at work right now.

460
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,366
I see.

461
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,536
Do you know where he works?

462
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,830
Well…

463
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,461
There's a bookstore
on the way to the subway station.

464
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,088
You can go that way.

465
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,842
Yi-jin! You need to hide!

466
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,885
What's wrong?

467
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,095
A creditor came to your place

468
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,014
and the landlady told him you work here.

469
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,393
I'll watch the counter,
so stay there and hide.

470
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,939
Hello.

471
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,942
Hello. How may I help you?

472
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,403
Hello.

473
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,620
Hello!

474
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,877
Are you looking for something?

475
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,254
Fantasy is here, romance is here…

476
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,675
Full House is popular these days.
Have you read it?

477
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,717
Well…

478
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,637
I heard a young man works here.

479
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,806
A young man?

480
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,308
I'm the only worker here.

481
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,649
Do you want to rent Full House?

482
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,694
No, thank you. Bye then.

483
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,132
He's gone. You can come out now.

484
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,689
What did he say?

485
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,695
So I recommended Full House to him
out of nowhere,

486
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,488
and he just left.

487
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,075
He probably wanted nothing to do with me.

488
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,994
He could probably tell I was crazy.

489
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,916
You look kind of moody.

490
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,003
I just feel like

491
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,964
I'm really an adult now.

492
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,176
Why?

493
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,014
I suddenly realized
I don't have a guardian.

494
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,353
But I'm going to be a guardian
for my little brother.

495
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,362
Want to get slushies?

496
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,323
I still owe you 2,000 won.

497
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,576
Let's call it even
since you helped me today.

498
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,412
No way. You should repay money with money

499
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,539
and show gratitude differently.

500
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,126
I'll let you show your gratitude
right now.

501
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,298
Congratulate me.

502
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,591
I…

503
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,137
got lucky and can compete
for the national team.

504
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,681
Really?

505
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,022
Congratulations. I'm happy for you.

506
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,235
I'm not on the team yet,

507
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,655
but I'm excited
about competing at the qualifier.

508
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,490
It's my first time.

509
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,744
-It's obvious with you.
-What is?

510
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,789
I can tell you'll do well,
although you don't see it.

511
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,585
No, I don't. Not at all.

512
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,672
I just hope I don't come in last.

513
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,715
You'll see.

514
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,977
YI-JIN

515
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,493
I WANTED TO SEE YOU
FROM DAD

516
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,466
I wanted to see you,
but I couldn't find you.

517
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,052
I'm doing well, so don't worry.

518
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,974
I'll stop by again,
so take care until then.

519
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,144
I miss you. From Dad.

520
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,807
The bus to Gunsan is about to depart.

521
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,060
Excuse me. Where's the bus to Gunsan?

522
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,561
-Go to Gate 16.
-Gate 16.

523
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:17,360
GUNSAN

524
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,861
Damn it.

525
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,341
Dad.

526
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,427
HOGYEONG EXPRESS BUS

527
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,762
Wait!

528
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,098
Please.

529
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,419
Dad.

530
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,278
I'm sorry. I…

531
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,449
I didn't know it was you
and hid in the bookstore.

532
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,580
I guess
people have been coming to see you.

533
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,459
I don't mind any of that.

534
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,755
You're not sick, are you?

535
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,049
No. Not at all.

536
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,054
I'm so glad I got to see you, Yi-jin.

537
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,016
Me too.

538
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,185
Okay.

539
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,899
We have to go, sir.

540
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,984
I need to go.

541
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,739
Make sure you eat well
and don't be discouraged.

542
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,326
Okay. Bye.

543
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,204
Dad.

544
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,916
I'll reunite our family.

545
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,669
I'll bring us together.

546
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,130
Okay.

547
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,635
I'm sorry, Yi-jin.

548
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,678
Sorry.

549
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,937
Bye now.

550
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,694
Bye.

551
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,424
Excuse me. Please open the door.

552
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,915
You could have been hurt.

553
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,046
What would have happened
if you hurt your ankle?

554
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,051
I'm sorry.

555
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,553
Are you out of your mind?

556
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,890
How long have you been running
to have ended up here?

557
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,809
Or wear sneakers if you're going to run!

558
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,397
Why were you running in slippers?
That's dangerous.

559
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,862
I'm really sorry.

560
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,574
You don't have to be.

561
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,706
I met my dad.

562
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,299
Thank goodness.

563
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,094
I'm so glad.

564
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,489
Thanks.

565
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,623
What--

566
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,717
How could you look for someone
all the way here?

567
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,471
My dad wouldn't be here.

568
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,895
I can't find him if I don't look for him.

569
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,401
Where did you find him?

570
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,779
At the bus terminal.

571
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,993
You're so…

572
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,997
smart.

573
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,085
I guess you really did get good grades.

574
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,962
That's right.

575
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,423
And you're as foolish as I expected.

576
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,635
Oh, right.

577
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,973
Here.

578
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,142
You dropped it earlier.

579
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,564
YI-JIN

580
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,610
I thought you couldn't see your dad
because of me.

581
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,157
I felt so bad that I didn't think
I could face you again.

582
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,868
And…

583
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,287
that terrified me.

584
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,711
Then I can't go to rent Full House.

585
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,006
I'd have to find another store.

586
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,554
Were you hurt?

587
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,557
You were running around for two hours.

588
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,185
It's been two hours already?

589
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,486
How funny.

590
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,739
Is it funny?

591
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,701
I don't have any glue.
How will I get home?

592
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,627
I'm smart, so I'll figure it out.

593
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,923
The most you'll think of
is wrapping your foot in a plastic bag.

594
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,301
How did you know?

595
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,815
Put this in your bag.

596
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,401
Exactly.

597
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,323
Left foot.

598
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,367
-Left foot.
-What the heck?

599
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,745
-Left foot. I said, left foot.
-You said left!

600
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,916
I thought you meant my left!

601
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,794
Are you getting upset with me?

602
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,298
Didn't we agree to be happy
when we're together?

603
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:02,050
I wasn't getting upset. I was protesting!

604
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,220
And I feel like
my shoulder's about to pop.

605
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,431
Don't you want to go home?

606
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,100
-I do.
-Let's go.

607
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,019
Left foot.

608
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,521
-Left foot.
-Right foot.

609
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,650
-That's it.
-Right foot.

610
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,194
What a strange day.

611
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,447
Things happened that were like a dream

612
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,034
as well as things
that I wished were a dream.

613
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,957
RYDER37: THINGS HAPPENED
THAT WERE LIKE A DREAM

614
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,793
INJEOLMI: YOU SEEM HAPPY THOUGH

615
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,671
How'd you know?

616
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,675
I'm kind of happy right now.

617
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,222
You seem to know me really well.

618
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,687
INJEOLMI: WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MEET SOMEDAY, RIGHT?

619
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,484
This thought suddenly came to me.

620
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,029
Maybe we know each other already.

621
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,407
Perhaps we've crossed paths before.

622
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,496
RYDER37: PERHAPS
WE'VE CROSSED PATHS BEFORE

623
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,414
INJEOLMI: NO

624
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,668
INJEOLMI: THERE'S NO WAY
I WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU

625
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,299
You're right.

626
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,763
You want to do what?

627
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,808
I'd like to train more.

628
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,935
Early mornings
and on the weekends as well.

629
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,603
Go ahead.

630
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,691
I don't think I'll improve
if I train by myself.

631
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,527
Can't you give me some guidance?

632
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,695
Look at you.

633
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,948
You want me to spend my weekends
and free time coaching you?

634
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,158
I know I can train hard.

635
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,786
I don't think I can. It's too tiring.

636
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,706
Please help me.

637
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,334
Darn it.

638
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,212
What's your goal?

639
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,506
I want to come in first.

640
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,884
You want to make the national team?

641
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,344
Yes.

642
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,638
Listen to this kid.

643
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,640
At least you know how to dream.

644
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,935
Anyone can have a dream.

645
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,855
No. Countless kids
don't know how to dream,

646
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,023
but you do.

647
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,485
How early in the morning
do you want to train?

648
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:30,032
Since morning training starts
at 9 o'clock, at least 6:30 a.m.--

649
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,159
What? At 6:30 a.m.?

650
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,371
Are you telling me to wake up by 6 a.m.?

651
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,542
Hey! I moved closer to the school
to sleep an extra 30 minutes.

652
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,835
The house here is much more expensive.

653
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,712
How could you do this to me?

654
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,090
I'm sorry.

655
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,138
Damn it.

656
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,101
Can you really keep up with my training?

657
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,566
Yes! I know I can do it!

658
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,743
Will you do everything I say?

659
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,703
I will.

660
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,581
I really want to.

661
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,334
How far is your home
from the school on foot?

662
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,461
About an hour.

663
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,297
Listen carefully.

664
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,216
First.

665
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:35,222
Put on 5kg weights on your torso,
3kg on your ankles,

666
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,599
and 2kg on your wrists

667
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,810
and run from your home
to mine every morning.

668
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,561
And wake me up.

669
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,523
Coach.

670
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,484
Coach! Wake up!

671
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,117
Coach. Wake up.

672
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,827
Hey. I'm up.

673
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,246
Go get started with 1,000 fentes.

674
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:05,085
Second. Practice 1,000 fentes every day.

675
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,422
Do 300 early morning, 300 during
morning training, and 400 at night.

676
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,221
Your legs. They're shaking.

677
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,141
Concentrate!

678
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,146
Third.

679
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,274
Climb the nearby mountain
every weekend with two jugs.

680
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,736
Fill them with spring water at the summit

681
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,154
and bring them to me.

682
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,905
You get two hours.

683
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,576
It'll take a while to come down,
so you should run up.

684
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,287
Don't try to fool me

685
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,705
-with tap water.
-Stop.

686
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,000
I can tell. I've been drinking
that water for five years.

687
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,544
What a waste.

688
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,671
-Give me that.
-Okay.

689
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,090
Fourth.

690
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,635
Memorize the choreography I choose
and show it to me.

691
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,518
Damn it!

692
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,191
That's so hard.

693
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,985
Why do I have to do that?

694
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,572
-Last and foremost.
-Last.

695
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:19,493
Do not question anything
that I make you do.

696
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,788
Why? Because you wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

697
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,459
She's right.

698
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,086
I wouldn't understand even if she told me.

699
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,506
Let's just do as I'm told.

700
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,223
Plant your back foot.

701
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,141
Relax your shoulders.

702
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:44,851
That's it.

703
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,480
En garde.

704
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,816
Rompez.

705
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,360
Fente. That's right.

706
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,696
Look at her showing off
just because she qualified.

707
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:01,117
She looks like a personal coach
rather than a team coach.

708
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,496
-She's never done that for us.
-En garde.

709
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,622
Exactly.

710
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,257
Hi, Yu-rim. Enjoy your lunch.

711
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,383
Coach.

712
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,802
Yes?

713
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,597
Are you giving Hee-do
one-on-one training for the qualifier?

714
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,849
No.

715
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,810
It's because she begged me.

716
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,728
She asked you?

717
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,565
Yes, because she wants to come in first
at the qualifier.

718
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,698
Yu-rim, you know,

719
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,659
if a student asks to be trained,

720
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,537
it's the coach's duty to oblige.

721
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,206
Plus, that brings me great joy.

722
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,625
However…

723
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:55,255
"Coach, can you help me
for just one more hour?"

724
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,382
"How's my fente?"

725
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,093
It's easy to ask.

726
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,763
But does it hurt their pride?

727
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,683
No one ever asks me for help.

728
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,477
No one.

729
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,820
That punk.

730
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,493
-I'm so tired.
-I'm exhausted.

731
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,162
It's so annoying.

732
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,414
I know.

733
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,250
Good work as always, everyone!

734
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,668
-Good night.
-Sure.

735
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,048
-And you?
-Let's go.

736
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,758
You go ahead.

737
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,842
Okay.

738
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,123
I'm playing StarCraft.

739
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,626
I'm sorry, but we're full.

740
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,710
What?

741
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,881
You don't have a single computer?

742
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,341
-No.
-Seriously?

743
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,176
Damn it.

744
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,929
It looks like…

745
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,186
-Number ten is done.
-Pardon?

746
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,773
I'm going to take his place.

747
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,988
You're not doing well.

748
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,489
What the hell?

749
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,616
Coach.

750
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,202
What are you doing here?

751
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,997
Your underclassmen are training hard
even at night,

752
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,624
but you're training extra hard here.

753
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,960
So? Is it easier to win at games?

754
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,504
No, Coach. I was just leaving.

755
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,297
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

756
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,299
-I'm sorry.
-Get home safely.

757
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,934
Excuse me. I'd like cup noodles
at station ten please.

758
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,310
Okay.

759
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,937
Nice.

760
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,309
Damn it.

761
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,478
Have you punks lost your mind?

762
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,525
Seriously.

763
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,709
Hey.

764
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,004
I said no night training
without my permission.

765
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,137
Must you throw your senior
under the bus just to do well?

766
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,267
I'm sorry.

767
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,355
At least she doesn't know anything.

768
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,150
What's your problem?

769
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,112
You won one gold medal,

770
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,531
so you have no respect for seniors?

771
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,117
Do you think you're above us?

772
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,038
What do you think you're doing?

773
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,586
That will hurt.
She's covered in bruises already.

774
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,755
Damn it.

775
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,176
Hey, you. Have you lost your mind?

776
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,679
Why should we get in trouble for training?

777
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,725
Why must we be afraid to work hard?

778
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,603
She and I stayed behind to train
because we were desperate!

779
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,188
-Why you--
-I'm sorry.

780
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,566
I was thoughtless.

781
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,317
It'll never happen again.

782
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,404
-Why are you sorry--
-Shut up.

783
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,119
This is just great.

784
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,914
-We'll leave right now.
-No.

785
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,749
Don't leave.

786
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,463
Clean the floor until it shines.

787
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,757
You like to train.

788
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,093
This is the best for strength training.

789
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,305
I'll examine it in the morning.

790
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,557
Not a speck of dust, got it?

791
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,994
Why should we apologize?

792
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,126
You were always like this, weren't you?

793
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,480
You're both equally impossible to talk to.

794
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,275
It would have been over
if you had apologized.

795
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,320
Talking back like you

796
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,323
only makes them nag and abuse us more.

797
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,661
Life becomes easier
if you back down briefly.

798
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,162
How is it any easier?

799
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,291
You can't train properly
and have to tiptoe around them.

800
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,546
You have to lose to them in a spar
and in official matches too.

801
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,463
How is that easy?

802
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,259
That only applies
to average fencers like you, not to me.

803
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,262
If you stand out,

804
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,222
everyone wants to support you.

805
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,315
Average fencers

806
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,819
should shut up
no matter how they've been wronged?

807
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:44,289
Don't disrespect what I've had to endure.

808
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,464
Sure.

809
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,967
What a gold medalist had to endure…

810
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,764
is worth much more
than what average fencers like me endured.

811
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,063
Well…

812
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,025
I guess there are tiers even in effort

813
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,237
although everyone endured the same.

814
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,326
You know what?

815
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,123
I really…

816
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,005
liked and idolized you.

817
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,970
I think that's exactly…

818
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,184
how much I can loathe you from now on.

819
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,191
Clean the floor by yourself.

820
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,277
I did nothing wrong, so I won't do it.

821
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,213
Ko Yu-rim wins the gold!

822
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:00,758
Ko Yu-rim wins a gold medal for Korea!

823
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,136
She's so cool.

824
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,361
Thanks for the umbrella!

825
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,080
"Thanks for the umbrella!"

826
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:52,268
MYEONGJIN BOOK RENTALS

827
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,771
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 12

828
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,608
Bye.

829
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,821
Is something wrong?

830
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,116
No.

831
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,620
I have something for you.

832
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,130
You broke yours because of me.

833
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,971
What is it? What's wrong?

834
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,974
Tell me.

835
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,853
You said we should be happy
when we're together.

836
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,980
It doesn't work if it's one-sided.

837
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,403
Then…

838
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,741
can you say something, no questions asked?

839
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,744
What is it?

840
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,836
"Yu-rim was in the wrong."

841
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,350
You can't, can you?

842
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,143
I don't know what--

843
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,531
Hee-do!

844
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:30,950
Hee-do.

845
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,619
Don't just leave like that.

846
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,710
I've had a really crappy day.

847
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,592
Was that so hard to say?
It's not like you had to mean it.

848
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,430
I've always been on your side.

849
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,185
Yu-rim was in the wrong.

850
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,775
Does saying that help you feel better?

851
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,241
I don't think it does.

852
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,130
I just realized why I'm not a good fencer.

853
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,720
Controlling the distance
between you and your opponent

854
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,973
is the most important in fencing.

855
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,977
I think I've failed at that.

856
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,985
I've expected too much

857
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,071
from Yu-rim…

858
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,032
and from you.

861
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,162

CAN I MAKE THE NATIONAL TEAM SOMEDAY?

862
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,164
FENCING FAIRY KO YU-RIM

01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,594
KO YU-RIM MAKES THE HIGHEST GLOBAL RANK

865
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,333
I've failed to keep the right distance

866
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,420
with everyone I like.

867
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,339
I don't think

868
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,302
I can like her anymore.

869
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:53,611
INJEOLMI: SHE WAS IN THE WRONG

870
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,407
I really wanted to hear that today,

871
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,576
and you said it.

872
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:06,874
I guess I've succeeded in controlling
the distance with you at least.

873
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,719
There is no distance between us,

874
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,763
so there's no need to control it.

875
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,100
INJEOLMI

876
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:36,612
Thanks. I'm so glad I have you.

877
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,700
Don't forget. I'm always on your side.

878
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,870
DON'T FORGET. I'M ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE.

879
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,572
Hello.

880
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:23,701
Today, I'm very upset because of Hee-do.

881
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:27,079
Let's pretend we didn't see each other
and just walk on by.

882
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,249
Okay. Let's get down to business.

883
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,084
Do you have a plan B?

884
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,295
That was humiliating.

885
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,590
Yu-rim, I'm not one of your fans.

886
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,175
I thought you had decided to hate me.

887
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,801
You have to stop liking me.

888
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,012
What am I looking at right now?

889
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:49,518
I hope the road ahead of us
is filled with more comedy.

890
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,146
Expectations for
how things should turn out.
