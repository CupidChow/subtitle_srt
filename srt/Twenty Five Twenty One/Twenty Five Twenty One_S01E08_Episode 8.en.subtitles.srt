1
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,154
Referee Smith asserted
that his decision at the match was fair.

2
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,992
The young athletes had to bear the weight
of overly emotional speculation.

3
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,205
What should have been the happiest moment
became a piercing wound.

4
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,457
With UBS News, I'm Back Yi-jin.

5
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,712
I'm so glad that he took her side.

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,130
What is it?

7
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,048
EPISODE 8

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,758
Gosh, you startled me.

9
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,887
Why are you watching that old news?

10
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,225
Grandma. It must have been tough
for you back then.

11
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,479
What is?

12
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,524
So, I was looking through some things

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,984
and found out
that Mom went through a dispute

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,694
for her medal at the Asian Games.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,365
I saw you on the news

16
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,369
referring to her medal
as "a stolen gold medal."

17
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,249
But you were not only a mom

18
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,625
but also a news anchor.

19
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,670
That must have been heartbreaking.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,421
Gosh.

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,930
Your mom could not get
what a 15-year-old you can understand.

22
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,641
She just doesn't even try to be
in other people's shoes.

23
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,017
I know.

24
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,230
It's not like
I wanted to read that line on the news.

25
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,735
Do you know how I felt
having to attack my daughter?

26
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,029
That was the day

27
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,408
when I regretted my career
as a news anchor for the first time.

28
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,076
I totally understand.

29
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:51,462
How did Hee-do end up
with such a smart daughter like you?

30
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,092
But my mom is from you, Grandma.

31
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,265
I love you, Min-chae.

32
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,727
I love you, Yi-jin.

33
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,855
Please remember this moment.

34
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,524
I love you so much.

35
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,028
What?

36
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,114
I love you too, Da-eun.

37
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,935
You loved Da-eun a lot.

38
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,895
Why on earth are you listening to this?

39
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,440
So to explain what had happened,
Hee-do was in the broadcasting room…

40
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,692
It's all because
you had suddenly disappeared.

41
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,822
Hey.

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,493
Stop talking to him so casually.
I feel uncomfortable.

43
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,663
Let me use the restroom.

44
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,916
Thank you all for coming to save me.

45
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,531
You startled me!

46
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,704
Same here. I wasn't expecting
to find you here in the men's room.

47
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,960
Sorry.

48
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,134
Hee-do.

49
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,188
Do you carry this with you?

50
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,150
My dad advised me to.

51
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,402
He said a gentleman
should carry a handkerchief.

52
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,070
Thanks.

53
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,284
But aren't you supposed to be in Gyeongju?

54
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,286
I got kicked out from the NTC.

55
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,622
I was told to stay at home
until I'm disciplined.

56
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,875
This is your home?

57
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,461
I have to see Mom if I go home.

58
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,504
I don't want to.

59
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,884
Then were you going to
stay the night here?

60
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,677
Why are you so reckless--

61
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,471
Will you stop it?

62
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,724
You nag when you're with me

63
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,518
but you interviewed the referee
and aired it on the news.

64
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,812
What you're doing doesn't add up.

65
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,992
Thank you.

66
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,410
You don't need to thank me.

67
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,412
I would have done the same for anyone.

68
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,997
So? I know that.

69
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,666
But still…

70
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,253
you did that for me.

71
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,638
Gosh Hee-do. Stop worrying me.

72
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,702
Isn't she scared?

73
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,539
How did she think of sleeping here?

74
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,750
That's how you have to think
if you want to win the gold medal.

75
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,046
I guess she was too busy fencing
to know about the toilet ghost.

76
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,756
The toilet ghost?

77
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,467
I heard about this from my band member.

78
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,097
Every midnight, there's a sound of
someone crying on the fourth floor,

79
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,975
inside the far-end toilet.

80
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,229
And if you go closer
to check who is inside,

81
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,192
a pale hand would appear under the door
and grab your ankle like this!

82
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,239
That's such a cliché horror story.

83
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,032
No wonder it didn't sell.

84
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,953
True. You didn't know about it.

85
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,334
But Seung-wan.

86
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,378
What?

87
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,422
Now…

88
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,968
it's midnight.

89
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,666
What happened?

90
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,126
Nothing!

91
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,295
Then what's with the running?

92
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,130
Because it's scary!

93
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,805
This is so exhausting.

94
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,406
CLASS 1 KIM DA-EUN
CLASS 4 JUNG DA-EUN

95
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,035
I love you too, Da-eun.

96
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,544
PARK DA-EUN

97
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,716
So that's her.

98
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,062
BACK YI-JIN

99
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,481
They're like birds of a feather
flocking together.

100
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,165
This is her.

101
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,126
Park Da-eun.

102
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,135
Why did she put her hair down like that?

103
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:04,437
I have no idea what I'm doing now.

104
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,939
But one thing is for sure,

105
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,067
I'm so very annoyed.

106
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,074
I dated only for two weeks,
where all I got to do was to use nicknames

107
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,077
and even was mocked by Yi-jin for that.

108
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,287
Fine!

109
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,416
He's been deeply in love before,
so I guess he just couldn't help himself.

110
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,169
"I love you too, Da-eun"?

111
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,423
I love you too, Da-eun.

112
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,524
This is frustrating. I'm so upset!

113
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,000
It looks pretty good.

114
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,554
HOW ANNOYING!

115
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,690
Chairman Back's eldest son?

116
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,025
Yes, sir.

117
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,027
How have you been?

118
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,197
You've come to
a creditor's house on your own?

119
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,537
I wanted to give you this.

120
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,749
I got a job and saved up a little.

121
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,461
I know this is nothing
compared to what my dad owes you,

122
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,963
but this is straight from the heart,

123
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,215
so please add this
to your daughter's tuition.

124
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,186
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,981
I'll get going now.

126
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,734
You made a promise.

127
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,573
You said you will never be happy,
not even for a moment.

128
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,451
Don't keep that promise.

129
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,412
It had been weighing on my mind.

130
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,836
I acted out on you
despite all of this not being your fault.

131
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,173
As a parent with a child,
I shouldn't have done that.

132
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,010
But that was all I could do at the time.

133
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,014
I understand.

134
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,812
It can be difficult, but do your best…

135
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,900
to find happiness.

136
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,366
My daughter's got a scholarship.

137
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,828
I will try.

138
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,461
What is this?

139
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,296
I got paid.

140
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,008
Oh my gosh. This is beef!

141
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,095
Why did you buy something so expensive?

142
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,514
I wanted to thank you for the side dishes.

143
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,936
You are such
a decent and pleasant eldest son.

144
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,731
I'm sure your father misses you a lot.

145
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,656
I want to be successful
and bring my family back together.

146
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,744
What?

147
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,582
Mom, don't let him in here from now on.

148
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,375
Why is she so upset?

149
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,376
Yu-rim,

150
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,421
I got your favorite. Here.

151
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,589
POWDERED CANDY

152
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,180
I quit this in junior high.

153
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,348
I'm not a kid anymore.

154
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,516
That's right.

155
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,561
She was a kid,
but she will turn 20 next year.

156
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,856
You must be hungry.
Sit down for some tteokbokki.

157
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
I heard you got kicked out from the NTC.

158
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,823
Did you hear that from Hee-do too?

159
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
Why do you hear about everything from her?

160
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,453
You should at least cut her some slack.

161
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,289
The entire world is
coming at Hee-do to pick on her.

162
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,711
I made a complaint

163
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,756
because I really was faster than her.

164
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,134
I had no idea
that she would be criticized by everyone

165
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,013
because I complained and was in distress.

166
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,518
I just did what I could as an athlete.

167
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,689
I had never imagined
that kind of response.

168
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,695
That means you have way more people

169
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,657
rooting for you than you think.

170
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,785
And if that leads to blaming someone,

171
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,536
I don't need that kind of support.

172
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,997
You don't get to decide that.

173
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,333
That's the life of a star.

174
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,295
What do you mean by "a star"?
I'm just an athlete.

175
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,466
You don't get to decide on that, either.
What you can decide is…

176
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,052
Let's see. Right.

177
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,850
Whether you are going to eat
this tteokbokki or not. That's about it.

178
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,275
Are you trying to say
that life doesn't go the way we want?

179
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,487
Look at me.

180
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,406
I've become a reporter out of the blue.

181
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,077
So, where do you stay now?

182
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,371
I'm at a small studio in front of UBS.

183
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:42,167
But I'm moving this weekend.
You're going to help me, right?

184
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,585
Where are you moving to?

185
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,384
He's moving back? To here?

186
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,594
He asked if the room was still available.

187
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,304
So I told him to come right away.

188
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,889
I heard he is now a TV reporter.

189
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,475
Auntie, thanks for everything.

190
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,061
And take care, Seung-wan.

191
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,773
Is this the only room available in Seoul?

192
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,483
Why would he insist on coming here?

193
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,277
I guess he liked this place.

194
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,405
The landlord is generous,
the house is in great condition,

195
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,698
and it's close to the TV station.

196
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,616
There's no reason to stop him.

197
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,786
And not many tenants keep the room
as tidy as he can.

198
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,496
-But Auntie!
-Gosh, you startled me.

199
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,083
How could you decide on that
without consulting me first?

200
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,132
Can I stay at your place until I graduate?

201
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,802
Gosh. Gossip about us
will spread like wildfire then.

202
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,306
People have been
gossiping about us for ten years.

203
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,641
It's about time
people talk of us living together.

204
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,646
It's fun to be at the center of a gossip,
but not now.

205
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,608
That could upset Yu-rim.

206
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,027
So there's something between you two?

207
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,029
Have you asked her out?

208
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,494
My heart is
about to burst at the phrase "ask out."

209
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,955
Your heart is here.

210
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,712
-What should I do?
-What?

211
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,258
In my mind, I asked her out,
got rejected, cried at home

212
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,970
and yelled at my mom

213
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
when she asked me to come eat.

214
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,600
Isn't this sad?

215
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,269
I can't stop myself from crying.

216
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,187
You're crazy.

217
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,064
Just worry about the moving day.

218
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,650
-What are we going to do?
-Thanks. Bye!

219
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,276
Who's moving?

220
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,821
Hi, Hee-do.

221
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,241
Hey, you can have one each.

222
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,661
Eat up now and give me the wrapper.

223
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,121
I'll throw it away.

224
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,337
I think she's after the stickers.

225
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,672
Geez. You're nuts.

226
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,551
Why would an Asian Games gold medalist
collect stickers?

227
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,219
Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,057
She's not in grade school
but an adult next year. What nonsense.

229
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,990
Oh my gosh! This is just so cute!

230
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,910
Note to self. Don't rush to conclusions!

231
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,746
You have to collect them
when they are this cute.

232
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,957
Here you go.

233
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,421
Hey, what was that about moving?
Are you moving?

234
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,799
Yi-jin is moving back in.

235
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,385
What? Back to Seung-wan's?

236
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,554
-When?
-This Saturday.

237
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,348
Hey, let's study at the library
on that day.

238
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,808
What should I do then?

239
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,059
Aren't you going to help him move?

240
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,521
Seung-wan, he is your senior
from the broadcasting club.

241
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,275
He is also my senior from the band.

242
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,944
I couldn't have known about it.
It's your fault, Hee-do.

243
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,989
Guys, then we should definitely help him.

244
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,782
Wouldn't that put your mind at ease?

245
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,951
Count me in.

246
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,163
-I can come and help too.
-Well…

247
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,582
I guess you're right.

248
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,428
Sir, welcome back!

249
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,679
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

250
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,683
-What is this?
-A gift.

251
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,809
How did you find out about this?

252
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,479
They asked me to help you move in.

253
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
-That's what you said.
-That's what you said.

254
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,649
When did I say that?

255
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,152
I see. So you two didn't want to help,
but were forced to come?

256
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,988
That's not it. So where is Da-eun?

257
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,450
Hey, Yu-rim.

258
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,535
Are you also here to help him?

259
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,371
Yes.

260
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,754
Should I go, or should you?

261
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,382
We shouldn't really be in the same room.

262
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,050
I'm not leaving.

263
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,426
I'm here to help.

264
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,428
Fine then. I'm not leaving either.

265
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,055
Where should we start?

266
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,816
Metallica. This is a great album.

267
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,695
This one is by Judas Priest.

268
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,865
He even has Black Sabbath's album.
Geez. He was tough.

269
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,078
Way to go! The 14th year guitarist
for The Jungle Prince.

270
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,122
But isn't hip-hop the mainstream nowadays?

271
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,166
I guess he is too old-fashioned
to listen to modern music.

272
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,419
Hey, you can't call
music these days as music.

273
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,879
Still, I like hip-hop more than rock.

274
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,674
-I agree. Hip-hop is better.
-What?

275
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,927
And who do we have here?

276
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,266
"I love you too, Da-eun."

277
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,768
Right. She must be Da-eun.

278
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,770
No, that's Min-young.

279
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,063
-What?
-What?

280
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,481
That's Min-young.

281
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,817
She was Yi-jin's girlfriend
for the longest time.

282
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,360
He was with Da-eun only briefly.

283
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,698
Yet they loved each other that much?

284
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,827
How do you all know about Da-eun?

285
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,291
I'm so glad that you now have a job.

286
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,085
When everyone found out
you didn't pass the interview,

287
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,796
we were really worried about you.

288
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,132
This is somewhat a glorious return!

289
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,258
He's a ladies' man.

290
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,177
-It's good to see you back.
-Take care.

291
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,679
-See you around.
-Please get home safely.

292
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,934
Wait, I'm sending that to my grandma's.

293
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,938
I wonder how many ladies you have
in that neighborhood.

294
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,984
How does it feel
to be surrounded by women all the time?

295
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,195
What are you on about?

296
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,615
Because of them?

297
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,869
You account for
80 percent of what had just happened.

298
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,164
It's because you let everyone know
that I didn't pass the interview.

299
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,918
If I account for 80 percent,
what about the remaining 20?

300
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,213
Do you even have to ask?
It's standing right in front of you.

301
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,218
He's annoying.

302
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,679
Did you take the tape? The sticky one.

303
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,348
-The sticky one?
-Yes.

304
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,266
I have it right here.

305
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,983
It's perfect.

306
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,445
When was this from…

307
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,992
What's her problem?

308
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,586
Hello. I thought
you weren't on the news today.

309
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,046
I have something else.

310
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,050
Hey, aren't you on the Gyeongju team?
Why do I keep seeing you in Seoul?

311
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,468
No, I'm on the Seoul team.

312
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,303
I went down to set up interviews
with the athletes,

313
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,013
then I got back late
because of the fencing controversy.

314
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,099
I heard that
Yi-jin is now on the Seoul team.

315
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,977
You saw him. He needs some guidance.

316
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,061
He's a loose cannon.

317
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,688
In a good way or a bad way?

318
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,857
It goes both ways I'd say.

319
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,363
Take care.

320
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,781
Bye, ma'am.

321
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,163
I doubt you came
all the way here to see me.

322
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,455
Of course not.

323
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,877
They want a copy of my bankbook
to pay me for my work.

324
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,505
I do have something to give you.

325
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,676
Let's sit down.

326
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,848
How did he tie this so tightly?

327
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,771
Can you pass me the scissors?

328
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,873
Can't one of you just go home?

329
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,166
It's awkward to be here.

330
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,793
She's right.
Hee-do, I think you've done enough.

331
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,089
Since when have you two been on bad terms?

332
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,424
Is this because of what happened?

333
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,176
You're the one making things awkward.

334
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,637
What? He's even got this.

335
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,347
Wait, what was that called?

336
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,057
-It's an arm exerciser.
-Right!

337
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,767
Gosh, this is really hard to do.

338
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,312
Someone like you would only end up
hurting your shoulders. Be careful.

339
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,731
You use the muscles
you're born with to do this.

340
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,816
I bet I can do more than you.

341
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,738
Ji-woong, I'm an athlete
who is on the national team.

342
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,740
Haven't you seen me on TV?

343
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,991
Bring it over here.

344
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,415
Hold it like this.

345
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,420
One, two, three, four,

346
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,505
-five…
-Five…

347
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:53,176
six, seven, eight, nine,

348
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,639
ten, eleven, twelve,

349
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,225
thirteen…

350
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,144
fourteen, fifteen,

351
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,855
sixteen…

352
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,658
The look on my face right now…

353
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,439
Guys, you said you came to help me.

354
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,482
I never asked for any of your help,

355
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,526
but you all came anyway!

356
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,036
I'm sorry. I'll clean this up.

357
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,746
Hey, don't move.

358
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,248
You could get hurt.

359
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,423
Let me hold you for a second.

360
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,640
Stay here.

361
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,229
Yi-jin, what about me?

362
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,108
What was that sound?

363
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,029
Oh my gosh! How did this happen?

364
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:40,033
Mom, it was me. I broke it.

365
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,037
-Thank you for the meal!
-Thank you for the meal!

366
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,580
Gosh, it's hot.

367
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,416
All of you can go after having this.

368
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,587
The window will be fixed tomorrow,
so please bear with it for a while.

369
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,214
Okay.

370
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,347
Is that for me?

371
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,521
That was the only paper large enough
to cover the window.

372
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,442
Enjoy your meal, Yu-rim.

373
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,194
Same to you.

374
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,320
Thanks.

375
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,867
Hee-do, why do you look so absent-minded?

376
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,995
-Me?
-Did that arm exerciser blow your mind?

377
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,832
No, nothing.

378
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,443
Let me hold you for a second.

379
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,249
Please remember this moment.

380
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,793
I love you so much.

381
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,422
I love you too, Da-eun.

382
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,215
No, that's Min-young.

383
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,259
She was Yi-jin's girlfriend
for the longest time.

384
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,347
-This is just so annoying!
-What is so annoying?

385
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,517
When did you get back?

386
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,729
Did you buy all this just to collect that?

387
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,231
You're wrong.

388
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,068
When are you going to stop acting stupid?

389
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,618
I figured you were avoiding it,

390
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,411
so I didn't want to bring it up.

391
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,499
But have you reflected on your attitude
at the press conference?

392
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,085
You're a gold medalist, so act like one.

393
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,255
So are you acknowledging
that I'm a gold medalist?

394
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,925
I thought it was "a stolen gold medal."

395
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,469
You said so yourself on the news.

396
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,179
What are you getting at?

397
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,390
Should I have sided with you
since you're my daughter?

398
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,976
What do you think the news is?

399
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,990
When you read that line…

400
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,120
did you at least feel
a little sorry for me?

401
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,752
What difference would that make?

402
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,089
I don't apologize
for things being the way they are.

403
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,218
There is always a victim to
every news I cover.

404
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,470
Then should I be going around apologizing?

405
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,431
I've decided not to feel sorry for anyone,

406
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,100
and I'm not making an exception.

407
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,230
Is that so? All right.

408
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,860
Good for you. It's great
that you don't make any exceptions.

409
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,739
What do you want me to do?

410
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,701
You don't want to do anything.

411
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,412
So let's stay out
of each other's business.

412
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,581
Whether I do something stupid or not

413
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,625
has nothing to do with you and your news.

414
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,697
The gold medal your daughter threw away.

415
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,497
I got it from the Federation.

416
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,791
I thought you should give it to her.

417
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,002
Why did you think that?

418
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,506
You said on the news yourself
that it's "a stolen gold medal."

419
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,386
That's that, but you should
offer an olive branch to your daughter.

420
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,679
Give it to her in person.

421
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,851
I can relate to
what Hee-do must be going through.

422
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,062
I was once betrayed by a trusted friend.

423
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,033
The national team coach Ms. Yang Chan-mi

424
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,994
bought this car
from an athlete, Mr. Kim's father.

425
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,164
It costs more than 3 million won
in the used car market.

426
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:42,543
But Coach Yang bought the car
for 1.5 million won.

427
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,130
She leveraged her power to select
the members of the national team

428
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,674
for personal gain.

429
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,718
Nice work, Jae-kyung.

430
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,595
Thank you.

431
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,640
But didn't you say
you were close to Coach Yang?

432
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,405
This story is for a minute and a half,

433
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,908
so we'll show the scene from the match,
then the interview for 20 seconds.

434
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,035
Excuse me.

435
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,749
Back Yi-jin speaking.

436
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,084
Yi-jin, are you in the Jongno area?

437
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,129
Yes, sir. I just interviewed
Yeo Hong-chul's parents and…

438
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,382
Go to the Central Government Building
right now. There's a fire.

439
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,468
Check if it is arson
and get a phone ready.

440
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,470
-Yes, sir.
-This will be on the main news.

441
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,555
Yes, sir.

442
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,603
We have to
get to the Central Government Building.

443
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,563
Okay.

444
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,856
A fire broke out.

445
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,572
I know it's temporary,
but still, I'm in the sports dept.

446
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,830
As you know,
a fire can break out anywhere.

447
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,540
This time, it happened to be at the MOU.

448
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,375
Are you saying this isn't an arson attack?

449
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,544
Like I said, there are no signs so far.

450
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,756
The fire was at the MOU, which stores
a lot of important files on North Korea.

451
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,215
Did anything get destroyed?

452
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,053
We back up the important files,
so that won't be the case.

453
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,890
But do you know
that the fire spread to the press room?

454
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,224
Phones are unavailable.

455
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,062
Hurry up!

456
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,647
What time will you give us
an update on the investigation?

457
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,066
Within an hour.

458
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,402
But sir, don't you need to find a phone?

459
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,987
I already have one.

460
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,622
Gosh. How did I come up with
such a great idea!

461
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,583
All right.

462
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,629
Let's get ready.

463
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,013
Yes, the fire broke out around 6:20 p.m.…

464
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,556
INCOMING CALL

465
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,520
Back Yi-jin speaking.

466
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,813
Do you have a phone?

467
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,523
Yes, sir. Of course.

468
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,319
Yes, sir. I'll be on standby.

469
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,489
Our next news.

470
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,576
This afternoon, a fire broke out
at the government building on Sejong-ro.

471
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,037
Fortunately, there were no casualties,

472
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,999
but the fire alarm did not work and
it could have led to a huge catastrophe.

473
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,419
We'll hear the details,
live from the scene.

474
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,420
Back Yi-jin reports.

475
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:35,758
Yes, the fire broke out around 6:20 p.m.

476
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,177
The fire started from the MOU
on the fourth floor…

477
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,729
Yes, please continue.

478
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,189
Reporter Back Yi-jin?

479
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,788
Yes. It seems we have an issue
with the phone connection.

480
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,332
According to the investigations,

481
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,794
it is suspected the fire started
due to an overheated electrical fan.

482
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,797
We'll report further on this
once we have more details.

483
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,340
Our next news.

484
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,012
INCOMING CALL

485
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,512
Thank you.

486
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,142
Thank you, ma'am.

487
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,144
-Great work, everyone.
-Thank you.

488
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,520
Thank you, ma'am.

489
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,820
I'm sorry, ma'am.

490
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,663
There wasn't a connection issue.
You hung up, right?

491
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,375
I had the news typed up on my laptop,

492
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,210
but then a blue screen error…

493
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,965
So a reporter hangs up the phone
during live news?

494
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,302
I thought that was the best option.

495
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,638
My mind went blank.

496
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,432
How can a reporter
not be fully aware of his own story?

497
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,018
If you're dumb, you should have
had it printed but you didn't.

498
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,771
Then are you at least quick on your feet?
No, you're not.

499
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,524
What qualities do you have as a reporter?

500
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,776
I'm sorry.

501
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,609
I saw you on TV earlier.

502
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,361
Cheer up.

503
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,116
By the way, don't throw away the stickers.
Keep them for me.

504
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,201
Hee-do.

505
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,540
This is so humiliating.

506
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,461
ELEPHANT SNACKS

507
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,629
-I'm home.
-You're back.

508
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,131
Hurry, sit down and eat.

509
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,469
This looks tasty.

510
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,014
Did you bring your glove?
You said there's a hole in it.

511
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,265
Right, I have it here.

512
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,101
Let me take a look.

513
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,439
Here, and here.

514
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:22,318
Gosh. I darned this for the third time,
but it keeps getting worn out.

515
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,739
How about a new glove?

516
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,408
What time do you get off tomorrow?
Let's go and buy one.

517
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,620
No, that's a waste.
I can wear it after you darn it.

518
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,624
And tomorrow,

519
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,752
I have to be
at the disciplinary committee.

520
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,047
Oh, is that tomorrow?

521
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,091
All right.

522
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,094
Oh dear!

523
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,639
Did you stand surety
for that rice cake shop

524
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,599
when they had to buy a new machine?

525
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,393
Yes. Why?

526
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,936
Goodness.

527
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,438
It's terrible!

528
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,650
The owners of the shop
fled into the night!

529
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,445
What are you talking about?
I saw them yesterday.

530
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,198
I couldn't get in touch with them
this morning,

531
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,243
so I went to the shop and found out
that it was completely empty.

532
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,329
They had planned this all along!

533
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,291
Then what about the money
we've been saving?

534
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,461
Gosh. They took all of it!

535
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,881
-That can't be.
-Oh dear, wait!

536
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,550
Wait. I'm coming too.

537
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,427
Wait for me!

538
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,181
-Oh my gosh.
-What about my money!

539
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,516
-My money!
-Where are they?

540
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,268
-Where is she!
-Where's that wench!

541
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,020
-All the money's gone!
-My money!

542
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,064
-They're gone!
-Oh my goodness!

543
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,943
You rotten fools!
Do you know what that money was for?

544
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,112
It was for my child's wedding, damn it!

545
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,239
What should I do?

546
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,325
-Oh no!
-Goodness me.

547
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,995
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

548
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,957
At least,
you have a daughter who wins gold medals.

549
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,918
What about us! What should we do?

550
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,630
-Please calm down.
-What should we do?

551
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,757
-This can't be happening!
-No!

552
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,469
Oh, you poor thing.

553
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,680
My goodness. What are we going to do!

554
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,058
-Mom?
-Yes?

555
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,978
-What's going on?
-What?

556
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,856
Oh, it's nothing.

557
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,733
Let's go.

558
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,986
-What should we do?
-Where are you going?

559
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,654
-Oh dear!
-They took everything!

560
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,740
-We have to find them!
-Give our money back!

561
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,783
BANKBOOK

562
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,377
Ko Yu-rim and Na Hee-do
from Tae Yang High School fencing team

563
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,089
have degraded the dignity of an athlete
and destroyed the name of Korea's fencing

564
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:16,385
at the press conference
after the Asian Games fencing finals.

565
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,887
Therefore, severe punishment
should be imposed.

566
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,348
However, in consideration of
the achievements in international games,

567
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,393
which have contributed to
the development of Korea's fencing,

568
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,605
they will be suspended for three months.

569
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,690
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

570
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,858
Any objections?

571
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,860
No, sir.

572
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,074
Go and move out from the NTC immediately.

573
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,128
I'll make sure this never happens again.
I'm sorry.

574
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,340
We are throwing our weight behind you,

575
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,509
yet you lose a gold medal
and get yourself into trouble.

576
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,723
If you continue like this,
you won't be a star fencer anymore.

577
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,517
We only need one fencing star,

578
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,769
do you understand?

579
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,647
I'll do my best.

580
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,981
You should get going.

581
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,025
I have a question.

582
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,114
It's about the pension I'm receiving.

583
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,078
Would it be possible
to receive it in advance?

584
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,871
An advance on your pension?

585
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,499
Do you think that makes sense?

586
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:32,419
Gosh. How nice would it be
if you were from a well-off family?

587
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,547
I can ask,

588
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,217
but it's highly unlikely,
so don't get your hopes up.

589
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,345
Gosh.

590
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,585
Who could it be?

591
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,713
Everyone should be in Gyeongju now.

592
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,502
Ko Yu-rim?

593
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,124
What should I do!

594
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,211
-Oh no!
-Goodness me.

595
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,380
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

596
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,839
-Oh dear!
-My money!

597
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,345
What is she doing?

598
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,707
Yu-rim…

599
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,689
What has she been up to?

600
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,163
She cried.

601
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,583
I saw her cry.

602
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,673
I wonder what tragic circumstances
she has to endure.

603
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,509
I hated her so much…

604
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,971
but now I feel confused.

605
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,162
I hope she knows
that you feel this way about her.

606
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,957
Then she wouldn't feel so lonely.

607
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,172
Are you also going through a rough patch?

608
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,090
It just sounds like you are.

609
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,563
How about…

610
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,567
we meet up?

611
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,240
INJEOLMI: HOW ABOUT WE MEET UP?

612
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,708
How does it feel like to get kicked out?

613
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,337
Lessons come at a price,

614
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,632
but it came with
a very high price to pay this time, girls.

615
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,093
How long are you banned?

616
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,387
For three months.

617
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,059
They still want you
for the next international match.

618
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,977
They want their medals.

619
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:54,319
Train as usual for the three months.
Do you understand?

620
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,112
-Yes, Coach.
-Yes, Coach.

621
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,656
You can go now.

622
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,993
Hee-do, I need to have a word with you.

623
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,876
Hee-do, do you know reporter Back Yi-jin?

624
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,172
-Yes.
-How do you know him?

625
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,507
Are you two close?

626
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,427
I've known him
since before he became a reporter.

627
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,142
I don't care since when.

628
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,188
Don't be too close to
someone who became a reporter.

629
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,065
This is my advice as a fencer.

630
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,220
Yes, this is Back Yi-jin.

631
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,598
Yes, I put that on hold,

632
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,392
because you wanted to see how
the match goes next week.

633
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,812
Yes. I've already got
the shooting agreement signed.

634
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,607
Yes, I've sent the news
to the editor this morning.

635
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,775
Yes, understood.

636
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,830
He is such a grown-up.

637
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,004
This station is
Seon Jung Girls' High School.

638
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,143
Hey, Hee-do!

639
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,314
Geez. What a coincidence!

640
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,401
On your way back from school?

641
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,362
Yes. What about you?

642
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,780
I'm coming back from an interview.

643
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,824
Right. I have something for you.
Give me your hand.

644
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,328
Here.

645
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,166
Three…

646
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,918
four…

647
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,254
Thanks for the snack.

648
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,425
You didn't have to carry them with you.

649
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,469
In case we meet like this.

650
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,931
But this is so weird.

651
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,808
I was thinking about you.

652
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,103
-About me?
-Yes.

653
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,313
Why?

654
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,653
Look.

655
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,572
TEENAGERS ADDICTED
TO ONLINE CHAT ROOMS CANNOT SPELL

656
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,743
-Why you little…
-Hey.

657
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,707
Do not "distrub."

658
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,881
-I'll get going.
-Hey.

659
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,719
We go the same way.
Why would you go alone?

660
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,267
It's not like there's anything
special between us.

661
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,061
We have a debtor-creditor relationship.

662
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,189
What is that?

663
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,528
You owe me 2,000 won.

664
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,613
That makes you a debtor. Got it?

665
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,701
Get me ice cream. It's hot today.

666
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:36,583
AHYEON SUPERMARKET

667
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,001
Now you owe me 1,000 won.

668
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,549
Here. Let me pay you back.

669
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,134
No thanks.
Get me ice cream again next time.

670
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,302
Take it.

671
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,850
You can buy one with this next time.

672
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,021
Why are you acting so different today?
This isn't like you.

673
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,779
Nothing.

674
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,466
That jerk is crazy
to drive like that in an alley.

675
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,843
Are you okay?

676
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,305
What?

677
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:33,848
Yes.

678
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,393
Do I have ice cream on my face?

679
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,312
Hold on to this.

680
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,149
Let me take a look.

681
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,914
So what's going on with you today?
You haven't answered my question yet.

682
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,920
Nothing.

683
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,173
Everything's the same.

684
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,468
That's good to know then.

685
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,205
Right.

686
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:44,127
That handkerchief you lent me earlier…
I'll wash it and get it back to you.

687
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,962
I forgot.

688
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,299
Sure. You can get it back to me any time.

689
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,557
Why are you smiling?

690
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,437
Because I'm happy to see you.

691
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,319
This is me. Bye.

692
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,446
All right. Bye.

693
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,773
What is this?

694
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,783
Hey!

695
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,917
We meet again.

696
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,844
-Do you enjoy toying with me?
-What?

697
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,347
Is it fun for you to play me for a fool?

698
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,475
Why did you pull this prank? I'm upset!

699
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,687
Sorry, it was just for a laugh.

700
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,355
None of this is funny to me.

701
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,275
Do you think I'm in grade school
to laugh at a prank like this?

702
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:35,154
Right. You're an adult.
So to you, I'm still a kid.

703
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,449
You're smart. You read newspapers.

704
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,036
You work like a grown-up,
speaking on the phone using jargon.

705
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,706
But yes, I collect stickers!

706
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,502
I'm not as smart as you

707
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,547
and I've never been in true love
like you have.

708
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,301
All I know is how to fence. I know that!

709
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:05,351
But still, I don't want you treating me
like some young, dumb, funny kid.

710
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,354
I hate it.

711
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,865
Listen, Hee-do.

712
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,633
It feels like we're growing apart.

713
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,096
I can feel your world
and my world becoming distant.

714
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,933
You're so much ahead of me, and I'm…

715
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,732
Somehow, I feel like
I'm lagging far behind.

716
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,861
We'll hear the details,
live from the scene.

717
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,280
Back Yi-jin reports.

718
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,118
Yes, the fire broke out around 6:20 p.m.

719
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,621
The fire started from the MOU
on the fourth floor…

720
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,709
Yes, please continue.

721
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,711
Reporter Back Yi-jin?

722
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,759
Yes. It seems we have an issue
with the phone connection.

723
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,597
Oh no.

724
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:39,570
Your mistakes weren't small blunders,
but much more serious.

725
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,616
So I couldn't tease you about them…

726
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,996
Was that an accident yesterday?

727
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,833
The phone got cut off on a live broadcast.

728
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,171
He was reading off his laptop
then it shut down.

729
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,258
Rather than stuttering
and making the news a joke,

730
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,885
he simply hung up
as if there was a connection issue.

731
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,263
That was a good call in a split second.

732
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,432
And in a way,

733
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,102
you took the credit for those mistakes.

734
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,775
Whereas my mistake

735
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,528
had thrown me into an abyss.

736
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,661
I know what this feeling is.

737
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,497
I'm jealous of you.

738
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,042
I went too far.

739
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,503
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

740
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,224
There you go.

741
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,603
She should be properly dressed
since you two are living together.

742
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,602
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
DUE TO SOURCING ISSUES

743
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,440
Hi, Yu-rim.

744
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,568
Are you coming back from your training?

745
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,154
-Where are you going?
-To band practice for the festival.

746
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,448
By the way, is something going on at home?

747
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,159
Did something happen to your clothes?

748
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,454
This? I'm into hip-hop these days.

749
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,748
I think we have similar tastes.

750
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,250
We like the same things.

751
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:44,171
I was saying that if I had to choose,
hip-hop was better than rock.

752
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,214
Really?

753
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,259
Then what is your favorite?

754
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,678
Let's see. Toy,

755
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,847
Lee Juck, Kim Dong-ryul?

756
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,934
That's your type? The highly educated.

757
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,103
You thought my taste
in music sucked just now.

758
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:05,860
Even today this rain continues

759
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,992
What are you talking about?
I like them a lot.

760
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,744
ELEPHANT SNACKS

761
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,454
But is something wrong?

762
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,456
I've never seen the shop closed before.

763
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,919
To be honest,

764
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,714
I wanted to get in touch with you
a few days ago.

765
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:32,929
When I'm with you, it feels like
everything is going to be fine.

766
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:37,475
So I wanted to see you,
but I couldn't reach out.

767
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,062
Why?

768
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,563
Well…

769
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:49,195
I guess I didn't want to show you
that side of me.

770
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,198
Come on.

771
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,535
Can't you see
I'm wearing my heart on my sleeves?

772
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,538
I'm upset. I'm going.

773
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,041
All right, I won't.

774
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,003
I won't hesitate next time.

775
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,548
It's a promise.

776
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,637
On that note, what are you doing tomorrow?

777
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:18,724
Oh, I have this important thing tomorrow.

778
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,142
Very important.

779
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,409
-Thank you for the camera.
-Why do you need it for?

780
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,204
I'm meeting someone today,
and I want to take a picture together.

781
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,374
-A guy?
-I don't know.

782
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,917
What? Who are you meeting?

783
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,545
I'm meeting up with a friend I met online.

784
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,716
So you're going to meet someone
whose identity isn't verified?

785
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:52,758
But you're Ko Yu-rim.

786
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,637
That doesn't matter.
You don't know how much we've talked.

787
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,015
Are you going to go even if I stop you?

788
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,307
Yes. Bye!

789
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,893
Wait. I'm coming with you.

790
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,353
Why would you come with me?

791
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,897
I'll leave once I know
that person is safe to be with.

792
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,315
So you wait here for me.

793
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,152
-Wait, okay?
-But…

794
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,487
You just stay put.

795
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,197
All right. Then hurry up!

796
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,453
One yellow rose, please.

797
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,288
Sure. Just a moment, please.

798
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,212
Marronnier Park at 11 a.m.
Let's be there with a yellow rose.

799
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,339
That's how we'll find each other.

800
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,217
"Marronnier Park, 11 a.m."

801
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:38,804
"A yellow rose."

802
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,312
Thank you.

803
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,189
Bye.

804
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,200
You've been friends for three years,

805
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,243
yet you don't know their gender,
name, or age? That's absurd.

806
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,497
I suggested it. I didn't want them
to know that I'm Ko Yu-rim.

807
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,582
You're thinking like a true celebrity.

808
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,711
The less you know about the person,
the deeper the conversation gets.

809
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,421
Just keep quiet if you don't know.

810
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,632
Why would I have tagged along then?

811
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:40,825
No way.

812
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,201
What is?

813
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,536
This is insane.

814
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,870
What's insane?

815
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,248
Tell me.

816
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,169
Hey.

817
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,462
Hey, Yu-rim!

818
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,339
Where are you going?

819
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,924
What's with her?

820
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:24,785
Back Yi-jin.

821
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,334
Injeolmi is…

822
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,838
Back Yi-jin?

823
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,741
Everything is now making perfect sense.

824
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,752
I wasn't jealous of you.

825
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,839
I was upset
that I might not be good enough for you.

826
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:33,854
-Hee-do.
-Injeolmi.

827
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,065
No.

828
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,360
Yi-jin.

829
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:46,158
Our talks comforted me
through countless nights.

830
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:50,412
If that is you,
then I'm more than qualified.

831
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,456
I…

832
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,126
have to have you.

833
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,796
Say that again.

834
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,673
You're Injeolmi?

835
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,050
Don't you have any faith in me?

836
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,511
What am I to you?

837
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:53,058
-Come out.
-Did you tell Hee-do everything?

838
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,145
You helped me
get back on my feet numerous times.

839
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,604
You should take on the responsibility.

840
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:02,359
It's going to be the two of us
in that vast space. Isn't that romantic?

841
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,616
I'm not disappointed that you're Injeolmi.

842
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:13,078
I don't need a rainbow.

843
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:24,882
