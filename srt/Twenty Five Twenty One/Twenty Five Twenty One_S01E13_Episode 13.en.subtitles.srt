1
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,634
It wasn't a mistake.

2
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,514
I wanted a change for myself too.

3
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,791
The bruise is almost gone.

4
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,087
Does it not hurt anymore?

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,510
It's late. I'll walk you home.

6
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,355
EPISODE 13

7
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,075
Go in. It's cold.

8
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,104
Is this kind of love unacceptable?

9
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,027
You said you loved me…

10
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,198
but won't accept this kind of love, right?

11
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,455
You know…

12
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,085
I worry more about whether or not
the bruise on your toe healed…

13
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,548
and things like that.

14
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,104
Got it. I get what you mean.

15
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,777
Bye.

16
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,457
What is that all about?

17
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,668
How could you, Yi-jin?

18
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
Then what was
everything you did until now?

19
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,076
Why didn't the world come to an end?

20
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,664
End!

21
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,583
Just end, will you?

22
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,052
Don't cry, Mom. I mean…

23
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,305
Don't cry, Hee-do.

24
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,020
That jerk.

25
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,506
What right do you have to sulk
after making her cry?

26
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,216
You said you loved her.

27
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,303
You'll be fine.

28
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,722
She's not fine!

29
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,516
It'll all pass, Yi-jin.

30
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,018
Yi-jin?

31
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,730
Are you worried about yourself
after making Hee-do cry?

32
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,398
Unbelievable.

33
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,280
You're just leaving?

34
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,241
Fine, go.

35
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,118
Mom was right.

36
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
The world should have come to an end!

37
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,792
Unfortunately, the world
did not come to an end.

38
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,629
What? How much is the late charge?

39
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,755
Well…

40
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,715
It's 20 million won.

41
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,844
What? That's not right.

42
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,891
It's the millennium bug.

43
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,900
The 400,000 people who worked overtime
to prepare for the millennium bug

44
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,360
greeted the new year at work.

45
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,865
The nuclear bomb that frightened us
stayed in place without any movement.

46
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,202
The world simply laughed it off

47
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,580
as a funny anecdote
regarding the turn of the millennium.

48
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,625
A late fee of 20 million won?

49
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,878
A bug like that, I could laugh off.

50
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,010
However, I couldn't laugh off
my personal millennium bug.

51
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,518
That kiss.

52
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,109
INCOMING CALL

53
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,782
-Hello?
-What are you doing?

54
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,619
-What is it?
-Let's have a party.

55
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,497
For what?

56
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,463
Wait for me.

57
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,756
That feels good.

58
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,008
-Mom.
-Yes?

59
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,260
You won't be home until 1 a.m., right?

60
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,680
That's right. Why are you asking
when you know the answer?

61
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,475
I'm going to stay up and wait.

62
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,976
Let's snack when you get home.

63
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,978
-Okay.
-Your bag.

64
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,063
-Give it to me. Go back.
-Okay.

65
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,441
Have a nice day!

66
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,151
Good luck, Mom!

67
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,011
Okay.

68
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,388
Shall we go then?

69
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,062
What's wrong?

70
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,064
That's right. The brake.

71
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,743
What is Ji-woong up to that he called out
someone studying for the CSAT?

72
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,162
He wanted to have a party.

73
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,039
What? He didn't mention a party to me.

74
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,374
Like a drinking party?

75
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,753
Hee-do. Is something wrong? You seem down.

76
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,589
Did you break 80 on the CSAT?

77
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,134
-Of course!
-Really?

78
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,012
That's so cool.

79
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,014
Is there anything you can't do?

80
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,059
You're such a great fencer.
Why are you so smart too?

81
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,188
At times, I miss the days

82
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,275
when you were mean to me.

83
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,528
Why are you bringing up the past again?

84
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,659
Hey.

85
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,624
Hey, hop on!

86
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,460
Did you pass your driving test?

87
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,920
You pulled it off.

88
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,172
I don't do things that are impossible.

89
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,758
That's Auntie's car.
Did you get her permission?

90
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,554
-What if she catches you?
-But you said to have a party.

91
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,389
A driving party.

92
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,766
Have you had a friend drive you around?

93
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,728
Get in. This is the day.

94
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,479
That sounds fun!

95
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,939
-Let's go.
-Will this be okay?

96
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,914
Is this car an automatic?

97
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,876
No. If you drive an automatic,
you can't say you're driving.

98
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,545
That's so cool.
My dad says the same thing.

99
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,383
Aren't we going way too slowly?

100
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,761
Your safety comes first and foremost.

101
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,061
How dare he honk at you?

102
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,605
-I'm fine.
-I'm not.

103
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,191
My gosh. That's it.

104
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,568
That was how she used to talk to me.

105
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
How?

106
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,073
"The fact that I don't know who you are
in this small fencing community

107
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,699
means you're nothing."

108
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,994
-Hee-do. I apologized with tears.
-Really?

109
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,164
That must have been hilarious.
I wish I had been there.

110
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,334
"Hee-do. I apologized with tears."

111
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,753
I didn't say it like that.

112
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,630
I'm utterly speechless.

113
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,632
-"I'm utterly speechless."
-Hey.

114
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,217
-"Hey."
-Guys.

115
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,635
-I did not--
-Guys.

116
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,264
I don't mean to kill the mood,
but I have a confession to make.

117
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,726
May I go back?

118
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm terrified.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm screwed.

120
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,338
-What should I do?
-Why? What's wrong?

121
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,049
This was where my mom was parked,

122
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,551
but someone else took the spot.

123
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,593
What?

124
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,721
Then she'll know you took the car
if you park somewhere else.

125
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,889
That's right.

126
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,435
Can't we ask them to move it?
Look for their number.

127
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,231
They didn't leave one.

128
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,150
When will your mom be home?

129
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,026
Around 1 a.m.

130
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,655
There's plenty of time,
so let's wait together until they leave.

131
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,574
Together?

132
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,660
Fine. I see what you,
his girlfriend, think.

133
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,663
What about you Hee-do, his friend?

134
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,375
Naturally, the same as you. Let's go.

135
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,795
Hee-do.

136
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,298
Hee-do!

137
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,216
Don't you remember?

138
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,470
Who went to save you that night
you were trapped in our hangout?

139
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,185
Darn it!

140
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,232
-C…
-Your turn.

141
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,320
Cop.

142
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,030
-Pool.
-Luck.

143
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,366
Kiss.

144
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,911
Switch.

145
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,579
-Hit.
-Tick.

146
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,331
K…

147
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,542
-Kiss.
-Do you want to do it?

148
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,379
No. Not many words start with K--

149
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,673
I'm sure she does
since she's never done it.

150
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,799
I have done it too.

151
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,844
You have?

152
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,347
With who? Yi-jin?

153
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,973
No!

154
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,569
-Let's let it slide.
-No, it wasn't.

155
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,322
We're not like that.

156
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,825
Maybe for me…

157
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,870
but not for him.

158
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,206
Hey, they're leaving.

159
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,000
Thank God.

160
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,586
-Yu-rim, buckle up.
-Okay.

161
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,090
You can make it there, right?

162
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,633
Naturally.

163
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,845
Point deducted.

164
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,099
Point deducted.

165
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,350
Hey!

166
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,351
Point deducted.

167
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,992
Moon Ji-woong. You have failed the test.

168
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,618
So…

169
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,873
they gave a license to someone like you.

170
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,749
What is this country coming to?

171
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,213
What do we do now?

172
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,008
There's nothing for us to do.

173
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,510
It's' all on Ji-woong.

174
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,973
What now? Your mom will find out for sure.

175
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,230
Yi-jin. He's a good driver.
Call him, Hee-do.

176
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,815
What?

177
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,402
We can't call him for something like this.

178
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,863
I'm sure he's busy.

179
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:10,034
It was him. She did it with Yi-jin.

180
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,119
I did not.

181
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,290
Damn it.

182
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,419
Fine, I'll call him. Happy?

183
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,340
I'll call…

184
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,223
Back Yi-jin speaking.

185
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,435
Hello? Yi-jin.

186
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,357
It's Hee-do.

187
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,735
Hey. What's up?

188
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,862
So…

189
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,576
I'm calling because Ji-woong can't park.

190
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,080
Can you come help?

191
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,125
Sorry but I'm going on air soon.

192
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,293
Okay.

193
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,880
Okay.

194
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,055
What did I tell you?

195
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,766
He can't come. He has to go on air.

196
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,978
So it wasn't with Yi-jin.

197
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,859
What do we do now?

198
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,946
-Individual training is more important.
-What I'm saying is…

199
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,322
Hey, guys.

200
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,826
Are you coming from training?

201
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,537
Yes. What are you doing here?

202
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,913
What else?

203
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,874
As you can see, I'm screwed.

204
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,334
Let's pick it up.

205
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,838
-Pick what up?
-The car.

206
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,010
Let's pick it up and move it.
There are plenty of people.

207
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,347
You want to pick up the car and park it?

208
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,683
-Yes.
-Have you ever seen that before?

209
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,436
No. And there must be a reason for that.

210
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,272
Hey. Let's at least try.

211
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,482
Do you have any other ideas?

212
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,611
Okay, let's try it. We're athletes.

213
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,946
Hey, band boys.

214
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,990
Get in.

215
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,703
Band boys.

216
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,955
File in!

217
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,588
Okay. Everyone, ready?

218
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,382
We can do it. We're Jungle Prince.

219
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,844
One! Two! Three!

220
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,057
We got it! Nice!

221
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,684
-Nice! We did it! Now put it down!
-We did it!

222
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,522
-We did it!
-Awesome!

223
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,777
-We pulled it off!
-We did it!

224
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,904
-That was awesome!
-Yes!

225
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,998
These are three colleges
that will give Hee-do a full scholarship.

226
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,750
You know this school.

227
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,669
Athletics is their focus,
so it'll be good for her future.

228
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,129
This school is prestigious.

229
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,633
This school has a good
academic program and good facilities.

230
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,177
Then I'll choose the prestigious school.

231
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,346
I knew it.

232
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,225
SHIN JAE-KYUNG

233
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,854
Sorry for making you come here.
I just couldn't find the time.

234
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,189
I'm used to it.

235
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,566
You only do things
that you have to apologize for.

236
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,654
I'm a fool for coming and going
whenever you beckon.

237
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,990
Bye.

238
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,539
Hey. Mr. Back.

239
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,834
I get to see you that I'm at the station.

240
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,962
How have you been?
What brings you to the station?

241
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,381
I had a meeting with a parent
to discuss college applications.

242
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,299
-I see.
-Wait.

243
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,344
Please ignore what you just heard.

244
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,764
Oh, I know that Jae-kyung is Hee-do's mom.

245
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,432
-You do?
-Yes.

246
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,726
You and Hee-do must be very close.

247
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,562
She said it was a secret.

248
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,565
Anyway, so…

249
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,610
Did Hee-do decide on a college?

250
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,112
Her suspension is over.

251
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,614
Will she be competing
in the upcoming tournament?

252
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,615
Did you two fight?

253
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,118
Why are you asking me?

254
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,538
No, we didn't.

255
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,626
Do you have a few minutes?

256
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,295
I have some intel.

257
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,755
Do you want an exclusive?

258
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,050
What information did you mean?

259
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:49,062
I'm returning as the coach
for the national team in March.

260
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,943
And?

261
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,447
What? So…

262
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,493
The legendary fencer Yang Chan-mi

263
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,038
will coach the national team again
after nine years.

264
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,875
Oh, I see.

265
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,876
Congratulations.

266
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,172
I guess that's not newsworthy anymore.

267
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,884
Time sure has flown.

268
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,554
No, not at all. You're still a legend.

269
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,349
There's no one in Korea
who can surpass you.

270
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,107
How old were you
when I won the gold medal?

271
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,692
How old are you now?

272
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,694
I'm 24 right now.

273
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,989
-What? You're 24?
-Yes.

274
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,784
I thought you just looked young,
but you're a baby.

275
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,330
How did you become a reporter at your age?
Didn't you serve in the military yet?

276
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,748
Well…

277
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,752
I received a compassionate discharge
due to the IMF crisis.

278
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,714
My goodness. You've had a tough life too.

279
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,011
What happened between you two?

280
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,848
Between you and Jae-kyung.

281
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,393
Why do you ask?

282
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,021
Did we not look like
a teacher and a parent?

283
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:18,610
Well, it was a little too informal
to be a teacher-parent meeting,

284
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:23,073
but you weren't friendly enough
to say you were friends.

285
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,950
You're quick.

286
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,213
We have quite a history.

287
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,010
I never would've won the gold medal
without all of your support.

288
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,637
Thank you, everyone.

289
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,391
-Thank you.
-Nice.

290
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,518
-You did great.
-Thank you.

291
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,234
Let's have some tteokbokki
since we're in Korea.

292
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,903
Right. Tteokbokki sounds good.

293
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,039
Oh no. I was too late. It's over.

294
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,210
What should I do now?

295
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,212
What do I tell the desk?

296
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,797
What do I do?

297
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,845
Are you a reporter with UBS?

298
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,311
Why are you crying?
I'll give you the interview.

299
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,404
A fencing star and a new reporter.

300
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,824
That was how we first met.

301
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,994
-Same age in the same era.
-Cheers!

302
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,413
We had different jobs,
but we had similar concerns.

303
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,581
Gosh, it's good.

304
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,291
Naturally, we became close.

305
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,505
Shin Jae-kyung speaking.

306
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,799
They changed our return date.

307
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,550
You're the only one I'm telling.

308
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,848
My gosh, Ms. Shin.

309
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,768
How did you know
we changed our return date?

310
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,020
You're so well-informed.

311
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,983
Are you going to have an exclusive today?

312
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,153
We became the best of friends,

313
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,948
and I wanted to be good to her
since I liked her.

314
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,865
THE 65TH NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL

315
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,743
You finished the final match
of your career. How do you feel?

316
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,411
They were happy days.

317
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,041
It was tough, but it was all worth it.

318
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,212
What a load off my back.

319
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,340
I don't have to train anymore!

320
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,973
She was there
in every glorious moment I had.

321
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,977
She was the reporter and a friend
who knew me the best.

322
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,439
But that was improper
for a reporter and an athlete.

323
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,988
Excuse me. You're Shin Jae-kyung,
a reporter with local news, right?

324
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,949
I am. How may I help you?

325
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,536
I have something to report

326
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,663
about Coach Yang Chan-mi.

327
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,335
Chan-mi.

328
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,505
The story about you
will be aired tomorrow.

329
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,091
But…

330
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,721
I won't apologize.

331
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,724
The coach of the national fencing team,

332
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,186
Yang Chan-mi, allegedly received
a bribe from a fencer's father

333
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,563
to get his daughter on the national team.

334
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,565
Shin Jae-kyung has the exclusive report.

335
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,734
This is the car

336
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,820
that Coach Yang Chan-mi bought
from athlete Kim's father.

337
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:56,286
Jae-kyung became the reporter
who did the most exclusives on me.

338
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,208
And she couldn't be my friend anymore.

339
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,133
That's what happens
to a reporter and an athlete.

340
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,094
Yes, it was partly my fault.

341
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,139
I said, "What a nice car."

342
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,808
Then he said he'd give me a good price
since he wanted to sell it.

343
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,853
I had known her for years
and was close to her parents.

344
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,313
I thought nothing of it.

345
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,817
But once his daughter didn't make
the national team, he reported me.

346
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:32,280
I only found out through the news
that it was a bribe.

347
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,200
I was too naive.

348
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,037
I didn't realize the position I held,
I was friends with a reporter,

349
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,790
and hung out and drank
with fencers' parents.

350
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,262
What are you going to do
if that happens to you?

351
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,934
And what if that involves Hee-do?

352
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,655
You'll be hurt and lose each other.
So apply elsewhere.

353
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,241
You don't think it'll happen, right?

354
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,701
It will.

355
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,088
And what if that involves Hee-do?

356
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,026
Why are you in the cold?

357
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,572
Don't tell me this kind of love is wrong.

358
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,245
When you said you loved me,

359
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,917
you said it had nothing to do with
how I felt about you.

360
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,212
Same here.

361
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,758
This is my love.

362
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,929
Don't tell me to stop.

363
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,100
Did you come to tell me that?

364
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,604
I came because I missed you.

365
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,411
I waited for an hour.

366
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,873
I'm cold. Buy me a hoppang.

367
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,147
Here.

368
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,612
That's too much.

369
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,782
You're supposed to give me half of yours.

370
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,328
Then we can both have
the vegetable and the red bean.

371
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,372
How are you so clueless?

372
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,749
Sorry.

373
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,716
But must you insult me
just because of that?

374
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,468
And I don't like vegetables.

375
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,179
I like red beans.

376
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,849
Hand it over.

377
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,574
Hold on to this.

378
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,883
You waited for an hour.

379
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,888
Here's the guy who worries about my toe.

380
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,514
Is that sarcasm?

381
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,268
It's me being anxious.

382
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,813
I'm afraid you won't even
do that much for me.

383
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,652
-Hee-do.
-I was just saying.

384
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,821
I felt like I had to say something.

385
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,618
You don't have to say anything.

386
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,078
Just stay there.

387
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,529
I wasn't trying to kiss you!

388
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,449
I was trying to remove that thread!

389
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,037
I was…

390
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,373
Hey, I was…

391
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,542
I'm leaving!

392
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,794
Hee-do!

393
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,587
Hee-do!

394
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,631
Hee-do!

395
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,341
Here's your change.

396
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,683
I feel humiliated.

397
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,852
How could he dodge like that?

398
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,354
You don't even avoid insects like that.

399
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,316
I can't stand Yi-jin.
I hate him. I loathe him!

400
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,610
I…

401
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,239
I like him.

402
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,702
Damn it. I like him!

403
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,120
I LIKE HIM!

404
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,501
Gosh, what do I do?

405
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,414
Hee-do.

406
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,126
You and I…

407
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,797
can't do that.

408
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,803
I'll end up disappointing you
one way or another.

409
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,057
But I…

410
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,187
keep wavering.

411
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,611
I want to waver.

412
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,045
ONGOING CALL

413
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,296
Yi-jin.

414
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,048
Hello?

415
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,637
So she did kiss Yi-jin.

416
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,140
This is so much fun.

417
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,560
This is nuts.

418
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,529
Shoot! Why did Ji-woong take that call?

419
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,697
What happened?

420
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,950
Wait. Should I be relieved?

421
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,994
Or not?

422
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,205
Damn it! Ji-wong…

423
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,001
Damn you, alcohol!

424
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,087
I'll never drink again, so help me God.

425
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,179
Jeez.

426
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,139
Hey.

427
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,809
Why are you…

428
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,437
I mean…

429
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,190
About last night…

430
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,235
-About that call--
-You called the wrong number.

431
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,112
So I relayed the message to Hee-do.

432
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,948
What?

433
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,325
Are you insane?

434
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,703
I guess I shouldn't do that.

435
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,747
Don't worry, I didn't.

436
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,751
Are you toying with me?

437
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,378
Because you make me waver too.

438
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,924
I want to waver.

439
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,636
Why you…

440
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,931
Auntie! I brought the containers!

441
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,019
Darn it.

442
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,281
What was that just now?

443
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,617
Are your feet glued to the floor?

444
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,078
Both of you were glued to the piste.

445
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,705
I'm sorry.

446
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,418
Hee-do. What are you thinking about
that you can't focus?

447
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,837
The competition is next week!

448
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,382
This won't cut it. You better shape up.

449
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,884
I'll do my best.

450
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,178
Doing your best is a given.

451
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,763
Don't just do your best.

452
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,349
You have to do well. Understand?

453
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,976
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,782
Gosh.

455
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,956
Why can't I focus?

456
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,210
Because of Yi-jin, no?

457
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,006
Seriously. Are you going to tease me too?

458
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,010
What's the problem? Tell me. I'm all ears.

459
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,972
I'm afraid of losing him.

460
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,684
I shouldn't have said how I felt.

461
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,438
It's a gamble to confess your feelings.

462
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,440
You either get it all or lose it all.

463
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,275
Even though we get it…

464
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,321
we'll end up losing it eventually.

465
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,656
Nothing lasts forever.

466
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,784
Right. Nothing lasts forever.

467
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,164
It'll probably hurt if you lose it all.

468
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,045
But what matters
is that you've had it at one point.

469
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,382
You're so mature at times. You know that?

470
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,178
You know nothing about relationships.

471
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,180
You're only good at fencing and studying.

472
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,599
Hey. I have a scar there too.

473
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,228
-Really? You really do.
-Yes.

474
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,897
I got this that day
when you saved me in the bathroom.

475
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,150
That's right.

476
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,486
-While we were fighting them, right?
-Yes.

477
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,156
Hey.

478
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,867
Let's use it for our own cheer.

479
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,577
Like how?

480
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,748
Good luck!

481
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,459
I like it. Let's try that again.

482
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,794
One, two, three.

483
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,170
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

484
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,757
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

485
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,642
DELICIOUS PIZZA

486
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,353
-Do you need something?
-Do you have some tape?

487
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,249
Gosh.

488
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,460
Dad.

489
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,342
I'm getting a regular salary now,
so don't spread yourself too thin.

490
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,971
Hey.

491
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,309
If you're going to act like
the head of the family in front of me,

492
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,393
go to sleep instead.

493
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,898
If you don't understand how I feel,
sing me a song instead.

494
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,319
The one Mom likes
at the beginning of Shin Seung-hun's song.

495
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,737
"Ich Liebe Dich"?

496
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,741
That sounds good to me.
Sing for us. It's been too long.

497
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,998
-Yes!
-If you insist.

498
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,675
I love you

499
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,429
As you love me

500
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,391
In the evening

501
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,770
And in the morning

502
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,398
There wasn’t any day

503
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,610
That you and me

504
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,697
That you and me didn't share

505
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,784
Our worries

506
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,785
Dad.

507
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,495
Yes?

508
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,913
I have a boyfriend.

509
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,707
What?

510
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,845
How are things?

511
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,639
Well…

512
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,352
I've become a total bum.

513
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,730
I drink every night.

514
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,277
That's not becoming a bum.
It's becoming a real reporter.

515
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,657
Is something wrong?

516
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,951
Or are they just growing pains?

517
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,912
Jung-hyuk.

518
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,040
How long must I stay in one department

519
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,211
before transferring to another one?

520
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,506
You need a good reason for transferring.

521
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,050
Otherwise,
you should stay at least a year.

522
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,512
Why? Is it too hard in Sports?

523
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,182
Yes.

524
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,352
The work or the people?

525
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,312
People.

526
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,065
People make it hard.

527
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,483
Like who?

528
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,069
Who in the Sports
is giving you a hard time?

529
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,452
"Don't be too far,
but don't get too close."

530
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,744
What does that mean?

531
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,084
Keep a distance…

532
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,088
but not too much.

533
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,549
A reporter and a subject?

534
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,218
Don't even think about it.

535
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,914
Why are you here again?

536
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,582
Yi-jin.

537
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,377
Who do you think about the most lately?

538
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,130
What do you want me to say?

539
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,674
Do you want to know
who I think about the most?

540
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,345
Not you.

541
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,555
It's me.

542
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,058
I think about myself the most.

543
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:05,105
Liking someone means
I can learn about myself.

544
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,608
Why am I here?

545
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,486
Right? Why am I here?

546
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,240
I must have no self-respect.
Pathetic, isn't it?

547
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,118
I didn't know I was like this.

548
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,581
I can't believe this is me.
I'm such a loser that it upsets me.

549
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,501
Can you understand why I'm like this?

550
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,962
Is it because you understand…

551
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,051
that you love me?

552
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,847
I don't understand you.

553
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,016
I simply accept you.

554
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,231
You're lucky, Hee-do.

555
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,733
You get to say everything you want.

556
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,445
You do it too.

557
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,198
I never stopped you.

558
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,915
Good luck tomorrow.

559
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:09,878
Bye.

560
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,172
Don't go.

561
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,862
-I'm drunk. I need to go.
-I took a gamble.

562
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,823
I'll either get it all or lose it all.

563
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,951
I'm doing this
knowing I may lose everything.

564
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,123
I'm scared that I'll actually lose you

565
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,751
but I've taken the gamble already

566
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,170
nonetheless.

567
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,757
So…

568
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,093
if you want to push me away, do it right.

569
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,557
Be prepared to lose it all
and set your boundaries.

570
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,936
I won't leave until then.

571
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,777
Then I'll leave.

572
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,550
BEFORE SUNSET

573
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,672
Hello, Officer Choi.
This is Back Yi-jin with UBS.

574
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,759
Yes. Well…

575
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,428
The thing is…

576
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,641
There's a suspicious man walking around.
Do you mind patrolling a little?

577
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,401
Darn it.

578
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,529
Why is love so damn hard?

579
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,835
PRESIDENTIAL CUP
NATIONAL FENCING COMPETITION

580
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,337
Why am I so nervous?

581
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,924
You're not nervous, you're excited.

582
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,968
It's been a while, hasn't it?

583
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,637
It has.

584
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,057
I feel like I can do well.

585
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,147
Attaque. Touche. Point.

586
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,282
KIM DA-MI, NA HEE-DO

587
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,511
Come here. Now.

588
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,556
What's your problem?
What was that just now?

589
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,435
-I lost.
-I lost.

590
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,229
Damn it.

591
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,523
That was the round of 32!

592
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,567
I'm so embarrassed.

593
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,194
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

594
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,288
I'll have to check
once I'm back at the studio.

595
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,792
Yes, I'm out
covering a fencing tournament.

596
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,377
Yes.

597
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,546
Okay.

598
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,507
I'll call you when I'm done here.

599
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,175
Na Hee-do isn't much.

600
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,764
What did you just say?

601
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,310
You went on TV and put on a show
just because you got lucky and won gold,

602
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,062
but you're not that good.

603
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,356
Am I wrong?

604
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,235
Ko Yu-rim must be so pissed off.

605
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,821
Some girl with no skills
stole her gold medal

606
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,115
and she even appeared on TV with her.

607
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,033
Stop riding her coattail.

608
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,160
You're a nobody.

609
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,872
Why that…

610
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,957
You're right.

611
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,042
What?

612
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,502
Nothing you said was wrong.

613
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,172
I lost to you too
so I have nothing to say.

614
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,634
Stop acting all cool.

615
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,012
I'm not.

616
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:15,225
Earlier during the tournament,
I felt like you were reading my moves.

617
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,978
-Were you?
-That's right.

618
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,355
Your feet were slow
and I could read your thoughts.

619
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,858
It was obvious that you were flustered.

620
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,570
I see.

621
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,866
Thanks for telling me.

622
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,951
But…

623
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,622
don't worry about Yu-rim.

624
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,373
She likes me.

625
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,418
And learn some social skills.

626
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,671
We're adults now, okay?

627
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,424
Good luck.

628
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,663
Yes! It's a new one!

629
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,432
Let's see.

630
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,900
So what happened was…

631
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,375
MATCH RECORDS

632
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,717
-Hee-do.
-Hi, Jun-ho!

633
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,345
-Hi, Hee-do.
-Hello.

634
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,680
We'll go in first.

635
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,682
Why did you lose?

636
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,559
-I got carried away.
-Who is that?

637
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,770
It's been too long since I've competed.
I must have lost my edge.

638
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,817
You should have gone
for something simple at the end.

639
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,360
That was too much.

640
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,070
I know that, okay?

641
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,448
I knew but I lost anyway.

642
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,367
So? Did you win?

643
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,202
Of course, I did.

644
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,912
Look how sweetly she talks to him.

645
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,373
That's right. You're 20 now, right?

646
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,708
Let's grab a drink after.

647
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,877
-A drink?
-A drink?

648
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,879
Sounds good. I'm down.

649
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,840
-Call me when you finish. See you.
-Okay.

650
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,095
Jun-ho! Wait for me. I have to go too.

651
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,190
Gosh.

652
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,611
She's too into him
that she forgot her gloves.

653
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,450
"Wait for me." Whatever.

654
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,473
Drinking excessively with boys
is bad for your health.

655
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,068
Darn it.

656
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,258
-What is it?
-You wrote this, didn't you?

657
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:20,595
"Drinking excessively with boys
is bad for your health."

658
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,765
Are you being snarky
for talking to another guy?

659
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

660
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,521
Is that right? Then how'd you know
it was me who called?

661
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,401
-What?
-You answered the phone, "What is it?"

662
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,778
You're watching me, aren't you?

663
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,071
Where are you?

664
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,701
I don't understand a single thing
that you're saying.

665
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,871
Good luck with the team match. Bye.

666
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,251
What the…

667
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,629
Is he jealous?

668
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,425
Why would he get jealous?

669
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,927
He's so annoying.

670
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,184
But why is he so adorable?

671
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,106
I'm so annoyed!

672
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,487
Testing.

673
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,658
The finals of the team match
will now begin.

674
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,085
Stay alert. You have to win, okay?

675
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,086
-Yes, coach!
-Yes, coach!

676
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,087
Let's do this.

677
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,423
This is the finals.

678
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,677
And this is the last time the four of us
compete together as a team.

679
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,805
For Hee-do and me, it's the last
team competition at Tae Yang.

680
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,599
I was happy fencing with you all.

681
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,101
-Me too.
-Me too.

682
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,061
Me too.

683
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:55,440
Okay. Let's make the last one fun
and be happy doing it. Okay?

684
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,358
-Okay!
-Okay!

685
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,026
Two, three.

686
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:01,279
-Let's go Tae Yang High!
-Let's go Tae Yang High!

687
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,698
-Let's do this!
-Let's go!

688
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,202
-Let's go!
-Allez.

689
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,536
ROUND 1, KO YU-RIM

690
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,580
Allez.

691
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,000
Nice!

692
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,335
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

693
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,544
Allez.

695
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,091

00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,969
-You did well.
-Allez.

00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,261
ROUND 3, NA HEE-DO

698
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,639
Attaque. Touche. Point.

699
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,475
You did well.

700
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,268
Allez.

701
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,353
ROUND 4, KO YU-RIM

702
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,063
Nice!

703
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,484
-You did great!
-It's okay. Let's go!

704
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,861
-Look carefully and focus a little more!
-En garde. Prêtes?

705
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,780
-You can do it!
-Let's do it!

706
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,781
Allez.

707
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,033
-Nice.
-You did great.

708
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,828
-Let's do this!
-You can do it!

709
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,745
Allez.

710
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,080
ROUND 6, NA HEE-DO

711
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,750
-It's okay.
-Nice!

712
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,419
I should have gone right.

713
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,336
ROUND 7, PARK HAN-SOL

714
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,549
-Well done.
-It's my turn.

715
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,968
Prêtes? Allez.

00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:10,056
ROUND 8, KO YU-RIM

717
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,892
Attaque. Touche. Point.

718
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,686
You were great!

719
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,859
-Okay. Keep it up!
-You can do it!

720
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,485
It's okay!

721
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,863
-You were amazing, Yu-rim!
-You were great!

722
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,072
You're awesome!

723
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,580
Invincible Tae Yang!

724
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,373
You can do it!

725
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,666
INVINCIBLE TAE YANG

726
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,712
-You can do it!
-We can do it!

727
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,630
Let's go, Hee-do!

728
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,217
-Let's do this!
-Let's win, Hee-do!

729
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,931
-Let's go, Hee-do!
-Let's win, Hee-do!

730
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,974
Let's go!

731
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,895
-Let's go!
-I don't fight for myself in team matches.

732
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,438
You can do it!

733
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,273
I fight for us.

734
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,276
Us.

735
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,779
"Us," the people I love.

736
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,742
As valuable as we are…

737
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,120
I can become stronger.

738
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,089
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

739
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,341
ROUND 9, NA HEE-DO

740
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,264
Allez.

741
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,351
Allez.

742
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,146
-Nice, Hee-do!
-Yes, Hee-do!

743
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,275
-Yes, Hee-do!
-Let's go!

744
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,319
-You can do this!
-Yes!

745
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,446
INVINCIBLE TAE YANG

746
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,285
Let's do this!

747
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,453
En garde.

748
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,831
Prêtes?

749
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,749
Allez.

750
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,699
The result was brilliant,
and the process was beautiful.

751
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,409
It was the last team match

752
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,162
in which Ko Yu-rim and Na Hee-do
competed as teammates.

753
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,581
The two athletes,
who brought their team to victory,

754
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,709
will join different teams
and compete against each other.

755
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,461
With UBS, I'm Back Yi-jin.

756
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,215
Gosh.

757
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,343
-Gosh.
-What is it?

758
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,346
Want some fruit? Cookies? Pastries?

759
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,182
-Should I get tteokbokki?
-Get out.

760
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,727
Why do you keep telling me to leave
when I said I'd be your servant?

761
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,857
Let me tell you again.

762
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,193
Me dropping out
had nothing to do with you.

763
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,779
The sorrier you feel,
the more of a nuisance you are.

764
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,573
Please leave unless
you want me to take the CSAT again.

765
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,869
Fine, I'll leave. Happy now?

766
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,413
Do you have a place to go?

767
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,250
I'm meeting Yu-rim at night.

768
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,544
How cute.

769
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,296
Did you even hold her hands yet?

770
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,007
I will today.

771
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,096
You haven't yet? Is there a problem?

772
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,348
I'm nervous just picturing it.

773
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,226
I'll be fine, right?

774
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,354
Do you have a plan?

775
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,147
I came up with one…

776
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,442
and I think I can pull it off.

777
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,154
The seasons
and the weather are helping me.

778
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,658
It's cold out.
Our hands will get very cold. Right?

779
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,454
You can do it, Ji-woong.

780
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,831
Ji-woong!

781
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,006
Yu-rim.

782
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,800
How did it go today?

783
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,552
We won the gold in the team match.

784
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,054
-You did? Congratulations.
-Yes. Thank you.

785
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,643
-How about the individual match?
-I did really bad.

786
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,187
It's freezing, isn't it?

787
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,441
Ta-da. I brought these for you
in case your hands get cold.

788
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,943
I see.

789
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,447
Thanks, Yu-rim.

790
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,199
You're the only one who cares.

791
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,243
Exactly. Try them on.

792
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,494
Okay.

793
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,251
It must be so cold for her

794
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,137
-Ma'am. Your hands must be cold.
-Yes?

795
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,764
Put these on.

796
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,766
I have my own.

797
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,061
See?

798
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,314
You have even nicer gloves.

799
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,482
Thanks.

800
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,901
-I hope you sell a lot.
-Thanks.

801
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,611
Goodbye.

802
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,746
I realize more and more
just how kind you are.

803
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,789
Really?

804
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,291
It's cold. Put the gloves on.

805
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,627
Right. The gloves.

806
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,632
-There.
-Let's go.

807
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,183
-Here.
-Hold on.

808
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,937
Darn it. You should have put it here.

809
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,023
You're right.
I should have taken your advice.

810
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,738
-Do you want to play something else?
-Sure.

811
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,075
Ji-woong, your gloves.

812
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,620
Oh, that's right.

813
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,497
Thanks.

814
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,420
If you move into the training center,
you'll only get to leave on weekends?

815
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,296
Yes.

816
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,549
It must feel so suffocating.

817
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,593
Can't you just commute from home?

818
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,972
Well, there is a way we can commute.

819
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,057
-What is it?
-Getting married.

820
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,268
I meant something I--

821
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:13,438
Ji-woong. Did you leave the gloves
at the arcade again?

822
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,314
What?

823
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,776
I left them again.

824
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,445
By the claw machine.

825
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,573
We came too far to turn back.

826
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,700
Your hands must be freezing.

827
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:26,993
Let's share these.

828
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,829
-I'm fine.
-It's cold. Put it on.

829
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,214
The string…

830
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:45,219
Right. You're right.
The string looked a lot longer before.

831
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,679
My shoulders are too broad.

832
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,507
Those fish-shaped pastries look good.
Aren't you hungry?

833
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,758
-Do you want some?
-Yes.

834
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,719
They don't have fish in them, right?

835
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,227
-Hello.
-Goodness, come in.

836
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,312
What would you like?

837
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,189
I'll take them all.

838
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,441
Okay.

839
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,488
Let's see. That will be 2,000 won.

840
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,217
-Here.
-Thank you.

841
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,469
There. Just a minute.

842
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,139
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

843
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,766
-Good night.
-You too.

844
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,729
-It's hot.
-Is it?

845
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,399
Smell them.

846
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,192
-They smell good.
-Right?

847
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,238
First, I'm very happy.

848
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,906
VOLUME

849
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,201
And it's a huge relief
that we have Hee-do on our team.

850
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,705
I was happy

851
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,999
to be on the same team as Yu-rim.

852
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,003
Thank you, Yu-rim.

853
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,799
The result was brilliant,
and the process was beautiful.

854
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,968
It was the last team match

855
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,846
in which Ko Yu-rim and Na Hee-do
competed as teammates.

856
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,307
The two athletes,
who brought their team to victory,

857
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,643
will join different teams
and compete against each other.

858
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,228
With UBS, I'm Back Yi-jin.

859
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,233
HEAD OF SPORTS, KIM HAK-GYU

860
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,778
"The result was brilliant,
and the process was beautiful."

861
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,073
Is that the news or poetry?

862
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,327
I wanted to try something different.

863
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,454
Different is good.

864
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:19,498
But the viewers can't relate to it.

865
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,960
It's not like they watched the match
and it wasn't an international event.

866
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:26,047
It's an unpopular sport
and only you watched the match.

867
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,508
Did you sign up for Sports
to publicize fencing?

868
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,136
Or did the federation pay you?

869
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,262
No, sir.

870
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,933
It's good to care,

871
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,643
but Yi-jin,

872
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,104
you're a reporter. Don't forget that.

873
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,524
Sir.

874
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,236
May I switch to another sport?

875
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,363
Another sport?

876
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,284
I failed to maintain
a proper distance as a reporter.

877
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,748
-I'm sorry. Any sport--
-If you failed, fix it.

878
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,584
Don't dump it on someone else.

879
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,923
I hope it's a minor mistake
that can be fixed,

880
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,800
Yi-jin.

881
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,756
"The result was brilliant…

882
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,469
and the process was beautiful."

883
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,780
Thank you

884
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,909
for expressing our final match
so beautifully.

885
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,250
I was…

886
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,549
chewed out by the head of sports
for that sentence.

887
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,138
Why?

888
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,519
Because a reporter can't speak
with emotions like that.

889
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:32,817
I don't regret…

890
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,155
meeting you or loving you.

891
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,118
Letting myself waver…

892
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,579
Wanting to waver…

893
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,791
was my failure.

894
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,839
A failure that's clearly not minor.

895
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:00,970
Hee-do.

896
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,186
Let's put a distance between us.

897
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:13,190
We were capable of anything.

898
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,320
So let's try this as well.

899
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,578
If I hadn't kissed you…

900
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,543
would this not have happened?

901
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,427
I'll stop this kind of love.

902
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,638
I'll stop if you tell me to.

903
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,557
I just…

904
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,980
wanted to be in the snow with you today.

905
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,236
Because I don't think
we had done that before.

906
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:11,916
Bye.

907
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,515
I'm crying, Yi-jin.

908
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,773
I don't care about anything else.

909
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:40,653
Be it a rainbow, this kind of love,
or that kind of love…

910
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,742
I can't lose it.

911
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,954
I just can't.

912
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,333
So, please

913
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,379
don't take a single step away from me!

914
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,497
You drive me crazy.

915
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,128
Fine.

916
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,510
Let's try this kind of love, Hee-do.

917
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,769
I'm going to do everything…

918
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,230
I can with you.

919
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,445
So prepare yourself.

920
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,612
Hold on.

921
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,614
What do we have here?

922
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,159
Horse number one!

923
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,079
-Drumroll!
-Drumroll!

924
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,795
I'll kill you if you make Hee-do cry.

925
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,422
You taught me

926
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,591
that you could gain things
by fighting and protesting.

927
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,301
You're really cool, Yu-rim.

928
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:53,929
Yi-jin!

929
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,682
I've become a reporter,
not knowing what I'm getting myself into.

930
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:00,269
I need to give you a warning
as your girlfriend.

931
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:12,072
