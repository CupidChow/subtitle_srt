EPISODE 1

2
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,153
Please check your temperature
and sanitize your hands.

3
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,238
Scan your QR code.

4
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,450
You may call to check in as well.

5
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,411
Please check your temperature
and sanitize your hands.

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,165
Parents aren't allowed in
due to COVID-19 protocols…

7
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,752
Gosh. Aren't you Na Hee-do?

8
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,087
I am. Hello.

9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,964
Oh my gosh. Hello.
It's so nice to meet you.

10
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,508
This way.

11
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,845
Go in. I'll watch it
in the car on my phone.

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,390
Just show them how much you love ballet.

13
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,100
Don't think about doing well.

14
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,853
How can I not think about that?
I'm here to win.

15
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,730
Winning doesn't matter.

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,733
That's unconvincing coming from you.

17
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,247
THE 43RD MYUNGIN DANCE CONTEST

18
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,404
Next is contestant number 11.

19
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,823
Kim Min-chae
from Myeong Gyeong Middle School.

20
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,907
Good luck.

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,333
Kim Min-chae.

22
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,294
You can go in.

23
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,965
Min-chae? You can go in now.

24
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,559
Contestant number 11,
Kim Min-chae, is a no-show.

25
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,977
Next, contestant number 12.

26
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,854
Min-chae.

27
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,358
Min-chae.

28
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,863
I'm going to take the ballet school van.
You can leave first.

29
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,656
Did you just give up?

30
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,367
How could you give up without even trying?

31
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,578
I've already lost.

32
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,455
You saw Choi Yun-seo.

33
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,123
I can't win anyway.

34
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,126
So what if you don't win?
What happens if you don't?

35
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,836
Is it meaningless if you don't win?

36
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,754
It is.

37
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,467
I'm going to quit ballet.

38
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,523
BALLERINA KIM MIN-CHAE

39
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,862
I ran away from home, Grandma.

40
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,656
I'll just be here for the summer.

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,581
I ran away only to end up in Mom's room.

42
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,172
FENCING CHAMPIONSHIPS
MEDAL

43
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,303
I heard you said you were quitting ballet.

44
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,430
Do you want to do something else?

45
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,059
Do people always have something
they want to do?

46
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,312
Weren't you doing ballet
because you wanted to?

47
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,356
You did it for five years already.

48
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,442
I don't know anymore.

49
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,322
I need to do something
to look like I'm doing something.

50
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,578
Not something you have to do.
What's your dream?

51
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,541
Adults never accept it

52
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,710
if we say we don't have a dream.

53
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,838
Do we need to have one?

54
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,173
People only talk about getting a job.

55
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,223
You're right.

56
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,059
These are the times you're living in.

57
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,742
How do I use this?

58
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,786
It doesn't fit.

59
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,998
"Practice video"?

60
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,545
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION
FOREIGN FENCERS COMPILATION

61
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,217
TO HEE-DO, WITH LOVE

62
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,721
What's this?

63
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,724
Is it Mom's diary?

64
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,814
THIS YEAR'S GOALS:
NATIONALS, MEDAL, TRAIN HARD, SAVE UP

65
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,196
She wrote all of this by hand?

66
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,282
This seems like punishment.

67
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,793
I GO EVERY SATURDAY TO SEE THAT KID

68
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,795
"That kid"?

69
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,797
Mom's ex-boyfriend?

70
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,174
Awesome.

71
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,971
I GO EVERY SATURDAY TO SEE THAT KID

72
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,558
I go every Saturday to see that kid.

73
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,855
That's why I wake up early on Saturdays,
and I become impatient.

74
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,359
Bye!

75
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,117
JULY, 1998

76
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,914
-It's soft tofu stew today, right?
-Isn't it kimchi stew?

77
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,041
-It's soft tofu stew.
-Yes.

78
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,418
It's kimchi stew.

79
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,046
What is she doing here?

80
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,757
-Isn't she on the fencing team?
-Why did she come to class?

81
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,509
Doesn't she come only for exams?

82
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,304
I have to meet
my minimum class attendance.

83
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,973
Just ask me directly.

84
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,058
What use is it
to speculate among yourselves?

85
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,102
First period is English.

86
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,479
It is? Study hard.

87
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,899
If the teacher tells you to wake me,
say I'm on the fencing team.

88
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,317
I need my rest.

89
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,694
Okay. Got it.

90
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,951
I'm in a really good mood today.

91
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,203
Help me sleep well, okay?

92
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,746
Why are you in a good mood?

93
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,207
Because it's Saturday.

94
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,504
Saturday.

95
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,882
The only day of the week
when I can see that kid.

96
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,846
SEON JUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

97
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,556
Be careful.

98
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,226
SEON JUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

99
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,612
MYEONGJIN BOOK RENTALS
VIDEOS, DVD, COMIC BOOKS, BOOKS

100
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,741
Full House volume 11
comes out on Wednesday, right?

101
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,825
Save a copy of me.

102
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,622
The thing I look forward to
after Saturdays is Full House.

103
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,584
BOREUM BANK HAS BEEN MERGED WITH HANA BANK
AS OF JULY 4, 1998

104
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,007
Darn it.

105
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,678
The world is a mess right now
because of stupid IMF.

106
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,890
Chungmuro is dying!

107
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,768
We must fight tooth and nail

108
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,312
to protect the Korean film industry,

109
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,398
which will be crucial to our future.

110
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,985
Our movies must be protected.

111
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,281
Korean movies are nowhere near
as competitive

112
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,991
as American movies.

113
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,701
Show interest in Korean movies.

114
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,372
We must support creative Korean movies

115
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,874
and the Korean film industry!

116
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,253
Chungmuro is dying!

117
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,547
-Chungmuro is dying!
-Chungmuro is dying!

118
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,511
THE GOVERNMENT IS KILLING KOREAN FILMS

119
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,567
People must be losing something.

120
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,532
But it has nothing to do with me.
It's adult stuff.

121
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,451
I'm just 18,

122
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,870
too young to lose anything.

123
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,127
The stuff I have can't be lost.

124
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,296
For example,

125
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,424
my dream and admiration.

126
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,802
-Save it!
-Save it!

127
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,974
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL

128
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,038
And her, my dream and admiration.

129
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,207
She is gifted.

130
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,253
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH

131
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,923
1 YEAR AGO

132
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,556
Ko Yu-rim wins!

133
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,893
Ko Yu-rim wins a gold medal for Korea!

134
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,020
How amazing.

135
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,440
This young athlete is making history
in the fencing world.

136
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,651
She's only 17
and it was her first time here,

137
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,486
-but she wasn't timid.
-She's so cool.

138
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,154
She is incredible and…

139
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,242
My dream is to become her rival.

140
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,644
But of course, in reality,
we live in different worlds.

141
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,692
I get moody on my way back.

142
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,530
The truth is,

143
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,783
I want to shine brightly like she does.

144
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,994
But then it happened.

145
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,540
IMF.

146
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,585
I thought it had nothing to do with me.

147
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,547
As the school's become
underfunded due to IMF,

148
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,799
we have decided to
close down the Fencing Club.

149
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,304
Why would we do that?

150
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,058
Even pro baseball
and basketball teams are being sold off.

151
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,520
What's the big deal
about losing a high school fencing team?

152
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,606
What about us?

153
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,483
All the schools are cutting back

154
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,778
and are getting rid of teams
that aren't successful.

155
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,280
No one will take you kids.

156
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,449
To be blunt…

157
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,745
it's not like you're Ko Yu-rim. Gosh.

158
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,419
Is Ko Yu-rim's school
not getting rid of their team?

159
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,379
Why would they when they have her?

160
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,214
Idiot.

161
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,801
Fencing is very expensive.

162
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,721
I'm sure your families are struggling
right now.

163
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,556
Find something else.

164
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,310
Go back to your classes
starting tomorrow. Understood?

165
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,519
But sir.

166
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,816
You can't end it like this.

167
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,613
How could you crush our dreams like this?

168
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,699
SEON JUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

169
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,414
I didn't crush your dreams.

170
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,124
The times did.

171
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,760
The times.

172
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,639
Was it the times that crushed my dreams?

173
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,606
INJEOLMI: WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW?
WILL YOU GIVE UP?

174
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,360
No. I will never give up.

175
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,241
But I don't know what to do.

176
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,701
RYDER37: BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

177
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,833
INJEOLMI: IF YOUR WORLD IS GONE,
GO TO HER WORLD

178
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,088
RYDER37, INJEOLMI

179
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,715
GO TO HER WORLD

180
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,260
To her world?

181
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,840
Hey, kid.

182
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,425
Yes?

183
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,635
The paper is ten minutes late.

184
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,432
This is a problem for people
who start their day with the paper.

185
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,349
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,561
I couldn't take a dump
because the paper didn't come.

187
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,729
Since I'm new here,

188
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,898
I started an hour earlier
but I was still late.

189
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,984
-But these things happen.
-What?

190
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,862
It's my first time here
and my first time delivering papers.

191
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,114
-So what?
-Everyone has a first day.

192
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,200
Today was mine,
so it'll be just for today.

193
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,577
I won't be late anymore.

194
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,746
Here.

195
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,040
Have a nice day.

196
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,877
Have a nice day.

197
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,844
Why is he smiling?
Why is he smiling at me?

198

JULY 7, 1998
9 O'CLOCK NEWS

199
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,726
PLAY

200
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,312
Under the current law, the principal
and interest is guaranteed

201
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,022
only until the business suspension date.

202
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,734
The Ministry of Finance and Economy
is now aware of the situation,

203
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,779
but the remaining issue
is not expected to be resolved easily

204
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,114
since the new law
should be applied retroactively

205
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,867
even if the deposit protection act
is revised.

206
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,037
Next on the news.

207
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,165
Everyone must remember
the gold-collecting campaign

208
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,001
to overcome the foreign exchange crisis

209
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,003
that everyone participated in.

210
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,006
As a fellow Korean, I also participated.

211
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,135
The weight of gold collected
over three months was 225 tons.

212
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,264
Monetized, it is over 2.2 billion dollars.

213
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,618
The moral laxity of this case
was strongly criticized.

214
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,912
With UBS News,
this is Kim Dong-yun reporting.

215
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,792
Pak Se-ri has won the US Women's Open.

216
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,754
It was a breath of fresh air to the people
drained from the economic crisis.

217
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,131
Kim Yeon-ju reports.

218
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,135
You know,
she's only four years older than you.

219
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,929
After a six-hour nail-biter,

220
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,640
the US Women's Open ended
with Pak Se-ri's victory.

221
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,810
Once it was over,
she cried in her father's arms…

222
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,021
Can you transfer me
to Tae Yang High School?

223
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,481
Tae Yang High School?

224
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,151
You mean Ko Yu-rim's school?

225
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,736
Yes.

226
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,239
My school got rid of our fencing team
because of that stupid IMF.

227
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,325
I want to transfer out.

228
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,537
That's good. Quit fencing.

229
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,168
312-23 AHYEON-DONG MAPO, SEOUL

230
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,054
Why should I quit fencing?

231
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,098
I've fenced all my life!

232
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,601
This is my everything!
How could you tell me to stop?

233
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,519
Why do you fence?

234
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,313
To prove you're not talented?

235
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,025
Don't cling onto something
you're not good at and study again.

236
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,652
I'm talented in fencing.

237
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,488
That was why I started.

238
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,824
I'm in a slump now, but I can get past it.

239
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,744
And I don't need anything else.

240
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,205
I just like to fence.

241
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,374
How can you like something
you don't do well in?

242
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,379
Cut the crap about transferring and study.

243
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,634
Whether or not I transfer,
I'll take care of it.

244
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,304
Just be your usual self
and stay out of it.

245
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,807
Don't pretend to care now.

246
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,183
Hee-do.

247
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,061
I won't take your nasty attitude anymore.

248
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,109
You sold the wedding ring.

249
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,112
For that stupid gold-collection campaign.

250
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,323
Don't get sentimental.

251
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,200
It's just a lump of gold.

252
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,376
It wasn't just a lump of gold.

253
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,837
It was Dad's.

254
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,423
Did you forget? I'm a public figure.

255
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,676
I have a duty to lead by example.

256
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,346
Fine.

257
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,641
Live as an anchor
who leads by example for society.

258
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,644
You don't do that for your family anyway.

SAMHAN NEWS

260
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,671
Hey!

261
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,384
Damn it.

262
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,265
You hurt the peeing boy.

263
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,351
Who got hurt again?

264
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,522
The peeing boy can't pee anymore.

265
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,274
Don't you see that? No newspapers.

266
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,234
We said we don't want newspapers.

267
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,778
Why did you ignore that
and turn him into a eunuch?

268
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,365
Damn it, don't you hear me?

269
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,285
Does everyone in this town yell
when they talk?

270
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,289
You're being rude,
so I assume I can be rude right back.

271
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,125
And it's an unstated rule
that you leave a paper

272
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,585
even if people say not to.

273
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,671
Now explain slowly. Who got hurt?

274
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,432
Do you mean that fake statue?

275
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,518
-The original one is in Brussels.
-That's a fake?

276
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,230
There's actually an original?

277
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,398
Anyway…

278
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,735
is it okay for the peeing boy
to be unable to pee if it's a fake?

279
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,904
Everyone has the right to pee!

280
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,698
You're asserting that a newspaper,
which is made of paper,

281
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,660
broke that statue, which is made of metal.

282
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,662
That's right. I saw it happen.

283
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,374
Let's use some common sense here.

284
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,127
If a newspaper could break that,
it means it was already cracked.

285
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,090
How much do you want?

286
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,341
I didn't ask for money.

287
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,511
Then what do you want from me?

288
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,637
I don't know!

289
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,349
I just wanted to vent because I was angry!

290
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,311
Get home safely.

291
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,867
I have a daughter in high school.
She's at the top of her class.

292
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,620
She studies until way past midnight.

293
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,831
So be quiet at night.

294
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,874
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,545
Why did your things arrive first
before you did?

296
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,172
Sorry. I had an interview
for a part-time job.

297
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,175
You found a job here already?

298
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,677
Before you finished moving?

299
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,847
Yes. Making money was more urgent.

300
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,685
You look like a slacker,

301
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,978
but you must work hard.

302
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,566
Are you in college or did you graduate?

303
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,362
I'm in college,

304
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,197
but I doubt I can go back.

305
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,825
Why not? Because of IMF?

306
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,369
Your family must have gone bankrupt.
Oh, no.

307
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,291
You looked like a rich brat,
so I almost said no to you.

308
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,046
Rich brats wouldn't live around here.

309
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,965
True.

310
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:54,706
YEAR 1994

311
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,338
Let's see…

312
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,436
You must work all the part-time jobs
in this neighborhood.

313
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,272
-Full House volume 11 came in, right?
-They're all out.

314
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,692
You didn't save one for me?

315
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,446
Didn't your boss tell you? I'm a VIP.

316
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,156
I've spent so much money here.

317
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,034
I don't have to wait my turn.

318
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,162
Is this your snot?

319
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,333
-What was that?
-My boss said

320
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,169
to check the books for damage
and any snot.

321
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,881
He said to charge for damaged books,
and this booger is huge.

322
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,174
It wasn't me!

323
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,344
Why would I put my snot
on a comic book at my age?

324
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,099
I guess you used to.

325
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,230
You owe our family, right?

326
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,649
How will you pay for it?

327
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,653
Will Full House volume 11 do?

328
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,907
It will.

329
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,285
Come back this time tomorrow.

330
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,667
I can't come at this time.
I'll come a little later.

331
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,918
But I will be here.

332
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,670
Save it for me.

333
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,223
I guess she's still fencing.

334
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,068
It's empty.

335
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,030
There's no training tonight.

336
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,954
Coach Yang Chan-mi.

337
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,585
Well, Coach Yang.

338
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,463
I'm here to see you today.

339
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,631
Today?

340
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,925
So…

341
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,638
I'm Na Hee-do
from Seon Jung's fencing team!

342
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,272
What brings you here?

343
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,943
Please take me in, Coach!

344
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,240
Our fencing team was scrapped
because of IMF.

345
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,743
But I don't want to quit fencing.

346
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,079
If you'll accept me,
I'll transfer to Tae Yang High School.

347
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,790
I bet you're not very good.

348
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,419
-Pardon?
-Look at you.

349
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,422
Hey. It takes skill to persuade someone.

350
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,425
Yet you're so clueless,
ignorant, and tacky.

351
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,177
I bet that's how you fence too.

352
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,143
-Yes.
-Why do you still fence if you know?

353
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,313
I'm familiar with it.

354
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,647
What?

355
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,817
Technique and good sense are important,

356
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,821
but familiarity can really help too.

357
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,826
Okay. I see.

358
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,164
Thanks for your wise words. Goodbye.

359
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,460
Coach.

360
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,797
I'll work very hard.

361
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,965
No. I'll do well.

362
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,301
I'll do well no matter what.

363
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,055
Please take me in.

364
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,016
What must I do?

365
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,726
I don't know.

366
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,271
Please test me!

367
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,649
Look at you. Why should I?

368
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,111
Please don't be like that
and give me a chance.

369
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,239
I'm willing to do anything.

370
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,414
I'm begging you, Coach.

371
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,793
Then transfer to Tae Yang High School.

372
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,887
No. I'm not telling you to transfer.

373
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,764
I have no reason to.

374
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,687
But you come if you can.

375
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,360
Okay.

376
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,821
I'll transfer.

377
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,160
You didn't tell me to, but I'll come!

378
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,206
Good night!

379
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,340
Yes. It's not like Mom ever helped me
with anything.

380
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,552
If she won't transfer me,

381
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,637
I'll get transferred.

382
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,264
Compulsory transfer.

383
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,850
That is my plan.

384
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,519
Assaulting a peer.

385
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,958
-Hey, you.
-Let's go.

386
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,502
No, they don't have any.

387
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,171
Some bad deeds can also be good.

388
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,422
Bye.

389
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,928
The cause and justification
for assaulting a peer.

390
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,015
Today, I will fight for justice
while simultaneously achieving my goal

391
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,477
of being forced to transfer.

392
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:17,273
Ko Yu-rim. I'm taking my first step
toward your world.

393
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,109
Ouch.

394
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,323
Did you just hit me?

395
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,742
What?

396
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,245
-Hey.
-What?

397
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,581
Seriously.

398
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,667
Aren't you a fencer?

399
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,086
So what?

400
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,133
Don't you realize
an athlete's body is her life?

401
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,678
Be careful!

402
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,639
Watch where you're going
so you don't get hurt.

403
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,684
Is your shoulder okay?

404
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,144
Yes.

405
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,272
Be careful.

406
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,859
You might compete internationally later on
and win medals and stuff.

407
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,197
But…

408
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,286
Hey.

409
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,539
I failed.

410
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,335
Those bitches from Nam Il High.

411
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,963
I'll crush them today.

412
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,924
We should have messed them up
when they provoked us at the club.

413
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,721
The others must be on their way.
They paged us to hurry. Let's go.

414
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,763
Let's go.

415
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,181
They're dead.

416
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,641
Let's kill them.

417
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,192
I was too naive.

418
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,696
I need a bigger assault

419
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,656
in order to be forced to transfer.

420
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,412
The assault I'll partake in

421
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,123
is gang assault.

422
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,000
A gang fight.

423
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,517
I'll get wrapped up in this fight
and be forced to transfer.

424
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,355
What do I need for that?
I need the cops to show up.

425
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,989
I'm at the empty lot
behind Samlim Apartments.

426
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,866
I think there will be a gang fight.

427
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,201
Please hurry.

428
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,373
Just wait, Ko Yu-rim

429
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,626
I'll go to your world for sure this time.

430
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,504
You must be scared

431
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,673
if you brought those losers with you.

432
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,428
Which one is yours?

433
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,058
Either way, I'm disappointed in you.

434
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,354
You bitch. Shut your mouth.

435
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,203
-Have you lost your freaking mind?
-Get off.

436
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,490
That little…

437
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,414
How dare you hit her?
Do you have a death wish?

438
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,005
What's your deal?

439
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,725
Damn it.

440
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,397
Stop it!

441
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,622
Why you…

442
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,491
What the…

443
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,631
Hey, you.

444
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,634
I need to be the assailant here.

445
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,721
Don't interfere with my plan
unless you really want to get stabbed.

446
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,518
-Let's go!
-Run!

447
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,025
-I instigated--
-Are you okay?

448
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,610
-Yes.
-Freeze!

449
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,869
I should have run

450
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,997
if I wanted to get caught.

451
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,209
Excuse me. Sir?

452
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,962
I fought too!

453
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,845
Why won't you arrest me?

454
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,683
I need to transfer schools!

455
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,437
Why won't you take me?

456
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,695
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH

457
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,763
Ko Yu-rim.

458
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,768
Why is it so hard for me to go to you?

459
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,821
What?

460
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,551
Damn it. It's raining hard.

461
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,592
What's that?

462
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,638
Use it! Don't get wet!

463
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,235
Who are you?

464
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,243
I'm just a fan!

465
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,708
Thanks for the umbrella!

466
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,649
Just wait.

467
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,235
I'll really go to your world.

468
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,369
Going ambiguously astray
isn't what I need right now.

469
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,329
It's something that's illegal.

470
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,833
Music, dancing, alcohol, and cigarettes
in the dark of night.

471
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,211
Mix that with a minor.

472
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,965
It's impossible
for something not to happen.

473
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,943
What a great country to go astray.

474
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,779
Why isn't there a single cop?

475
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,158
A minor is openly at a club--

476
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,534
Hello, miss.

477
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,744
What?

478
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,795
Go right in.

479
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,716
Okay, then. Enjoy yourselves.

480
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,915
What the hell? Aren't you in high school?

481
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,917
Look at her makeup. It's obvious.

482
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,086
Those are clearly her mom's clothes.
She's obviously in high school.

483
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,671
I'm not in high school.

484
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,590
Then sit down.

485
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,270
Hey. Be honest. How old are you?

486
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,730
Why does that matter?

487
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,441
She wants to learn
the ways of the world early.

488
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,443
What's wrong with teaching her?

489
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,737
I can drink this, right?

490
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,114
Look at her.

491
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,536
You should let the guy pour you the drink.

492
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,789
Drink up.

493
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,592
What's your problem?

494
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,763
Send her out. Don't kill the mood.

495
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,400
It's a waste of alcohol.

496
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,862
You've gotten cheap
ever since your family went bankrupt.

497
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,991
Don't nag. I'll pick up the tab.

498
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,910
I wouldn't make someone
who lost everything pay for the drinks.

499
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,165
Aren't you here to ask me for a favor?

500
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,709
When are you going to ask?

501
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,462
You can't, can you?

502
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,590
Because you can't swallow your pride.

503
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,633
You can't ask for money, can you?

504
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,177
-Hey--
-Shut up and drink.

505
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,564
Get up.

506
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,776
Go first. I have business here.

507
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,372
Where are you going? Sit down.

508
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,375
Give it a rest.
What's your problem, asshole?

509
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,212
It's my inferiority complex toward
a bankrupt conglomerate owner's son.

510
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,173
-Move it.
-Go by yourself.

511
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,299
She wants to stay.

512
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,594
Shit.

513
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,847
Damn it. I'm going to call the cops.

514
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,475
That there's an obvious minor at a club.

515
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,727
Please call the cops.

516
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,021
She wants me to.

517
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,939
What do you think?

518
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,861
I really have a plan, okay?

519
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,199
You know each other, don't you?

520
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,535
That's why you're doing this.

521
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,288
Decide.

522
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,666
Let me report her
and watch her get arrested

523
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,460
or we can all hang out here.

524
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,297
What will it be? Decide.

525
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,009
You can't step foot outside until you do.

526
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,804
Fine. Let's all leave together.

527
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,435
FIRE ALARM

528
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,773
What's going on?

529
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,900
Everyone, please exit!

530
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,318
Hurry!

531
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,446
-Evacuate them!
-Hurry up. This way.

532
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,159
Are you crazy?

533
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,331
Excuse me, you need to evacuate.

534
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,377
This asshole has changed
since he left home.

535
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,337
Who changed? Me?

536
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,506
Not you?

537
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,594
This is one good thing
about my family going bankrupt.

538
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,182
I get to see people at their worst.

539
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,311
You should have treated me this way
from the get-go.

540
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,398
I thought we were friends.

541
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,691
Let's go.

542
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,653
Watch your step.

543
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,614
Go this way. Hurry.

544
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,324
Watch your step.

545
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,492
Is there a fire?

546
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,790
Get home before the buses stop running.

547
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,958
Hey!

548
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,337
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

549
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,846
And what are you doing?

550
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,100
Read Full House at home.

551
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,394
Why are you pretending to be a delinquent?

552
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,147
Do you think I'm doing this
to pretend to be a delinquent?

553
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,817
This is a part of an important plan
for my life!

554
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,235
What plan?

555
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,071
What kind of a plan involves
a high schooler meeting guys

556
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,323
and drinking at a club?

557
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,952
Do you want to get arrested?

558
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,371
Yes, I do.

559
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,832
That was my plan.

560
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,752
I was supposed to get caught at a club.

561
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,838
They were supposed to call my school,
and the school…

562
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,259
was supposed to force me to transfer.

563
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,054
You planned this
in order to be forced to transfer schools?

564
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,389
Why? Is that wrong?

565
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,157
Do you know why the law protects minors?

566
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,576
Because your imaginations are limited.

567
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,955
What did you imagine would happen here?

568
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,791
Do you think things would've unfolded
the way you imagined?

569
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:16,917
Not a chance.

570
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,086
If you come to places like this,

571
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,255
things you don't need to experience,

572
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,090
shouldn't experience,

573
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,301
that you're better off
not experiencing happen.

574
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,138
Because when people do something bad,

575
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,682
the imagination of adults

576
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,184
and the imagination of minors
are worlds apart.

577
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,488
Then what should I have done?

578
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,827
I was stripped of my dream overnight.

579
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,831
The fencing team was scrapped.

580
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,668
I'm going crazy
because I want to keep fencing.

581
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,423
My mom tells me to quit fencing and study.

582
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,680
I'm talented in fencing.

583
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,724
That was why I started.

584
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,269
I'm in a slump now, but I can get past it.

585
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,230
And I don't need anything else.

586
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,691
I just like to fence.

587
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,989
The coach said

588
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,200
the one who crushed my dream

589
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,829
wasn't him

590
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,248
but the times.

591
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:44,296
What's so great about the times
that it can crush my dream?

592
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,551
The times

593
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,555
can easily take away your dream.

594
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,810
Not just your dream.
It can take away your money…

595
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,397
and even your family.

596
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,028
Sometimes, it takes all three at once.

597
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,036
I didn't ruin your plan today.

598
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,748
It failed because it was a bad plan.

599
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,834
Come up with a new plan.

600
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,093
Annoying prick.

601
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,267
I owe you something, right?

602
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,442
MYEONGJIN BOOK RENTALS

603
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,490
Now, we're even.

604
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,996
How old are you, anyway?

605
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,873
I'm 22.

606
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,585
That's rude.

607
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,256
I thought you were at most 20… sir.

608
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,176
I've been too rude to you until now.

609
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,803
Right, sir?

610
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,430
Then be respectful starting now.

611
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,098
That's not right.

612
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,183
We've gotten too close for that now.

613
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,983
Protecting your dream…

614
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,112
Though your plan was wrong,

615
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,033
you had the right idea.

616
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,666
I always think only about what I've lost.

617
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,588
But you think about what you can gain.

618
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,761
I want to try that too.

619
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,728
Did you really go bankrupt?

620
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,606
Yes. Completely bankrupt.

621
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,194
It's okay to go bankrupt
when you're young.

622
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,823
It's better than going bankrupt
when you're almost 60.

623
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,825
That's my dad.

624
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,744
What I mean is--

625
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,789
That's why
I can't ask my parents for help.

626
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,083
But I'm sure you have people
who can help you.

627
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,922
That's a special right
you only have at your age, so enjoy it.

628
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,382
It'd be a waste to blow it.

629
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,428
You're right.

630
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,688
Who's your favorite in Full House?

631
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,150
Ryder.

632
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,819
The male lead.

633
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,238
People always like rich people.

634
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,989
I like him because he's cute.

635
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,368
I'm going to go home
and enjoy his good looks.

636
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,703
Bye.

637
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,206
Wait.

638
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,256
What's your name?

639
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,972
I need to log it.

640
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,645
Hee-do.

641
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,772
Na Hee-do.

642
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,069
What about you then?

643
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,699
I'm just asking
since it's etiquette to ask back.

644
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,034
Back Yi-jin.

645
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,875
I'll cancel my request for no newspapers.

646
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,140
I had the guts to get into trouble,

647
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,392
but not the guts to talk to my mom.

648
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:14,566
My mom may be the biggest obstacle for me.

649
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,946
INJEOLMI: WHAT TOWN DO YOU LIVE IN?

650
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,782
INJEOLMI: NEVER MIND.
WE AGREED NOT TO ASK THINGS LIKE THAT.

651
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,875
I really want to know
about you at times too.

652
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,754
Where you live, what you look like,

653
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,131
and what you dream of.

654
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,680
INJEOLMI: IF WE LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER

655
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,100
INJEOLMI: WE WON'T BE THIS OPEN AND HONEST

656
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,646
That's true.

657
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,405
THAT'S TRUE

658
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,661
What is it?

659
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,374
Well…

660
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,796
I meant it when I said…

661
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,717
I wanted to transfer schools.

662
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,262
I don't want to quit fencing like this.

663
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,599
I know I'm not doing well
and am struggling,

664
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,019
but I'm trying very hard.

665
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,563
So…

666
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,150
please help me.

667
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,487
Are you sure you're trying?

668
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,720
Where did you go in this?

669
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,346
You used my makeup too.

670
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:13,018
Where did you go wearing this and makeup
that it reeks of alcohol and smoke?

671
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,859
A club.

672
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,286
Have you lost your mind?

673
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,080
That was how desperate I was.

674
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,043
I planned to get arrested
for being at a club

675
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,753
and be forced to transfer schools.

676
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,713
Do you expect me to believe that?

677
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,631
You call this trying hard?

678
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,601
Hee-do.

679
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:01,232
When you started fencing,
they said you were gifted.

680
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,236
You were above everyone else
when you started. But where are you now?

681
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,530
You're still stuck at being a prodigy.

682
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,617
While everyone else advanced,
you're still where you started!

683
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,662
-It's frustrating and killing me too!
-You should've worked your ass off!

684
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,957
You go to clubs

685
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,584
and read stupid comic books.

686
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,087
How dare you whine about fencing
and transferring?

687
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,098
Who are you to rip up Full House?

688
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,602
Do you think you're any better
than that comic book?

689
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,773
You never once came to watch me compete.

690
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:46,236
Whenever I came home alone
upset after losing a match,

691
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,071
you weren't the one who comforted me.

692
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,616
It was that comic book.

693
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,994
So what right do you have to rip that up?
What gives you the right?

694
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,547
You have no idea how hard it was for me
to muster up the courage to talk to you.

695
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,759
It required much more courage
for me to talk to you

696
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,180
than to go to the club
to get forced to transfer.

697
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,935
That's who you are to me.

698
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,771
You're someone I don't want to talk to…

699
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,319
ever since Dad passed away.

700
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,527
Damn it.

701
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,963
It's me, Shin Jae-kyung.

702
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,800
It's been a while.

703
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,355
Damn it.

704
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,607
How can I fix this?

705
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,570
I should have fought her
after I got my allowance.

706
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,405
I can't afford to pay for this.

707
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,757
This is Myeongjin Book Rentals.

00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,844

710
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,645
Gosh, what do I do?

711
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,066
I remember the storyline.

712
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,402
I remember all the lines.

713
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,531
What do I do?

01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,519
Damn it. The door.

717
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,189
Hey. Hold onto it.

718
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,532
You're a little late.

719
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,371
Good night.

720
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,498
What's wrong with her?

721
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,753
What the hell?

722
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,049
Hey, Hee-do!

723
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,061
What is this?

724
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,902
Why are you crying?

725
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,240
Why are you crying?

726
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,746
Hey.

727
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:59,716
My mom ripped up Full House.

728
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,384
What? Your mom did what?

729
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:06,472
I'm so upset,
but I don't have the money to pay for it.

730
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,183
But you paged me and said

731
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,768
-to return it.
-Speak clearly.

732
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:14,897
So I drew it in myself
and tried to secretly return it.

733
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,442
But you caught me.

734
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,528
This is so humiliating!

735
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:26,951
What…

736
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,800
WHY CAN'T I "LIEK" YOU?

737
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:43,760
Gosh…

738
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,386
"Why can't I

739
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,847
liek…"

740
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,372
Hello, Coach Yang.
I've been waiting for you.

741
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,582
It's been a while.

742
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,585
I'm sorry.

743
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,880
I tried my best to transfer here,

744
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,007
but all of my plans failed.

745
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,596
That is why I've come
to show you my fencing skills.

746
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,724
Please watch and decide
whether or not you want to train me.

747
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,192
I've brought my own sword.

748
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,261
First test, pass.

749
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,847
Come with me.

750
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,150
Do you have money?

751
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,697
Well…

752
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,242
Do you still take bribes?

753
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,829
I'm asking if you have money.

754
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,753
-I have 600 won.
-Okay, 600 won.

755
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,422
Give me that.

756
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,426
Now, one, two, three, four.

757
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:49,719
Give me 300 won.

758
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,348
So you put 300 won, and I put 300 won too.

759
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,812
It's 50-50 whether or not I train you.

760
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,106
It's better odds than you imagined, right?

761
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,652
Second test. Begin.

762
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,537
I see. The second test is odds or evens.

763
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,788
Guess.

764
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,833
Even.

765
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,961
Odd.

766
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,214
Wait. I still have 300 won left.

767
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,674
Give me one more chance.

768
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,145
Odd or even?

769
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,109
Odd.

770
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,780
Even!

771
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,325
-What?
-Second test, fail.

772
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,160
What? Wait.

773
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,370
Hold on!

774
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,220
Give me one last chance.

775
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,017
I'm begging you. Please.

776
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,648
Come on.

777
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,109
Come on.

778
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,989
Come on.

779
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,535
Go on.

780
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,331
Even!

781
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,835
Let's see.

782
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,428
Odd.

783
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,644
Coach!

784
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:07,690
This has nothing to do with fencing!

785
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,151
Why not?

786
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:14,321
Do you think athletes succeed
just by being good at their sport?

787
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,326
Everyone's skill level is similar.

788
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,330
Competitions are about luck and vigor.

789
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,084
Look at you.

790
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,253
You have no luck at all.

791
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:35,259
But then again, I'm lucky.

792
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,929
The coach's luck is what matters.

793
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,314
Second test, pass.

794
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,691
Start attending Tae Yang High next week.

795
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,236
Do you mean it?

796
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,781
But leave these here
since a game is a game.

797
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,785
Yes! Of course!

798
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,707
Thank you!

799
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,168
Thank you so much!

800
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,586
Thank you!

801
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,423
Bye.

802
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,217
Thank you!

803
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,072
I guess they don't talk to each other.

804
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:46,122
I'm so humbled to see someone
so impressive.

805
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,084
Have you been well?

806
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,044
I guess I should be.

807
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:55,881
Who knew you'd come to me as a parent?

808
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,676
-As I told you, my daughter fences--
-I know.

809
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:02,429
She got on her knees before me
and asked me to take her in.

810
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,350
-That's why you're here, right?
-Yes.

811
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,064
How did you know she was my daughter?

812
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,567
I saw her at your husband's funeral.

813
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:16,986
Were you

814
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,405
there that day?

815
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,533
Yes. But you weren't.

816
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,788
Have her start next week.

817
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,292
Thanks.

818
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,295
No need. I'm not doing it for you.

819
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,131
It's because I'm drawn to her.

820
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,307
I guess

821
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,019
you can ask me for favors
but you can't apologize to me.

822
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,734
You thought I'd understand, didn't you?

823
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,072
Answer me.

824
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,950
You can't be nasty to me anymore

825
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,286
now that you're entrusting
your daughter with me?

826
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,205
I never meant to be nasty.

827
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,210
I wanted to be understood though.

828
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,500
-Were you mugged?
-Yes.

829
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,168
Why do you bother doing sports?

830
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,878
To be mugged without being hit.

831
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,589
Get in. Let's go somewhere.

832
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:01,757
No.

833
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,134
Then I'll pick the size
for your school uniform.

834
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,433
What uniform?

835
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,769
You need Tae Yang High School's uniform.

836
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,649
You can't go looking like that anyway.

837
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,864
I'll go!

838
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,033
Wait for me!

839
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,170
Ko Yu-rim.

840
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:44,133
I'm finally entering your world today.

841
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:47,594
Just wait.

842
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:55,936
Yi-jin!

843
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,817
Back Yi-jin!

844
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,116
I'm finally going to a new school today!

845
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,826
And it's Tae Yang High School!

846
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,454
I can keep fencing!

847
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:15,581
I enjoyed the special right

848
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,834
I only get at my age thanks to you!
Thank you!

849
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,547
Hey, are you still there?

850
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:25,799
Didn't you hear me?

851
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,470
That's okay.

852
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,972
I can forgive anyone for anything today.

853
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,894
Because I'm so very happy right now!

854
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,133
Congratulations.

855
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:01,061
I've finally made it
to your world, Ko Yu-rim.

856
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:04,148
How do you know Yu-rim?

857
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,315
Are you two dating?

858
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,902
Looking at you reminds me of myself.

859
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:09,987
You're like me at 18.

860
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:13,282
Looking at this makes me happy.

861
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:17,035
Oh, so you're the pretty boy
from class seven.

862
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,997
You said you'll never be happy again.

863
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,331
I'm against that.

864
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,126
The first to reach 15 points wins.

865
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,795
Prêtes? Allez.

866
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,130
I like the fact

867
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,923
you're so reckless.

868
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:40,976
