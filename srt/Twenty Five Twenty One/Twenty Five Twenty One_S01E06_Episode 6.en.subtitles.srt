00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,860
This is DJ Wanseung's pirate radio show.

00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,819
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,865
We'll start today's show with a story
from Baekho, seeking advice.

4
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,785
Hello, Wanseung.

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,912
I fought with my brother yesterday.

6
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
-Wait!
-Because of the way I behaved…

7
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,167
-It's my story.
-…he is very disappointed in me.

8
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:29,005
But instead, I got mad at him
and said mean things to him.

9
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,884
I think I hurt his feelings.
What should I do?

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,720
Wanseung read my story.

11
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,973
Do you even need to ask? Just apologize.

12
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,811
Baekho, practice makes perfect
even when it comes to apologizing.

13
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,232
I doubt you would want to become
an immature person who can't apologize.

14
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,817
Am I right?

15
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,777
Right.

16
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,947
INTERNET CAFE

17
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,992
Yi-jin. Isn't this a place
for playing computer games?

18
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,453
Why did you want to come here with me?

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,497
Sit down here for a minute.

20
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,751
Just a moment.

21
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,007
Honey, have you been doing well?

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,346
How could I be doing well

23
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,808
when I know you're not.

24
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,187
I want to see you…

25
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,816
and hold you.

26
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,613
My heart is aching from
how much I'm missing you, Honey.

27
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,824
CHAT WITH BACK SEONG-HAK

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,126
Tell me about it.

29
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,670
It's raining outside,

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,548
but my heart feels dry like a desert.

31
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:58,011
Even if I end up dying from the heat,
walking across that desert,

32
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,639
I will be with you, my darling.

33
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,144
Gosh.

34
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
I've never written anything like this.

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,445
Even if I end up dying
crossing that desert,

36
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,157
I want to be with you.

37
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,370
Honey…

38
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:31,419
Your uncle seems to want to
continue working with you.

39
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,087
You don't mind, do you?

40
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,256
It's not as big as
what we had back in Seoul,

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,635
but he owns 13 stores at the market.

42
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,639
He is sort of a leader in Pohang
and is a successful businessman.

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,267
He has strong business acumen.
I've learned a lot from him.

44
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,980
But then again,
why would you be interested in business?

45
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,150
You've been forced to move here
because of your dad and his business.

46
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,654
Do you find it okay staying here?

47
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,865
Well, this is my hometown.

48
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,576
A place I find strange and uncomfortable.

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,954
Where I fled to
after throwing everything away.

50
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,418
Right, Yi-jin.
I have something to say to you.

51
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,670
What is it?

52
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,629
In Seoul…

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,758
Yes?

54
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,969
You have to buy an apartment in Apgujeong.

55
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,054
They're now at their lowest price.

56
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,765
How could I afford that?

57
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,018
What? You don't even have that much?

58
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,273
What did you do in Seoul, not saving up?

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,818
I know. I've been so lazy.

60
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,154
After the business went under,

61
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,867
I had to get divorced on paper
and we've ended up like this.

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,579
Still, I've never once regretted
marrying your dad.

63
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,625
We loved and respected each other

64
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,336
all our lives.

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,880
And we still do.

66
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,800
You should also meet someone like that.

67
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,219
Someone that inspires you to improve
just by being together.

68
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,056
That is what a truly successful life is,
you silly.

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,366
Mom.

70
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,534
Yes?

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,288
I want to go to Seoul.

72
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,461
I'm done with running away.

73
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,884
I'm going to start over.

74
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,226
All right. I believe in you.

75
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,998
I've missed you.

76
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,003
But I saw you

77
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,380
because you showed yourself to me.

78
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,217
So, I got to smile today.

80
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,096
Congratulations on the bronze medal.

81
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,640
I told you before

82
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,518
that seeing you accomplish something

83
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,896
makes me want to accomplish something too.

84
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,983
I think now it's time
for me to try and accomplish something.

85
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
Did Full House volume 14 come out yet?

86
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,705
I'll show up before volume 15 comes out.

87
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,626
Wait for me, Hee-do.

JOURNALIST EXAM
PRACTICE QUESTIONS

90
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,201
Yi-jin, it's me.

91
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,413
Do you know what changed about you
after we went bankrupt?

92
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,791
You don't listen to music anymore.

93
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,170
Even if life gets tough,
don't give up on the things you like.

94
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,047
And quit smoking.

95
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,009
I asked you to wear perfume,
not because of the fish smell,

96
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,261
but because you reeked of cigarettes.

97
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,557
Once you get to Seoul,
live your life doing whatever you can,

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,767
whether it be success or failure.

99
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,562
And stop worrying about me.
It's too much pressure.

100
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,525
Lastly, I'm sorry
for talking back the other day.

101
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,861
I sincerely apologize.

102
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,382
5 MONTHS LATER

103
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,144
He is so fast, gosh!

104
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,188
-Gosh!
-Hey!

105
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,608
-Stop following me!
-No!

106
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,985
I can do this!

107
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,987
-Yes I got it!
-No!

108
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,365
PAYPHONE

109
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,785
Hey.

110
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,829
If you have time to rant,
go find another one.

111
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,039
You've got ten minutes.

112
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,042
You'll pay for this. I mean it.

113
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,919
Good luck!

114
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,303
Trainee reporter Back Yi-jin speaking.

115
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,763
Do you have a phone?

116
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,603
-Can't we use a cellphone?
-You idiot.

117
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,481
Who in their right mind uses
a cellphone to report the news?

118
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,568
The hospital area is crowded
with patients, medics, and reporters.

119
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,113
The station wouldn't hold up.
Can you take the fall if you get cut off?

120
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,157
I'm sorry, sir.
I will find a landline immediately.

121
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,242
Yes.

122
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,415
Gosh, that place is open.

123
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,845
Trainee reporter Back Yi-jin speaking.

124
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,929
Do you have a phone?

125
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,140
Yes, sir.

126
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,351
What is that sound? Where are you now?

127
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,814
Well, the thing is, I'm at a pet salon,

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,899
where dogs get a bath.

129
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,901
Are you nuts? Where's your head at?

130
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,820
Do you want dogs barking on the news?

131
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,780
-I'll persuade them.
-Persuade what?

132
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,867
I'll persuade the dogs.

133
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,577
I see.

134
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,792
Hey, guys.

135
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,671
Listen. Dogs and humans go way back.
We're friends. You know that, right?

136
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
You have to cut your friend some slack.

137
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,467
Stay quiet, just for 30 seconds.

138
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,514
It's my first time
reporting the main news,

139
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,558
and my future depends on this.

140
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,518
I'm really desperate.

141
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,937
All I'm asking for is only 30 seconds.

142
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,857
You're listening to this
while eating, right?

143
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,152
Yi-jin, are you on standby?

144
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,945
Yes, I'm ready.

145
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,283
It was a massive accident,
but thankfully, there were no casualties.

146
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,454
We'll now hear from Hanam Jaeshin Hospital
for an update on the victims.

147
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,290
Live from the scene, Back Yi-jin reports.

148
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,291
Cue!

149
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,378
Yes, here at Hanam Jaeshin Hospital,

150
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,547
there are 24 patients hospitalized
from today's accident.

151
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,842
A 31-year-old Mr. Kim is in surgery
due to a head injury,

152
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,845
but his life is unaffected.

153
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,641
Nine were seriously injured,
and eighteen were slightly injured

154
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,228
but three of them were released
due to minor damage.

155
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,400
The hospital reports
all slightly injured patients

156
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,362
will be released from the hospital
by the day after tomorrow at the latest.

157
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,239
From Hanam Jaeshin Hospital…

158
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,621
this is Back Yi-jin, for UBS news.

159
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,551
You idiot!

160
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,469
A pet salon?

161
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,680
Out of all the other places?
Are you insane?

162
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,142
All payphones were taken by
other reporters.

163
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,477
That was the only store that was open.

164
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,774
I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,820
Yes, I'll make sure
to never let this happen again.

166
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,698
Yes.

167
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,914
I want to stop being told off.

168
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,957
BOOKS

169
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,463
Now I find a quiet bookstore.

170
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,173
BEST BOOKS AND STATIONARY

171
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,508
I should have come down
just one more block.

172
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,929
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 15 AVAILABLE

173
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,229
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 15 AVAILABLE

174
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,119
A bright future for fencing in Korea.

175
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,997
Ko Yu-rim wins gold,
Na Hee-do wins bronze.

176
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,418
My precious reward money.

177
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,090
This is just great.

178
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,930
Excuse me, sir.

179
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,391
I'm sorry, but due to changes
in the aviation security act this March,

180
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,185
inflight smoking is now prohibited.

181
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,353
Excuse me?

182
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,650
So we can't smoke on planes anymore?

183
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,943
No.

184
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,614
What is this world coming to?

185
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,372
Congratulations on the bronze medal,
Ms. Na.

186
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,873
How did you know?

187
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,417
You're our national star athlete.

188
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,002
of course I should know.

189
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,755
It's an honor to serve you.

190
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,090
Thank you.

191
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,716
Would you like something to drink?

192
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,760
-Orange juice, please.
-Sure.

193
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,976
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

194
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,712
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD

195
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,638
It's only the gold I haven't won.

196
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,058
Then I'll work on winning one.

197
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm counting on you
for the Asian Games too.

198
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,706
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER NA HEE-DO

199
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,416
And please look after

200
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,587
the person who gave you to me.

201
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,465
Help him out when things are hard.

202
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,478
What?

203
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,562
Hee-do!

204
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,148
Are you here for the midterms?

205
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,151
Yes. You weren't at the broadcasting room,
so I thought you'd be here.

206
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,490
How have you been?

207
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,159
As usual.

208
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,203
But a lot has changed for you.

209
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,498
You've been sweeping medals
in all kinds of international games.

210
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,502
I go around telling people that
we are close.

211
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,921
I don't have many friends,
so I'd say we're close.

212
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,131
Really? We are?

213
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,885
Then feel free to use
this space whenever since we're close.

214
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,054
Really?

215
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,893
Thanks!

216
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,231
And here.

217
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,941
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL BROADCASTING CLUB

218
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,777
Thanks for these. I enjoyed them.

219
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,072
Have you heard from Yi-jin?

220
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,324
Yes. Just once, about a few months ago.

221
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,077
Gosh, he's so rude!

222
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
I'm sure he will show up.

223
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,374
He said he will.

224
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,381
Let's go.

225
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,509
It's your first time
coming to school this year.

226
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,137
Do you know what class we're in?

227
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,305
-"We?"
-Yes, "we."

228
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,682
We're all in the same class.

229
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,810
You, me, Ji-woong and Yu-rim.

230
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,022
The answer is number 1 for question 23.

231
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,815
Number 3 for question 24,

232
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,402
-Number 3 for question 25.
-You can sit over there.

233
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,653
Hey!

234
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,072
Glad to see me?

235
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,449
Of course!

236
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,743
You're here, so Yu-rim will be here too.

237
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,372
Right.

238
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,709
That is what is going to happen.

239
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,555
-Hi.
-Ji-woong. Are we in the same class again?

240
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,807
Yes. I'm now class three's pretty boy.

241
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,562
Congratulations on winning gold and silver
and all sorts of numerous medals.

242
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,980
Thank you.

243
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,982
So which exam do we have today?

244
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,275
Math.

245
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:52,863
Number three is the most common answer to
questions prepared by our math teacher.

246
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,657
If you want to guess, go for number three.

247
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,036
I see. I wasn't sure which number to pick
for guessing the answers.

248
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,080
Thanks. Are you going for
number three, too?

249
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,122
Me?

250
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,250
I'm going to solve the problems.

251
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,753
You're an athlete, and I am a student.

252
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,381
That's true. You must be good at studying.

253
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,927
I'm not all that bad.

254
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,346
PERIOD 1 MATH,
PERIOD 2 ENGLISH, PERIOD 3 KOREAN

255
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,193
NA HEE-DO, MATH

256
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,672
Answer number 1 for question 21.

257
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,091
Number 3 for question 22.

258
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,926
Number 1 for question 23.

259
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,928
Number 3 for question 24.

260
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,014
And number 3 for question 25.

261
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,850
-Yes!
-I got question 23 wrong.

262
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,017
-Gosh.
-Did you get it?

263
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,895
MOON JI-WOONG, 9 POINTS

264
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,402
Wait a minute.

265
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,654
Then it adds up to 17, 18, 19 and…

266
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,741
21 POINTS

267
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,372
KO YU-RIM, 30 POINTS

268
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,380
I'm going to take a taxi to NTC.
Do you want to share?

269
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,756
No.

270
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,508
Hey, Hee-do!

271
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,343
That's a designer brand bag.

272
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,679
It's pretty.

273
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,682
Can I try it on just once?

274
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,350
-Go ahead.
-Yes!

275
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,732
You're going to put it on backward?

276
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,066
-I want it.
-Give it.

277
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,193
Let's swap.

278
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,277
Give it back.

279
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
-I'm off.
-Bye.

280
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,073
-Hey.
-Yes?

281
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,670
Prêtes? Allez.

282
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,339
LET'S WIN GOLD AT GYEONGJU!

283
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,007
WE WISH OUR ATHLETES ALL THE BEST

284
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,675
YOUR EFFORTS WILL BEAR FRUIT

285
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,475
Prêtes? Allez.

286
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
Hey, Yu-rim.

287
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,780
Why do you always lose against Hee-do?

288
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,659
Listen, kid. This is the Asian Games.

289
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,954
Don't you know
that the entire country will be watching?

290
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,581
If you don't win the gold medal,

291
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,875
your fame and reputation will crumble.

292
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,963
You can't do this
when we're throwing our weight behind you.

293
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,466
You can't lose against her.
Do you understand?

294
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,219
Yes.

295
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,680
Please, Yu-rim.

296
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,557
Don't let down the ones
who believe in you.

297
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,560
That does it.

298
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,896
From tomorrow, you'll train at night.

299
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,148
Be ready by 8 p.m. Okay?

300
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,860
Gosh.

301
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,680
What was that?

302
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,557
Was that the wind?

303
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,270
Be more careful. We share this place.

304
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,110
I heard that
you'll train at night from tomorrow.

305
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,072
It'll be my bedtime,
so be quiet on your way in and out.

306
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,200
Did you eavesdrop?

307
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,577
Why would I?

308
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,745
I overheard.

309
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,790
You seemed terrified
in case I'd win the gold medal.

310
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,004
Shouldn't you be having that kind of talk
somewhere private at least?

311
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,590
Do you think I like standing there
listening to that crap?

312
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,425
So what? That's your problem.

313
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,470
What annoys me is how you're always
involved in my problems.

314
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,725
Coach has been giving me an earful
every day since you've joined us.

315
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,477
He always goes on about you
and the gold medal.

316
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,936
Every day since you got here!

317
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,022
Then beat me.

318
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,398
Do I have to let you win?

319
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,068
The Federation supports you,
and you're a star.

320
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,028
Does that mean I have to let you win?

321
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,991
I can read you like a book the moment
you stand in front of me. What can I do?

322
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,994
Your upper body leans forward
when you're thinking of attacking.

323
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,871
Your back foot is behind
when you're about to retreat,

324
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,581
and your hands are down
when you have a lot on your mind.

325
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,041
You're an open book!

326
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,542
But can you read me?

327
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,628
Can you?

328
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,172
What do you know about me?

329
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,716
Have you studied my fencing?

330
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,887
You haven't. Why?

331
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,224
You are incapable of admitting that
I'm on my way up.

332
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,769
I told you.

333
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,772
I was your fan…

334
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,735
and I've replayed your bouts
hundreds of times to copy and learn.

335
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,157
That umbrella you cherish so dearly
because your fan gave it to you,

336
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,452
is from me.

337
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,088
Use it! Don't get wet!

338
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,423
I'm just a fan!

339
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,802
Thanks for the umbrella!

340
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,430
That is

341
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,851
how much I liked you, Yu-rim.

342
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,438
So I studied you like crazy.

343
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,159
Then you should have just stayed a fan.

344
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,246
How dare you come all the way here
and cause trouble?

345
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,334
-Are you crazy?
-Let go of me.

346
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,919
-Say that again!
-Let me go!

347
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,045
Say that again!

348
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,591
Hey, I said let go of me!

349
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,971
-Darn it! Let me go!
-Hey!

350
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,639
-You! Let me go!
-Damn it!

351
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,308
-Let me go!
-Let go of me!

352
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,727
I said, stop it!

353
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,811
Hey!

354
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,938
What are you two doing?

355
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,366
HEAD OF SPORTS DEPARTMENT
KIM HAK-GYU

356
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,743
Come in.

357
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,254
Sir, these are the trainees
who will be joining us starting next week.

358
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,007
Okay.

359
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,425
Didn't I mention this?

360
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:14,095
To prepare for the Asian Games next month,
the sports dept needs more reporters.

361
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,305
So you'll fill in.

362
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,057
Go on. Introduce yourself.

363
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,269
Hello. I'm Jung Da-yeong,
a trainee reporter.

364
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,023
Hello. Kwon Dong-uk, a trainee reporter.

365
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,108
Hello. Back Yi-jin, a trainee reporter.

366
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,653
It's you, the eldest son
from Sanil Constructions.

367
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,738
Yes, sir.

368
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,158
The young master who went
from riches to rags joined us.

369
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,912
But you look young. How old are you?

370
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,373
-I'm 23.
-I see.

371
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,669
So you're the first high school graduate
reporter to have joined us at UBS.

372
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,756
That's impressive.

373
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,759
An international event is no joke.

374
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,928
Don't try to take initiative

375
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,264
and just do well
on the tasks that you're given.

376
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,808
It is your sixth month in,
so you should know better.

377
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,976
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,311
-Jung-hyuk?
-Yes, sir.

379
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,731
Come with me to the draw
for the Asian Games broadcasting rights.

380
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,317
No, I'm not going.

381
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,611
You're going to give me an earful
if we get unlucky.

382
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,240
Are you going to entrust our future
to my pair of jinxed hands?

383
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,909
Then take one of these
youngsters with you.

384
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,996
It would be better
if you want to pass the buck.

385
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,958
-Hey, Back Yi-jin.
-Yes.

386
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,293
You come with me.

387
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,421
-Me, sir?
-Yes.

388
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,047
You must be very lucky

389
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,508
to become a reporter
with just a high school diploma.

390
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,385
Free up some time tomorrow.

391
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,553
Yes, sir. I will.

392
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,974
The three stations literally gather

393
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,768
to do a random draw and decide on
what to broadcast during the Asian Games.

394
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,104
Let's say cycling, handball,

395
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,481
and a Korea-Japan soccer match
all take place at the same time.

396
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,734
Then all stations
will want to broadcast the soccer game.

397
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,321
To prevent that from happening,
the three stations gather

398
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,489
to make a draw
to decide on what to broadcast.

399
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,616
But since we're at it,

400
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,785
what do we need to pick?

401
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,831
At last, we have
the Korea-Japan soccer match at stake.

402
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,126
This round is for broadcasting rights
on June 30th at 3 p.m.

403
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,919
Gosh, I'm nervous.

404
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,589
The game happening at the same time is

405
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,966
wrestling.

406
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,927
It will be an easy win for Sim Kwon-ho.

407
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,013
And the last one left is

408
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,182
the fencing finals.

409
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,143
This one is a bit, you know, so-so.

410
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,645
Still, we have a huge event at stake here.

411
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,315
How about rock, paper, scissors
instead of a draw?

412
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,359
Let's do that.

413
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,903
And this time,

414
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,405
-let's see what our employees have got.
-What?

415
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,366
Sure, let's do that.

416
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,325
-Agreed!
-Agreed.

417
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,744
You have to win.

418
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,829
This is an order.
The Korea-Japan match is ours.

419
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,414
Don't worry, sir.

420
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,209
All right.

421
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:55,215
-Please, God!
-Abracadabra…

422
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,267
All right, let's go!

423
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,769
Rock, paper, scissors!

424
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,814
-Yes, you did it! The Korea-Japan match!
-Damn it!

425
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,234
LBS will broadcast the Korea-Japan match.

426
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,610
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,237
That's fine.

428
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,657
It's okay. Wrestling has Sim Kwon-ho,
so that's good too.

429
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,493
Yi-jin, let's win it this time.
Let's do this!

430
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,577
Yes, sir.

431
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,914
-Let's do this.
-I'll throw a rock.

432
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,874
Come on, don't do that.

433
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,709
You're already in the palm of my hand.

434
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,254
He said he will throw a rock,

435
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,048
so that I will throw a paper.

436
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,384
That means he's going to throw scissors.

437
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,010
Then I'm going to throw a rock!

438
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,804
Rock, paper, scissors!

439
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,558
It's over!

440
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,776
-You did a great job!
-Thank you, sir.

441
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,028
I'm sorry, sir.

442
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,740
Let's put it up at the center.

443
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,450
-This is great.
-Wrestling is good.

444
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,576
We have Sim Kwon-ho.

445
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,996
Well, isn't fencing okay?

446
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,498
It can't be worse than fencing.

447
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,000
Shut it.

448
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,419
-Look at that.
-Great.

449
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,254
Fencing is on the rise these days.

450
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,047
-Did you see that?
-Hold on.

451
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,384
Fencers Ko Yu-rim and Na Hee-do

452
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,137
have won more than five medals
from international games.

453
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,931
But who knows about that?

454
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,517
We showed them.

455
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,852
I will make sure they do.

456
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,604
I'm so glad we have Sim Kwon-ho.

457
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,564
Can I cover fencing?

458
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,362
Your daughter joined the national team
a while ago.

459
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,114
The timing of your visit seems

460
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,074
a little off.

461
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,412
I'm here today not as a parent

462
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,165
but to work, so let's talk about that.

463
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,625
We'd like for you to be

464
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,711
our network's commentator
for fencing at the Asian Games.

465
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,673
You are the face of fencing.

466
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,091
You're perfect for the job.

467
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,013
And instead of the sports department,

468
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,266
a prime-time main news anchor comes
to ask this matter herself?

469
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,561
Does an ill-fated relationship
count as a connection to you?

470
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,648
I also wanted to thank you
for getting Hee-do on the national team.

471
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,941
That's also why I'm here.

472
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,153
But aren't I a risk?

473
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,950
I was fired for taking bribes
from the athletes' parents.

474
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,080
You covered the story yourself.

475
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,207
Don't you remember?

476
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,919
That happened eight years ago.

477
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,005
Everyone has forgotten about it.
So should you.

478
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,341
Forget?

479
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,552
I should forget?

480
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,930
Hey!

481
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,518
Seriously?

482
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,645
Are you hearing yourself?

483
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,858
Everyone can say that to me, but not you.

484
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,485
Then what should I have done?

485
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,281
Should a reporter ignore a tip-off?
Since we're friends?

486
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,365
I'm the victim here.

487
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,450
You knew that,

488
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,536
yet you went ahead with it.

489
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,414
Then can you say that you're innocent?

490
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,874
No, I'm not.

491
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,751
But what about those freaking parents?
Were they innocent?

492
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,795
You didn't believe me.

493
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,175
We met as an athlete and a reporter,
but still

494
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,428
I thought we were friends.

495
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,975
I was a reporter before being a friend.

496
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,101
Of course.

497
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,438
I know that very well.

498
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,108
You've already proved that yourself.

499
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,238
Let's not talk about this.

500
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,533
Think about the offer and let me know.

501
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,534
I'll get going.

502
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,221
-Secure our jobs!
-Secure our jobs!

503
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,515
We are starving to death!

504
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,476
-Starving to death!
-Starving to death!

505
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,686
Give us jobs!

506
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,521
-Give us jobs!
-Give us jobs!

507
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,690
Stop restructuring!

508
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,735
The laborers insisted on reducing
working hours for job sharing

509
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,322
in order to reduce unemployment
from the financial crisis.

510
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,325
In addition, the labor union vowed
to launch a general strike

511
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,828
if the government continued to show
no signs to engage in discussions.

512
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,373
With UBS news,
this is Seo Jung-hyuk reporting.

513
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,710
With UBS news,
this is Back Yi-jin reporting.

514
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,380
We are starving to death!

515
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,215
-Starving to death!
-Starving to death!

516
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,134
-All right, cut!
-That was great.

517
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,595
Let's get a full shot, then go for a meal.

518
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,680
All right.

519
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,307
Reduce working hours!

520
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,434
-Reduce them!
-Reduce them!

521
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,311
We are starving to death!

522
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,816
-I'd like to capture that large banner.
-That one?

523
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,026
Yes, that one. The entire banner.

524
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,027
Okay.

525
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,654
What do you think?

526
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,406
If we get a full shot…

527
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,408
The entire thing?

528
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,743
Just as it is?

529
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,871
Yes, I want to keep it.
And then move down.

530
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,040
We can edit that.

532
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,550
Give us jobs!

533
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,760
-Give us jobs!
-Give us jobs!

534
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,475
I'm sorry, Jung-hyuk.
I'll get to the TV station by myself.

535
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,810
I'm sorry!

536
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,478
Hey! Where are you going!

00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,897
-Starving to death!
-Starving to death!

538
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,691
Reduce working hours!

544
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,326
Secure our jobs!

-Secure them!
-Secure them!

546
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,872
Reduce working hours!

00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,582
-Reduce them!
-Reduce them!

548
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,042
We are starving to death!

FULL HOUSE VOLUME 15

550
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,588
-I'm sorry.
-We're starving to death!

00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,590

554
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,928
Stop restructuring!

555
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,680
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

556
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,891
Back Yi-jin?

557
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,607
Back Yi-jin!

558
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,796
NO TO UNEMPLOYMENT!
WE WANT JOB SECURITY!

559
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,721
We are starving to death!

560
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,640
-Starving to death!
-Starving to death!

561
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,141

Stop restructuring!

00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,647
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

565
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,210
You got hurt.

566
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,838
This?

567
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,257
I got it in a fight with Yu-rim.

568
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,094
I thought you two would become close.

569
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,888
I had also hoped for that.

570
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,688
-The pager--
-The pager--

571
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,861
You go first.

572
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,656
Your pager number wasn't in service.

573
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,452
My mom got rid of it without telling me.

574
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,163
She told me to use my cellphone.

575
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,710
So you did try to contact me.

576
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,422
To give you that.

577
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,217
FULL HOUSE VOLUME 15

578
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,845
This is for me?

579
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,682
It's not to my taste yet.

580
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,268
Maybe it will be
when I get a little older.

581
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,784
I'm sorry for being late.

582
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,754
Have you already read it?

583
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,343
No.

584
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,261
Now I can read it.

585
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,945
What are you doing here?

586
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,822
To cover a story.

587
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,495
I became a reporter.

588
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,748
Really?

589
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,252
I heard the exam
to become a reporter is difficult.

590
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,546
Smart ones are surely different.

591
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,882
Congratulations.

592
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,303
Were you going somewhere?

593
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,430
Well…

594
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,724
Have you eaten?

595
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,560
No, not yet.

596
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,356
Do you want to come and eat with us?

597
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm on my way to meet someone,

598
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,902
but if you don't mind joining us.

599
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,492
Okay.

600
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,622
This is my boyfriend.

601
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,631
A boyfriend?

602
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,218
When you've met
for the first time after six months?

603
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,223
He is also on the national fencing team.

604
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,314
I know. You are Jung Ho-jin.
Nice to meet you.

605
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,692
Do you know me?

606
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,236
Yes. I cover fencing in the sports dept.

607
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,113
Really?

608
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,365
Yi-jin, you sure have
strong ties with fencing!

609
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,471
Are you okay? Did you get hurt, Cutie Pie?

610
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,889
Sweetie Pie.

611
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,391
That knife was heavier than I thought.

612
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,018
It slipped off my hands.

613
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,605
Let me do this.

614
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,900
You shouldn't hold a knife
with such pretty hands.

615
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,321
Isn't her job to hold a sword?

616
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,659
How long have you two been dating?

617
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,165
Three days.

618
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,710
Three days?

619
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,840
-I see.
-Excuse me.

620
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,384
For the record,

621
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,804
I detest typical guys who go by as
a contact, a tutor, or a church buddy.

622
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,808
Please draw the line at friendship
with my Cutie Pie. Are we clear?

623
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,686
Cutie pie.

624
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,273
-You should do it like this. Look.
-Right.

625
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,692
-We usually stab, like this.
-Yes.

626
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,487
But here, we have to slice, like this.

627
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,406
Here, you can see.

628
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,699
It's all done.

629
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,661
Cutie Pie, let me quickly
use the bathroom.

630
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,456
-Come back soon.
-I will.

631
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,843
"Come back soon."

632
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,428
"Come back soon."

633
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,264
It's been a while, and that's what you do?

634
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,686
You're so full of surprises.

635
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,897
I've never imagined seeing you
in a three-day-old relationship.

636
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,816
Are you mocking me?

637
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,152
No. I'm just glad to see you
after a long time.

638
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,960
I thought my heart had skipped a beat
when I saw your back earlier.

639
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,089
Why?

640
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,301
In case I lose you.

641
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,228
It was so noisy out there…

642
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,316
but all I could hear was your voice.

643
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,825
I've kept praying
so that you won't have a hard time.

644
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,787
Maybe my prayer was answered.

645
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,215
It was a little tough.

646
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,760
But soon I got back on my feet.

647
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,307
I could.

648
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,605
I knew you would.

649
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,028
You once delivered newspapers,

650
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,988
and now you're making them.

651
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,073
That's pretty cool!

652
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,452
So I'm not a newspaper reporter.
I work at a TV station called UBS.

653
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,703
At UBS?

654
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,829
What is it?

655
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,998
Nothing.

656
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,713
Is your boyfriend treating you well?

657
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,048
What do you like about him?

658
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,009
Well, he said he likes me.

659
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,138
Gosh. Your motto is to date with anyone
who likes you?

660
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,849
I'm curious
about being in a romantic relationship.

661
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,685
If it really is like in Full House.

662
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,274
Right, you're 19. That's a perfect age
to fall in love for the first time.

663
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,859
I feel like you're constantly mocking me.

664
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,778
I'm not mocking you.

665
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,613
Not at all.

666
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,448
All right, Cutie Pie.

667
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,533
You're so annoying.

668
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,331
TAXI

669
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,718
This is my number! Hee-do.

670
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,053
Gosh, I'm at a loss for words.

671
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,347
What is it, sir?

672
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,685
It's nothing. I just had
this ridiculous thing happen to me today.

673
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:29,315
It was something to do pies.
Sweetie and Cutie.

674
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,858
I see.

675
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,904
Some kind of lovey-dovey…

676
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,994
Once you're in Gyeongju,

677
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,788
go straight to IBC
and collect your AD card,

678
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,665
check on our assigned office,

679
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,084
and find out the locations
for venues per sport.

680
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,587
There are countless variables at play
during an international event,

681
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,547
so you must stay alert.

682
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,965
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

683
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,967
Who has a car?

684
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,762
You two can go to Gyeongju on your own.

685
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,765
-Dong-uk, you can go with Mr. Choi.
-Yes, sir.

686
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,141
Yes, understood.

687
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,645
-Hey, don't kick it.
- Sorry, sir.

688
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,733
Why did you

689
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,444
bring this kind of a car?

690
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,822
You asked us to borrow one if possible,

691
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,948
so to be of help…

692
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:25,454
Would you believe in anything that's said
by a reporter driving in a car like this?

693
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,209
Well, I think that's a stereotype.

694
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,754
I can see you did go from riches to rags.

695
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,548
Close the top before you hit the road.

696
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,549
It's broken.

697
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,720
I'm going to kill you
if you wear sunglasses on top of this.

698
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,142
All right, off you go to Gyeongju!

699
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,648
-Hurry!
-Yes. Take care.

700
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,034
WE WELCOME ALL THE ATHLETES

701
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,501
Today is the fourth day
of the 1999 Gyeongju Asian Games.

702
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,211
Here, in front of the main stadium,

703
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,965
tourists of various nationalities are
having a great time.

704
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,593
Yes, they went to the aquatic center,
and I'm on my way to the fencing stadium.

705
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,012
Yes, sir. All right.

706
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,247
There is quite a skill gap
between the two as expected.

707
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,085
Na Hee-do surely has made
incredible progress over time.

708
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,920
Yu-rim already made it to the finals.

709
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,006
So if Hee-do wins this round,

710
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,342
the nation will watch in comfort
while Korea wins a gold medal.

711
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,012
It will be an uneasy moment
for the athletes, though.

712
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:09,141
It would be great to mention that
when we broadcast the finals tomorrow.

713
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,143
Sure.

714
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,147
Being teammates

715
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,735
and then enemies at the finals
is awkward and fun.

716
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,074
En garde. Prêtes?

717
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,702
Allez.

718
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,551
Attention.

719
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,553
Salut.

720
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,957
Great job!

721
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,834
If you could do a little more…

722
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,462
Excuse me, can you two please
come here and help me?

723
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,797
-Yes.
-Yes.

724
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,881
Please, hurry!

725
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,425
Good job, Hee-do.

726
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,137
It seems we'll have to fight
amongst ourselves for the finals.

727
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,350
Who will you coach tomorrow?

728
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,102
What?

729
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,397
Whose side will you be at?

730
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,275
Yu-rim or me?

731
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,403
Neither.

732
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,365
In this case, the coach normally goes
to be at the stands.

733
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,869
But I bet your mind is set on one of us.

734
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,751
-Hello.
-Best of luck tomorrow.

735
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,053
My dream is about to come true, Yu-rim.

736
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,934
Becoming your rival.

737
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,186
I think I'm almost there.

738
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,524
Are you seeing this?

739
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,028
How far your obsessive fan has come.

740
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,786
You will see it tomorrow too.

741
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,374
Reasons for why I'm me,
regardless of how far you've come.

742
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,337
Why you were once my fan

743
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,131
and why your dream can't come true.

744
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,598
I'll teach you,
so you can watch and learn.

745
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,438
I'm sorry!

746
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,566
You said you'll teach me tomorrow.

747
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,069
You shouldn't get hurt.

748
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,036
Na Hee-do and Ko Yu-rim
advanced to the finals.

749
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,497
It was Japan against Iran
in the third-place playoff,

750
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,959
where Armita from Iran
won the bronze medal.

751
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,921
Good work. Go to IBC
and send your manuscript to the editor.

752
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:26,880
Yes.

753
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,592
Do you know that we'll do an interview
with Yu-rim and Hee-do before the finals?

754
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,885
Yes, I know.

755
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,558
Yes, I'll get prepared.

756
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,268
Yes.

757
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,405
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

758
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,824
Tteokgalbi?

759
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,827
The food here tastes horrible.

760
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,911
Sorry?

761
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,212
Which one?

762
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,468
Oh, that.

763
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,680
Podaegi.

764
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,392
-Po.
-Dae.

765
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,477
-Dae.
-Gi.

766
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,061
-Gi.
-Yes.

767
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,931
GOOD LUCK
TO OUR NATIONAL FENCING TEAM

768
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,308
There's Ko Yu-rim!

769
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,551
What is this?

770
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,929
This is not my sword.

771
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,389
I'm sorry?

772
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,517
This is the one you've used
at the semi-finals yesterday.

773
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,726
I brought it straight to here.

774
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,437
No, I have a sword that I use all the time
and it's not in here.

775
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,022
None of these are mine.

776
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,485
Excuse me, can you two please
come here and help me?

777
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,028
-Yes.
-Yes.

778
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,154
Please, hurry.

779
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,283
There must have been a mix-up.

780
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,995
You had left my sword bag
to be at somewhere else for a moment.

781
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,249
I did. But something urgent came up.

782
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,878
But I came back and got it.

783
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,130
No. There was a red bag next to mine
which belonged to the Japanese fencer.

784
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,423
You've brought that one.

785
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,385
That can't be.
This was the only one there.

786
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,179
Then she must have
mistakenly taken mine as hers.

787
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:04,931
What is going on?

788
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,476
Coach, can you get in touch with
the fencer I went up against yesterday?

789
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,769
Right now.

790
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,937
What?

791
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,026
Yes, please.

792
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,153
Is that so?

793
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,824
On a tour of Seoul?

794
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,371
The Japan team has completed the schedule
and is on the way to Seoul for a tour.

795
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,540
The team is already on the train.

796
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,668
So she is not in Gyeongju?
Then where is she now?

797
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,130
If you are not in Gyeongju,
whereabouts are you?

798
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,425
She got on the train about 20 minutes ago.

799
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,970
Tell her to get off at the next station
and that I'm on my way.

800
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,682
Please hold. Hey, the finals start
in three hours.

801
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,892
Where do you think you're going?

802
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,936
Then can you go, Coach?

803
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,480
Or can I ask someone else to go?

804
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,981
Just use what you have now.

805
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,192
That one has been authorized
so it should be fine.

806
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:00,111
Who on earth uses someone else's sword
at a competition?

807
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,281
I've been practicing
with my sword forever!

808
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,119
Tell them to get off at the next station,

809
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,413
and let me know which station it is.

810
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,882
Give me the earliest ticket
to Yeongcheon station.

811
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,384
The train departs in ten minutes.

812
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,098
-Please hurry to the platform.
-Thanks.

813
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,646
How have you been?

814
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,233
Coach, I'm not doing this interview.

815
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,026
Wait. Yu-rim!

816
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,654
Yu-rim, I'm sorry.

817
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,204
How many times are you going to do this?
Give me a heads-up.

818
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,791
No, let's just put an end to us.

819
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:59,337
You disappear all of a sudden
then reappear like nothing happened.

820
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,215
And you're asking how I've been?

821
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,676
How about you? Have you been well?

822
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,262
Could you?

823
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,689
I am sorry.

824
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,279
But now I'm more confident
than I was before. I've tried.

825
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,490
That's why I couldn't be in touch.

826
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,413
Do you two know each other?

827
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,667
Yes, our families have known each other
since we were young.

828
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,295
Does Hee-do know that
you've become a reporter?

829
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,633
Yes.

830
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,681
It was a coincidence.
We ran into each other on the street.

831
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,269
That wench.

832
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,606
She promised to tell me.

833
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,487
So where is Hee-do?

834
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,406
I'm so sorry.

835
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,409
I didn't know there was a mix-up.

836
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,545
What is she saying?

837
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:28,343
You're a good fencer.
You'll win the gold medal.

838
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,809
I'll try my best.

839
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,311
It was a great bout.

840
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,405
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER NA HEE-DO

841
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,123
Hello?

842
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:01,376
Yes, coach. I got my swords,
and I'm on my way back.

843
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,170
I'll be arriving at 1:05 p.m.,
so there's enough time.

844
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,841
Hello?

845
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,639
I ran out of battery.

846
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,316
Why is this stopping?

847
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,194
Please note we are experiencing delays

848
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,822
due to a train ahead of us
proceeding at a slow speed.

849
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:34,159
We ask for your understanding.

850
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,870
What is he saying?

851
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:46,045
Finally, please say a few words
to all the Koreans rooting for you.

852
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,716
Yes. Thank you for all your support.

853
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:53,386
I'll try my best to get good results
like I did at the previous games.

854
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,181
Cut. Thank you.

855
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,223
Thank you.

856
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,894
You owe me a proper apology for today.

857
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,146
Thanks for giving me a chance.

858
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,321
Hee-do is on a train that will reach
Gyeongju station at 1:05 p.m.

859
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,573
At 1:05 p.m.?

860
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,619
Then I will stop by at IBC
and come back here around 1:30 p.m.

861
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,786
Yes.

862
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,374
The crowd is gathering to watch
the Korea-Japan soccer match.

863
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,418
The traffic in downtown Gyeongju is heavy.

864
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,047
Many roads are closed off
for the smooth running of the games…

865
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,257
Back Yi-jin speaking.

866
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,344
This is Dong-uk. Can you pick Jung-hyuk up
from Gyeongju station?

867
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,388
I don't think I can.
The fencing finals are happening soon.

868
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,015
Then what should I do?

869
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:42,727
His train was supposed to arrive
at 1:05 p.m., but it is delayed

870
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,480
and I have to get to wrestling by 2 p.m.

871
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,982
Then on your way to wrestling…

872
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,071
Wait. The train to arrive at 1:05 p.m.
has been delayed? For how long?

873
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,364
I don't know.

874
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,408
He told me just now that
the train hadn't moved for 30 minutes.

875
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,327
Hang up for a minute.

876
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,871
HEE-DO

877
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,336
-The number you have dialed…
-Gosh, Hee-do.

878
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,328
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

879
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,275
Hey, Yi-jin.

880
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,486
You came to pick me up?

881
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,406
The game will start in 50 minutes. Run.

882
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,575
Hey, Yi-jin?

883
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,579
Back Yi-jin?

884
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,847
Hurry up.

885
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,893
Put on your seatbelt.

886
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,359
Hee-do.

887
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,616
My gosh. The train was delayed,

888
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,577
and it was making constant stops.

889
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:10,750
I was afraid I might forfeit
when I've worked so hard for this.

890
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,628
Hee-do.

891
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,505
Hee-do?

892
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,507
Look at me.

893
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,802
We will be at the stadium in 15 minutes.

894
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,763
So you'll warm up for 30 minutes
and be at the fencing finals.

895
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,350
All right? You also found your sword.
Everything is fine.

896
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,143
Right?

897
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,854
Right.

898
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,107
Good. Now, let's go.

899
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,921
But why are you in Gyeongju?

900
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,257
Did you forget that I'm a reporter?

901
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,050
That's right.

902
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,886
How did you know I was there?

903
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,222
I heard about it
when I went to get an interview.

904
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,683
I found out about the train delay
by coincidence.

905
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,561
Wait.

906
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,813
We should have gone straight there.

907
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,941
If we take the route you know,
you can't make it to the finals.

908
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,874
Please go back.
This road is closed for the Asian Games.

909
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,792
I'm Back Yi-jin, a reporter for UBS.

910
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,627
A national fencing team member
is in the car,

911
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,879
and the finals will be in 40 minutes.

912
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,631
She can make it to the stadium on time
only if you let us use this road.

913
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,799
What?

914
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,885
But we haven't been informed.

915
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,555
Of course not, since this just happened
and is an emergency.

916
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,931
Please open the road.

917
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,185
-You can't do that.
-We don't have time for this.

918
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,520
If you don't open up the road,

919
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,064
a Korean athlete will lose by default
at the finals.

920
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,777
You could be held accountable for that.
Is that okay with you?

921
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,821
But who would hold me responsible?

922
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,157
I will, as a reporter.

923
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,868
Please wait.

924
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:14,165
Sir, we have a situation here.

925
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:17,251
The situation is, how should I put it…

926
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,547
Sir, a national fencing team member
can't get to the venue.

927
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,425
The bout is in 40 minutes.
If you don’t open the road now…

928
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,055
we won't be able to win a gold medal.

929
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,683
A national team member?
What are you doing? Open the road, now!

930
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,874
What would I be doing now
if I hadn't met you?

931
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,837
Today? Or just in general?

932
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,673
Both.

933
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,133
Even if we didn't know each other,

934
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,303
we would still be together like now.

935
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,891
Because we have the same destination.

936
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,771
But how can I get a ride
if we don't know each other?

937
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,482
I would have gone to Gyeongju station
to pick up Jung-hyuk,

938
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:25,403
and recognized Na Hee-do,
the rising star in fencing.

939
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,408
You've let me down.

940
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,326
-I'm talking to you.
-That's Na Hee-do.

941
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,120
Ms. Na Hee-do?

942
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,541
Aren't you supposed to be at the stadium?
What happened?

943
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,918
I'm here if you need any help.
I can carry this for you.

944
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,670
Please.

945
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,803
That would have been
a nice first encounter.

946
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,681
We were destined to meet

947
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,309
at some point in our lives.

948
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,856
Thank you for today.

949
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,859
I wanted to thank you too,

950
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,069
the entire time we were apart.

951
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,824
I mean it.

952
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,243
I know.

953
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,963
Now let me ask you two questions.

954
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,673
Please answer them.

955
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,430
You have the final round ahead.
How are you feeling?

956
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,183
Great.

957
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,394
I had an intensive warm-up this morning,
so I feel good.

958
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,106
This is your first time
in the Asian Games,

959
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,276
where you'll have to meet
Ms. Ko Yu-rim at the finals.

960
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,695
What is going to be your strategy?

961
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,781
Well…

962
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,659
My strategy is to not have a strategy.

963
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,078
Nothing changes
because Yu-rim is my opponent.

964
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,914
I am going to fence the way I want

965
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:03,292
as I always have.

966
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:10,299
I'll show the world that
this is Na Hee-do's fencing.

967
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,597
I find it more thrilling to compete
on a larger scale.

968
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,892
I like it very much to think that

969
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,228
the whole country will be watching me.

970
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,694
Why? Am I too full of myself?

971
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:35,032
No. I like it very much.

972
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,507
What's with the police car?

973
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,758
Are we in trouble?

974
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,595
Do you have any idea
how important you are right now?

975
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,472
You are being escorted.

976
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,228
No way!

977
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,772
This is so exciting! Totally awesome!

978
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,234
I'm a big shot!

979
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:16,699
A big shot will now ask you a question.

980
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:21,662
Today Yu-rim and Hee-do will meet
at the finals.

981
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,164
Who are you rooting for?

982
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,083
Let me see.

983
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,835
Ko Yu-rim.

984
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,466
-What?
-You have Sweetie Pie rooting for you.

985
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,009
Yu-rim doesn't have one.

986
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,762
I broke up with Sweetie Pie!

987
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,600
What? How long was she in a relationship
before breaking up?

988
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,774
Two weeks was long enough.

989
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,152
Why did you even date him?

990
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,613
I'll let you in on a secret.

991
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,866
I wanted to experience a breakup.

992
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,370
What?

993
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,791
All the song lyrics
make such a big deal out of a breakup.

994
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:11,128
I was so curious to know why
people were losing their minds over it.

995
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,380
But it wasn't a big deal.

996
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,553
You have to be in love first

997
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,680
for a breakup to be sad, you idiot.

998
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,072
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER NA HEE-DO

999
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,543
We're almost there, Hee-do.

1000
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,401
Thank you.

1001
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,201
See you.

1002
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:26,704
Hee-do.

1003
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,709
You will do well, right?

1004
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,297
I don't know.

1005
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,966
But one thing is for sure.

1006
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,429
I'm going to win.

1007
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,283
Women's fencing finals will soon begin.

1008
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,671
Na Hee-do was in good spirits
when I met her before the finals.

1009
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:43,424
Rather than planning to defeat Ko Yu-rim,

1010
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:47,136
she had a strong ambition to fence her way

1011
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:50,472
and promised to give
her very best in the finals.

1012
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:53,267
Test.

1013
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,485
We'll now begin the women's fencing finals

1014
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,195
En garde.

1015
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,662
Prêtes?

1016
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:01,835
Allez.

1017
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,532
Today is the day

1018
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,618
my dream will come true.

1019
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:35,536
En garde.

1020
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,580
Prêtes? Allez.

1021
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:44,628
I'm betting my everything on Yu-rim.

1022
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,506
Everyone told me to quit fencing.

1023
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,467
But I didn't.

1024
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,387
Because…

1025
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:57,141
-I still found it so much fun.
-Prêtes?

1026
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,100
Allez.

1027
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,352
Touche. Point.

1028
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,981
I made a promise to win a gold medal.
I could not keep that promise.

1029
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:15,784
