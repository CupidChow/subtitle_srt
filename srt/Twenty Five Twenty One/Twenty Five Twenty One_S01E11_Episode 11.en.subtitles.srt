EPISODE 11

2
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,113
When will you be done?

3
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,907
Not for a while.

4
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,159
It's boring without ballet, right?

5
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,829
-That's why everyone needs--
-Summer's starting tomorrow.

6
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,873
Let's get samgyetang for dinner.

7
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,333
Grandma and I have to fast

8
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,086
starting from dinner
for our annual physical the day after.

9
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,128
Let's make it lunch.

10
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,463
Fine.

11
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,010
Wasn't that chair in Grandma's front yard?

12
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,055
You have a good eye.

13
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,890
It looks old.

14
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,351
Why are you fixing it
instead of making a new one?

15
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,233
Because it's important to me.

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,613
What does it mean to you?

17
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,620
My dad was good with his hands.

18
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,498
He could fix and make anything.

19
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,169
Hee-do. Ta-da!

20
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,256
-Daddy!
-One day, he made three chairs.

21
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,424
-What are these?
-These?

22
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,010
This is your chair.

23
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,180
-It's so pretty.
-Isn't it?

24
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,348
Yes.

25
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,725
Come here, Hee-do.

26
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,272
Here. Sit down. Test it out.

27
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,024
That's it. And…

28
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,781
-Mom, Dad, me.
-Thank you.

29
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,783
-They were for the three of us.
-All right.

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,828
All done.

31
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,501
We were always happy
when we sat on them together.

32
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,884
But then, Dad passed away.

33
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,888
And Mom got busier and busier.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
No. He opposed that article.

35
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,934
The direction we took was wrong.

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,853
Mom. My feet touch the ground now.

37
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,816
Yes. We must consider
the concerns of the source.

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,319
He brought us the story.
We can't bring him harm.

39
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,238
I understand your concern, but…

40
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,489
Mom!

41
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,254
Eventually, I was the only one
sitting in those chairs.

42
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,967
Then I got used to being alone.

43
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,434
I learned how to be on my own
a little early.

44
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,896
I learned at a young age…

45
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,524
so I adapted very quickly.

46
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,654
To be honest, this is more awkward for me.

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,405
Coming to the beach with friends.

48
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,409
How is it?

49
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,626
It's really fun, actually.

50
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,170
So fun, that I'm bitter
that I never knew about this.

51
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,382
I used to be surrounded by fencers.

52
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,635
I feel like I'm in another world.

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,388
I'm glad.

54
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,103
Anyway, did I not tell you
that my dad passed away either?

55
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,521
Well…

56
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,025
When I interviewed you
after you won the gold medal,

57
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,361
you mentioned your dad for the first time.

58
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,905
So I kind of guessed.

59
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,202
That's right. I did.

60
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,833
-Yes!
-Damn it.

61
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,129
-Why did it topple over? It was so steady.
-Yes!

62
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,383
Are you really going to hit me?

63
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,260
Of course. A game is a game.

64
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,179
Fine. Hit me.

65
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,599
What? You?

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,104
You freak out if I get hurt even slightly

67
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,315
and say I have to see a doctor--

68
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,782
You really hit me.

69
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,204
How could you?

70
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,915
Is this what you call love?

71
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,170
Okay, let's play again. Rematch.

72
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,922
Let's play again.

73
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,466
I'm speechless.

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,556
Hey.

75
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,309
Are you upset?

76
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,228
Fine. You can hit me too. Hit me.

77
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,117
What are you doing?

78
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,913
Hey. What are you doing?

79
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,957
What…

80
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,043
-Wait right there!
-What are you doing?

81
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,669
Hey, wait.

82
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,798
I'm going to get you!

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,216
You'll never catch me.

84
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,009
Got you.

85
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
Hey!

86
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,597
Stop it!

87
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,946
What's with your forehead?

88
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,366
I got bit by a mosquito.

89
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,284
It's way too big for that.

90
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,452
Shut it.

91
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,163
You better study.
I'll check your report card next time.

92
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,165
Damn it. You're such a nag.

93
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,502
-Bye.
-Okay, drive back safely.

94
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,129
-I will.
-Come visit again.

95
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,171
Okay.

96
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,216
What now?

97
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm starting to get used to
parting ways like this.

98
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,059
Our family used to live together
under one roof.

99
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,772
You're making him feel bad
before his long drive home.

100
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,445
What's wrong with you?

101
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,824
Let's live together again.

102
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,620
Okay? I'll make it happen. I promise.

103
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,877
Gosh.

104
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,593
PAYPHONE

105
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,194
What did you just do?

106
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,864
I hope someone else
will be able to get back up again.

107
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,366
With those coins? How?

108
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,868
None of your business.

109
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,079
-Where are the others?
-Getting some squid.

110
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,083
Seriously. How could you lie about that?

111
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,669
It's true. Trust me.
I'm the top student in our grade.

112
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,339
-Seriously.
-What now?

113
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,675
They ate some of my squid legs

114
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,969
and are lying that squids have eight legs!

115
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,471
They do have eight legs.

116
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:37,016
Hey, Yu-rim. I misjudged you.
I didn't know you were like that.

117
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,769
I wouldn't have liked you if I had known.

118
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,395
Too late. You like me already.

119
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,610
-Give it to me.
-No!

120
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,448
Let's take a picture before we head out.

121
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,616
A group picture.

122
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,497
Get closer.

123
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,542
Are we good?

124
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,418
Ready?

125
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,306
-Now?
-Yes.

126
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:26,023
Put your name down
if you want a copy. From Ji-woong.

127
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,956
HEE-DO

128
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,842
This is so funny.

129
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:21,454
HEE-DO

130
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:25,249
We're training at Sanga University
for three days starting Friday.

131
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,003
It's a good chance to test yourself
before the tournament, so stay healthy.

132
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,421
-Yes, Coach.
-Yes, Coach.

133
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,381
Coach. Are we going too?

134
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,133
Of course, you should.

135
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,636
You may be suspended,
but you still have to train.

136
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,430
You make it look like a vacation
rather than a suspension.

137
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,228
I have something to ask you.

138
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,691
Next Saturday
is our band's annual concert.

139
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,692
Can you come?

140
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,196
Will you take the stage?
I thought seniors didn't.

141
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,740
The tickets won't sell if I don't.

142
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,493
Okay, I'll go.

143
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,787
You mean it? You promise you'll come?

144
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,966
What is it? Is something wrong?

145
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,428
I said I'd go
to Ji-woong's concert on Saturday.

146
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,390
Gosh, but we suddenly have training.

147
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,183
The band's concert?

148
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,811
He'll be disappointed.

149
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,315
How could she tell us about training
with only a few days' notice?

150
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,234
She thinks we have no lives.

151
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,027
Did you have plans too?

152
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,071
No, I didn't.

153
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm so sick of it.

154
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,672
Is there even an end to this?

155
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,429
-Hey.
-What?

156
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,390
-What did you do yesterday?
-I'm so tired.

157
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,602
Hey, it hurts.

158
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,522
Okay. I'm up.

159
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,493
Are you happy, Ji-woong?

160
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,038
I'm going to ask Yu-rim out
at the concert.

161
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,541
At the concert? How?

162
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,959
During the encore.

163
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,796
You'll ask her out on stage? In public?

164
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,132
Girls hate things like that.

165
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,969
What do you know?

166
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,596
I know more than you do.

167
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,770
Yu-rim.

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,689
Do you have a minute?

169
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,359
So…

170
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,362
Well…

171
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,949
I don't think
I can make it to your concert.

172
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,494
They suddenly scheduled training.

173
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,373
-Really?
-Yes. Sorry.

174
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,292
I see.

175
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,795
Well, it's fine.

176
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,259
I'm sorry.
I have to get to my afternoon training.

177
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,012
Okay. Sure. Bye.

178
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,680
Bye.

179
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,350
Why are you home at this hour?

180
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,185
I forgot a document.

181
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,520
I have to get back.

182
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,194
Mom, out front…

183
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,742
The chairs.

184
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,288
They're worn out
and are beginning to mold.

185
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,708
I think we should have them fixed.

186
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,294
That's not fixable.

187
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,046
They weren't made well anyway.
It's a waste of money.

188
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,507
So you'll throw them away?

189
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,560
The carpenter may be able to put
a fresh layer of paint on it though.

190
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,646
Let's go when I get home
the day after tomorrow.

191
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,148
Make sure to eat.

192
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,635
ANNIVERSARY OF DAD'S PASSING

193
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,345
One! Two!

194
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,846
One! Two!

195
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
One! Two!

196
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,599
One! Two!

197
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,809
-I really don't want to train today.
-One! Two!

198
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,062
-Me neither.
-One! Two!

199
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,189
Every time I run laps out here,

200
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,608
I fantasize about running out the gate.

201
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,361
I guess I'm not the only one.

202
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,988
In middle school, I always had 3,000 won
in my pocket whenever I ran.

203
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,365
So that I can take a cab.

204
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,117
One! Two! One! Two!

205
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,327
Ye-ji!

206
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,164
What is she doing?

207
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,708
I think she's running away.

208
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,295
What are you all doing?

209
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,009
Are you done running?

210
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,803
Yes, we are.

211
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,139
Today's morning training
will be one-on-one with me.

212
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,728
Where's Ye-ji?

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,649
Well, yes. Ye-ji…

214
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,484
-She said her head hurt.
-Yes.

215
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,986
-Right.
-So she went to the infirmary.

216
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,446
She said she had a migraine
that wouldn't go away.

217
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,031
-Yes.
-She'll be back soon.

218
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,494
Anyway, we'll go in order
starting with tenth graders.

219
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,914
So change and gather in the gym
an hour from now.

220
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,749
-Yes, Coach.
-Yes, Coach.

221
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,347
Ye-ji!

222
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,403
What are you doing?
Why are you standing here?

223
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,200
I crossed too late.
The light changed, so I got stuck.

224
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,703
Are you okay? Why did you run away?

225
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,918
I always fantasize
about the same thing you two do.

226
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,422
Running out the gate while running laps.

227
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,969
That was why I tried it.

228
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,556
I wanted to try it.

229
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,272
Let's go. We need to practice.

230
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,699
UBS FENCING DOCUMENTARY DRAFT

231
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,004
There you are.

232
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,924
I've been looking for you since morning.

233
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,344
Are you leaving now?

234
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,597
Yes. I heard you were assigned to Sports.

235
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,599
Stay on your toes.

236
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,559
Don't cause trouble.

237
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,895
I'll do my best.

238
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,688
You're returning to Local News?

239
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,649
I'm not going by choice.

240
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,567
They blackmailed me to go.

241
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,653
-Later.
-Just a minute.

242
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,741
May I call you when things are tough?

243
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,830
No. Work through it alone.

244
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,543
I'll call you.

245
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,545
I'll call you.

246
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,888
Ye-ji didn't look good all day long.

247
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,974
I wonder if something's wrong.

248
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,686
Probably. But she looked like
she didn't want to talk about it.

249
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,938
I couldn't ask her.

250
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,940
You're right.

251
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,609
Is this it? I'll wait for you.

252
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,875
What is it?

253
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,294
I don't get it.

254
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,547
Why were you so mean to me at first

255
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,883
when you're this friendly?

256
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,301
At first?

257
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,514
Well…

258
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,517
You scared me.

259
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,482
I knew who you were from the start.

260
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,277
Way before you transferred here.

261
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,448
You knew me?

262
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,826
How could I forget you?

263
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,164
You beat me eight-nothing
at my first junior sports festival.

264
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,211
Junior sports festival?

265
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,339
When I won the gold medal?

266
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,841
We competed back then?

267
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,385
You don't remember me, do you?

268
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,680
I knew it.

269
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,226
I couldn't eat for three days
because I was so upset.

270
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,230
I only thought about you

271
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,857
ever since that tournament.

272
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,901
About beating you.

273
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,737
About beating you eight-nothing,
if possible.

274
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,159
But you were…

275
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,787
GRADE SCHOOL GIRLS'
FENCING CHAMPIONSHIP RESULTS

276
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,209
KO YU-RIM

277
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,258
NA HEE-DO

278
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,009
CHOI YEON-JU

279
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,403
It upset me that you were doing poorly.

280
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,533
I thought I'd be happy, but I wasn't.

281
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,704
I had worked so hard to get where I was

282
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,915
because of you.

283
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,168
But I felt like you weren't trying.

284
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,257
I had no idea.

285
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,846
Then one day you showed up in my life,

286
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,766
saying you had transferred in
and that you were my fan.

287
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,275
But it felt strange.

288
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:03,030
I was no longer the girl
who had lost to you eight-nothing.

289
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,117
I was the gold medalist Ko Yu-rim.

290
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,579
But I was still scared.

291
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,921
I guess childhood memories
stick with you more.

292
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,801
You're not scared of me anymore, right?
We're close now.

293
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,223
I am.

294
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,229
I'm still scared of you, Hee-do.

295
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,318
She said she was scared of me.

296
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,155
It feels weird.

297
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,240
Because Yu-rim…

298
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,577
doesn't scare me.

299
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,925
Hey.

300
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,718
Did you come from school?

301
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,428
Why didn't you wait for me inside?

302
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,098
I didn't want to go in alone.

303
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,351
You get shy
when you go to unfamiliar places.

304
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,603
You were at the studio too.

305
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,107
You were rude to me from the get-go.

306
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,985
That was because
you looked like a pushover.

307
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,864
I pick and choose. Let's go in.

308
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,419
Hello. It's been so long.

309
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,588
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

310
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,216
I was very pleased
to see your name on the reservation.

311
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,009
Please, come this way.

312
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,803
Let's go.

313
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,988
Let me know when you're ready.

314
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,364
Okay. I'll do that.

315
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,163
What do you want?

316
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,917
What should I get?

317
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,296
But first, why are you buying me dinner?

318
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,548
Isn't this place expensive?

319
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,176
Yes, it's expensive.

320
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,928
But I'm very grateful to you,
so it's fine.

321
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,723
Well…

322
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,517
Get Course A.

323
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,312
A course meal?
Where they bring you a bunch of food?

324
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,942
What's up? Why are you buying dinner?

325
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,700
I'm an official reporter now.
A sports reporter.

326
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,784
Really?

327
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,038
What were you until now?

328
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,664
Right.

329
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,543
Sure. You didn't know.
That's only natural.

330
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,921
It's too complicated to explain.

331
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,548
Well, let's just say I got a raise.

332
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:12,052
Really? Congratulations!

333
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,481
I'm in charge of fencing,

334
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,901
so I'm introducing myself to a top fencer.

335
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,988
Also, I wouldn't be where I am today

336
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,658
if it wasn't for you.

337
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,912
So, eat up.

338
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,249
-Really?
-Yes.

339
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,046
Is Course A the most expensive?

340
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,006
Yes.

341
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,175
Then Course A it is.

342
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,807
Is it good?

343
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,226
It's awesome.

344
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,062
You must have come here often.

345
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,189
The employee seemed to know you.

346
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,402
My family came often when I was young.
When we lived together.

347
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,530
How nice.

348
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,491
What is? We can't come together anymore.

349
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,076
You can't come now,

350
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,745
but it's nice to have memories.

351
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,000
I can't remember my dad's voice
that well anymore.

352
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,086
I do remember it faintly,

353
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,922
but I'm not sure if it's his voice
or just my imagination.

354
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,553
I'd be able to remember clearly
if I had more memories.

355
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,394
Hearing you say that,
I feel like this moment is precious too.

356
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,770
It is.

357
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,482
It'll become a fond memory in the future.

358
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,989
Let's stay alert and remember clearly.

359
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,493
Back Yi-jin. Na Hee-do.

360
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,873
Course A. Delicious. Okay?

361
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,381
Bruise on your left arm, crooked name tag,

362
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,550
and purple scrunchy.

363
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,763
Also, my business card is being ignored.

364
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,725
UBS, BACK YI-JIN

365
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,727
That's what my memory will consist of.

366
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,563
After I bought you dinner
to celebrate becoming a reporter.

367
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,065
Seriously.

368
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,906
Memory revised. Okay?

369
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,624
Since it's an important day,
I'll create another memory.

370
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,377
Let's go to the stationery store.

371
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,588
What? Why?

372
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,382
LUCKY DRAW

373
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,508
You want to do this?

374
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,512
Yes. Let's see how lucky you'll be
in the future.

375
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,472
You get six chances.

376
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,392
-Pick.
-With this?

377
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,144
Seriously.

378
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,939
Okay, let's see.

379
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,526
This one.

380
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,280
I'll win for sure.

381
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,742
TRY AGAIN

382
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,743
It's a bust.

383
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,538
Second try.

384
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,832
Would you pick more thoughtfully?

385
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,502
-This one.
-Okay.

386
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,841
-"Snap clip." What's a snap clip?
-You won something?

387
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,428
Snap clips are the lowest, but…

388
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,054
Snap clips, please!

389
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,567
This one.

390
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,902
Look carefully.

391
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,198
TRY AGAIN

392
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,616
Next.

393
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,411
This one.

394
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:07,954
TRY AGAIN

395
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,330
Seriously.

396
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,502
Pick again.

397
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,297
Let's do this!

398
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,092
Think before you pick.

399
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,599
Come on.

400
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,685
-What is it?
-It's…

401
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,190
-Pencil case!
-Pencil case!

402
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,527
Pencil case!

403
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,118
-Let's ask for it.
-But…

404
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,455
Pencil case, please!

405
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,087
We'll be done editing the documentary
on Na Hee-do and Ko Yu-rim this week.

406
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,090
We'll do an internal viewing
and get comments next week.

407
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,801
Okay.

408
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,552
What time are you scheduling it for?

409
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,222
I'm discussing it with Scheduling.

410
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,682
I think 10:30 a.m. is the most likely.

411
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,601
-Give me a pen.
-Yes, sir.

412
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,478
Let's see.

413
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,817
What is that?

414
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,156
-It's a pencil case.
-I know that much.

415
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,284
It's an important pencil case.

416
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,414
You're letting your colors fly
now that you're an official reporter.

417
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,459
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

418
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,294
Congratulate him.

419
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,379
Congratulations.

420
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,549
I'm Reporter Back Yi-jin.

421
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,026
How nice. He still has
enough energy to scream.

422
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,821
It means it's still bearable.

423
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,828
Since I'm the class president,
I should check on him, right?

424
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,376
Where did he go?

425
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:23,756
Have you kids lost your mind?

426
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,385
The CSAT is only a few days away.

427
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,763
Do you think the classroom
is your playground?

428
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,891
-Answer me, you punks.
-Sir!

429
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,227
Hi, Seung-wan. What is it?

430
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,689
I'm stuck on a question.
I just can't understand the answer.

431
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,774
Are you free right now?

432
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,568
Right now?

433
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,072
Of course. The top student needs me.

434
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,283
Scram.

435
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,659
Which problem?

436
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,870
-I'll go get it.
-Sure.

437
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,467
-Sir. Are you closing up?
-Yes.

438
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,512
We need something fixed,
so I was going to come later with my mom.

439
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,722
-Really?
-Yes.

440
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,434
I'll wait then.
Will you be here in an hour?

441
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,438
Well, yes, I think so.

442
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,564
Okay.

443
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,691
-Thank you. We'll be here soon.
-Okay.

444
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,738
Ma'am.

445
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,284
Hey. Hi. Are you going to the studio?

446
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,828
-Yes. To watch the 11 p.m. broadcast.
-Okay.

447
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,206
Is it a newsroom team dinner?

448
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,207
Yes.

449
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,794
I came out for some air
because I felt tipsy.

450
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,046
-You should go.
-Okay.

451
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,268
HANGOVER BUSTER

452
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,647
Why are you so sweet?

453
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,149
It's to thank you
for letting Hee-do go on the trip.

454
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,070
I was able to get some good footage
thanks to you.

455
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,697
Thanks.

456
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,416
You ended up becoming a sports reporter.

457
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,211
Regardless…

458
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,798
congratulations.

459
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,883
Thank you.

460
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,596
Was becoming a reporter always your dream?

461
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,725
My dream?

462
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,436
I'm not sure.

463
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,564
I don't think not living your dream
means you've failed at life.

464
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,901
And I don't think living your dream
means you've succeeded either.

465
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:54,365
I simply want to do well
at my job right now.

466
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,702
That's my current dream.

467
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,288
That's nice.

468
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,002
May I ask you what your dream is?

469
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,046
-My dream?
-Yes.

470
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,220
My news being fun to watch.

471
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,057
That's my dream.

472
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,851
More fun than LBS and KBY News?

473
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,561
No.

474
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,149
My competition isn't LBS or KBY.

475
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,945
It's everything that people
not watching my news are doing.

476
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,990
Movies, dramas,

477
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,410
books, chatting online,

478
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,455
drinking, talking with friends…

479
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,917
All of them are my competition.

480
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,962
I want them to watch my news
more than any of that.

481
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,425
I want them to stop what they're doing
and turn on the TV.

482
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,475
Hold on.

483
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,771
I'm going back in. You should go.

484
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,773
-Okay. Good night.
-Bye.

485
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,233
-Thanks.
-Sure.

486
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,951
She's so cool.

487
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,253
Hello?

488
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,089
I'm heading home, so wait a short while.

489
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,715
Are you drunk?

490
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,846
Fine. Hurry home.

491
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,865
It's raining.

492
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,539
I'm going to call it a night.

493
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,125
I have a date with my daughter.

494
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,460
No. It's been so long
since we had a team dinner.

495
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,962
Hwang Ho-jin speaking.

496
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,924
We'll have more team dinners.
Have fun everyone.

497
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,802
Chief. We got a call from the station.

498
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:27,894
Hey.

499
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,939
-Are you going on tonight?
-No. I just wanted to watch the news live.

500
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,442
Okay. Work hard.

501
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,360
Thanks.

502
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,612
Five minutes!

503
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,700
Sports Night is canceled tonight!

504
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,243
We have a news flash in three minutes!

505
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,790
What's the news?

506
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,500
Sin Chang-won was caught.

507
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,270
Last commercial.

508
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,439
But she drank.

509
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,113
Breaking News.

510
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,784
Sin Chang-won, who broke out of prison,
was finally captured.

511
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,953
He was caught by the police this afternoon

512
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,414
and was transported
to Suncheon, South Jeolla.

513
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,833
He broke out of prison
two and a half years ago.

514
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,587
The police went immediately
upon receiving a witness's tip

515
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:41,259
and successfully captured Sin Chang-won
in an apartment in Suncheon, South Jeolla.

516
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,231
Your call will be directed
to voicemail after the beep,

517
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,691
and you will be charged--

518
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,071
Figures.

519
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,479
Oh, no.

520
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,815
Damn it.

521
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,402
Yes.

522
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,863
As you know,

523
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,491
I have the most experience
with news flashes.

524
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,535
Everyone else there was new.

525
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,789
Not at all. You're too kind. Yes.

526
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,374
What are you doing?

527
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,669
Yes.

528
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,423
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

529
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,848
Why were you doing that alone?

530
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,021
You didn't come.

531
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,732
You tried to do that alone
in the rain? Are you stupid?

532
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,444
Am I stupid?

533
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,615
Right. Yes, I'm stupid.

534
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,536
I stupidly care too much
about those chairs, unlike you.

535
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,791
I know you never keep your word,

536
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,086
and that you never come
after saying you will.

537
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,130
But you should have come today.

538
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,966
If you had time to drink,
you should have come.

539
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,718
Yes, I did drink,

540
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,889
but I couldn't come in time
because of a news flash.

541
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,393
The news? What does that
have to do with me?

542
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,228
What was I supposed to do?

543
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,355
Ignore the news flash and come to you?

544
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,107
Since our plans are more important?

545
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,819
I may be your mom,

546
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,321
but I'm also an anchor
who delivers the news.

547
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,698
Just as you compete
even if you're sad or sick,

548
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,158
I do the same.

549
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,661
Don't you get it?

550
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,623
I thought you'd understand
once you grew up,

551
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,542
so I wished you'd grow up soon.

552
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,546
But you don't care to understand me.
You're always ready to be disappointed.

553
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,511
You wanted me to grow up quickly
because of that?

554
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,228
But I'm sorry.

555
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,403
I'm still stuck at 13, Mom.

556
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,117
I can't forget how you didn't come
to Dad's funeral because of a news flash.

557
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,036
Because I just can't forgive you for that,

558
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,791
I'm still only 13 years old.

559
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,044
You're right.

560
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,131
I don't care at all to understand.

561
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:11,010
A 13-year-old
can't understand these things.

562
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,391
Hey, listen.

563
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,518
I know you started as a reporter,

564
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,687
but you're an anchor now.

565
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,857
You need better delivery.

566
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,987
The viewers don't care
if an anchor started

567
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,073
as an announcer or as a reporter.

568
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,286
I'm sorry, sir. I'll work on it more.

569
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,164
The higher-ups started to complain.

570
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,334
You worked hard to become an anchor.
Don't lose it.

571
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,878
It's not like you're young.

572
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,715
I know your family is going through
a lot right now,

573
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,801
but don't give the higher-ups
a justification.

574
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,137
Yes, sir.

575
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,641
Jae-kyung.

576
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,559
Yes?

577
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,646
It's the hospital.
You should go right now.

578
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,028
A plane to Mokpo crashed!

579
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,656
-They're assessing the situation.
-Any deaths?

580
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,032
Probably many.

581
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,659
Where's the Local News team?

582
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,035
I'll call Captain.

583
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,662
Prepare a news flash.

584
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,831
I'll do the news flash.

585
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,752
Are you insane? You can't do it.

586
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,254
Get to the hospital.

587
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,755
Chief.

588
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,299
Let me do it.

589
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,971
I'll prove why I belong there.

590
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,390
DRESSING ROOM

591
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,870
Breaking news.

592
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,422
Breaking news.

593
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,549
Breaking news.

594
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,720
A 737 plane heading from Seoul
to Mokpo has crashed.

595
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:22,182
The plane took off from Gimpo Airport
with 106 passengers and crew on board.

596
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,351
-However, it never landed in Mokpo.
-Hee-do.

597
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,062
-Poor visibility was the cause.
-Let's change.

598
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,898
-Where's Mom?
-It crashed in a mountain near Mokpo.

599
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,193
-Why isn't Mom here?
-They told the control tower

600
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,696
that they'd circle due to poor visibility,

601
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:40,618
-But it disappeared around 3:40 p.m.
-Something urgent came up.

602
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,663
The police are at the site of the accident

603
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:49,084
but are having difficulties
because the plane crashed on a cliff.

604
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,129
The police speculate they crashed
into the mountain top

605
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,382
immediately after being disconnected
from the control center.

606
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,222
I didn't know back then…

607
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,603
what your absence at Dad's funeral meant.

608
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,441
But I came to understand
and appreciate what it meant

609
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,902
year after year as I grew older.

610
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,698
The more I understood,
the more hurt I was.

611
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,702
That's why…

612
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,998
it hurts the most now.

613
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,916
Do you get that?

614
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,384
What is it? You're uncomfortable
because I'm bringing Dad up again, right?

615
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,553
You always avoid talking about him.

616
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,724
You always try to forget him
as if he never existed.

617
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,311
You have

618
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,815
nothing but longing for your dad, right?

619
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,778
Not I.

620
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,949
I'm filled with resentment.

621
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,285
I always was as I raised you.

622
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,414
I had to avoid it to survive

623
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,166
and forget in order to live.

624
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,803
Fine.

625
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,390
I won't seek your understanding anymore.

626
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:32,980
But don't criticize my efforts of avoiding
and trying to forget.

627
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,984
That's how I'm enduring.

628
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,130
What brings you here?

629
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,885
It was great. You looked really cool.

630
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,386
All I could see was you.

631
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,512
What do you mean?

632
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,308
You'll look cool. And you'll do well.

633
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,643
And all I'll see is you.

634
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,231
I'm sorry that I can't make it.

635
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,027
This isn't right.

636
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,946
I'm going to tear up.

637
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,073
Take it.

638
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,202
I can't go physically,
but my heart will be there.

639
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,918
Thanks for coming.

640
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,703
Back Yi-jin speaking.

641
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,581
Hey, Yi-jin. It's me, Ji-woong.

642
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,875
Just because.

643
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,170
I needed…

644
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,591
the courage to stand up again.

645
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,636
Our band's annual concert is coming up.

646
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,055
I wanted to ask Yu-rim out
during the concert,

647
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,516
but she can't make it
because of her training.

648
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,436
I see. That's good.
Girls hate that kind of stuff.

649
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,440
I really wanted her to come
even if she did hate it.

650
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,569
I wanted to show her…

651
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,156
that at least on stage,
I can do something better than others.

652
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,368
I really wanted to show her.

653
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,247
Goodness. I get you. What a shame.

654
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,456
Come on.

655
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,750
I'm tired too. Bye.

656
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,503
High school drama
is for high schoolers. I'm an adult.

657
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:06,633
Seriously, these teenagers.
I should have become a teacher.

658
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,101
Hee-do.

659
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,361
What's wrong?

660
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,242
My mom threw away the chairs.

661
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,538
The chairs my dad made.

662
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,750
My mom threw them away.

663
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,046
I can't find them. They're gone.

664
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,762
Let's look for them.
We'll look together. Don't cry.

665
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,143
Don't cry.

666
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,234
There are three chairs
and one is broken. Have you seen them?

667
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,819
No, I haven't.

668
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,614
-Thank you.
-Sure.

669
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,284
AHYEON SUPERMARKET

670
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,036
I think they took it away already.

671
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,789
Let's stop.

672
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,876
Are you okay?

673
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,258
I wasn't crying,
but I started to cry because I saw you.

674
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,136
It's your fault.

675
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,473
Did you two get into a big fight?

676
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,557
Yes.

677
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,520
It was big enough to be named something.

678
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,231
Something for the history books.

679
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,584
During Sin Chang-won's news flash,

680
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,714
Jae-kyung looked incredibly cool.

681
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,634
It was the first time
since I joined the studio that I thought…

682
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,222
"I want to be like her."

683
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,267
But after coming to know

684
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,271
that moment caused you
to be sad, I'm torn.

685
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:31,236
Because behind her professionalism
are your heartaches.

686
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,951
This is strange.

687
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,835
They were heartaches for me,

688
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,297
but my mom made you dream.

689
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,093
That's…

690
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,474
kind of nice in itself.

691
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,161
About the chairs…

692
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,915
Why don't you make
the same ones your dad made?

693
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,336
I'm sure he'd like that too.

694
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,715
Hey. You're that kid from before.

695
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,593
I'm sorry I couldn't come that day.

696
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,886
Did you wait long?

697
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,222
About an hour.
You weren't coming, so I left.

698
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,266
Is that what you needed to be fixed?

699
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,522
-It's my lesson fee.
-What?

700
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,400
I want to learn how to make chairs.

701
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,321
There's a chair that I want to make.

702
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,698
Please teach me.

703
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,787
Does your training start tomorrow?
When will you be back…

704
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,883
Allez.

705
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,179
Allez.

706
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,103
-You can do it!
-Let's go!

707
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,401
Even if they're only a few years apart,

708
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,195
fencing styles change by generation.

709
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,241
It's mutually beneficial
if high schoolers train

710
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,701
with college kids.

711
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,539
I'm sorry, what? Are they
your run-of-the-mill high schoolers?

712
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,042
Do you have anyone who ranks
higher than Yu-rim or Hee-do?

713
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,590
Realistically, you're not training
with high schoolers.

714
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,135
They're way up there.
They're world-class talent.

715
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,970
That's with whom you're training.

716
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,766
I'm grateful. It's all thanks to you.

717
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,060
You punk…

718
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,607
-Thank you for today.
-Sure. See you.

719
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,691
Yes, ma'am.

720
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,902
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

721
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,029
-Let's go.
-Okay.

722
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,741
Mr. Back. What brings you here?

723
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,992
Are you here for a story?

724
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,785
No, not a story.

725
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,080
If you don't mind,
may I take the two of them?

726
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,212
I'm in the middle of editing
the documentary

727
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,049
and need some backup interviews
from them both.

728
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,218
-We have training in the morning.
-What's going on?

729
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,056
Take them.
They don't have any tournaments coming up.

730
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,308
Thank you for your understanding.

731
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,851
When is it going to air?

732
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,938
Am I in it at all?

733
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:57,484
Well, you gave us such a great interview,

734
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,735
you'll be in it for sure.

735
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,362
Really?

736
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,030
I'm used to being on TV.

737
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,075
-Work hard.
-Thank you. Have a nice day.

738
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,534
-Bye.
-Bye.

739
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,827
-See you.
-Bye.

740
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,373
-Goodbye.
-We'll see you later.

741
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,793
What's up? What extra shoots?

742
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,127
I was lying.

743
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,881
-We're going to Ji-woong's concert.
-What?

744
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,385
-You came to take us there?
-Yes. Let's hurry up.

745
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,137
Thanks! You're the absolute best
in the whole world!

746
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,598
-Liar.
-Yes, I'm lying.

747
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,311
I want to reach the place

748
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:37,065
Filled with blinding light

749
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,735
The pieces that passed by yesterday

750
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,614
Become dust and scatter today

751
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:51,246
The cool breeze
I'm on a trip

752
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,874
Follow the secretive light of the galaxy

753
00:54:54,958 --> 00:55:01,172
That world filled with sparkling dreams

754
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:12,559
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

755
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,185
Let's go a bit further

756
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,191
The world we've been waiting for

757
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:24,487
Is becoming clearer

758
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,867
The pieces that passed by yesterday

759
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,704
Become dust and scatter today

760
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:39,627
The cool breeze
I'm on a trip

761
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,048
Follow the secretive light of the galaxy

762
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:49,012
That world filled with sparkling dreams

763
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:53,558
It's beckoning me

764
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,477
Let's go a bit further

765
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,522
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

766
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,736
-Encore!
-Encore!

767
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,030
Hey!

768
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:12,035
-Encore!
-Encore!

769
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,080
-Great job everyone.
-The crowd went wild.

770
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,039
Hey.

771
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,208
I have to do well.

772
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,504
We have to do very well.
Amazingly well. Got that?

773
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,671
Yes.

774
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,257
Jeez!

775
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,093
So-yeong. The concert isn't over yet.

776
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,346
Weren't you and Min-ji over?
Why is she here?

777
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,601
So-yeong! I know nothing about that!

778
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,560
Shoot.

779
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,729
Sorry, but I can't do the encore.

780
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,898
Hey! Are you insane?

781
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,401
Yes, I am. My girlfriend
is more important than the performance.

782
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,946
-Sorry.
-Hey!

783
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,572
What? What is it?

784
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,158
Hey, Jungle Prince.

785
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,203
Are you even listening to each other?

786
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,831
-Who are you?
-What's that?

787
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,125
The 14th guitarist, Back Yi-jin.

788
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,169
How can you call yourselves a band?

789
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,172
Grab the guitar.

790
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,674
We need a guitarist.

791
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,801
-What?
-Hey. Take off your uniform.

792
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,720
Put that on. It's our stage costume.

793
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,139
What do you mean?

794
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,101
Our guitarist took off.

795
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,895
You hear them asking for an encore?
We have to go back.

796
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,273
We will sing
our signature song, "Starlight".

797
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,066
Just fill in for one song.

798
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,404
I graduated three years ago.
There's no way I remember it.

799
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,448
I don't. I can't do it. No way.

800
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,408
How will we perform without a guitar?

801
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,702
You may not remember, but your hands will.

802
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,829
Trust me.

803
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,416
The Jungle Prince's reputation
is on the line.

804
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,002
Sir. Here's my uniform.

805
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,509
-Encore!
-Encore!

806
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:58,349
-Encore!
-Encore!

807
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,477
-Thank you.
-Encore!

808
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,981
For our encore performance,
we'll sing "Starlight",

809
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,359
which represents
the Jungle Prince's 20-year history.

810
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,155
SOUL
JUNGLE PRINCE IS THE BEST

811
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,615
I WISH THE TEACHER HAD JI-WOONG'S FACE

812
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,164
What the? Isn't that Yi-jin?

813
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,043
Why is he up there?
He's wearing a uniform too.

814
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:33,051
We light everyone
Shine on each other

815
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:40,058
The sad expressions will soon disappear

816
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,601
Remember

817
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,771
We shine more

818
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:50,401
Than anything else

819
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,779
I CAN'T LEAVE SCHOOL WITHOUT YOU, YI-JIN
MARRY ME, YI-JIN

820
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,155
JUNGLE PRINCE IS HERE

821
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:07,210
You are my starlight
You are my sunshine

822
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:13,800
Whatever you want
You're the one shining on me

823
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:19,389
Yes, that's you

824
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,155
The boy who was trapped
inside the old tapes

825
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,701
is standing before me now.

826
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,348
Their guitarist ran away.

827
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,183
-Yi-jin.
-Yes?

828
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,144
What class were you in your senior year?

829
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,022
Me? In class six.

830
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,234
Back Yi-jin from class six.

831
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,778
I'm Na Hee-do from class three.

832
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,490
Let's hang out together.

833
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,751
Follow the secretive light of the galaxy

834
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:36,299
That world filled with sparkling dreams

835
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:41,638
It's beckoning me

836
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,223
Let's go a bit further

837
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:46,934
You're awesome!

838
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,812
You're so cool!

839
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,774
I'd like to say something

840
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,818
I've been preparing for a while.

841
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,031
I wanted to be special to many people.

842
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,117
I wanted attention.

843
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,537
That was the most important.

844
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,872
However…

845
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,001
I've found something more important.

846
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,923
If I can become special
to just one person,

847
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,133
I'd want nothing more.

848
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,900
I can do this.

849
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,757
Ko Yu-rim.

850
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,802
I like you.

851
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,811
Will you go out with me?

852
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:37,170
The pieces that passed by yesterday

853
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,924
Become dust and scatter today

854
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,010
Come on!

855
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,056
I can't do that again.

856
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,434
You played the guitar
in front of all those people.

857
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,561
Can't you do this one thing for me?

858
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,856
Listening to that tape
really cheered me up.

859
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,066
Oh, my gosh!

860
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,655
Hey. What are you doing here?

861
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,616
Listening to FM Date.

862
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,534
They won't let us during study sessions.

863
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,995
Wait. Why are you here, Yi-jin?

864
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,541
Forget that.
Why are you wearing a uniform?

865
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,169
Why do you think? It was all Ji-woong.

866
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,837
Didn't you go watch him?

867
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,506
Oh, that…

868
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,927
I truly love music, you see.

869
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,846
I didn't go because of my love.

870
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,933
Whatever. Give me the script
from an old broadcast.

871
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:35,561
I want to hear Yi-jin read it live.

872
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,730
You're going to do a reading?

873
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,857
Sounds fun.

874
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,068
BROADCASTING CLUB

875
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,116
The college entrance exam is coming up.

876
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,161
Hang in there. You can do it.

877
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,997
But can we really do it?

878
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,626
Sometimes, saying that we can do something

879
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,671
can be more discouraging.

880
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:06,217
Content like this needs to be aired.

881
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,890
We haven't learned about a world
in which you don't have to do well

882
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,643
-and can fail.
-What is it?

883
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,312
-Is that a mistake?
-What? A mistake?

884
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,898
Still, let's do the most we can.

885
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,733
Let's do our best.

886
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,904
But I still hope that even if we fail,

887
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:30,241
we'll be strong enough

888
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,327
to get back up again.

889
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,331
Look. Fireworks.

890
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,293
-Look.
-Where?

891
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,213
They're so pretty. Where is that from?

892
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,382
There's a festival at the district office.

893
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,510
What are you all doing here?

894
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,472
What's going on here?

895
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,850
-I guess he did it.
-I guess so.

896
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,060
Did what?

897
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,646
We're going out.

898
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,564
You what?

899
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,233
Thanks for everything, Yi-jin.

900
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,695
Wait a second. I'm not that dense.

901
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,323
Naturally, I knew
that Ji-woong liked Yu-rim.

902
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,701
But Yu-rim. You meant it too?

903
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,953
How could you go from Ryder to Ji-woong?

904
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,204
What do you see in him?

905
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:21,167
Well, he's doesn't have
the standard good looks,

906
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,377
but he's my type.

907
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,547
What the heck? What?

908
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,633
-Unbelievable…
-It's none of your business.

909
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,884
Watch the fireworks.

910
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,803
Life is long and fireworks are short.

911
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,601
-Let's go watch too.
-Okay.

912
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,904
I feel like the entire world
is blessing our new beginning.

913
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,073
Give me a freaking break.

914
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,908
Exactly. Who cares?

915
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,701
Hey.

916
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,288
Seriously. I love your jokes.

917
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,999
Thanks for calling it a joke.

918
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:08,631
They're so pretty. I'm so happy.

919
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,719
Thanks…

920
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,681
for gifting me a day like today.

921
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,981
They're really pretty.

922
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,025
Look.

923
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,538
PUT YOUR NAME DOWN IF YOU WANT A COPY.
FROM JI-WOONG.

924
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,674
HEE-DO

925
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:52,967
HEE-DO, SEUNG-WAN, YU-RIM

926
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,301
HEE-DO

927
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,803
HEE-DO, SEUNG-WAN, YU-RIM

928
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:56,971
HEE-DO

929
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,267
HEE-DO, SEUNG-WAN, YU-RIM

930
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,394
HEE-DO

931
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,327
YI-JIN

932
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:27,043
YI-JIN

933
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,886
-Gosh.
-Careful.

934
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,472
-Gosh.
-Right there.

935
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,018
How long do we dry it?

936
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,519
For about an hour.

937
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,898
-We have to sand it again once it dries.
-Again?

938
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,820
It's not as easy as I thought.

939
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,949
When did my dad learn--

940
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,375
Excuse me. What's with those chairs?

941
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,921
Why are they here?

942
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,130
Oh, that?

943
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,842
Do you know Shin Jae-kyung?
The newscaster.

944
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,594
She dropped them off.

945
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,514
They must mean a lot to her.

946
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,724
She had so many requests.

947
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:27,436
The legs were broken.
It took forever to reattach them.

948
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,651
When?

949
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,654
When did she drop them off?

950
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,457
What took you so long? Get dressed.

951
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,167
What?

952
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,337
Where are we going?

953
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,506
Did you forget?
You put it on the calendar.

954
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,299
Your dad's cemetery.

955
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:07,893
What do I wear? Should I wear black?

956
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,937
Whatever's comfortable.

957
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,439
Okay.

958
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,313
Mom.

959
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:44,073
Mom. Are you crying?

960
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,295
Mom.

961
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,524
Hee-do.

962
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,987
Are you really

963
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,699
still 13 years old?

964
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,372
I wanted…

965
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,625
to tell you

966
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,962
once you were all grown up.

967
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,550
The…

968
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:47,845
The truth is…

969
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:54,560
I miss your dad so very much.

970
01:11:57,521 --> 01:12:00,190
I miss him so much, Hee-do.

971
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,404
Mom…

972
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,953
Mom. I…

973
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,336
I miss Dad a lot too.

974
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,681
They finished their colonoscopies,

975
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,975
so your mom and grandma
should be back soon.

976
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,143
Thank you.

977
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,000
Mom.

978
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,962
Mom.

979
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,635
Yes?

980
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,929
Hee-do?

981
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:55,806
It's Mom.

982
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,101
I'm here.

983
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,478
Mom.

984
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,398
Are you okay?

985
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,775
Yes.

986
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,196
I'm fine.

987
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,867
Don't go anywhere.

988
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,245
Don't go.

989
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,790
Stay with me.

990
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,711
I will.

991
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,007
I left you alone

992
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,761
way too much when you were young.

993
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,100
It's okay, Mom.

994
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:43,729
Live a long, long life…

995
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,194
by my side.

996
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,706
I love you…

997
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:04,917
Mom.

998
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,839
Is it because of the crack
that formed when they broke?

999
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,842
Everything started to change slowly.

1000
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,720
-One. Two.
-Actions speak louder than words.

1001
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:17,971
You did the right thing.

1002
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,848
I'm quite impressed, Hee-do.

1003
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:23,393
You said your life was boring.
Look what fun trouble you're in.

1004
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,895
I'm right again this time.

1005
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,481
What would you like to do
before the world ends?

1006
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,442
-You can do this!
-You can do this!

1007
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,069
-Good luck!
-I guess

1008
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:34,404
I also wanted a change for myself.

1009
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,740
I want to stay by your side

1010
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,617
and watch you grow into a great person.

1011
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,868
Reporter Back Yi-jin?

1012
