1
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,902
It's from Dad. Open it.

2
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,029
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,915
Didn't you tell him that I quit ballet?

4
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,374
You tell him.

5
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,127
When is he coming back?

6
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,046
He'll have to quarantine for two weeks

7
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,422
and again when he goes back.

8
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,801
He can't come. He'll lose a month.

9
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,555
He doesn't know what I'm into now.
How disappointing.

10
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,643
Why are you disappointed?
I didn't even have a dad at your age.

11
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,354
I'll help you.

12
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,023
I want to try painting too.

13
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,362
This is the problem
with not living in apartments.

14
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,322
It's too high maintenance.

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,828
You're doing well just as I taught you.

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,496
You catch on quickly.

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,457
I improve quickly
with things like this, but…

18
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,048
Min-chae. Tell me the truth.

19
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,968
Why do you want to quit ballet?

20
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,638
I try hard but I don't improve.

21
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,349
So? Is it not fun anymore?

22
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,731
Do you…

23
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,028
think your skills improve
consistently like this, right?

24
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,822
They don't.

25
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:40,076
Your skills don't improve consistently
but in steps.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
Like this.

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,955
And when people hit a wall

28
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:48,501
here, here, and here,
they want to give up.

29
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,628
Once they get past this corner,

30
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,048
they'll improve exponentially,
but they don't realize it.

31
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,800
Why not?

32
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:03,182
Because they think this will last forever.

33
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,476
Is that true?

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,521
Of course, it is. I'm living proof.

35
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,775
Think about it.

36
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,863
Did you enjoy ballet or the compliments?

37
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,035
If you liked the compliments,
you can quit.

38
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,787
But if you liked ballet,

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,665
think it over again.

40
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,794
How do you know things like that?

41
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,048
My dad taught me. What about it?

42
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,598
My gosh. How long has it been?

43
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,391
It's cool seeing you abroad.

44
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,685
I know. It's been too long.

45
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,270
How long have you been in Paris?

46
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,231
-About six months.
-What?

47
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,442
Hee-do was bored,
so I wanted her to pick up a hobby.

48
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,819
Hello. I'm Hee-do.

49
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,737
Hi there.

50
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,784
Hee-do.

51
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,579
"En garde" means to take
the position to get ready.

52
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,749
You get in position before fighting.

53
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,505
-Prepare to fight.
-Exactly.

54
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,508
And prêtes and allez mean,

55
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,510
"Ready? Go."

56
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,512
-Prêtes and allez?
-Yes.

57
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,224
Prêtes? Allez. Then you fight.

58
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,726
Can you do it?

59
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,061
-Yes.
-Here.

60
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,815
You can do it, right?

61
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,192
Okay.

62
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,867
We will now begin
the women's fencing finals

63
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,495
at the Asian Games in Gyeongju.

64
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,670
We will now begin
the women's fencing finals

65
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,922
at the Asian Games in Gyeongju.

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,103
En garde. Prêtes?

67
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,439
Allez.

68
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,358
-Attaque. Touche.
-A score by Ko Yu-rim.

69
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,404
Ko Yu-rim scores the first point
of the final match.

70
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,949
-She's good.
-Hey, scoot over.

71
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,203
-Okay?
-Na Hee-do.

72
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,872
STUDENT BUS PASS

73
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,582
No more bets after this line.

74
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,250
KO YU-RIM, NA HEE-DO

75
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,086
-Who did you bet your 1,000 won on?
-Hee-do.

76
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,213
Not on Yu-rim?

77
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,132
I'm betting my everything…

78
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,302
on Yu-rim.

79
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,221
Prêtes? Allez.

80
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,601
Attaque. Touche. Point.

81
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,568
Ko Yu-rim was quicker this time as well.
It's three-zero.

82
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,988
-Na Hee-do looks quite nervous.
-Attaque. Touche. Point.

83
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,460
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

84
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,795
So he's a referee.

85
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,630
En garde.

86
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,799
Prêtes? Allez.

87
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,517
-Attaque. Touche. Point.
-Na Hee-do. Good concentration.

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,728
Block and stab.
Na Hee-do scored her first point.

89
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,905
You are very good.

90
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,574
Did you come to France with your dad?

91
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,870
With my mom as well. My mom is…

92
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,541
Daddy, what's a correspondent in French?

93
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,711
I'm not sure. I'm not very good at French.

94
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,049
My mom is a journalist.

95
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,385
She's the one who taught me French.

96
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,595
Well, it's fantastic.

97
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,347
See you tomorrow.

98
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,390
Okay.

99
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,517
Bye.

100
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,063
-Dad.
-Yes?

101
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,983
Can I continue fencing
when we go back to Korea?

102
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,192
It's so much fun.

103
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,611
Of course. As much as you want.

104
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,613
If you try hard,

105
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,450
you can compete internationally
like in the Asian Games.

106
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,535
-Really?
-Yes.

107
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,663
Can I become like Yang Chan-mi?

108
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes! Na Hee-do scores again.

109
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,546
-That's a great but difficult attack.
-That's right.

110
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,591
Na Hee-do is a great fencer.

111
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,552
You train Na Hee-do yourself.

112
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,804
What is she like normally?

113
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:56,517
Na Hee-do doesn't know how to back down.

114
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,147
She does everything I teach her
and absorbs them like a sponge.

115
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,483
-She's a human sponge.
-I see.

116
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,195
No one can stop her.

117
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,905
-I see.
-That's right.

118
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,202
En garde. Prêtes?

119
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,413
Allez.

120
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,754
Don't look away, Hee-do.

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,547
Focus more.

122
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,799
Extend your sword completely.

123
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,011
Now!

124
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,559
Dad, I won the gold medal.

125
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,152
Hee-do, you're amazing.

126
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,530
People say I'm a prodigy.

127
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,822
That's good, right?

128
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,699
It's a huge compliment.

129
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,120
But tell me.
Do you like being complimented

130
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,497
or do you like fencing?

131
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,583
Well, I like both.

132
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,837
Later on, even if things
don't go your way with fencing,

133
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,381
remember this one thing.

134
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,052
Your skill doesn't improve consistently

135
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,720
but in steps.

136
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,266
Hop, hop.

137
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,892
Understand?

138
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,187
Well, not really.

139
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,442
But Daddy, I'll win the gold medal
at the next competition too,

140
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,612
so you have to get all better
and come watch, okay?

141
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,365
Promise.

142
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,580
Okay, Hee-do. I promise.

143
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,042
Dad could not keep his promise.

144
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,348
Grandma.

145
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,021
I want to change. I don't like this dress.

146
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,366
-Run!
-I couldn't keep my promise either.

147
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,455
My promise to win another gold medal.

148
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,885
I've never seen anyone try as hard as you,
but not improve.

149
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,387
Are you stupid or foolish?

150
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,724
Let me give you advice as your coach.

151
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,477
You have no talent.

152
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,730
Seriously consider quitting.

153
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,232
I won't quit.

154
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,110
It's a skill to know to give up.

155
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,989
I won't quit!

156
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,709
Halte. Attaque. Touche. Point.

157
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,467
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

158
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,177
-Good!
-Ko Yu-rim!

159
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,679
-Ko Yu-rim!
-You're doing great

160
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,517
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

161
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,477
Why should I quit fencing?

162
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,605
I've fenced all my life!

163
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,066
This is my everything!
How could you tell me to stop?

164
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,112
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

165
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,407
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

166
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,451
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

167
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,663
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

168
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,458
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Ko Yu-rim!

169
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,670
Ko Yu-rim! You're doing great!
Keep it up and you'll win!

170
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,512
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

171
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,474
-Halte.
-Na Hee-do scores again.

172
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,519
She's down by only one point.

173
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,230
Did you see that?
Did you? Did you see that?

174
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,859
Camera flashes went off from the crowd.

175
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,777
The spectators have shitty etiquette.

176
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,781
-Looks like her vision was impaired.
-Line check!

177
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,659
Ko Yu-rim is making an appeal.

178
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,702
Yes.

179
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,495
SHITTY ETIQUETTE

180
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,414
What?

181
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,085
Yes. That's right.

182
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,713
They have shitty etiquette.

183
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,425
Prêtes? Allez.

184
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,569
Attaque. Touche. Point.

185
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,905
That's it, Ko Yu-rim!

186
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,492
It's 14 to 12. Ko Yu-rim pulls away again.

187
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,411
-That's a gold medalist. This is fun.
-Yes.

188
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,997
-That's right.
-This is worthy of the finals.

189
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,207
Yes, it is.

190
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,380
Na Hee-do looks like
she has a lot on her mind.

191
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,550
Ko Yu-rim has one point left
between her and the gold medal.

192
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,678
But two points
can easily be won or lost in fencing.

193
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,058
Ko Yu-rim needs to defend well.
Na Hee-do, you!

194
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,019
This is your last chance!

195
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,367
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER NA HEE-DO

196
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,328
Everyone told me to quit fencing.

197
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,121
Why do you fence?

198
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,249
To prove you're not talented?

199
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,500
I bet you're not very good.

200
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,336
The fact that I don't know who you are
in this small fencing community

201
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,713
means you're nothing.

202
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,050
But I didn't.

203
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,890
Skills don't improve consistently

204
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,934
but in steps.

205
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,521
Hop, hop.

206
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,106
Understand?

207
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,492
Why?

208
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,203
Because I still find it so much fun.

209
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,883
En garde.

210
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,888
Prêtes? Allez.

211
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,282
Yes, Hee-do!

212
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,619
It's 14 to 13!
Na Hee-do is right on her heels.

213
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,746
She's showing incredible energy.

214
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,041
What did I tell you?
I told you she was persistent.

215
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,210
She eats three bowls of rice a day.

216
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,546
She's a big eater.

217
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,602
Ko Yu-rim's sword broke.

218
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,480
How will this affect the match?

219
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,273
The score is 14 to 13.

220
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,777
Ko Yu-rim is still leading by one.

221
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,709
You memorized
the questions for Na Hee-do, right?

222
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,419
Yes.

223
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,176
Do you think her sword breaking
will shake Ko Yu-rim?

224
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,429
It wasn't her sword that broke,
but her confidence.

225
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,524
En garde.

226
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,779
Prêtes?

227
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,864
Allez.

228
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,716
Attaque. Touche. Point.

229
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,095
-Na Hee-do!
-Yes. Na Hee-do.

230
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,389
She has tied it up at 14 to 14.

231
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,433
We are back to square one.

232
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,062
Look at Na Hee-do refusing to back down
from a gold medalist.

233
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,231
She won't let it end like this!

234
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,900
-She's not your average girl.
-Yes?

235
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,986
She really isn't your average girl.

236
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,621
Yu-rim, I can tell.

237
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,796
Today is the day

238
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,340
my dream will come true.

239
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,178
My dream of becoming your rival.

240
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,316
Let's go!

241
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,916
En garde.

242
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,376
Prêtes? Allez.

243
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,839
Halte.

244
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,478
Attaque. Attaque. Touche.

245
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,063
Point.

246
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,657
Na Hee-do defeated
the gold medalist Ko Yu-rim

247
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,742
and took the gold medal
at these Asian Games.

248
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,829
-Na Hee-do wins gold!
-This is amazing.

249
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,165
Na Hee-do wins gold! Na Hee-do!

250
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,334
What did I tell you? I said she'd do it!

251
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,504
-Yes.
-I knew you'd pull it off!

252
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,840
I knew she'd win.

253
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,676
Na Hee-do wins gold!

254
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,888
-An amazing comeback!
-Na Hee-do won the gold medal!

255
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,181
That was beautiful.

256
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,445
And now it's Korea's turn to attack.

257
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,908
A long pass to Seo Jeong-won
followed by a short pass.

258
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,951
He centers the ball to Choi Yong-soo.

259
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,120
Almost, but not quite.

260
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,583
YOU CAN DO IT
FENCING GENIUS NA HEE-DO

261
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,169
You showed them, Hee-do.

262
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,837
Who bet on Hee-do?

263
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,547
-Me.
-Yes!

264
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,884
Ji-woong. We bet 1,000
and won 4,000. Awesome.

265
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,557
My 1,000 won.

266
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,645
Yu-rim! How could you lose? Darn it.

267
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,564
It's not like she wanted to lose.

268
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,364
What's wrong with Yu-rim?

269
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,877
-Ko Yu-rim is appealing to the ref.
-No. Approche attaque, non.

270
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,507
I think she's insisting she was faster.

271
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,093
Here's the video in slow motion.

272
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:05,597
-It's difficult to say based on the video.
-I see.

273
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,893
The referee's decision is absolute
as Fencing is a speedy sport.

274
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,395
That is exactly why

275
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,523
I always insist that fencing needs
to implement video reviews.

276
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,402
I see. It is quite frustrating
from Ko Yu-rim's standpoint.

277
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,613
Was it a bad call?

278
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,866
Who knows?
Anyway, prepare to interview Na Hee-do.

279
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,244
Okay.

280
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,675
Hey. Good work.

281
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,554
Darn it.

282
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:52,352
Na Hee-do.
Please come with me for your interview.

283
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,241
Here's Na Hee-do,
the Fencing gold medalist

284
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,035
at the Gyeongju Asian Games.

285
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,337
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

286
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,340
How does it feel to win
your first international gold medal?

287
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:28,513
I'm very happy.
This is the moment I've been dreaming of.

288
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,725
And…

289
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,817
I can't stop shaking. Gosh.

290
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,363
It must be incomparable to anything
as it's your first gold medal for Korea.

291
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,491
Who, if anyone, comes to mind right now?

292
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,789
My dad.

293
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,917
He would have been happy.

294
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,628
And that makes me happy.

295
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,927
That was a fierce competition.
Which moment was the toughest?

296
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,556
Well…

297
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,023
Right now, I think.

298
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,702
That was Na Hee-do,
the gold medalist fencer

299
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,746
at the Gyeongju Asian Games.

300
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,373
Was it really a bad call?

301
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,543
You've gained a lot of interest
in sports lately.

302
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,002
Was it a bad call?

303
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,672
You're experts. You should know.

304
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,510
Based on that video,
it looks like Ko Yu-rim was faster.

305
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:53,140
But you can't see exactly when
Na Hee-do's blade touched her.

306
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,725
Ko Yu-rim's attack was a contre-attaque.

307
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,561
Na Hee-do's was an attaque.

308
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,855
-What you see--
-Whatever. Was it a bad call?

309
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,525
It may have been and it may not have been.

310
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,735
Okay. Got it. Okay.

311
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,321
Sir. Viewers are calling like crazy
and throwing a fit

312
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,448
that the ref made a bad call in fencing.

313
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,701
Everyone takes it out on the TV station.

314
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,496
The online community is furious,
saying it was a bad call.

315
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,583
Why are they so upset?
Korea won the gold anyway.

316
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,877
But Ko Yu-rim is a star.

317
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,423
Plus, she's a good girl from a poor family
who won the gold medal.

318
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,925
She's young and pretty to boot.

319
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,802
They want to protect her.

320
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,014
Then what about Na Hee-do?

321
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,975
She's a no-name nuisance

322
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,977
who's getting in Ko Yu-rim's way.

323
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,605
I can see why the people are upset.

324
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,734
This is going to blow up.

325
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,503
It will blow up.

326
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,174
Then we should build it up.
What happened with soccer?

327
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,010
It just ended. Korea lost zero to one.

328
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,015
Keep airing the video of
the controversial part in slow motion.

329
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,226
Drop the Asian Games highlights

330
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,394
and air the fencing press conference live.

331
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,690
Hey. Let's use this to get our ratings up.

332
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,527
Today's focus isn't the Korea-Japan
soccer match, but fencing.

333
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,404
These LBS punks.

334
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,406
There's a major dispute over the ruling,

335
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,284
and Ko Yu-rim even cried for us.

336
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,203
How perfect is that?

337
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,247
This is our chance.

338
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,415
NATIONAL FENCING TEAM PRESS CONFERENCE

339
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,705
This question is for Na Hee-do.

340
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,208
The opinions are split
regarding the final decision.

341
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,752
Do you truly believe
it was not a bad call?

342
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,136
It was not a bad call.

343
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,932
Ko Yu-rim. You cried on the podium.

344
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,851
Did you believe it was a bad call?

345
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,271
-Please don't ask things like--
-It was a bad call.

346
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,066
I believe I was faster.

347
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,490
Na Hee-do.

348
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,619
If it was not a bad call,
why is there this controversy?

349
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,459
Are you saying
my winning is a controversy?

350
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,920
I'm asking about the possibility
that you won on a bad call.

351
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,422
There is no possibility.

352
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,592
I was definitely faster.

353
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,137
The referee saw and ruled the same.

354
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,930
Please, don't ask about the rulings--

355
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,099
Do you have
a personal relationship with him?

356
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,395
Was I supposed to

357
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,981
throw this match?

358
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,152
Because everyone wanted
to see Ko Yu-rim win?

359
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,992
No. You can't say it like that.

360
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,670
We'll end the press conference now.

361
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,047
You claim innocence, right?

362
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,424
Do you really not know the referee?

363
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,927
If it was a bad call,
will you return the medal?

364
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,388
Don't you feel bad for Ko Yu-rim?

365
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,931
-Answer us!
-Say something!

366
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,519
There must be a reason behind such a call.

367
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,609
Say something!

368
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,429
-Na Hee-do!
-We're not done!

369
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,888
-Na Hee-do.
-Hey.

370
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,059
Ko Yu-rim, please give us a statement.

371
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,436
Follow them!

372
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,296
What have you done?

373
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,549
What was with that act?

374
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,553
You were the one acting.

375
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,056
The fencers know who was faster.

376
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,685
Let me make this clear. I was faster.

377
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,895
Really?

378
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,565
Then I must have bribed the ref
as the reporters say.

379
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:41,070
The federation, the national team,
everyone is hell-bent on making you win,

380
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,989
but I beat them all and bribed the ref.

381
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,282
Don't be sarcastic.

382
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,493
I'm the victim.

383
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,869
You're the victim?

384
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,166
Why are people doubting the decision?

385
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,671
The moment I won the gold medal,
you appealed to the ref

386
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,841
and cried on the podium.
That's why this happened.

387
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,635
How can I accept a bad call?

388
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,141
I was faster, but he said I lost.

389
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,937
I lost the gold medal
because of the ref's error.

390
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,315
How can I accept that?

391
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,445
You really…

392
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,158
believe you were faster.

393
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,751
But why are you deciding that

394
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,045
instead of the ref?

395
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,508
It's a fencer's right
to appeal a bad call.

396
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,885
It's the duty of a fencer
to accept the ref's call.

397
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,264
Do you know what you've done?

398
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,058
You denied the ref's call

399
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,979
and destroyed the value of the gold medal
I worked so hard for.

400
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,690
Because you refused to accept the result…

401
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,069
my gold medal…

402
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,489
has lost its honor.

403
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,498
Is that why you're angry?

404
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,713
Are you as mad as I am?
I had the gold medal stolen from me.

405
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,552
You think I stole the gold medal?

406
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,683
I'm the one who had it stolen from me.

407
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,978
And you stole it, Yu-rim.

408
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,780
Are you two out of your mind?

409
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,909
How can you do this in front of reporters?

410
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,713
Hee-do.

411
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,217
Get back here right now.
Is that how I taught you?

412
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,011
When did you teach me anything?

413
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,724
GYEONGJU ASIAN GAMES

414
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,353
What do you think about what occurred?

415
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,772
-Are you upset?
-Please give us a statement!

416
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,649
What about Na Hee-do?

417
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,359
Is Na Hee-do in there?

418
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,277
Where is Na Hee-do?

419
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,696
Ko Yu-rim! Please give us a minute.

420
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,991
-Ko Yu-rim! You're angry, aren't you?
-Are you mad?

421
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,786
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Please look this way!

422
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,996
-Ko Yu-rim!
-Please look this way!

423
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,298
Na Hee-do.
Do you really not know the referee?

424
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,841
You claim innocence, right?

425
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,594
If it was a bad call,
will you return the medal?

426
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,680
Don't you feel bad for Ko Yu-rim?

427
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,057
-Answer us!
-Say something!

428
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,477
There must be a reason behind such a call.

429
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,772
-Say something.
-Are you really innocent?

430
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,191
Do you know the ref?

431
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,819
-A question for Na Hee-do.
-Na Hee-do.

432
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,321
-Na Hee-do.
-There's a controversy about the ruling…

433
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,906
Do you know the referee personally?

434
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,701
I'm asking about the possibility
that you won on a bad call.

435
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,371
-Na Hee-do!
-Is Na Hee-do in there?

436
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,330
Na Hee-do!

437
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,335
PHARMACY

438
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,381
Hello. What would you like?

439
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,175
-I need something to calm my nerves.
-Give me a minute.

440
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,221
The fifth day of the Gyeongju Asian Games
has come to an end,

441
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,975
and many unexpected incidents occurred.

442
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,561
During the fencing finals held today,

443
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:45,898
Ko Yu-rim cried after having
the gold medal stripped from her hand.

444
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,736
The referee's final decision
determined the winner of the gold medal.

445
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,864
Many believe this decision was in error.

446
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,615
The public is saying

447
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,535
that Na Hee-do stole the gold medal.

448
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,203
Seo Jung-hyuk reports.

449
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,958
Na Hee-do puts down the gold medal
and leaves the press conference.

450
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,587
The coach was flustered
and Ko Yu-rim left as well.

451
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,047
Gosh, they look furious.

452
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,258
The gold medal, losing its owner
and its honor, fell to the floor.

453
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,386
The public is criticizing
Na Hee-do's attitude,

454
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,306
as being unbefitting
of a national athlete.

455
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,516
I'm Seo Jung-hyuk, with UBS News.

456
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,077
Tell me what you're unhappy with.

457
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,537
It's nothing.

458
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,791
Tell me.

459
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,502
Do you…

460
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,007
really think Na Hee-do
stole the gold medal as well?

461
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,886
I understand the public.

462
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,555
They wanted to watch Ko Yu-rim win,
but she lost.

463
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,391
But the news shouldn't do this.

464
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,729
The news relays the situation.
What's the problem?

465
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,191
It doesn't look like
we're simply relaying it.

466
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,571
-I feel like we instigate at times.
-You're mistaken.

467
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,407
Do you know why you're mistaken?

468
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,285
You failed to keep a distance
from the subject.

469
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,082
You know Na Hee-do.

470
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,008
A public figure must not get too close to
or too far from a civilian.

471
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,220
A journalist must maintain a distance
from the subject being covered.

472
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,988
The pharmacy.

473
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,884
Hello? That's my phone.
Is this the pharmacy?

474
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,385
I'll go pick it up now.

475
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,678
Where are you, Hee-do?

476
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,724
Where are you?

477
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,017
Yi-jin?

478
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,937
Hee-do.

479
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,314
Hello?

480
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,776
GEUMJANG GROCERY STORE

481
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,862
Excuse me. Where am I right now?

482
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,771
I was calling you nonstop.

483
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,651
Why do you have my phone?

484
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,905
Because I spoke to the pharmacist first.

485
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,160
Running away isn't the solution.

486
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,122
You're on the national team.

487
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,417
Do you think your attitude
at the press conference was acceptable?

488
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,211
You left without telling the team,
didn't you?

489
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,883
You know, you can be disciplined for this.

490
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,055
Are you done? Then leave.

491
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,561
I could have gotten my phone back myself,
so I won't thank you.

492
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,442
What will you do in a town
that you don't know?

493
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,281
I ran away because I didn't want
to hear that garbage. Don't you get it?

494
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,899
I told you not to follow me.

495
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,867
People say Yu-rim is a victim.

496
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,829
I think you're a victim too.

497
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,001
Even if the ref's decision was a bad call,

498
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,629
you're still a victim.

499
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,552
It wasn't a bad call.

500
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,446
Hold this.

501
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,164
I taught you, right?

502
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,333
Once I say, "Prêts? Allez," attack.

503
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,753
Prêts? Allez.

504
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,590
Why aren't you attacking?

505
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,883
Again.

506
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,885
Prêts?

507
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,679
Allez.

508
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,348
Who was faster?

509
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,226
You.

510
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,853
Again.

511
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,398
Prêts? Allez.

512
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,484
Who was faster?

513
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,741
Again.

514
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,209
Prêtes? Allez.

515
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,044
Allez.

516
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,631
Now?

517
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,678
Me.

518
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,183
Do you get it?

519
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,810
There's no way the fencers don't know.

520
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,315
Even if both lights go on simultaneously,
the fencers know.

521
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,946
I was faster than Yu-rim. I felt it.

522
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,329
Does that explain it?

523
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,873
-Who asked for an explanation?
-You're a reporter.

524
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,626
Would you have come here
looking for me otherwise?

525
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,544
What do you think?

526
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,591
Tell me.

527
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,766
You would have come.

528
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,851
Regardless.

529
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,107
As long as you know. Let's go back.

530
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,317
No.

531
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,611
I won't go.

532
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,280
I don't want to see anyone right now.

533
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,115
I want to be alone, so please leave.

534
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,703
You owe me a wish.

535
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,124
We made a bet last time when we fenced.

536
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,168
You lost. I won.

537
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,004
I'll use it now.

538
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,676
Your face was on the news
on every channel.

539
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,638
Don't cause any more trouble.

540
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,849
Let's go back, Hee-do.

541
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,439
This is my wish.

542
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,662
1999 GYEONGJU ASIAN GAMES

543
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,872
I'm Back Yi-jin, a reporter with UBS.

544
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,709
Would you tell me which room

545
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,837
the referee Alan Smith
from Australia is staying in?

546
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,715
We can't share our guests' information.

547
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,678
Can you connect me to his room then?
I need to talk to him.

548
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,724
I'm sorry, but he said
he wouldn't take any calls.

549
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,767
I'm sorry.

550
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,231
Wait. Sir.

551
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,257
Darn it.

552
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,027
Hello? It's me, Yi-jin.

553
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,072
I was just wondering.

554
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,033
Is Jung Hui-jin in charge of the airport?

555
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:10,207
Yes. I need some information
regarding people flying out.

556
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,002
You pull that crap
at the press conference,

557
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,921
then you leave and can't be reached.

558
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,257
Hey, Hee-do. Are you out of your mind?

559
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,636
Of course, not.
You wouldn't have done that if you were.

560
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,054
Hey.

561
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,390
Hey!

562
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,976
Do you two understand what you've done?

563
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,396
The news and the papers,
everyone's talking about you two.

564
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,524
How could you disgrace
Korean fencing like this?

565
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,444
At an international competition
with the world watching!

566
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,988
I'm sorry.

567
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,659
I don't want your apologies.

568
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,121
Both of you will leave
the training center right now.

569
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,374
You don't deserve to enjoy this.

570
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,710
You'll be disciplined,

571
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,172
so stay home quietly until then. Got that?

572
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,757
Seriously.

573
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,818
THE OWNER OF THE GOLD MEDAL
HAS BEEN SWITCHED

574
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,281
KO YU-RIM'S GOLD MEDAL STOLEN

575
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,409
THE OWNER OF THE GOLD MEDAL
HAS BEEN SWITCHED

576
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:47,781
The refs can't always be right.

577
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,825
Even if you were faster.

578
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,076
I was faster.

579
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,248
Sure. Even if that were true,

580
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,295
you should submit the ref's decision.

581
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,048
Your skills won't go anywhere.

582
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,677
-If you do better next time--
-There may not be a next time.

583
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,096
What if this was the last time?

584
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,143
As your dad,

585
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:21,565
I don't want my daughter to live
with such a heavy burden.

586
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,485
Of all the sports out there,

587
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,864
I chose fencing, an expensive sport.

588
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,410
I knew our family couldn't afford it,

589
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,746
but I threw a tantrum and insisted.

590
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,667
I feel bad and grateful about it

591
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,337
to you and Mom.

592
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,468
So I don't want to feel wronged
even for a moment.

593
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,642
Yu-rim. You're already the best.

594
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,021
Fence for yourself now.

595
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,773
Not for your family.

596
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,985
How can I remove my family?

597
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,988
My family is my everything.

598
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,455
I love you, Yu-rim.

599
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:25,837
So stop obsessing over Mom and me.

600
00:49:56,368 --> 00:50:01,540
The train will now stop
at Daejeon Station.

601
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:05,711
Farewell to all passengers who will be
getting off at the current station.

602
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,052
NOODLE SHOP

603
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,016
-Noodle soup please.
-Okay.

604
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,352
Extra broth please. It's so cold.

605
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,020
Let's have noodles.

606
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,232
The noodles at Daejeon Station
are really good. I'll get them.

607
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,192
What if the train takes off?

608
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,195
It won't. The train stands
at this station for a while.

609
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,449
You can be alone for a bit, right?

610
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,623
DAEJEON

611
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,144
Daddy. Please hurry.

612
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,375
Daddy isn't on yet.

613
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,336
Daddy!

614
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,812
Daddy!

615
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:53,109
Hee-do. Why are you crying?
I said I'd be right back.

616
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,363
I thought you didn't get on.

617
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,198
I thought you missed the train.

618
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,534
It's okay.

619
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:07,165
Come on.
I wouldn't go anywhere without you.

620
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,917
Stop.

621
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,840
Stop crying so that you can have
some yummy noodles.

622
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,686
How is it?

623
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,479
It's yummy.

624
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,899
Let me have some too.

625
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,335
Dad.

626
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,924
I won the gold medal.

627
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,850
GIMPO AIRPORT

628
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,872
Back Yi-jin speaking.

629
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,668
I'm in Seoul.

630
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:43,511
I'm sorry. I came because I really wanted
to get an interview with the referee.

631
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,557
I promise I'll get it.

632
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,989
I'll get off here.

633
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,577
Mr. Smith.

634
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,333
Tteokgalbi?

635
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,048
Podaegi.

636
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,690
Over here!

637
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,489
Hi.

638
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,494
I didn't know you'd be in Seoul.

639
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,122
I thought about it for a while
before beeping you.

640
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,543
I got kicked out of the training center.

641
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,795
You got kicked out?

642
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,175
I think I'm going to be disciplined.
They said to stand by.

643
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,427
How can you smile?

644
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,054
It was all a waste.

645
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,767
I prepared so hard for the Asian Games.

646
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,105
I didn't know it would end like this.

647
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,863
I don't know about decision disputes.

648
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,657
You're the gold medalist in beauty.

649
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,160
Congrats on your gold medal.

650
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,752
You really are nice.

651
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,381
Not to everyone.

652
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,550
Just so you know.

653
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,014
Thanks.

654
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,810
This is the most special medal I've won.

655
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,063
Of course, it's special.
Because you can win this without trying.

656
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,233
So don't be too down.

657
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,279
You've been a gold medalist
since the day you were born.

658
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,122
I need to get back.
My mom said to hurry home.

659
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,208
If my mother-in-law said that…
No, never mind.

660
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,133
Come down. Why did you go up there
with your bad ankle?

661
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,596
Grab onto my shoulder.
You may hurt your ankle if you jump.

662
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,901
Was that on purpose?

663
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,195
What do you mean, on purpose?

664
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,447
Be cute or pretty. Choose one.

665
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,366
Or you might drive me crazy.

666
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,286
Stop it.

667
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,209
A right-handed athlete
used her right hand.

668
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,214
I'm off.

669
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,007
I'll go with you.

670
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,912
The public is saying

671
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,248
that Na Hee-do stole the gold medal.

672
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,307
-Hello.
-You're working hard.

673
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,142
Have a seat.

674
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,022
-This is delicious.
-It sure is.

675
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,984
-…to revive the economy.
-Have another glass.

676
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,029
He begged the public to partake
in the efforts to overcome the IMF crisis.

677
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,157
Next on the news.

678
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,035
The referee's decision
during the fencing finals

679
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,705
during the Asian Games last night

680
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,290
is being disputed.

681
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,875
This has led to unreasonable assertions

682
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,211
such as claiming the referee was bribed.

683
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,798
We met with referee Smith,
who is at the center of the controversy.

684
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,842
Back Yi-jin has the exclusive.

685
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,179
ALAN SMITH, FEMALE FENCING FINALS REFEREE

686
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,406
Referee Smith asserted

687
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,242
that his decision at the match was fair.

688
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:26,331
The young athletes had to bear the weight
of overly emotional speculation.

689
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,585
What should have been the happiest moment
became a piercing wound.

690
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,587
I'm Back Yi-jin with UBS News.

691
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,506
Where did you move to?

692
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,425
Enjoy.

693
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,094
It's so hot out.

694
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,388
Don't get me started.

695
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,933
-Let's drink.
-Yes, let's drink.

696
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,528
Hey, miss. Why are you crying?

697
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,822
Is something wrong?

698
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,115
No, sir.

699
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,617
No?

700
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,952
Whatever it is,

701
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,622
have some soju and shake it off.

702
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,709
It's okay. I'm still in school.

703
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,586
You're in school?

704
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,715
-Wait. Isn't that her?
-What?

705
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:23,054
Wait. Aren't you the athlete Na Hee-do
from yesterday?

706
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,598
What? Na Hee-do?

707
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,143
-It is.
-The fencer from yesterday?

708
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,021
My goodness.

709
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,817
You must have been so hurt.

710
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,696
Life throws you some nasty curveballs,
doesn't it?

711
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,614
You've been through a lot.

712
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,574
Here. Have a drink.

713
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,411
-Hey.
-She's still in school.

714
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,622
I drank straight from the bottle
when I was in school.

715
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,001
Na Hee-do.

716
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,005
You were amazing
during the match yesterday.

717
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,633
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

718
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,262
Gosh.

719
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:10,226
It must have taken such hard work
to make it there.

720
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,396
You must have cried so much in secret

721
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,941
and suffered so much pain.

722
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,194
Goodness. You did great.

723
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,949
Please lead Korean fencing
going forward. Okay?

724
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,078
Why are you making her cry?

725
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:33,332
Ms. Yang! Bring her a bottle of soda!

726
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,084
It's on us.

727
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,502
-Okay.
-Okay.

728
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,588
-Hang in there.
-Gosh.

729
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:43,259
That interview wasn't because
I was too close.

730
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,679
The news criticizing her
went out yesterday

731
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,931
and we feigned innocence
as the public criticized her.

732
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,351
It was an improper attitude for the news.
That was why.

733
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,523
If you say I did it because I knew her,

734
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,401
I'd have nothing to say.

735
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,489
You did good.

736
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,327
You did good.

737
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,580
Remember how you felt
as you rushed to the airport today.

738
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,583
Congrats on your debut in the news.

739
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,629
Thank you.

740
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,050
You did good.

741
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,636
Thank you.

742
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,030
Nice. It's open.

743
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:14,392
Let me crash just for one night,
Seung-wan.

744
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,387
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL BROADCASTING CLUB

745
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,931
ANNOUNCER: BACK YI-JIN

746
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,780
At times you're sad as if
the whole world's turned its back on you.

747
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,991
But other times, you laugh your guts out.

748
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,870
Our friendships are always excessive,

749
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,290
we're helpless in the face of love,

750
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,334
and our failures are passionate.

751
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:27,048
Anxiety, grief, jokes,
and smiles come together

752
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,258
to form a strange and irregular shape.

753
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:34,472
Perhaps we're currently standing
at the center of our youths.

754
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,100
I know how much your growing pains hurt.

755
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,020
I understand.

756
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,816
Thank you for understanding,

757
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,902
Yi-jin.

758
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,388
Gosh. Why didn't they lock it?

759
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,730
Did he lock me in?

760
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,449
What about the bathroom?

761
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,832
Back Yi-jin speaking.

762
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,625
Yi-jin, it's me. Hee-do.

763
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:47,753
Hee-do?

764
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,298
You must have seen the news.

765
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,635
-If you want to thank me--
-That's not it.

766
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,221
I'm locked in the storage room
on the roof of my school.

767
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,348
Help me, Yi-jin.

768
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,100
You're locked in?

769
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,186
I came here
because I didn't want to go home.

770
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,897
But the security guard
locked the door from the outside.

771
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,484
Only Seung-wan
and Ji-woong know the combination,

772
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,319
but I don't know their numbers.

773
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,905
What do I do? Please help.

774
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,407
CONGRATULATIONS
NA HEE-DO GOLD, KO YU-RIM SILVER

775
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,829
Hello, Yi-jin.

776
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,789
What a surprise.

777
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,458
Have you been well?

778
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,753
Yes. Sorry for calling you at home.
I didn't have your pager number.

779
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,757
Did you have to bring him though?

780
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,259
My point exactly. Was this necessary?

781
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,844
Just tell him the combination.

782
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,013
We may need reinforcements.

783
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,015
We can't let the security guard catch us.

784
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,225
Also…

785
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:47,063
Hee-do can't be dragged into
any more controversies.

786
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,567
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

787
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,527
-Where is it?
-This way.

788
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,112
-There?
-Yes.

789
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,246
Stay calm.

790
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,207
Let's stay calm.

791
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,959
Stop thinking about the bathroom.

792
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,462
Stop thinking about
not thinking about the bathroom.

793
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:14,381
Stop thinking about the bathroom.

794
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,138
Think about something else.

795
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:38,447
YI-JIN LOVES DA-EUN

796
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:49,125
This is the bathroom window.
They rarely close it.

797
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,794
If one person goes through it
and opens another window,

798
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,754
we can go in that way.

799
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,299
Hold this.

800
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,014
Darn it. It's pretty high.

801
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,766
How do I get up there?

802
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,810
Please step on me to climb up there.

803
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,479
Hey. What are you doing?
You're the lightest one among us.

804
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,481
-You step on me--
-No!

805
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,276
How can I step on a high and mighty alum?

806
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,155
I'm so glad
I'm not in the broadcasting club.

807
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,825
Hey. What club are you in?

808
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,411
-The band.
-The Jungle Prince?

809
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,745
Yes.

810
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:31,667
Hey. There's something I need to tell you.

811
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,298
"Whatever you want…"

812
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,926
-You're the one who shines on me
-You're the one who shines on me

813
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:43,846
Hello, sir.

814
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,473
Stay down but go over there.

815
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,767
Move quickly. Get down.

816
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,270
Why were you in two clubs?

817
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,522
Here I go.

818
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,695
YI-JIN LOVES DA-EUN

819
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,996
It's just so cool, that's why.

820
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,498
You never brought me
to the broadcasting room before.

821
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,709
This is it. It's not much, is it?

822
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,506
Hold on. Are you recording this?

823
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,467
Yes. Because I want to remember.

824
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,686
It's three, four, seven, eight.

825
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,272
-Three.
-Four.

826
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,690
-Seven.
-Eight.

827
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,446
Hee-do.

828
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,240
I love you, Yi-jin.

829
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,201
Please remember this moment.

830
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,870
I love you so much.

831
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,622
What?

832
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,582
I love you too, Da-eun.

833
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,583
Sir, welcome back!

834
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,044
-Welcome back!
-What is this?

835
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:43,465
I have no idea what I'm doing now.

836
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:46,051
Hee-do, do you know reporter Back Yi-jin?

837
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,678
It feels like we're growing apart.

838
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:49,138
I feel like I'm lagging far behind.

839
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:52,891
So there's something between you two?
Have you asked her out?

840
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,184
Thanks for everything.

841
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,436
We meet again.

842
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,730
Because I'm happy to see you.

843
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,356
I feel confused.

844
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,193
Stop worrying me, Hee-do.

845
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,238
Yi-jin, I…

846
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:18,876
