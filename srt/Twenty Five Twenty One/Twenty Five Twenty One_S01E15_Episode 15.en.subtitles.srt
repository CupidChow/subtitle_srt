1
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,068
I went to City Hall…

00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,111
EPISODE 15

3
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,988
and heard about you by chance.

4
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,952
I met someone from your agency.

5
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,415
I interviewed him…

6
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,380
with the intent
to report about your decision.

7
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,676
It'll probably hurt you
once it gets on the news.

8
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,931
It'll probably hurt your parents too.

9
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,978
I knew that, but I did it anyway.

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,063
So?

11
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,398
Do you feel bad?

12
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,611
That would be too cowardly.

13
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,616
I would have been disappointed
if you had apologized.

14
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,080
There are times I feel bad
toward the fencers that I beat.

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,749
But I never apologize.

16
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,501
It's nothing to apologize for.

17
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,007
It was bound to get out anyway.

18
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,344
I'm glad you were the first one
to find out about it.

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,722
I hate it when reporters

20
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,184
say things about me and make things up.

21
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,938
Yu-rim.

22
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,734
Just explain
why you're changing your citizenship.

23
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,571
I know I can persuade the people.

24
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,989
No, I can't.

25
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,575
Then they'll judge my parents.

26
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,579
I'd rather die than have that happen.

27
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,039
I have a favor to ask.

28
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,418
Sorry for asking this of a reporter,

29
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,670
but tell people
that I'm changing my citizenship

30
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,715
solely because of money.

31
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,092
Please don't mention my parents.

32
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,053
I can handle it.
I'll be the one to be criticized.

33
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,392
Please.

34
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:13,026
KO YU-RIM IS A TRAITOR

35
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,519
You always hide when you're in pain.

36
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,817
You avoided my calls and texts.

37
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,155
I didn't know you'd be here doing this.

38
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,370
It was me…

39
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,584
who did this to Yu-rim.

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,633
People congratulated me…

41
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,266
when it was me
who turned everyone against Yu-rim.

42
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,059
Yu-rim told me…

43
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,106
that you were just doing your job.

44
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,151
We fence…

45
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,072
and you cover stories.

46
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,951
Let's acknowledge and accept that.

47
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,662
There aren't many things…

48
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,958
that we can do as we want

49
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,836
in this world.

50
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,058
Let's erase it together.

51
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,729
At least that much, we can do as we want.

52
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,073
Thank you.

53
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,747
I'm sorry…

54
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,836
for saying such nasty things that day.

55
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,257
I was just angry.

56
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,052
I didn't mean it.

57
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,283
KO YU-RIM IS A TRAITOR

58
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,250
KO YU-RIM IS A TRAITOR

59
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,336
-Yi-jin.
-Yes?

60
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,465
I need to give you a warning
as your girlfriend.

61
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,807
I'm going to share…

62
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,311
everything that's yours.

63
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:23,109
Everything, including your sadness,
happiness, and despair.

64
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,280
So…

65
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,325
don't hide because things are tough.

66
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,495
Make sure to leave my share.

67
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,040
If you don't lean on me,

68
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,668
I'll be lonely.

69
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,006
Sorry for not calling you.

70
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,220
Let's suffer together when we're in pain.

71
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,056
It's 100 times better

72
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,976
than being lonely alone.

73
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,204
What is it?

74
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,041
I'd like to transfer
to the newsroom next month.

75
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,751
The newsroom? Which department?

76
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,879
It doesn't matter.
As long as it isn't Sports.

77
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,380
Is this because of Yu-rim?

78
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,134
It's because of Hee-do.

79
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,387
If something like that
were to happen to Hee-do,

80
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,224
I'd have to do my duty as a reporter,
and that's unbearable.

81
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,229
I've already lost all objectivity
when it comes to Hee-do.

82
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,568
That sounds like
a sweet profession of love.

83
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,281
We've been seeing each other seriously
for about a month now.

84
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,536
So it finally happened.

85
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,454
I understand.

86
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,749
Having her mom break her heart on the news

87
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,459
is more than enough.

88
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,424
You know Local News
controls the newsroom, right?

89
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,928
-You'd better prepare yourself.
-Yes, ma'am.

90
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,305
But…

91
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,893
do you have anything else to say
about Hee-do and me?

92
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,982
Don't fight.

93
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,359
What? You're not at the scene?

94
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,237
-Okay, coming.
-Is everything ready? We're heading out.

95
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,072
-Yes.
-Okay, let's hurry.

96
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,199
-Hello.
-Hey. Let's go.

97
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,791
UBS NEWS HITS 33% VIEWERSHIP

98
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,346
Jung-hyuk.

99
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,016
Such a bright smile
doesn't belong in Local News.

100
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,934
Let's go. There's no time to unpack.

101
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,769
Where are we going?

102
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,770
Gwanghwamun.

103
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,356
Hey.

104
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,443
A protester was arrested
for assaulting an officer.

105
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,778
-The officer is heading to the hospital.
-Okay.

106
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,988
I'll go to the hospital.

107
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,114
-You go to the scene.
-Okay.

108
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,283
-Find witnesses and interview them.
-Okay.

109
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,035
You moved here
because you're seeing Na Hee-do, right?

110
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,870
Yes. What?

111
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,249
I can't tell whether
you're decisive or blinded by love.

112
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,669
It's a pleasure to be working with you.

113
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,296
This may come back to bite you.

114
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,799
Newsroom reporters would rather sleep
if they had time to go on dates.

115
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,179
That's probably because
they don't have anyone to…

116
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,058
No, you're not!

118
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,353
Hi, Hee-do. It's Yu-rim.

119
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,110
Hi, Hee-do. How have you been?

120
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,279
I just finished moving.

121
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,701
I still can't believe I'm living alone
in a foreign country.

122
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,830
My name is Ko Yu-rim.

123
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,958
I'm the best fencer in the world.

124
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,919
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

125
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,797
"Welcome. It's nice to meet you."

126
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,965
How do I say, "nice to meet you"?

127
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,511
We don't speak the same language,
but we don't need to when we fence.

128
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,721
I'll adjust quickly, right?

129
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,515
LET'S TURN MADRID GOLD!

130
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,516
Okay, 919.

131
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,851
It's spring in Korea now.

132
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,561
Hey! Maintain your balance!

133
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,022
-I moved into the training center.
-Hold it properly.

134
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,900
You know Coach Yang
now coaches the national team, right?

135
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,901
Are you getting up to leave?

136
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,411
KO YU-RIM

137
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,873
Everything here is the same
except that you're not here.

138
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,086
So have you thought of what to cover?

139
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,005
-Yi-jin is in the newsroom now.
-Let me hear your ideas.

140
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,383
Violence at college freshmen
welcoming events--

141
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,051
Is there a case worth reporting?

142
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,012
Yes. The sociology department
at Myungin University…

143
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,015
He's much busier
than when he was in Sports.

144
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,353
YUHWA CINEMA

145
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,313
Sorry, I wanted to go but Jung-hyuk…

146
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,982
You're 40 minutes late.

147
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,317
The movie has already started.

148
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,528
I already finished the popcorn.

149
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,613
How many times is this?

150
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,118
I only get the weekends off
but you're always busy on those weekends!

151
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,996
My bad. Sorry. Accept my apology.

152
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,207
-You always say that.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

153
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,465
I knew you'd do this
so I got tickets for the next screening.

154
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,343
You're a genius.

155
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,845
I know, right?

156
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,222
Let's go.

157
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,434
It's upsetting at times,

158
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,188
but we're sacrificing sleep
to see each other.

159
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,523
- This is my boyfriend.
- Is this your boyfriend?

160
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,567
I think I'm getting adjusted now.

161
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,529
It's hard to communicate,
but it's pretty fun.

162
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,201
It's summer
but it never breaks 25 degrees celsius.

163
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,827
It's chilly morning and night.

164
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,789
It must be really hot in Korea by now.

165
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,835
I kind of miss the sunny summers in Korea.

166
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
Why are you all here again?

167
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,302
Don't scold them. I told them to come.

168
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,847
Seung-wan's CSAT
is only 100 days away. Right?

169
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,768
Yi-jin, what do I do?

170
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,811
Do you think I can do well?

171
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,942
It was 100 days before the CSAT,
so we drank to commiserate.

172
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,984
And…

173
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,737
I got trashed.

174
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,325
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,788
I will never drink again.

176
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,334
Hee-do. Are you okay?

177
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,129
Will you still love me
even if I'm like this?

178
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,381
Of course.

179
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,927
No, no. Turn your head.

180
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,178
There. Your hair.

181
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,436
Hey, I hear Ji-woong is finally going
to Russia next week.

182
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,938
You must be so happy.

183
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,031
It's Ji-woong in the flesh.

184
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,041
I thought the world had come to an end

185
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,627
because I missed you so much.

186
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,758
I was happy, although it passed
in the blink of an eye.

187
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,136
I'll be alone again on New Year's Eve.

188
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,346
That's kind of sad.

189
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,557
I just got home.

190
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,439
What? You have to cover a story
on the 31st?

191
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,609
No, I'll be at the training center
the day before.

192
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,155
Oh, well.

193
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,367
Okay. Bye.

194
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,580
Having a boyfriend in the neighborhood
isn't any better.

195
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,875
Looks like I'll be alone
on New Year's Eve too.

196
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,127
With two and a half hours left
of the year 2000,

197
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,130
which started the new millennium,

198
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,592
the Bosingak Pavilion
is filled with people

199
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,844
awaiting the bell-ringing ceremony.

200
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,723
Notwithstanding the frigid temperature,
the people look excited

201
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,267
and are looking forward to
a new year filled with hope.

202
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,896
Gridlock is expected in Seoul
after the ceremony.

203
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,565
It is recommended that you take
public transportation.

204
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,818
With UBS News, I'm Back Yi-jin.

205
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,030
Thank you.

206
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,629
It's the new year!

207
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,679
Ta-da.

208
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,562
What is this place?

209
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,692
Somewhere with no people and a great view

210
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,986
from which we can hear the bell.

211
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,698
It's awesome.
How did you find out about this place?

212
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,783
While staking out for a story.

213
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,077
Lots of problematic people live here.

214
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,623
Even in times like that,

215
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,128
you thought of me, is that it?

216
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,429
You have no idea
how much I think about you.

217
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,848
I'm never going to know.

218
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,147
-Ten! Nine! Eight!
-Ten! Nine! Eight!

219
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,898
They must be starting the countdown.

220
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,151
Six!

221
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,904
-Five! Four!
-Five! Four!

222
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,699
-Three! Two!
-Three! Two!

223
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,784
One!

224
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,587
Happy new year, Yi-jin!

225
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,505
You too.

226
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,635
Do you have a new year's wish?

227
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,012
-Me?
-Yes.

228
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,600
What is it?

229
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,646
-I want that.
-What?

230
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,231
A couple's plan.

231
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,733
-A couple's plan?
-Yes.

232
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,694
If you get that, couples
can talk on the phone for free.

233
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,822
-We talk all the time.
-Okay, let's go tomorrow.

234
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,741
-Really?
-Yes.

235
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,205
It's finally 2001, Yu-rim.

236
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,959
I can't wait to see you in Madrid.

237
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,506
Okay. Ji Seung-wan was voted
the freshman department representative.

238
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,257
FRESHMEN ORIENTATION

239
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,511
So, I'm used to these things.

240
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,599
If it brings you pleasure to pick me,
that's good enough for me.

241
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,268
I'll do my best.

242
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,277
Look cooler.

243
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:39,159
Hey, let's stop.
I swear I took over 100 already.

244
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,830
Where do you post these, anyway?

245
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,914
Freechal.

246
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,458
I'm super famous there.
I get a lot of comments.

247
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,002
-Why?
-Because I dress well.

248
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,425
So I was thinking,
should I get my own webpage?

249
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,718
To do what?

250
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,471
For people like me who like clothes.

251
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,684
I'll post pics of myself and people
I see on the street that dress well.

252
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,478
Models in magazines are unrealistic.

253
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,732
Hey. That sounds fun.

254
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,900
Right?

255
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,027
Right.

256
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,950
I like this one and this one.

257
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,660
-No.
-The one where I do this.

258
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,911
Let's take a few more.

259
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,664
Seung-wan got into the college
that she wanted.

260
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,083
She's the class rep in her department.
Funny, right?

261
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,919
-Did you hear about Ji-woong?
-More!

262
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,921
I think he's starting something fun.

263
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,175
-I'm curious what it is.
-Okay, I love it.

264
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,435
INBOX

265
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,354
YU-RIM, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
ARE YOU BUSY THESE DAYS?

266
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,195
But Yu-rim…

267
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,533
why aren't you reading my emails?

268
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,045
That's hot.

269
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,881
Should we report
that their water is too hot?

270
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,926
How about that reporters
haven't gone home for three days?

271
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,470
You never cease to amaze me.

272
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,350
Seo Jung-hyuk speaking.

273
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,518
Where?

274
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,729
Which hospital?

275
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,273
Coming.

276
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,360
A crane collapsed at a construction site.

277
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,946
-Where?
-I'll send you the map.

278
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,740
I'll go to the hospital.
You go to the site.

279
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,077
Clean that up, okay?

280
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,287
Hey. You should clean it!

281
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,248
I'm your supervisor!

282
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,918
I got an x-ray, and they say it's fine.

283
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,796
You don't need to worry.

284
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,966
Yes. Okay, bye.

285
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,510
Gosh, what's happened here?

286
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,936
It's Yi-jin.

287
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,360
I'm at the site where the crane collapsed.

288
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,779
A 40m crane collapsed,

289
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,615
burying three laborers in the process.

290
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,368
"They were found dead 20 minutes ago."

291
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,037
"They were found dead."

292
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,164
The bodies of the laborers

293
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,458
who were buried at the site
of the crane collapse

294
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,878
have been reported to be uncovered.

295
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,589
We'll connect to the scene
and get a detailed report.

296
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,008
Back Yi-jin.

297
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,386
I'm at the site where the crane collapsed.

298
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,930
A 40m crane collapsed,

299
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,849
burying three laborers in the process.

300
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,436
They were found dead 20 minutes ago.

301
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,355
The families, who had been holding back,
erupted into tears

302
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,065
once their identities were confirmed.

303
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,151
The police are questioning those in charge

304
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,571
and are investigating
whether safety protocols were followed.

305
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,865
With UBS News, I'm Back Yi-jin.

306
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,827
I hope they're okay.

307
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,288
-Did a lot of people get hurt?
-Yi-jin…

308
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,597
Honey!

309
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,892
-Honey!
-Mommy, why are you crying?

310
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,393
Eun-seo.

311
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,897
My baby.

312
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,195
What do we do now? Honey…

313
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,448
How tragic.

314
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,866
The poor lady.

315
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,417
It has been only six years

316
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,964
since Sampoong Department Store
and Seongsu Bridge collapsed.

317
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,259
Why is this still happening?

318
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,098
Every site I go to, people are dead.

319
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,518
All those accidents
could have been prevented.

320
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,938
When I saw the families cry…

321
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,191
You can't do this job
if you let it all hurt you.

322
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,570
Grow numb to their situations
and focus on the incident.

323
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,117
I don't want to grow numb.

324
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,078
I'll feel their pain every time

325
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,746
and empathize with them.

326
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,960
That's the priority for me.

327
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,879
That's not bad if your body can handle it.

328
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,799
But if it can't,

329
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,344
ask the world instead of crying with them.
"Is this acceptable?"

330
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,303
Jeez.

331
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,683
I'm strong. Can't you tell?

332
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,561
I'm foregoing sleep to drink.

333
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,859
What about using that time
to see me instead, Mr. Back?

334
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,318
What?

335
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,863
Hee-do!

336
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,116
What are you doing here?
How'd you get here?

337
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,535
We spoke when you were in the can.
I asked her to come.

338
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,454
I called because I suddenly got a day off,

339
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,790
but you were drinking.

340
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,252
Hee-do!

341
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,463
-Hey.
-How'd you get here?

342
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,756
Where'd you come from?

343
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,258
-Sorry.
-Keep it down.

344
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,093
-He's crazy.
-She's my girlfriend.

345
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,053
-My girlfriend.
-Stop it.

346
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,513
Hey. Baby.

347
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,931
-Baby.
-Damn it.

348
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,559
Hey. I'm out. This is too humiliating.

349
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,520
-Have fun.
-Good night.

350
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,480
-Bye. Okay.
-Wake up, okay?

351
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,524
-Sorry.
-Good night.

352
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,609
Night.

353
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,492
Pour me one.

354
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,578
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,459
Wait a second.
Don't you always get trashed if you drink?

356
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,669
Didn't you know?

357
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,172
That's who you're going out with.

358
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,466
Okay. I see.

359
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,138
Why is this so tasty?

360
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,098
Give me another.

361
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,684
Yes, ma'am. Here you go.

362
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,311
Pour it already.

363
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,737
Careful.

364
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,325
Let's go for round two.

365
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,578
Call out the others. Let's wake them up.

366
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,456
Let's have just one more drink.

367
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,917
Seung-wan!

368
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,004
-Lie down.
-Ji-woong!

369
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,384
Stop that.

370
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,643
I'm cold.

371
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,229
You're cold?

372
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,528
Seung-wan.

373
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,283
Let's go drink.

374
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,171
Life is…

375
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,510
precious.

376
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,181
Let's love with no regrets…

377
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,562
while we're alive.

378
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,244
Hee-do.

379
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,788
Hee-do.

380
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,500
Are you hurt?

381
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,171
-What?
-You were groaning.

382
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,216
Really?

383
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,429
I hear I groan when I sleep

384
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,307
after a tiring day of training.

385
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,934
I'm okay.

386
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,317
Take some medicine
when you sober up, okay?

387
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,319
I can't take any medicine.

388
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,907
I may test positive for doping.

389
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,956
Okay.

390
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,793
Go to sleep.

391
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,813
You know…

392
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,527
I saw you earlier.

393
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,778
Where?

394
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,447
At the site of the accident.

395
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,118
I wanted to call out to you,

396
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,413
but I couldn't.

397
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,998
Why not?

398
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,002
Because you were working.

399
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,755
Because…

400
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,717
I support your career.

401
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,349
So I couldn't approach you.

402
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,292
Same here.

403
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,379
That's how I felt during your matches.

404
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,387
I couldn't approach you…

405
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,808
because I supported you.

406
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,063
That's right.

407
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,443
Do you remember

408
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,196
what you said long ago?

409
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,283
That…

410
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,330
I always lead you to good places.

411
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,167
You always lead me to do what's right

412
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,711
and to a good place.

413
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,756
You…

414
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,969
lead this world that we live in…

415
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,974
to a much better place.

416
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,478
That's who you are.

417
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,564
So…

418
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,484
don't hurt too much.

419
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,323
Hang in there.

420
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,205
I love you…

421
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,875
in every way.

422
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,420
Me too.

423
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,897
TAEREUNG NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

424
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,234
Are my lips too red?

425
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,696
They need to be red
for you to be photogenic.

426
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,738
YOUR INBOX IS EMPTY

427
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,823
Really?

428
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,534
Do I look better in a bun
or in a ponytail?

429
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,119
INBOX

430
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,747
YOUR INBOX IS EMPTY

431
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,376
Did something happen to her?

432
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,878
Hee-do.

433
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,297
What's wrong with Yu-rim?

434
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,299
KO YU-RIM, "NA HEE-DO IS NO MATCH FOR ME"

435
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,592
Why? What is it?

436
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,051
What is she saying?

437
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,928
How dare she talk about Hee-do?

438
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,098
She should shut her mouth and stay low
if she abandoned her country.

439
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,600
How dare she run her mouth?

440
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,519
People change so quickly.

441
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,774
You know that reporters
twist your words around.

442
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,027
They wouldn't have made it up though.

443
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,153
Exactly.

444
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,865
You have to beat her
if you face her in the finals in Madrid.

445
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,909
People will get worked up
like the Korea-Japan soccer matches.

446
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,328
Hey. Stop it. That's enough.

447
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,413
I'm so annoyed.

448
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,167
Prêtes? Allez.

449
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,835
50 DAYS UNTIL MADRID, MEDIA DAY

450
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,295
Attaque. Touche.

451
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,464
Get it together!

452
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,344
You'll hurt your knees
if you play like that.

453
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,638
Okay? You can do better.

454
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,431
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

455
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,308
Prêtes? Allez.

456
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,146
Darn it.

457
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,357
Okay.

458
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,361
-Hee-do. Wipe your face.
-Okay.

459
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,280
-I'll do it.
-You're very talented.

460
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,033
Coach.

461
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,160
You're creeping me out.

462
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,291
Did you see
Ko Yu-rim's interview this morning?

463
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,960
What do you think about that?

464
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,587
Would you please respond to what she said?

465
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,062
What is she doing?

466
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,317
Whatever I say about Ko Yu-rim

467
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,654
always gets twisted
into something antagonistic.

468
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,323
That's why I brought this.

469
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,202
If you edit my comments
and manipulate my words again,

470
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,163
I will never give an interview again.

471
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,376
I'm watching and reading everything.

472
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,879
She used to storm out
of the press conference.

473
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,673
Now, she knows how to handle them.

474
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,425
How you've grown.

475
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,017
My determination is always the same
before a big competition.

476
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,062
I'll do my best to obtain the best result.

477
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,898
I don't want to lose,
whoever the opponent may be.

478
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:50,111
I'm sure Ko Yu-rim feels the same way.

479
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,491
I'll do my best in Madrid as well.

480
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,124
Okay.

481
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,836
Let's shout, "Let's go, Korea!"
And we'll end with that.

482
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,384
Let's go, Korea!

483
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,303
-Let's go, Korea!
-Let's go, Korea!

484
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,555
Na Hee-do, this way please.

485
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,683
-Please look here too!
-Over here too.

486
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,994
SPAIN, MADRID

487
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,097
Yu-rim!

488
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,558
Coach.

489
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,104
How have you been?

490
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,898
How about you?

491
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,151
How is it living abroad? Is it bearable?

492
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,614
They're all people too. It's fine.

493
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,658
Good.

494
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,042
Is Hee-do inside?

495
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,086
You came to see Hee-do?

496
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,421
Wait here.

497
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,817
Hee-do…

498
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,904
doesn't want to see you right now.

499
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,781
What?

500
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,951
I see.

501
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,954
Oh, okay.

502
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,167
Sure. I understand.

503
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,143
She's gone.

504
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,773
Did she say anything?

505
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,984
What could she say to that?

506
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,111
Why won't you see her?

507
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,823
Because I need to win.

508
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,786
Okay, Hee-do.
Get ready for the semi-finals.

509
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,333
Let's go, Hee-do.

510
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,221
-Attaque.
-Attaque.

511
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,973
-Point.
-Touche. Point.

512
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,947
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

513
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,836
Touche. Point.

514
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,505
Touche. Point.

515
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,304
One more! Let's finish it!

516
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,765
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

517
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,317
Na Hee-do, representing Korea
has advanced to the finals,

518
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,486
securing a silver medal!

519
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,155
Way to go, Hee-do!

520
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,075
-Yes, Hee-do!
-My loach baby. That little loach.

521
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,869
Yu-rim. Aren't they going to show
Yu-rim's match?

522
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,664
We'll tune in to Russia's
Julia Ko's match,

523
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,083
whom we know as Ko Yu-rim.

524
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,756
Julia Ko is behind at 14 to 13.

525
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,551
The winner of this match
will advance to the finals.

526
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,012
-She will face Na Hee-do.
-En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

527
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,977
Attaque. Touche. Point.

528
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,983
Don't lose, Yu-rim.

529
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,571
If you're going to lose,
advance and lose to me.

530
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,783
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

531
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,257
Attaque. Touche. Point.

532
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,595
Russia's Julia Ko
has advanced to the finals.

533
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,514
Attention. Salut.

534
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,480
Let's put this in the background.

535
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,689
-Okay.
-Thanks.

536
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,318
What happened in fencing?

537
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,071
Your girlfriend's in the finals.

538
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,451
What about Yu-rim?

539
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,495
Together with Ko Yu-rim.

540
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,996
Thank God.

541
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,541
Hurry if you want to watch the finals.

542
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,086
-Hurry it up.
-Yes, sir.

543
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,174
Forget everything about friendship
and sympathy right now.

544
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,094
Face Yu-rim as fencer to fencer.

545
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,096
You've always beaten Yu-rim.

546
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,847
Today will be no different.

547
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,516
No other fencer…

548
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,894
knows Yu-rim better than you do.

549
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,480
-Got that?
-Yes, Coach.

550
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,483
Don't worry.

551
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,903
You did not pick a fencer who loses.

552
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,658
The final women's fencing match will
begin now.

553
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,910
Go and win this, Hee-do.

554
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:26,215
Introducing the two impressive players
who have made it to the finals.

555
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,889
An imposing rookie
that has reached the finals

556
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:38,436
in her first appearance on the big stage.

557
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,313
From Korea, Na Hee-do.

558
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:52,741
Now, let me introduce her opponent.

559
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,745
The reigning champion.
From Russia, Julia Ko.

560
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,414
En garde.

561
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,253
Prêtes? Allez.

562
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,174
Attaque. Touche. Point.

563
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,779
En garde.

564
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,199
Prêtes? Allez.

565
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,454
Attaque. Touche. Point.

566
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,378
En garde.

567
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,505
Prêtes?

568
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,674
Allez.

569
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,599
Hee-do, you haven't worked out enough,
have you?

570
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,101
How could you fall down?

571
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,644
I'm sorry.

572
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,272
How will you beat Yu-rim like this?

573
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,942
Do you know how many people
are suffering to support you?

574
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,280
You know how the people feel.
You have to beat Yu-rim.

575
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,781
Lose, and you're a traitor too.

576
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,492
Can you please stop saying that?

577
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,716
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

578
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,398
Attaque. Touche. Point.

579
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,291
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

580
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:51,420
You are competing against Na Hee-do now.
What do you think about her?

581
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,841
You are competing against Na Hee-do now.
What do you think about her?

582
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,763
I'm close friends with Na Hee-do

583
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,891
so I am not fond of people
making her out to be an enemy of mine.

584
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,478
Hee-do is a great fencer.

585
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:12,816
But a fencer must believe
she's the best when she competes.

586
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,819
"She's nothing. She's no match to me."

587
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,488
It's like self-hypnosis.

588
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,868
KO YU-RIM, "NA HEE-DO IS NO MATCH FOR ME"

589
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,593
Hee-do. Don't fence to show Yu-rim.
Be yourself.

590
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,928
This isn't you!

591
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,471
Allez.

592
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,017
Attaque. Touche. Point.

593
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,937
WIN FOR KOREA, HEE-DO

594
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,481
NA HEE-DO, "I'M HEARTBROKEN
BY KO YU-RIM'S BETRAYAL"

595
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,862
KOREA'S HOPE, NA HEE-DO

596
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,115
NA HEE-DO PREPARING FOR REVENGE
AGAINST KO YU-RIM

597
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,158
NA HEE-DO, TAKE DOWN KO YU-RIM!

598
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,336
That's not it!

599
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,880
Don't you find it unfair
that people in Korea hate you?

600
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,716
Don't you want to win the gold medal
and show it to everyone?

601
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,596
How's our daughter doing?

602
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,392
Okay. Don't get hurt.

603
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,229
Do your best. Okay.

604
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,856
Hey, Yu-rim.

605
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,192
We're always on your side.

606
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:42,197
We're always rooting for you,
so be strong, okay?

607
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,825
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

608
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,084
WE LOVE YOU, FROM MOM

609
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,507
I started a new training yesterday.

610
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,302
It's something I've never tried in Korea.

611
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,852
My ankle is bothering me again…

612
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,523
MY ANKLE IS BOTHERING ME AGAIN

613
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,277
Hee-do.

614
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,866
I can't be completely honest with you
like I used to be.

615
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,288
Attaque. Parade-riposte. Touche. Point.

616
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,893
En garde.

617
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,188
Prêtes? Allez.

618
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,442
Attaque. Preparation.

619
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,111
Attaque. Touche. Point.

620
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,365
No. She's preparation.

621
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,090
En garde. Your mask.

622
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,457
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

623
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,800
Touche. Point.

624
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,855
Prêtes? Allez.

625
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,360
Touche. Point.

626
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,156
We're almost there! Come on! Let's go!

627
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,907
Prêtes? Allez.

628
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,454
Actions simultanées. Pas de touche.

629
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,455
Allez.

630
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,583
Allez.

631
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,129
Actions simultanées. Pas de touche.

632
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,496
One point!

633
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,026
En garde.

634
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,201
Prêtes? Allez.

635
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,066
Attaque. Touche. Point.

636
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,403
Attention.

637
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,741
Salut.

638
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,426
I'm sorry, Hee-do.

639
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,684
I'm sorry for not reading your emails.

640
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,608
I know. You don't have to say it.

641
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:44,578
You probably experienced
the same thing I did.

642
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:50,500
Only we know how hard it was for us.

643
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,462
No one else does.

644
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,516
I was happy today.

645
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,940
Me too.

646
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,554
KOREA, NA HEE-DO
MADRID, WOMEN'S FENCING GOLD MEDAL

647
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,393
Our daughter is the best.

648
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,687
You did well, Yu-rim.

649
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:58,068
Congratulations, Yu-rim, Hee-do.

650
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,740
-Yes!
-Na Hee-do!

651
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,742
-Nice!
-We won!

652
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,788
Congratulations.

653
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,215
You too. Congratulations…

654
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,010
on having a girlfriend
you can be proud of.

655
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,599
I don't want to be

656
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,228
an embarrassment to Hee-do.

657
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,150
Let's have dinner together
once she gets back.

658
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,528
Okay.

659
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,172
NA HEE-DO GOLD, JULIA KO SILVER,
FRIENDSHIP SURPASSING BORDERS

660
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,810
Mom. Why were you crying here?

661
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,938
What happened between you two?

662
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,944
I know that Min-chae is reading my diary.

663
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:27,532
I've decided to let her.

664
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,576
-Let's go.
-And he went like this.

665
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,122
It fell off.

666
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,624
-I don't have anything else.
-Don't you have anything?

667
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,001
-Anything fun.
-I don't.

668
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:43,631
My diary from those days
is filled with just love and friendship.

669
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,303
A time when friendship and love
were all that mattered in life.

670
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:52,140
A time like that lasts only for a moment.

671
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:57,145
I hope Min-chae experiences
such passion as well.

672
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,940
A rowdy friendship and passionate love.

673
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:06,321
Because those brief moments
are what make your long life shine.

674
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,825
Is there nothing after that?

675
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,627
Where is it?

676
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,171
Sadly, I lost the next diary

677
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,507
that Min-chae is looking for.

678
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,161
Congratulations, Hee-do.

679
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,790
What's your problem, Yi-jin?
You were the slowest to text.

680
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,213
Hello?

681
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,382
It's me. Are you back?

682
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,801
Yes. I just got home.

683
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,762
Congratulations on your gold medal.

684
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,473
How do you feel?

685
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,103
I miss you.

686
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,981
That's how I feel.

687
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,275
What? That's the same as me.

688
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,029
I'll see you tonight.

689
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,657
Don't be late again.

690
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,701
Okay.

691
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,625
Would you like to order?

692
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,044
-We'll wait until our party arrives.
-Okay.

693
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,380
You were craving spicy food?

694
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,049
Yes. They have spicy food in Spain too,

695
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,760
but it's completely different
from how Korean food is spicy.

696
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,804
Did you tour Madrid at all?

697
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,141
I don't think about touring
when I go abroad for a competition.

698
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,268
I just want to sleep once it's over.

699
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,104
Was it your idea
to have dinner together tonight?

700
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,899
That's right. But look how late he is.

701
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,902
Shouldn't a reporter know
how busy reporters are?

702
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,153
What's the big deal?

703
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,157
Couldn't you be like that toward me?

704
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,036
It wasn't just once or twice with you.

705
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,913
You were like that all my life.

706
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,042
It's Yi-jin.

707
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,127
Hello?

708
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,713
Yes. I'm here with my mom. Where are you?

709
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,091
What? Really?

710
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,051
I see.

711
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,553
Then you can't come at all?

712
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,642
It's not your fault.

713
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,478
Okay.

714
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,071
Something's come up.

715
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,410
Let's order, okay?

716
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:17,303
Yi-jin must feel really bad.

717
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,557
He texted to say he's sorry.

718
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,479
You said I had scarred you for life

719
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,024
for not going to
your dad's funeral, right?

720
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,819
It's unacceptable for your mom,

721
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,738
but it's okay for your boyfriend?

722
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,664
How is that the same thing?

723
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,375
Yi-jin may be busy,

724
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,003
but I'm at the training center too.

725
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,380
It's just hard for us
to coordinate, that's all.

726
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,048
Exactly.

727
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,551
I'm asking if that's okay.

728
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,139
Waiting, missing each other,
and being disappointed.

729
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,394
What I did to you your entire life.

730
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,023
One person is always sorry

731
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,151
and the other always gives up.
Are you really okay…

732
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,863
with a relationship like that?

733
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,452
Yes.

734
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,913
I'm okay with it.

735
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:39,010
I'm very sorry. I really wanted
to go and celebrate with you.

736
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,595
I'm so upset.

737
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,223
It'll be tough
to meet up this week. Sorry.

738
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,933
When are you free next week?

739
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,354
Sorry, there's a news flash
so we're on alert.

740
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,480
I'll call you later.

741
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,357
I passed out as soon as I got home.

742
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,400
Sorry.

743
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,742
Hello?

744
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,332
What was that?

745
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,000
-What?
-What?

746
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,544
Do people get prettier
when they win the gold medal?

747
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,089
-What?
-What?

748
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,885
I've missed you.

749
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,140
It's 1 a.m. What if my mom were home?

750
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,894
She's at the studio. I checked.

751
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,147
Still, it's so late.

752
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,734
I know I'm late, but congratulations.

753
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,779
Congratulations!

754
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,410
You're on vacation for a while, right?

755
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,286
-Yes.
-Want to take a trip next month?

756
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,414
A trip? Out of nowhere?

757
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,040
It's our 600-day anniversary soon.

758
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,171
-Did you forget?
-No.

759
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,343
You did forget. When is it? Tell me.

760
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,845
-September.
-September.

761
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,598
Look up!

762
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,891
-September.
-September.

763
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,356
-September.
-Twelfth.

764
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:20,027
-Nice.
-See? I'm right.

765
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,157
It's the tenth.
Your love has grown cold. Bye.

766
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,367
Come on. Don't be like that.

767
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,746
The tenth. Yes, the tenth.
September tenth.

768
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,955
Get ready to go.

769
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,290
Now?

770
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,375
Yes. Let's go to the night market
to prepare for our trip.

771
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,835
-The market?
-Yes.

772
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,712
We should get that.

773
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,338
This?

774
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,341
May I help you?

775
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,635
-We want matching travel bags.
-Okay.

776
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,304
-That one.
-Stop it.

777
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,055
We want two of this one.

778
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,016
-Two of the same.
-Yes, please.

779
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,435
What? The same?

780
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,437
Isn't that kind of embarrassing?

781
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,233
-Are you embarrassed?
-What?

782
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,652
-I mean…
-I embarrass you?

783
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,574
You had matching cell phone accessories
with Cutie Pie.

784
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,701
But it's embarrassing
when you're doing it with me?

785
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,495
Why are you bringing him up now?

786
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,580
That was years ago.

787
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,832
Should I talk about Da-eun then?

788
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,545
I don't know who that is.

789
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,089
"I love you, Da-eun."
Park Da-eun from class seven.

790
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,927
-No. Listen to me. Hear me out.
-No? Was it class six?

791
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,472
We weren't a couple for that long.

792
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:32,725
We didn't get anything that matched.
You're the first for me.

793
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,810
Whatever.

794
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:46,197
I left early so I wouldn't be late,
and got here really early.

795
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,617
Are you leaving the studio now?

796
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,997
Okay. I'll be waiting.

797
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,166
Okay.

798
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,051
What's taking him so long?

799
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,055
-What's going on?
-What is that? Is this a war?

800
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,432
-Is that true?
-Really?

801
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,310
-Why did a plane…
-Was the plane shot down?

802
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,855
-It's for real, right?
-My gosh, what is it?

803
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,606
-Oh my gosh.
-Is that happening now?

804
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,817
-How did that happen?
-My gosh.

805
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,402
How could that happen?

806
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,614
What's going to happen now?

807
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,325
Is this really happening?

808
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,785
-This is huge.
-My gosh.

809
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,829
-What is it?
-Look over there.

810
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,039
-What about the people in there?
-Is it an accident?

811
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,875
-Hello?
-Hee-do.

812
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,793
I'm so sorry, but something happened.

813
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,212
Wait at home. I'll call you.

814
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,132
Yi-jin! Get back here now!

815
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,466
Coming!

816
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,435
Waiting, missing each other,
and being disappointed.

817
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,521
One person is always sorry

818
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,691
and the other always gives up.
Are you really okay

819
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,736
with a relationship like that?

820
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:35,806
Hee-do. If you're waiting
at the end of my misery,

821
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,559
all of that misery was worthwhile.

822
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:42,063
Compared to the days we have ahead of us,

823
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,148
600 days is just an instant.

824
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,402
Thank you, sorry,

825
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,196
and I love you.

826
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:53,240
I know I'll be next to you,
but I'm too shy to say it.

827
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:54,909
Yi-jin.

828
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,474
You're home, right?

829
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,687
I'm going to New York
on the first flight out tomorrow.

830
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,730
I'm really sorry.

831
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:57,763
NEW YORK, AMERICA

832
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,482
Excuse me. I'm Back Yi-jin.
I came from HQ. It's nice to meet you.

833
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,860
Hi. I'm Lee Gi-hun,
the New York correspondent.

834
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,445
How'd you come? There are no flights.

835
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,281
-I came by land by crossing the border.
-That's a long trip.

836
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,951
As you know, New York is in
a state of emergency.

837
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,996
The correspondents in Washington DC
and Boston are all working.

838
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,499
We still don't know the number
of the deceased and the missing.

839
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,877
Do we know how many Koreans are missing?

840
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,170
So far, there are 21.

841
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,008
Go here and meet the Korean survivors.

842
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,301
Get their interviews.

843
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,345
-You can use that desk.
-Yes, sir.

844
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,482
Hello, sir.

845
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,485
I'm Back Yi-jin. I'm a reporter with UBS.

846
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:57,239
I know this is a tough time
but I'd like to hear your story.

847
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,117
You want an interview, right?

848
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,703
Yes. I'd like to hear
what happened at the time.

849
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,121
Do you mind?

850
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,665
You son of a bitch.

851
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,210
My colleague died.

852
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,923
We were fleeing together,
but only I made it out, you sick bastard.

853
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,425
I'm sorry.

854
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,221
But if we alert Korea
about people in New York--

855
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,848
Do you know how it feels
to be sad about being alive?

856
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,726
An interview? Get lost.

857
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,282
Excuse me. Are you Korean?

858
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,534
Yes, I am.

859
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,871
I'm Back Yi-jin. I'm a reporter with UBS.

860
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,039
Do you have a colleague or family here…

861
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,932
Doctor, please…

862
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,226
You're a Korean reporter, right?

863
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,145
Yes.

864
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,899
I need to give an interview.

865
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,610
My colleague is still in the building.

866
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:01,113
He saved us all
and was following in the back.

867
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:04,283
We made it to the underground level,
then the second plane…

868
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:08,996
I need to tell his family and the others

869
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,081
that he may still be alive.

870
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,172
I'll help you.

871
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,883
Let me help you.

872
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,473
We made it down to the underground level
and thought we were safe.

873
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,767
But then there was the second blast.

874
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:33,103
When I came to, I was in the hospital.

875
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,649
But we still haven't found him.

876
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,068
We have to find him.

877
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,738
Help us. Please help us.

878
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:48,410
Firefighters are moving quickly
to search for survivors.

879
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,122
Bernard Kerik, the police commissioner,
said there may be a pocket

880
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,668
under the debris in which
people may have survived.

881
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,171
He said they'll pour all their efforts
into rescuing the survivors.

882
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,508
From New York City, I'm Back Yi-jin.

883
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,680
Are you okay?

884
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,243
Your call could not be connected…

885
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,011
INCOMING CALL

886
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,597
-Hello?
-Hee-do.

887
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,766
Are you all right?

888
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,893
Sorry. You must have been worried.

889
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,897
Things were just too crazy. Where are you?

890
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,942
Me? I came to the training center today.

891
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,485
Okay. I see.

892
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,323
You went straight home that day, right?

893
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,286
Yes, I went home.

894
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,248
It looked really dangerous there.
Are you all right?

895
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,919
Too many people died.

896
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,215
It's really bad.
I think it'll take at least a month.

897
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,802
That long?

898
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,096
Okay.

899
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,060
Keep in touch and take care of yourself.

900
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,146
I'm very sorry.

901
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,024
I miss you a lot.

902
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:44,943
Me too.

903
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,157
Hang in there, Yi-jin.

904
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,430
What happened
at the mayor's press conference?

905
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,349
Is there an official death count?

906
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:16,892
It's 201 so far.

907
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,354
There are 5,422 reported missing.

908
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,756
I lost. Darn it. I could have won.

909
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,428
Hey. You lost on purpose
to see your boyfriend, right?

910
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:56,140
What do you mean? You're just too good.

911
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,391
Come on.

912
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,395
Okay, then. Bye!

913
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:13,073
The Manhattan area where
the World Trade Center was located…

914
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,700
I got here on time.

915
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,161
…life is slowly returning to normal.

916
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,414
However, the site is still
filled with smoke and dust.

917
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,377
President Bush,
in his Address to the Nation,

918
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,297
condemned the Taliban,
which refused to deliver

919
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,132
the terrorist Bin Laden,

920
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,926
and announced that air raids
have begun in Afghanistan.

921
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:38,182
The Taliban finally expressed
their intent to surrender.

922
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,225
They requested that the US guarantee

923
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,978
their safety and that of
the foreign volunteers.

924
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:47,024
They requested the UN representative
be present when they surrender.

925
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,949
What is that?

926
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,452
It's only his voice today.

927
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,129
Hello?

928
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,466
I thought you'd be disappointed
since my face won't be on.

929
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,054
How'd you know?

930
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,056
You know I stress about my clothes

931
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,184
whenever I go on air
so that I look good for you?

932
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,521
Really?

933
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,530
But you know…

934
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,660
isn't it time to show me
your pretty face in person?

935
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,329
It's been way over a month.

936
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,457
I didn't expect a war.

937
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,212
I'll be back before the new year though.

938
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,422
I miss you so much.

939
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,634
Yes. Me too.

940
01:15:58,303 --> 01:15:59,513
I miss you.

941
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,726
Hang in there, Yi-jin.

942
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,666
Excuse me. Are you reporter Back Yi-jin?

943
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,543
Yes. Hello.

944
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,672
I got out of the concrete grave.

945
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,133
We made it to the food court.

946
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,345
The tables were crushed.
There was nothing there.

947
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,057
I couldn't find my wife and daughter.

948
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:48,061
I searched everywhere and…

949
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,436
Back Yi-jin speaking.

950
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,775
I'll be right there.

951
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,952
Good work. Have a drink.

952
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,167
I saw pills in your room.

953
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,212
What are you taking?

954
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:00,300
Just sedatives. I can't sleep very well.

955
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,763
You have nightmares?

956
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,142
What do you see in your nightmares?

957
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:11,937
I'm sleeping…

958
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:16,900
and the company building is bombed.

959
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:21,613
People die and run away.

960
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:23,990
Things like that.

961
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,284
It's similar to mine.

962
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:33,750
I've been a reporter for 20 years,
but I've never seen hell like this.

963
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:38,004
I thought I had seen
many deaths, but this is like…

964
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:41,800
another level of hell.

965
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,138
What's keeping you here?

966
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,225
If this is hell,

967
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:54,563
I believe I need to tell people
that this is hell.

968
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,441
If I let enough people know,

969
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:00,861
perhaps we'll be able to prevent
something like this from happening again.

970
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,533
That hope is what's keeping me here.

971
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,080
You're like me when I was young.

972
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,083
Hope…

973
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,463
Does that exist?

974
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:25,469
The world keeps creating
more and more serious problems

975
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,928
and mocks me.

976
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,395
Don't get your hopes up.

977
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,279
I miss my family in Korea.

978
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,908
What am I doing here?

979
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,890
Back Yi-jin speaking.

980
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:12,974
Finally.

981
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:17,187
I didn't hear from you
so I thought you were very busy.

982
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:19,898
Yes, I was. Sorry.

983
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:27,072
I had a drink with a colleague
after I finished today.

984
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,033
You sound terrible.

985
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,035
Is something wrong?

986
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,870
I'm not sure.

987
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,541
A lot of things.

988
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,212
This place is pure hell,

989
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,091
and I have a nightmare every night.

990
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,970
The guy who was a reporter for 20 years…

991
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,017
says no matter how hard a reporter tries…

992
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,481
there is no hope in this world.

993
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,447
Everything that you're feeling now…

994
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,244
is probably you growing as a person.

995
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,331
Hang in there.

996
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,542
Grow?

997
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:27,841
I don't want to call
these emotions "growth."

998
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,141
My support isn't reaching him anymore.

999
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:50,864
I'm home.

1000
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,741
Hi.

1001
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,493
How long is your break?

1002
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,245
Until early January.

1003
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,080
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

1004
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,460
That's right. Have you heard?

1005
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:06,922
-What?
-There's an opening in New York.

1006
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,632
I heard Yi-jin applied.

1007
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:15,430
I guess Yi-jin will apologize to me again.

1008
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,058
I wish

1009
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,394
you'd stop apologizing.

1010
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,774
BOSINGAK

1011
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:31,696
I'm still sending you my support.

1012
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:36,326
But the more I do,
the farther apart we grow.

1013
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,250
With two hours left in the year 2001,

1014
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,920
I am standing here
at the snowy Bosingak Pavilion.

1015
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,427
I'll be back before the new year though.

1016
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:56,471
I miss you so much.

1017
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,683
Yes. Me too.

1018
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:12,904
Aren't you Na Hee-do?

1019
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,864
You are, right? Oh my gosh!

1020
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:19,285
May I get your autograph?

1021
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,621
Oh my gosh.

1022
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:25,208
I'm a huge fan.

1023
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:27,711
Thank you.

1024
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:29,963
Hee-do.

1025
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,799
You have a boyfriend, right?

1026
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,350
I'm not sure.

1027
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:49,232
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1028
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:16,176
-Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
-Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

1029
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:37,822
Happy new year, Yi-jin!

1030
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:39,657
You too.

1031
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,826
Do you have a new year's wish?

1032
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,369
-Me?
-Yes.

1033
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,166
What is it?

1034
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:53,046
-I want that. That.
-What?

1035
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:54,714
A couple's plan.

1036
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,216
-A couple's plan?
-Yes.

1037
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:59,135
If you get that, couples
can talk on the phone for free.

1038
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,388
-We talk all the time.
-Okay, let's go tomorrow.

1039
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,224
-Really?
-Yes.

1040
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:17,904
Congrats on turning 25, Yi-jin.

1041
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:22,742
Congrats on turning 21, Hee-do.

1042
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,163
-Thanks.
-What?

1043
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:32,210
Let's come back here next year.

1044
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:36,881
Sure. Let's come back again
the year after.

1045
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,091
-Should we?
-Yes.

1046
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:41,386
Then should we come back again
the year after that?

1047
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,558
Let's be together forever.

1048
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:50,937
Let's do that.

1049
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,690
Is Yi-jin not coming today?

1050
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,902
-At times, I miss the old days.
-Cheers.

1051
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,946
We had fun.

1052
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,948
Do you want to have dinner at my house?

1053
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:25,865
At your house?

1054
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,203
Because I think I know what this means.

1055
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:33,414
You and I both mean a lot to each other.

1056
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,668
Yi-jin. Why are you leaving like that?

1057
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,587
Hee-do, I…

1058
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,634
What I had imagined
eventually became reality.

1059
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:46,886
Back Yi-jin, you're making history in UBS.

1060
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,179
Nice to meet you all.

1061
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,514
Okay.

1062
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:51,307
I'll be right there.

1063
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,935
Na Hee-do has won a gold medal!

1064
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:57,313
I could reach you
