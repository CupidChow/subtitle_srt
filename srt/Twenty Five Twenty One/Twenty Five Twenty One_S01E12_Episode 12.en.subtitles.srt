00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,820
EPISODE 12

2
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,699
Let's visit Dad more often from now on.

3
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,034
I'll make time.

4
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,537
All right.

5
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,211
By the way,
how is your college application going?

6
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,837
Are they giving you a scholarship?

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,549
Yes, but I'm thinking of joining
a professional sports team.

8
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,051
They offer a high salary.

9
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,928
It'd be great
if I'm on the same team as Yu-rim--

10
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,055
What are you saying?

11
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,182
Aren't you going to college?

12
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,603
The scholarship only covers the tuition--

13
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,648
Don't kid yourself.
Do you think money is the issue here?

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,443
How long do you think you will fence
to decide not to go to college?

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,570
You have to go to college

16
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,073
if you want to make a living
once you quit fencing.

17
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,909
-Goodness.
-Why aren't you thinking straight?

18
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,161
Don't put it like that!

19
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,998
And why would I quit fencing?
I'm going to continue.

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,751
Seriously! This is annoying.
Stop talking to me!

21
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,670
Gosh, I'm so upset.

22
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:14,384
LET'S GO TAE YANG HIGH

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,635
Hey, Yu-rim.

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,097
Aren't you considering college?

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,515
You can get a scholarship.

26
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,310
But that's nothing
compared to the salary offered.

27
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,895
I need to earn money.

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,649
But when it comes to money,
going abroad is the best.

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,942
They offer you so much.

30
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,487
Still, changing your nationality
for money doesn't feel right.

31
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,489
I agree.

32
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,869
But why?
Are you thinking of going to college?

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,121
Yes.

34
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,417
I want to join a team and earn money,
but my mom insists I go to college.

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,085
Really?

36
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,591
Don't you have to take the CSAT then?

37
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,093
Yes. I have to get above 80 points.

38
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,845
So 80 out of 400 points?

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,431
Is that even possible?

40
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,101
I'll solve the Korean section.

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,813
Gosh, when am I going to read
all that boring text?

42
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,274
Hey, Lee Ye-ji!

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,486
What did I tell you about
bringing this up one more time!

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,239
Stop saying that you want to quit!

45
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,619
This is all because
your state of mind is rotten to the core!

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,078
Coach, I'm serious.

47
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,915
I've thought long and hard about this

48
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,250
to have the courage to tell you.

49
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,586
You should have spent
more time training instead.

50
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,837
Then you won't be in a slump!

51
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,674
Trust me, if you bring this up
one more time,

52
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,800
I won't let you off.

53
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,344
Do you understand?

54
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,017
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS

55
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,070
I had to tell her

56
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,324
because I really felt like
fencing wasn't for me.

57
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,453
But she keeps telling me
to stop the nonsense,

58
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,373
that I should endure
as this is just a slump.

59
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,795
Ye-ji.

60
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,509
Do you really want to quit?

61
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,638
Fencing isn't fun anymore.

62
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,101
I feel like
I'm wasting my time in the gym.

63
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,187
If I can attend my classes,

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,274
I would be able to fence
while exploring other options.

65
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,442
But we aren't allowed,

66
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,903
so my hands are tied.

67
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,780
I feel anxious. This is my life.

68
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,749
It must have been tough.

69
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,918
Sorry I didn't know sooner.

70
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,131
Let's try and find a way together.

71
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,303
Speaking of which…

72
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,599
what would happen…

73
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,647
if I don't come in to train
starting tomorrow?

74
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,827
Yi-jin!

75
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,456
You look beautiful as always.

76
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,208
Hey, why would you come
and ask for me when I'm working?

77
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,752
Who taught you this was okay?

78
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,756
No one's taught me.
I'm a natural, like that body of yours.

79
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,425
Gosh. So what brings you here?

80
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,761
I was in the area
to get something and stopped by.

81
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,013
You signed up for a picture.

82
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,890
The one with Hee-do alone,

83
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,683
which can be misleading.

84
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,983
I only did that
because no one else had signed up.

85
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,902
How much do I owe you?

86
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,653
Come on, Yi-jin.

87
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,114
I got to ask Yu-rim out, thanks to you.

88
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,617
-I said I would return the favor.
-Is it like 300 won?

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,577
What? It is 320 won.

90
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,498
Yes. I can see how grateful you're.
What did you have to get?

91
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,208
This?

92
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,293
It's something awesome.

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,128
Something really awesome.

94
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,438
The t-shirt worn by fugitive Sin Chang-won
when he was arrested

95
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,190
has become popular among the teens.

96
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:43,152
This has led to a nationwide
"Sin Chang-won Syndrome."

97
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,113
Even the fake copies of the t-shirt are

98
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,698
becoming a fast-selling fashion item
in the markets.

99
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,158
Come on in.

100
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,243
Do it properly.

101
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,047
-Look!
-You bought that?

102
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,893
Where is Ye-ji?

103
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,731
She went to class.

104
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,068
What? To class?

105
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
Ye-ji…

106
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,198
is serious

107
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,617
about wanting to quit fencing.

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,120
She wants to pursue something else.

109
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,332
Please let her quit.

110
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,838
Goodness. Now I've seen everything.

111
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,134
Hey, who do you think you are
to decide on that?

112
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,304
You're good at fencing, but she's not.
So it's okay for her to quit?

113
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,472
No.

114
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,683
I enjoy fencing

115
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,853
but she doesn't find it fun anymore.

116
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,521
Then she should be able to quit.

117
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,398
Did she not enjoy this from the start?

118
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,736
She couldn't improve her fencing
and that turned into a slump

119
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,237
and now she hates it.

120
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,908
Managing that kind of mentality

121
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,784
is also a part of my job.

122
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,206
It's my job to teach her not to give up
and keep on facing the challenge.

123
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,919
To her, giving up is also a challenge.

124
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,674
Athletes decide on a path
at a relatively early age

125
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,218
and stay committed
for the rest of their lives.

126
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,720
All we've ever done is this.

127
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,514
So for us,

128
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,726
to give up
is to face our greatest challenge.

129
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,898
Giving up is a challenge?

130
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,652
That's a nice way to put it.

131
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,654
Then is having grit

132
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,198
the same as being stupid?

133
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,831
Yu-rim, go to class and get Ye-ji.

134
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,089
Can't you hear me?

135
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,592
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,262
I'll also not take part in training

137
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,348
until you let Ye-ji leave the team.

138
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,558
What?

139
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,727
I always thought it was odd
how we couldn't go to class

140
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,688
just because we're on a sports team.

141
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,902
Did you all lose your minds?
Stop right there.

142
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,821
Ko Yu-rim!

143
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,824
What are you doing? Get her!

144
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,704
I'll also not be training
until you let Ye-ji leave the team.

145
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,289
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,301
Hurry and take a seat.

147
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,353
What happened?

148
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,962
Actions speak louder than words.

149
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,380
You did the right thing.

150
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,270
Eyes on me. I may not have
standard good looks, but I'm your type.

151
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,695
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

152
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,912
Gosh, I'm tired of this.

153
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,540
I can't believe that
after 12 years of school,

154
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,502
there is another school to go to.

155
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,463
But this is our last summer in uniforms.

156
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,382
I'm a bit sad.

157
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,760
-Hey, Ji-woong!
-Hey!

158
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,512
You're wearing the t-shirt.

159
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,598
You're so funny.

160
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,976
Hey, show it off properly.
Take off the uniform.

161
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,395
Gosh, come on.

162
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,899
-Oh my gosh.
-That's so cool.

163
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,567
Hey, should I buy something like this too?

164
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,196
Should I?

165
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,198
-It won't suit you.
-Ji-woong, should I buy one too?

166
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,116
Hey, let's go.

167
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,243
Wear it properly.

168
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,288
You, step forward.

169
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,211
Are you wearing

170
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,672
a t-shirt worn by a fugitive?

171
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,841
Well…

172
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,050
You, punk.

173
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,264
You're out of your mind, you punk.

174
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,724
Hey, do you think school is a joke?

175
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,518
Why you little…

176
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,063
A punk like you should get beaten up
to come to your senses!

177
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,064
Please stop!

178
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,276
I said please stop.

179
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,070
When are you going to
stop assaulting students?

180
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,990
Why do you hit them
when you can just talk to them?

181
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,534
Corporal punishment is now prohibited.
Don't you know?

182
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,870
What?

183
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,041
Then tell the police.

184
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,336
Go on and report me, you punk!

185
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,756
What are you looking at!

186
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,055
Hey, Seung-wan.

187
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,230
Yes, I'm calling
from Tae Yang High School.

188
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,400
We have a teacher
who habitually assaults students.

189
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,404
Yes.

190
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,573
Yes.

191
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,080
I called the police.

192
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,916
You can speak to me.

193
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,003
Get back to your class! Now! Go and study!

194
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,423
What? Police?

195
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,343
-Get back inside!
-That's Seung-wan over there.

196
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,304
Go back to your class immediately!

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,898
Since people are watching,
let's go to my office.

198
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,483
You two can come too.

199
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,443
Ji-woong has to go to the infirmary first.

200
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,572
Go put on some ointment.

201
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,657
No, I'll go with you.

202
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,035
Yu-rim.

203
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,788
Can you take him to the infirmary?

204
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,873
Yes.

205
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,459
-Please, this way.
-Yes.

206
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,257
Seung-wan. What on earth happened?

207
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,342
Let's talk later.

208
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,220
Listen.

209
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,931
He wore a fugitive's t-shirt to school
for god's sake.

210
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,475
-Should I just sit back and watch?
-You could have talked to him

211
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,019
or punished him.

212
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,854
But you always hit them first.

213
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,233
Today isn't your first time.
You do this all the time.

214
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,736
-Punks like that don't listen!
-Do they listen to you if you hit them?

215
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,448
If so, then there should only be
good students in this school.

216
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,118
You punk! I've been nice to you
for getting good grades…

217
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,413
That's right. You've never hit me
because I'm at the top of my class.

218
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,666
I've never been hit,
yet I've called the police.

219
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,835
Do you think I'll change too if you hit me

220
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,212
and not report you to the police
even if I get beaten to a pulp?

221
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,298
-What did you just say?
-Stop it, Seung-wan.

222
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,301
You didn't get hit.
Why are you going to this extent?

223
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,635
Because…

224
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,515
I don't want to live
just minding my own business

225
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,184
just because it doesn't concern me.

226
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,607
Well, listen.

227
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,652
You shouldn't talk like that
to your teacher.

228
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,988
And even if you report to the police,

229
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,532
there's nothing much we can do.

230
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,784
What do you mean?

231
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,953
Corporal punishment is prohibited
in schools,

232
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:17,458
but it is the school
that has the authority to manage that.

233
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,543
What?

234
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,797
So, there's nothing students can do

235
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,342
even if we're beaten until we bleed?

236
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,177
Then don't do things
that deserve getting hit.

237
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,767
Gosh, how am I supposed to educate
without corporal punishment?

238
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,061
What is this world coming to?

239
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,191
Yes, I know. It must be
a lot of hard work for the teachers.

240
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,445
This would have been
unthinkable in the past.

241
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,906
That's what I mean.

242
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,117
Goodness.

243
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,288
Just give it up already!

244
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,040
1999 HAENGDONG STUDIO APARTMENT
ASSAULT INCIDENT REPORT

245
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,958
You'll regret it.

246
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,543
Look at that. Stop it right there.

247
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,630
I saw that.

248
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,841
Sir, you've been gone for too long.

249
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,844
I heard that you're not a trainee anymore.
So why are you here?

250
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,388
Here.

251
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,014
ENERGY DRINK

252
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,893
Is Kim Hong-ju being questioned
for possessing drugs?

253
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,479
That's what I heard.

254
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,693
I don't know. I know nothing about that.

255
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,069
Come on, sir.

256
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,196
-I really don't know a thing.
-I know you do.

257
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,406
Detective Kim.

258
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,994
-Not even a little welcome?
-Hey.

259
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,372
Gosh. Time sure flies.

260
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,915
He started as a reporter
the same time you did, right?

261
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,918
Yes, but we share nothing in common.

262
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,129
You were at Tae Yang High?

263
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,797
Yes, I was.

264
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,173
A report on school corporal punishment?

265
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,509
How did you know?

266
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,846
That's the news I've been waiting for.

267
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,306
Now that it's banned,
students have lost their minds

268
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,183
to dare report to the police about it.

269
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,561
You've brought news for me.

270
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,441
I've heard of it,
but it was my first time getting a call.

271
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,109
What's the name of the student
who called the police?

272
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,445
Ji…

273
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,614
What was it? Was it Ji Seung-wan?

274
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,241
That's right. Ji Seung-wan.

275
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,702
She's got some nerves

276
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,288
and she was very abrasive.

277
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,622
Can I have more info?

278
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,959
-She…
-Hey, long time no see.

279
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,753
-Hey.
-What case is it?

280
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,505
What do you care?

281
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm in the sports dept,
and you're in the local dept.

282
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,926
As a reporter, I'm just curious.

283
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,636
Here's the thing.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,722
Now with corporal punishment banned,

285
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:41,518
these youngsters are calling the police
even when they are slightly hit.

286
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,312
What is the world coming to?

287
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,773
So, tell me more about the case.

288
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,566
Your call will be directed to--

289
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,532
-Your call will be directed to--
-Why isn't Seung-wan picking up her phone?

290
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,870
You had a long day. I should go.

291
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,954
Bye.

292
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,498
Are you Ji Seung-wan?

293
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,833
Do I know you?

294
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,711
I'm reporter Ji Yun-Seong from KBY.

295
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,339
You've called the police today
for corporal punishment at school, right?

296
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,883
I would like to hear more.
How about an interview?

297
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,301
What kind of interview?

298
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,429
You can tell me what happened
and why you had to call the police.

299
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,972
You know, a simple conversation.

300
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,477
If I agree, that means
my story will be on the news, right?

301
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,063
Then I can let people know

302
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,690
how serious corporal punishment is
even when it's been banned?

303
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,276
Yes, of course.

304
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,612
But are you really a reporter?

305
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,448
Right, let me give you my card.

306
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,077
Here, I'm reporter Ji Yun-seong.

307
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,830
Don't do it.

308
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,292
Yun-seong.

309
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,003
She's my cousin.

310
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,965
-What?
-She's my cousin.

311
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,218
So don't exploit her
for the story that you want to write.

312
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,471
Hey, what do you mean by "exploit"?

313
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,765
You weren't going to cover the realities
of corporal punishment at schools.

314
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,727
You were going to frame the students
as brats for calling the police.

315
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,979
Is that true?

316
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,358
Well, I heard kids are calling the police,
even when it's a slight graze.

317
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,693
That's why.

318
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,736
Then how much should a student
put up with?

319
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,989
What's the standard?

320
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,908
Can you report if there's blood,
and not if there's a bruise?

321
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,704
Hey, that's not what I meant.
I'm talking about our society in general.

322
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,207
Parents oppose banning corporal punishment
because it degrades teachers' authority.

323
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,460
Teachers' authority?

324
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,963
Yes, that's important.

325
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,967
But what's the point
if that's upheld by violence?

326
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,306
Anyway, this isn't the case that
you're looking for.

327
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,600
And I've graduated from this school,
so I know.

328
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,518
He is an abusive teacher.

329
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,566
Look for another case,
unless you want to lie about this one.

330
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,775
Let's go.

331
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,111
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL

332
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,863
Darn it, that beanpole.

333
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,828
You said your life was boring.
Look what fun trouble you're in.

334
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,997
I know.

335
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,293
So many things have crumbled down today.

336
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,672
Even if you report
the teachers for assault,

337
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,176
they can't do anything.

338
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,845
The case will be handed to
the Office of Education,

339
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,139
which will then
get sent back to the school.

340
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,642
What is that?

341
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,480
It's the world you're going to enter soon.

342
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,025
I thought that I was relatively…

343
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,778
I said relatively, okay?

344
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,157
Anyway, I thought
I was relatively on the smart side.

345
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
But I wasn't.

346
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,455
My life had been in vain.

347
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,917
If you hadn't shown up,

348
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,836
I would be doing the interview by now.

349
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,006
So it would have been great
if you had answered your phone.

350
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,092
I called to give you a heads-up.

351
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,512
I see. It was you who was calling me.

352
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,558
It would be great if there's a technology
to show who's calling.

353
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,062
I don't want that.

354
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,982
Then no one would pick up
when a reporter calls.

355
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,152
I will.

356
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,864
Geez, thank you.

357
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,954
Thank you for today.

358
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,299
Was it fun to skip training?

359
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,260
Hey, Ye-ji.

360
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,305
Look at what you've done to our team.
Any thoughts?

361
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,389
This isn't her fault.

362
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,640
Then is it all my fault?

363
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,310
Yu-rim, why are you a part of this?

364
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,979
You're not the type to be like this.
Who changed you?

365
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,773
Coach, can you let the others go?

366
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,069
This is all my fault,
so you should scold only me.

367
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,071
Why? Can't you handle this?

368
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,075
And yet you've managed to tell me that
you want to quit fencing?

369
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,539
I'm not going to let you quit that easily.

370
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,791
-Coach!
-Coach!

371
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,544
If you really want to quit,
there's only one way.

372
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,214
Get to the quarterfinals at the nationals

373
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,508
and I'll let you go.

374
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,843
The quarterfinals?

375
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,178
Why? Can't you do it?

376
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,264
Yes.

377
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,808
I can.

378
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,144
I will.

379
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,273
But if you don't make it, you can't quit.

380
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,610
If you want to quit fencing
and start a new life…

381
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,280
prove to me how determined you are.

382
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,753
Will I be able to make it

383
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,838
to the quarterfinals?

384
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,009
-We'll help you.
-We'll help you.

385
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,220
One, two.

386
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,473
-One, two.
-Prêtes? Allez.

387
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,644
Attaque. Touche.
Ye-ji, you need to concentrate.

388
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,728
Allez.

389
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,899
Contre-attaque. Touche.

390
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,776
Ye-ji.

391
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,154
You need thrust with a bigger motion.
Your arm is too slow.

392
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,074
Look.

393
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,327
Even if you do a big motion here,
don't go too far.

394
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,870
-Hit here right away.
-Okay.

395
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,747
-And keep your elbow in position.
-Okay.

396
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,944
Prêtes? Allez.

397
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,656
Attaque. Touche.

398
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,826
Prêtes?

399
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,035
Allez.

400
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,372
Attaque.

401
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,919
That was really well done!

402
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,714
-You did it!
-I'm proud of you!

403
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,799
That was great!

404
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,218
See, you can do it if you try!

405
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,679
-Thank you.
-Great job!

406
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,222
I did it!

407
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,849
You totally got it!

408
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,188
Well done.

409
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,481
There are things
we can do only at our age,

410
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,525
like going on a field trip
or a school trip.

411
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,903
I've never been on any of those.

412
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,489
Gosh, I can't stand to watch this.

413
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,866
That's what I look like?

414
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,451
-Yes, that's you.
-Sharing snacks…

415
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,994
I can't watch this!

416
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,039
You'll get used to it like I did.

417
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,874
After a school trip,

418
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,417
-That's Yu-rim!
-classmates will talk about things

419
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,919
that I know nothing about.

420
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,630
That made me jealous and sad

421
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,797
-Why?
-at the same time.

422
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,467
-I feel distant because you're on TV.
-I could never be part of that.

423
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,137
Then let's get closer again.

424
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,015
Geez, what is this?

425
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,184
Seriously, what is this?

426
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,811
What are you doing?

427
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,022
Look, that's us!

428
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,857
We're on TV!

429
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,163
It's back on!

430
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,543
What? Where did I go?

431
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,837
I'm not on the show anymore?

432
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,384
Ji-woong, we've already seen this.

433
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,802
You're not on anymore.

434
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,012
I missed it.

435
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,182
-It's okay. Don't worry.
-The moment of my TV debut.

436
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,269
Move. You're blocking the TV.

437
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,355
It's crazy to get cable now, right?

438
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,606
Yes.

439
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,193
-Hello.
-Hello.

440
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,863
-Hello.
-Look who's here. Reporter Back.

441
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,573
The documentary is a hit!

442
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,201
I could feel how passionate you were
just by watching it.

443
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,370
Thank you.

444
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,833
There's no baseball game today?
You are all here at this hour.

445
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,585
No, the postseason starts tomorrow.

446
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,380
Right. Did you see the schedule?
The games overlap once.

447
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,048
Why is there an overlap
during the playoffs?

448
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,134
There are now Magic League
and Dream League,

449
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,969
so two games will be on the same day.

450
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,305
What's with this two-league system?

451
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,307
I'm on live at the studio, so I can't go.

452
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,017
What are you saying?

453
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,685
Then who can cover the Daegu game?

454
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,690
Excuse me, is there a game in Daegu?

455
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,735
Yes, it's Lions versus Giants.

456
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,113
I see. I'm going there on Saturday
for fencing.

457
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,532
I could go there a day earlier to cover.

458
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,745
Baseball isn't my field, but can I try?

459
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,290
Today's Game Seven of the playoffs
between Lions and Giants

460
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,042
was a close match.

461
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,544
Giants won six to five
in the eleventh inning.

462
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,630
Lions… Gosh.

463
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,550
The fire started from the MOU
on the fourth floor…

464
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,679
Yes, please continue.

465
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,431
Reporter Back Yi-jin?

466
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,063
Goodness.

467
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,983
Okay. Today's Game…

468
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,902
All right, everyone on standby!

469
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,487
Yes, sir.

470
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,200
Today's Game Seven of the playoffs
between Lions and Giants was a close one,

471
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,993
which ended in the eleventh inning

472
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,912
where Lions…won.

473
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,497
Gosh, I don't know!

474
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,627
Giants won against Lions by one run

475
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,798
during Game Seven of the playoffs
to advance into the Korean Series.

476
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,343
But there was an unfortunate incident
during the game.

477
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,887
Connecting now to Daegu for updates.

478
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,138
Back Yi-jin reports.

479
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,354
Today's Game Seven of the playoffs between
Lions and Giants was a close match,

480
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,648
which ended in the eleventh inning.

481
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,442
Giants won six to five.

482
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,819
At the end of the fourth inning,

483
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,321
Lions had two home runs from
Lee Seung-yuop and Kim Ki-tae,

484
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,490
which put them in the lead,

485
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,910
but allowed José a home run
at the start of the sixth inning.

486
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,911
And…

487
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:30,875
UBS
LIVE FROM DAEGU

488
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,212
That's when eggs were thrown
from the stand,

489
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,925
one of them hitting José.

490
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,349
This enraged José
to throw a bat to the stand,

491
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,437
leading to a fight between the spectators
and the Giants players.

492
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,397
José was given a red card

493
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,275
and the game resumed after 16 minutes.

494
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,110
Both teams exchanged runs

495
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:01,030
and the game ended in the eleventh inning
when Kim Min-jae from Giants hit a double

496
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,367
to end the game,
which lasted for four hours and a half.

497
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,703
Giants will move on to the Korean Series

498
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,330
to play against the Eagles.

499
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,417
Okay!

500
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,462
-What happened? What's wrong?
-My goodness.

501
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,090
Look.

502
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,468
Did you use a water-based pen
when it's raining?

503
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,387
Goodness.

504
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,806
So did you just do that from memory?

505
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,184
Gosh, were you able to remember all that?

506
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,978
Reporter Back, you've come a long way!

507
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,608
Gosh, that was scary.

508
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,160
Yes, I just arrived at the lobby.

509
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,370
Yes.

510
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,540
It's chilly outside, so dress warmly.

511
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,585
Yes, all right.

512
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,256
Gosh, I'm tired.

513
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,093
Have you seen the luggage here?

514
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,012
Sorry?

515
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,394
I'm sure I left it here.

516
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,730
Haven't you seen it? It's a big suitcase.

517
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,690
What?

518
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,570
Why is everyone
doing this to me today? Gosh.

519
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,823
Let's see…

520
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,199
May I help you?

521
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,327
I think this man here needs some help,

522
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,121
but he can't speak English.
Can anyone speak French?

523
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,875
I'm afraid we don't have staff
who can speak French at the moment.

524
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,211
What's the matter?

525
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,671
Do you speak French?

526
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,965
-Yes.
-Thank you.

527
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,717
My luggage disappeared
while I was at the checkout.

528
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,345
I'm sure I put it here.

529
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,806
He put his luggage here,

530
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,724
but it was gone
when he came back from the checkout.

531
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,810
Do you mean his suitcase?

532
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,938
Can you see over there?
That taxi driver took it.

533
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,399
-I see.
-He asked for a taxi earlier.

534
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,110
Your taxi driver took your luggage.

535
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,612
It's that taxi over there.

536
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,406
Oh, I see.

537
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,743
That's such a relief.
I thought someone took it and I panicked.

538
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,871
Thank you so much.

539
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,039
You're welcome. Have a great day.

540
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,040
Same to you.

541
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,464
I got here fast, right?
I'm starving. Let's go!

542
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,467
Hurry!

543
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,808
What should we have?

544
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,311
Gosh, it's pouring!

545
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,148
Do you know how to speak French?

546
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,401
It's nothing.

547
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,071
Why? Do you find it funny
that I can speak French

548
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,990
when I misspell Korean?

549
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,910
Yes. Explain yourself.

550
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,786
Right now. I want an explanation.

551
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,663
When I was young,

552
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,291
I lived in Paris for a while
because of Mom.

553
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,834
That's when I learned to fence.

554
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
In Paris?

555
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,006
Was Jae-kyung a correspondent in Paris?

556
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,802
Yes. And besides,
many fencers know how to speak French.

557
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,640
En garde, prêtes, allez.
This is all in French.

558
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,021
I'm quite impressed, Hee-do.

559
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,565
Merci beaucoup.

560
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,568
It's raining. Let's go together.

561
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,489
-This tastes good.
-It's good?

562
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,490
Yes.

563
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,619
But why are you reporting on baseball?

564
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,287
That's not your field.

565
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,622
Games overlapped.

566
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,334
Actually, all I had to do was
to report the game results,

567
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,586
but things went crazy today.

568
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,171
Eggs were thrown from the stand,

569
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,674
and a player threw a bat
to the spectators.

570
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,676
It was the worst game ever.

571
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,969
Gosh, really?

572
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,513
What's with the baseball fans
all the time?

573
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,015
Hey, can you keep your voices down?

574
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,184
If you're from the away team,
eat up and leave.

575
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,852
Why do you have to be so loud?

576
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,479
Are they talking to you?

577
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,273
-Is it me? Probably not.
-I can't even talk while I'm eating?

578
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,360
Why are you picking a fight with us
when your team lost?

579
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,903
What are you talking about!

580
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,364
You know who screwed up the game!

581
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,867
What kind of a player
throws his bat to the spectators?

582
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,411
Did you forget why he did that?

583
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,163
-You guys threw eggs first.
-Are they fighting?

584
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,249
-No, it's because of their accent.
-You were so rude.

585
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,584
-They're just talking.
-Why did they have to do that?

586
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,421
Hey, are you done talking?

587
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,217
No, I'm not done.

588
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,263
Aren't you ashamed of not winning
after spending all that money?

589
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,100
You've come all the way here
and got a lot of gall!

590
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,601
Yes, I have!

591
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,020
Do you think Giants will win?

592
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,231
With your squad, never!

593
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,067
I would have played better than that.

594
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,653
-Then you try!
-I'm going to!

595
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,199
Gentlemen.

596
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,203
I understand what you're going through

597
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,998
but let's enjoy a quiet meal. Please?

598
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,960
It's the players who are the most upset
after losing a game.

599
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,463
Why you little…

600
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,597
You're that fencer.

601
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,848
What?

602
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,141
-Yes?
-Really?

603
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,352
You're right.

604
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,023
I also saw you in a documentary.

605
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,733
-You're Na Hee-do, right?
-She is.

606
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,485
-You're Na Hee-do.
-You're right.

607
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,694
-She's Na Hee-do.
-Yes.

608
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,780
-No, you're wrong.
-What?

609
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,531
-She is.
-You got the wrong person.

610
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,909
-Yes, she is.
-No, she's not.

611
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,452
-Can I get an autograph?
-Sorry.

612
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,871
Please enjoy your meal.

613
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,749
Gosh, that was her.

614
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,504
Geez. Why aren't you afraid of anything?

615
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,756
They were drunk hooligans, for god's sake.

616
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,259
I get ticked off
whenever someone says this,

617
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,053
and he said exactly that.

618
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,891
What do you mean
"I would have played better than that"?

619
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:05,812
Gosh, then why didn't he? He should have.

620
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,190
If he thinks he's going to be that great,
he should start right now.

621
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,650
It's never too late.

622
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,987
Well begun is half done! So please
do it before you say anything!

623
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,324
Seriously. He's all bark and no bite.

624
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,370
It's the players themselves
who want to do well the most!

625
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,704
Darn it!

626
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,917
Are you done?

627
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,752
I'm done!

628
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,296
Come. You'll catch a cold.

629
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,690
You should get inside.

630
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,109
Well…

631
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,403
Where are you staying?

632
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,906
Me? It takes
only about ten minutes by taxi.

633
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,825
That's close.

634
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,996
What time are you coming
to the stadium tomorrow?

635
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,622
Probably in the afternoon.

636
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,666
I see.

637
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,172
I should go.

638
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,174
Get back safely.

639
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,758
You should go in.

640
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,940
Wait, that's right!

641
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,944
Yu-rim asked me to get some milk
on my way back but I completely forgot.

642
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,533
Really? Then I can go with you.
You don't have an umbrella.

643
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,743
Shall we?

644
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,539
-But has the rain stopped?
-No, I don't think so.

645
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,250
-Let's go!
-But…

646
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,836
I think it stopped.

647
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,588
It's cold! That was the rain.

648
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,803
DONGIL SUPERMARKET

649
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,616
Are you only watching tomorrow?

650
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,035
Yes.

651
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,329
Three months is longer than I thought.

652
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,584
Well, it must feel very weird to not fence
while you're in the stadium.

653
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,046
Or, would it be more comforting

654
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,631
since you won't be pressured?

655
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,009
Feeling pressure is also an experience.

656
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,470
Yu-rim and I are missing out on that.

657
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,689
An athlete has to compete.

658
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,777
You have to compete to know that
you've improved, regardless of the result.

659
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,821
That's what keeps us going.

660
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,324
But I've lost the chance
to improve myself for now.

661
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,371
And what's the point of being an athlete

662
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,540
when you can't compete?

663
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,338
Are you growing up fast

664
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,300
or is it me who didn't realize that
you were already grown up?

665
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,471
I think it's both
since I'm still growing up.

666
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,143
But why aren't I getting taller?

667
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,315
I think you are very different

668
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,151
from who you were last year.

669
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,947
I guess I'll see another you next year
when you turn 20.

670
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,574
I bet.

671
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,452
I'm even going to be a real adult.

672
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,997
I want to stay by your side

673
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,083
and watch you grow into a great person.

674
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,093
Let's go.

675
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,397
Here. You should go in.
Yu-rim must be waiting for you.

676
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,315
Okay.

677
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,484
Get back safely

678
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,153
-and have a good night.
-You too.

679
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,226
Reporter Back Yi-jin?

680
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,107
Fencer Jung Ho-jin?

681
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,278
Can we talk for a minute?

682
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,408
It's been a while.

683
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,495
I guess

684
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,956
you two are still close.

685
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,042
I mean you and Cutie Pie.

686
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,377
What did you want to talk about?

687
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,755
The thing is…

688
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,883
I'm not over Cutie Pie.

689
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,180
Since you're close to her,
can you tell her

690
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,598
that I'm still here for her?

691
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,808
Don't wait around.

692
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,101
What? Why not?

693
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,520
You're not important to Hee-do

694
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,230
and there's no chance
of you getting back together.

695
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,775
She is already having a hard time
being suspended, so leave her alone.

696
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,320
And drop using that nickname "Cutie Pie."

697
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,489
Why are you getting angry at me?

698
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,783
-When did I--
-I'm kidding.

699
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,121
I'm not hung up on Cutie Pie.

700
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,498
What are you trying to pull?

701
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,001
I was just sounding you out.

702
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,836
Because I think we broke up

703
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,088
because of you.

704
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,134
Sweetie Pie, let's break up.

705
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,887
What are you saying?

706
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,513
Do you mean it?

707
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,599
But…

708
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,978
you shouldn't call me that
when you want to break up.

709
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,522
Let's put that aside.

710
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,566
What's the reason?

711
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,737
Well…

712
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,826
I think of someone else more than you.

713
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,953
And…

714
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,123
I shouldn't be doing that.

715
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,960
I got mad thinking over and over.

716
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,755
I know that someone is you.

717
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,259
I'm sure she doesn't even know
what she's doing.

718
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,553
But what about you?

719
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,891
Aren't you just toying with her?

720
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,436
Can you toy with her?

721
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
Answer me.

722
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,651
You've dated her, so you should know.
Can you?

723
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:14,698
The look in her eyes, her expression,
her thoughts, and values.

724
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,909
Toying?

725
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,913
Who would be so serious
while toying with someone?

726
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,627
You've changed a lot

727
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,421
since the last time we've met.

728
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,676
You seemed not to care at all
who Cutie Pie was dating.

729
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,010
I've changed.

730
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,763
Back then, I rooted
for every experience she had.

731
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,723
The more ordinary, the better.

732
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,226
But not anymore.

733
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,812
I feel her time is
more precious than mine.

734
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,190
So I don't want her to waste
a single moment on no good experiences.

735
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,901
She deserves to have
only the greatest experiences.

736
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,029
And that is something

737
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,241
I can do for her.

738
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,371
Did you say
she doesn't know what she is doing?

739
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,165
She doesn't need to.

740
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,167
Because I know.

741
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,851
ROUND OF 16
YOON A-REUM, LEE YE-JI

742
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,271
1999 KOREA JUNIOR
NATIONAL FENCING CHAMPIONSHIP

743
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,522
We have one match left.

744
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,442
We've trained really hard,
so just be yourself and you'll win.

745
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,612
I can really do this, right?

746
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,863
Hey.

747
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,325
Your body knows
how hard you've worked for this.

748
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,661
So don't think too much
and trust your body.

749
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,749
Yes, Hee-do.

750
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,757
-Let's go Tae Yang High!
-Let's go Tae Yang High!

751
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,592
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

752
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,510
Go!

753
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,970
-Go for it, Ye-ji!
-Go for it, Ye-ji!

754
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,478
ROUND OF 16
YOON A-REUM, LEE YE-JI

755
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,147
En garde.

756
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,900
Prêtes? Allez.

757
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,361
Action.

758
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,362
GO FOR IT, YE-JI

759
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,074
En garde. Prêtes? Allez.

760
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,665
-Let's go Ye-ji!
-Go Lee Ye-ji!

761
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,629
Attaque. Touche. Point.

762
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,006
YOON A-REUM, LEE YE-JI

763
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,383
-Great job, Ye-ji!
-Good job!

764
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,676
Prêtes? Allez.

765
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,513
Attaque. Riposte. Touche.

766
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,514
Point.

767
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,890
-That's okay!
-Go Ye-ji!

768
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,392
Go for it, Ye-ji!

769
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,352
En garde.

770
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,689
Prêtes? Allez.

771
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,442
Attaque. Point.

772
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,985
Attaque. Touche.

773
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,404
-Point.
-Let's go Ye-ji!

774
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,322
-Let's go Ye-ji!
-You're almost there!

775
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,907
Gosh, I can't watch the game!

776
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm so nervous.

777
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,329
En garde.

778
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,040
Prêtes? Allez.

779
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,559
Attaque. Touche. Point.

780
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,854
YOON A-REUM, LEE YE-JI

781
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,613
Yes, you did it!

782
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,664
That was great!

783
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,040
You're the best!

784
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,547
You did so well. Good job!

785
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,884
Well done, Ye-ji.

786
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,430
Thank you.

787
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,850
You've achieved your goal.

788
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,562
Why not compete in the quarterfinals
since this is your last day as a fencer?

789
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,901
No, Coach.

790
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,989
I would like to withdraw.

791
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,703
The other fencers here today are
more desperate than I am.

792
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,914
I don't want to
take away their opportunity.

793
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,420
I think I've had enough fencing

794
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,590
in my life.

795
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,476
What do you want to do after quitting?

796
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,103
Well…

797
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:00,025
I'm not sure, but I want to try baking.

798
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,485
To become a patissier.

799
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,321
That sounds nice.

800
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,450
Remember today.

801
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,955
Don't ever forget how you earned
a new opportunity.

802
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,041
Whenever you're having a hard time,
remind yourself

803
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,669
how difficult it was to start.

804
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,925
That's all I wanted to teach you.

805
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,556
Thank you for all your hard work.

806
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,111
Thank you, Coach.

807
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,367
Why are you crying, idiot?

808
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:09,386
LEE YE-JI

809
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:15,225
Hey, do you think it's cool
to not dress neatly?

810
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,311
This is why you're all so pathetic.

811
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,564
Gosh!

812
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,193
Get out of my sight!

813
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,573
Hello.

814
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,076
Ji Seung-wan.

815
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,124
Come to the counseling office
after sixth period.

816
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,545
Hey, stop running!

817
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,549
My friend got beaten up again.

818
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:51,303
A teacher slapped my friend
in the face and hit his head.

819
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,222
In the end,
blood ran from my friend's lips.

820
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,725
Students were watching
but none of them were in shock

821
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,478
since this teacher was known for
his behavior.

822
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:03,065
Everything happened as if that made sense,

823
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,942
and I wanted to put an end
to this nonsense.

824
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,195
So I called the police.

825
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,199
But they couldn't do anything.

826
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,242
Do you know what I thought?

827
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,161
I knew it.

828
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:20,123
It seemed so natural
for nothing to change in this world.

829
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,376
I…

830
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,796
wanted to say this out loud,
at least on this show,

831
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,798
that none of this is normal.

832
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,510
This should not happen.

833
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,428
But it did happen

834
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,349
today at Tae Yang High School

835
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,602
and the name of this abusive teacher is

836
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,437
Seo Yeong-seong.

837
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:52,948
Why?

838
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,325
Did you not see this coming

839
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,619
when you revealed the school and my name?

840
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,291
DJ Wanseung's pirate radio show? Gosh.

841
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,422
I never knew you'd be into something
like this when you're top of the school.

842
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,757
School regulation article 26.

843
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,511
A student who insults staff
or derogates staff authority

844
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,096
will be suspended.

845
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,556
School regulation article 27.

846
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,977
A student who disrupts the order
or instigates a collective action

847
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,770
will be expelled.

848
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,898
You did both at the same time.

849
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,527
These are the school regulations.

850
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,950
However, the purpose of education
isn't about punishment.

851
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,579
It's about being tolerant
of the students' wrongdoings

852
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:44,040
and leading them to be on the right track.

853
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,713
So what do I have to do?

854
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,139
Write a letter of apology that
you will never broadcast again.

855
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,475
You will go up on the podium
during the assembly

856
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,435
and read that in front of everyone.

857
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,605
You'll go over everything
you've done wrong

858
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,690
one by one, in front of the whole school.

859
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,816
And…

860
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,195
you will give me a sincere apology.

861
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,657
Did you apologize to Ji-woong?

862
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,286
What?

863
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,165
Did you apologize to him
for hitting him until he bled?

864
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,167
Why should I?

865
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,669
He has also violated
the school regulations.

866
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,798
He should be thankful that I let him off
with only a few hits.

867
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,300
So should he be thankful for the assault?

868
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,093
An assault? Hey, watch your language!

869
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,762
You watch your hands!

870
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,889
If that's not an assault, then what is it?

871
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,184
You've beaten the daylight out of him
with your bare hands.

872
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,229
And you say it's out of love?

873
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,110
Do you want to leave a spot
on your record?

874
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,779
Aren't you going to go to college?

875
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,369
College? I'm going to go.

876
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,458
But it would be embarrassing to go
with a diploma from a school like this.

877
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,419
I'm not apologizing.

878
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,506
I'm also not writing that letter
because I've done nothing wrong.

879
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,676
I refuse to accept
such ridiculous school regulations.

880
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:21,137
So I guess
there is only one thing left for me to do.

881
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,225
I'm quitting school.

882
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,523
-What?
-I'm deeply ashamed of this school

883
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,024
so I've decided to leave.

884
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,777
I'll come back with Mom.

885
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,667
So?

886
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,337
I…

887
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,716
can't write a letter of apology,

888
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,052
and I can't apologize.

889
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,222
I just can't accept this.

890
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,351
Is dropping out of school the only option?

891
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,730
How about transferring to another school?

892
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,108
That means

893
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,945
I'm admitting that
I was in the wrong. So, no.

894
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,160
Then what about CSAT?

895
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,995
I can't take it.

896
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,831
I'll have to take my GED first.

897
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,877
So do you want to throw away
all the work you've put in the past year?

898
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,479
You'll be throwing away
a whole year from your life.

899
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,275
Does this matter to you that much?

900
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,029
Yes.

901
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,366
Mom.

902
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,287
I'm sorry.

903
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,007
Seung-wan, you have to learn
how to be flexible.

904
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,053
You can't live in this world
if you only know how to break.

905
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,805
I know.

906
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,101
But I just can't do it yet, Mom.

907
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,486
I'm sorry.

908
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,447
I'm sorry, Mom.

909
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,873
That's okay.

910
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,253
I feel so sorry for you.

911
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,718
Can I try?

912
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,469
I think it'll work.

913
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,680
What is that?

914
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,348
-Why?
-It's hilarious.

915
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,726
-Go on.
-Hee-do, you try.

916
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,644
Oh my gosh, look at that.

917
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,110
Are you cleaning up?

918
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,404
Yes, some workbooks and books.

919
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,572
All of a sudden?

920
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,492
Then why did you call us here?

921
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,745
I have something to say.

922
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,956
You know about my radio show, right?

923
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,959
I insulted our school
and Mr.Seo on my show.

924
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,503
But Mr. Seo found out about it.

925
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,256
So I've decided to quit school.

926
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,924
My mom will be here tomorrow.

927
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:50,972
What are you saying?

928
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,060
You're dropping out
for making a little insult about school?

929
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,603
Seung-wan, that doesn't make sense.

930
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,106
Well, that's all I can say for now.

931
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,401
You can still use the hangout,

932
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,489
but can I take that chair?
It's my favorite.

933
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,866
That's okay, right?

934
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,000
You're not quitting
because you insulted the school,

935
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,169
but because you're being cornered
for calling the police, right?

936
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,630
Mr. Seo's been asking around
trying to dig up dirt on you.

937
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,050
-You're wrong, Ji-woong.
-No, I know I'm right.

938
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,013
So what did he tell you to do?

939
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,184
Why do you have to quit school?
How has this gone so far?

940
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,188
He told me to apologize to him
and write a letter of apology,

941
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,231
so I said no.

942
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,778
So you're dropping out of school?

943
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,738
When CSAT will be in a month?

944
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,784
Why are you doing all this?

945
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,286
You don't have to.

946
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,248
This is all because of me.

947
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,501
No, it isn't. I'm doing this for my sake.

948
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,045
Then think this over.
Not for you, but for my sake.

949
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,590
Haven't you thought about

950
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,009
how much guilt I would bear
if you leave like this?

951
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,427
You're always right.

952
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,388
You've been right all along,

953
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,183
but not this time, Seung-wan.

954
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:18,935
Please.

955
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,231
I'm sorry I insulted my teacher
on the show.

956
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,068
I'll never slander the school again
on the show.

957
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,780
I'll have to write this
and read it in front of everyone.

958
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,366
I'll have to
bow to Mr. Seo with an apology

959
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,076
and beg for him to forgive me.

960
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,912
Are you asking me to do all this?

961
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,379
Ji-woong, don't cry.

962
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,341
I'm right again this time.

963
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,761
Your only weakness…

964
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,308
is having me as your friend.

965
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,727
You're perfect

966
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,438
but I always put you into trouble.

967
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,401
That really upsets me.

968
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,653
Are you kidding?

969
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,240
That's the whole reason
why I'm friends with you.

970
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,828
I would've killed myself out of boredom
if it wasn't for you.

971
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,707
Are you enjoying this?

972
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,793
Is this fun for you?

973
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:26,961
Yes.

974
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,965
I'm going to continue
to have fun with you.

975
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,186
Don't cry.

976
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,027
I'm fine.

977
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,336
Is this the school that
repeatedly assaults its students?

978
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,422
There he is, the abusive teacher.

979
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:17,011
How dare you have the audacity
to keep your job without an apology,

980
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,013
and tell my daughter to apologize?

981
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,225
And you still call yourself a teacher?

982
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,393
Mom…

983
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,479
Ma'am, all right. Please calm down.

984
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,022
How can I?

985
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,026
You're covering for him.
So that means you're on his side.

986
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,903
Ma'am, I can explain.

987
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,865
Dropping out of a trashy school like this
won't leave a spot on my daughter's life.

988
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,244
Bring the papers so I can sign them now.

989
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,829
And you!

990
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,711
Apologize to Ji-woong.
He is like a son to me.

991
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,588
If you don't,

992
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,215
I'm going to describe
your assault in detail

993
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,718
and officially file a complaint
to the Parent's Association.

994
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,640
I can't believe I sent my daughter
to this horrendous school.

995
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,019
This is by far the most embarrassing.

996
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,562
Where are the papers?

997
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,690
Yes, of course. The papers.

998
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,527
Geez. So I take after my mom.

999
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,286
Seung-wan.

1000
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,871
Are you really leaving?

1001
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,247
-Don't go.
-Stay.

1002
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,499
-Are you serious?
-Think again.

1003
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,543
-Don't go.
-Do you have to go now?

1004
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,087
I have to go.

1005
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,053
Messages from everyone?

1006
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,598
You shouldn't have.

1007
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,850
You guys are so cute.

1008
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,477
BE HAPPY, SEUNG-WAN
WE LOVE YOU

1009
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,648
Thanks to you,
the class was filled with laughter

1010
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,900
even in our senior year.

1011
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,070
Yes, it was fun from the moment
you became the class president.

1012
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,365
It was also fun making bets
while watching fencing.

1013
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,783
-Right.
-I know.

1014
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,161
I will never forget what you played for us

1015
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,746
during the fireworks.

1016
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,418
I could have pulled off an amazing event
at our graduation.

1017
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,753
I'll miss that.

1018
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,884
Guys, don't forget to invite me
to the class reunion.

1019
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,303
I'm still the class president, okay?

1020
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,097
-Got it.
-Of course.

1021
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,181
-Sure thing.
-You have to come.

1022
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,475
-Definitely.
-It won't be a reunion without you.

1023
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:28,726
You have to promise to show up.

1024
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,936
-I'll say.
-That's right.

1025
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,312
Don't cry.

1026
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,855
Stop crying.

1027
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,360
I'm really going now.

1028
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,570
-Bye.
-Bye, Seung-wan.

1029
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,905
-Take care.
-Stay well.

1030
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,323
-Remember us.
-Keep in touch!

1031
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,450
-Goodbye.
-Don't forget about us.

1032
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,910
-Seung-wan!
-Stay in touch!

1033
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,371
You now have one less competitor.

1034
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,374
Good luck with your CSAT!

1035
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,335
-We'll do our best.
-Thanks, we will.

1036
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:55,878
-Good luck!
-Thank you!

1037
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,423
The class president will now
make her exit.

1038
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,383
Seung-wan, we love you!

1039
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,884
Seung-wan, good luck!

1040
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,429
-Seung-wan, we love you!
-You're the best!

1041
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,806
-We love you!
-We'll miss you!

1042
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,687
Bye!

1043
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,938
Take care!

1044
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,106
Don't go!

1045
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,695
You are so popular.

1046
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,905
I'm jealous.

1047
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,367
Don't be. Now that I'm gone
you'll be the most popular.

1048
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,411
There is a big difference.

1049
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,288
I'm just popular because of my looks.

1050
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,167
That's not true, so stop saying that.

1051
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,963
You should go back in.
The class starts soon.

1052
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,635
So what are your plans?

1053
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,805
First…

1054
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,267
I'll get a perm.

1055
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,856
-Bye!
-Goodbye, Seung-wan!

1056
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,566
-You're the best!
-We love you!

1057
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,942
-Seung-wan, you rock!
-Bye!

1058
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,486
-Good luck!
-Bye!

1059
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,653
-See you!
-Seung-wan!

1060
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,030
-We love you!
-Goodbye!

1061
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,199
-We love you!
-We'll miss you!

1062
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,825
Why can't I open this?

1063
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,204
Is it locked?

1064
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,081
Yes, I think so.

1065
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,336
You're on the fencing team.
Then you must know Hee-do.

1066
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:19,879
Isn't there training today?

1067
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,216
As of today, I quit the fencing team.

1068
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,425
Really?

1069
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,886
I also quit school today.

1070
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,473
Nice to meet you.

1071
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,854
But how do we get out?

1072
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,775
Tae Yang High is in our way again.

1073
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,778
Let's climb over this.

1074
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,573
Then let me push you up
since I was on the sports team.

1075
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,410
I know we've just met, but thank you.

1076
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,620
Sure.

1077
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,749
Here.

1078
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,959
TAE YANG HIGH SCHOOL

1079
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,377
-Here I go.
-Yes.

1080
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,462
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

1081
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,464
-One more time.
-Yes, once more.

1082
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,341
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

1083
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,680
I think we should have only one candle.

1084
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,391
What's the point then?
Let's put as many as their age.

1085
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,518
But they are not the same age.

1086
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,270
Think about it.

1087
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,230
What's going on?

1088
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,443
Hee-do, you ruined it.

1089
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,571
Hey, this isn't my fault!

1090
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:30,074
And you two, how did you get here?
I locked the gate.

1091
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,076
It was you who locked it?

1092
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,037
Gosh. So were you the ones
standing in our way.

1093
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,004
Here, blow out the candle!

1094
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,089
What's this? This feels so awkward.

1095
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,799
Stop and just blow it.

1096
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:50,094
One, two, three!

1097
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,684
-Congratulations on your new beginning!
-Congratulations on your new beginning!

1098
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,940
-All right!
-Thank you.

1099
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,401
So we're done with this.

1100
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,697
-Wait!
-Don't!

1101
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,660
Hey, hold on.

1102
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,372
Hey!

1103
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,751
Please, stop!

1104
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,545
-Come on!
-This is your last day!

1105
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,963
No!

1106
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,131
That's right!

1107
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,760
I was completely fed up with you, school!

1108
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,974
I was also completely fed up with fencing!

1109
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,111
That autumn,

1110
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,324
they tried breaking
without knowing how to bend.

1111
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,162
-Go for it!
-Good luck!

1112
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,706
-We're rooting for you!
-Go for it!

1113
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,500
-You can do this!
-You can do this!

1114
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,085
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1115
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,419
-Wish you all the best!
-Go!

1116
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:06,629
There they are.

1117
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,548
Guys, good luck with your CSAT!

1118
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,551
What? Did you come to cheer us on?

1119
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,137
Yu-rim, you said you were in bed.

1120
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,058
I hope you can guess
all the right answers.

1121
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,435
Where's mine?

1122
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,603
I don't have one.

1123
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,815
Aren't you going to work?

1124
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:26,983
I just stopped by.

1125
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:30,653
Here. Just keep your cool
and make sure to get 80 points.

1126
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,531
Gosh, who do you think I am?
I'll score higher than that.

1127
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,036
But is it just us two…

1128
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,289
taking the CSAT?

1129
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,000
Does this feel right?

1130
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,795
What's wrong?

1131
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,298
You should get inside.

1132
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:52,883
Go for it!

1133
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,719
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

1134
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,012
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

1135
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,139
-I'll get 100 points!
-Go for it!

1136
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,683
-Hope you get 80 points!
-You can do it!

1137
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,018
-I can do this!
-Good luck!

1138
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,811
-Don't give up!
-Go for it!

1139
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,646
-Hurry up.
-Go inside.

1140
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,148
-Hurry!
-Good luck!

1141
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,775
Is it because of the crack
that formed when they broke?

1142
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,362
Everything started to change slowly.

1143
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,708
The world was also getting ready
for a change.

1144
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,668
The new millennium?

1145
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:28,878
THE NEW MILLENNIUM DISCOUNT

1146
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:33,674
Gosh, this is hot.

1147
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,886
BASIC has warned that

1148
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,139
if we fail to address the issues
arising from the Millennium Bug,

1149
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,224
where computers fail to recognize
the year 2000,

1150
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,562
there could even be a nuclear strike.

1151
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,191
-How many minutes until the year 2000?
-Thirty minutes.

1152
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:52,943
But what if the world
comes to an end because of a nuke?

1153
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,363
-Hi, Yi-jin.
-Hey, Yi-jin.

1154
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:59,575
Gosh. You guys are breaking and entering
on a daily basis.

1155
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,619
Why do you keep hanging out here?

1156
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,747
Yi-jin, that's not the issue right now.
Come and sit down.

1157
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,665
He's right. This world might end.

1158
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,669
When are you getting rid of that perm?
How long do I have to see that?

1159
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,047
-It's pretty.
-Yes, it is.

1160
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,257
Right. You look pretty.

1161
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,429
But people aren't stupid enough
to not have prepared for this.

1162
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,350
They are prepared, but nobody knows
what could go wrong.

1163
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,351
Really?

1164
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,062
Then could the world actually
come to an end?

1165
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,773
You seem pretty excited.
The color is back on your face.

1166
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,150
I'm really curious. What will happen then?

1167
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,071
Let's see.

1168
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,657
We'll be

1169
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:44,537
the first to witness the end of the world.

1170
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,705
That's awesome.

1171
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,667
Wouldn't we all just be dead?

1172
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,295
No way! There are so many things
I didn't get to try yet.

1173
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,048
What if the world does end?

1174
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,216
Mom is home by herself.

1175
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,885
Same. Dad went to Geojedo,

1176
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,345
so my mom is alone too.

1177
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,347
Right.

1178
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,433
We should spend our last moments
with family.

1179
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,644
I'm going.

1180
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,938
-Should we go too?
-Yes.

1181
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,192
Bye.

1182
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,069
Hee-do, aren't you going?

1183
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,696
There's no one at home.

1184
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,948
My mom is working late
in case of a news flash.

1185
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,033
I see. We'll go now.

1186
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,077
-Take care, Yi-jin.
-Thanks.

1187
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,875
See you next year,

1188
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,919
if there is one.

1189
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,783
Let's watch TV
to see the Bosingak bell-ringing ceremony.

1190
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,078
A new millennium will begin shortly.

1191
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:14,835
People are gathered at Bosingak
to celebrate the new millennium.

1192
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,964
Countless people have shown up
to enjoy the festivities.

1193
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,676
-Two minutes until the new millennium!
-It's almost time.

1194
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:26,222
Bosingak is full of people both thrilled
and excited for the new millennium.

1195
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,849
Do you think they can get home
before the world ends?

1196
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,809
With a minute left to the new millennium,

1197
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,228
I'm here in front of Bosingak.

1198
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,355
Do you believe that
the world will end or not?

1199
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,981
Despite the extreme cold,

1200
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,109
-there is no space left to stand here.
-I'll be fine

1201
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,862
-with whatever if it happens now.
-Everyone's face is filled

1202
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:45,449
with hope and excitement
for the new millennium.

1203
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:48,827
The year 2000 will soon begin,

1204
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:54,792
and we'll ring the Bosingak bell
33 times to signal the new beginning.

1205
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,794
With the sound of hope,

1206
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:59,380
let's wish for
all the bad things to disappear

1207
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:04,176
and that only good things will happen
in the new millenium.

1208
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,136
What if the world really comes to an end?

1209
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,979
What would you like to do
before the world ends?

1210
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,445
Not really.

1211
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,703
As I speak, we have ten seconds till 2000.

1212
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:34,915
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

1213
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:39,253
Six! Five! Four! Three!

1214
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,422
Two! One!

1215
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:43,882
Let's welcome the year 2000!

1216
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,927
The bell will ring for the first time.

1217
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,538
The kiss that started when I was nineteen,

1218
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,416
ended when I was twenty.

1219
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:22,421
It was now a new year and a new century.

1220
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,966
I guess

1221
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,594
I also wanted a change for myself.

1222
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,000
Unfortunately, the world
did not come to an end.

1223
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,461
Hee-do, you and I are…

1224
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:05,130
We'll end up losing it.

1225
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,799
Nothing lasts forever.

1226
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,135
Hey, hop on!

1227
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,929
Kiss.

1228
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,263
Do you want to?

1229
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,308
What are you going to do
if that happens to you?

1230
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,103
And what if that involves Hee-do?

1231
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:22,147
You're lucky, Hee-do.
You get to say everything you want.

1232
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,317
-Hi, Jun-ho!
-Who is that?

1233
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,697
I wanted to be in the snow with you today.
I don't think we had done that before.

1234
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:43,585
