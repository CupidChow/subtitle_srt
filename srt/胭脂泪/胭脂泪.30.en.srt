No time between imm fought

Xiaoma

3
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,840
Xiaoma

4
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,760
What's the matter with you

5
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,840
I youtube

6
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,260
Dear God

7
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,260
I have stopped pie dude

00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,460
priest

9
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,540
I'll take it to the butler

10
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,580
and tell him to call you safe.

11
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,100
Who did this?

12
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,340
Zhou Yi Mu.

13
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,860
Qiang Man.

14
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,140
Zhou Yi Mu.

15
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,140
Someone!

16
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,260
Someone!

17
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,700
Commander, this poison is rare.

18
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,340
The antidote can only be taken from the North Ping Hospital.

19
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,300
And it spreads quickly.

20
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,860
When it's taken from the North Ping Hospital,

21
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,700
even if Her Ladyship is not dead,

22
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,820
our medicine will be the only thing that can keep her alive.

23
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,340
Maybe she'll become silly.

24
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,420
No hope.

25
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,420
Commander, come here.

26
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,220
Commander!

27
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,540
Captain Yu, we brought her to you!

28
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,540
I didn't expect I could come and see her today.

29
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,620
Her Ladyship!

30
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,100
Keep her alive for a few days.

31
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,380
Michelle.

32
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,340
Commander,

33
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
you have the man.

34
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
Yu Shi'an,

35
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,260
the antidote will be here soon.

36
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
Yu Shi'an,

37
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,260
this is a simple deal.

38
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,380
I'll use the life of Ye Xiaoman

39
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,940
to exchange for my freedom.

40
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,380
Commander,

41
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,380
there's...

42
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,220
Go now.

43
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,980
Ye Zhiqiu is waiting for you.

44
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,580
If anything happens to Xiaoman,

45
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,700
I'll kill you.

46
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,980
Commander,

47
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
he's awake.

48
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,620
When will he wake up?

49
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,860
He'll wake up soon.

50
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,500
Thanks to your antidote,

51
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,980
or he would have been dead.

52
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,620
Yixiu.

53
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,500
Are you all right?

54
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,940
Are you still conscious?

55
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,580
I'll go to the toilet.

56
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,700
All right.

57
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,740
Where's Da Loran?

58
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,780
You can go to the toilet.

59
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,340
Go.

60
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,540
I'll keep watch for him.

61
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,380
If he won't wake up yet,

62
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,180
I'll keep my eyes on him.

63
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,420
You know I won't.

64
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Something happened.

65
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,220
Yu Shi'an.

66
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,420
I came from Beiping.

67
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,420
The new chief of police,

68
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,820
Liang Shuping,

69
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,820
you colluded with the former commander, Lu Huai Gu,

70
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,220
to bribe the police officers.

71
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
You sold the opium.

72
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,220
The evidence is clear.

73
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
This is a arrest warrant.

74
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
You...

75
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,420
Zhou Yinguo.

76
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,420
This must be the plan

77
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,220
you made before you were arrested.

78
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Yu Shi'an.

79
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,620
Xiaoman.

80
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
You're fine.

81
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
This is great.

82
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,820
I was poisoned.

83
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,020
But it's not that serious.

84
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
Everything in the hospital

85
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,620
is for you to see.

86
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,820
Just to let you let Zhou Yinguo go.

87
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Xiaoman.

88
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
Why are you...

89
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Zhao Yingmu!

90
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
I've never

91
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,820
fought anything in my life.

92
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,420
But I lost to you.

93
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Yu Shi'an.

94
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Yu Shi'an.

95
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Yu Shi'an.

98
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
Yu Shi'an!

99
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Xiaoman.

100
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Do you remember the game we played when we were kids?

101
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
I just want to be like when we were kids.

102
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
To play with you.

103
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Yu Shi'an.

104
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
No!

105
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
No!

106
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Xiaoman, don't cry.

107
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,020
I'll show you something fun.

108
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,620
The stars are coming out.

109
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,220
Brother Shi'an, are you okay?

110
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,620
Are you dead?

111
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,420
You can't die.

112
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,620
Why are you protecting me?

113
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
Xiaoman, don't be afraid.

114
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
When I grow up,

115
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,820
I'll change this into a real gun.

116
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,220
I'll protect you for the rest of your life.

117
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Okay?

118
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,020
The stars are coming out.

119
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
Brother Shi'an.

120
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,020
The stars are coming out.

121
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
Chase after them.

122
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,020
Don't let them get in my dream.

123
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,020
Look at the sunset.

124
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,020
It's all asleep.

125
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Waiting for tomorrow to face the sun.

126
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Look.

127
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
The Zhou family is being sealed.

128
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
This is too bad.

129
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
Let's go.

130
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,020
The old master of the Zhou family is sick.

131
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
The second young master was shot.

132
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
The second and third ladies were burned to death.

133
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
The third lady was strangled to death.

134
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,020
The butler and the driver were killed.

135
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
The maid was killed.

136
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,020
And the maid was drowned in the pond.

137
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Now she's a ghost.

138
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,020
What kind of scenery was the Zhou family in the past?

139
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Isn't it?

140
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
Isn't it?

141
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
How is she?

142
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
I don't know.

143
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
So?

144
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,020
I can't tell.

145
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
This is my dream.

146
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
I'm not ready.

147
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
This is my dream.

148
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
This is my dream.

149
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
I don't know what it is.

150
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
No.

151
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,020
You're not ready.

152
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
I'm not ready.

153
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,020
You're not ready.

154
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
I'm not ready.

155
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,020
My dream is to be a ghost.

156
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
I'm not ready.

157
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
I'm not ready.

158
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
I'm not ready.

159
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,020
I'm not ready.

160
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,700
Okay.

161
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,720
Sister.

162
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,980
That crap.

163
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
You made my aunt too angry.

164
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,500
Master.

165
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,140
My sister is in charge of the household.

166
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,900
The servants are all slandering me.

167
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,300
If any servant dares to slander you,

168
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,180
I'll sell them all.

169
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,980
You're so kind.

170
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,580
You Nelson,

171
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,580
youOYou视 more intently than lots of fishes varieties.

172
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:42,700
You'reくy bewitchedRyeowN strongboard

173
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,620
Thank you for your compliment, father.

174
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
This is what I should do.

175
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,020
Oh, right. I'm about to give you your birthday.

176
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,820
I've prepared a small gift for you.

177
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,220
Oh?

178
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,420
You really do look like your father.

179
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,020
I've learned a lot from your skills.

180
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,020
Thank you for your compliment, father.

181
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,820
Master, Second Young Master,

182
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,820
there's something that the wood carving shop needs you to do.

183
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
I'll go over and get busy.

184
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,020
Come back after you're done.

185
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,820
Okay.

186
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,620
Let's go.

187
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,220
Let's go, Second Young Master.

188
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,820
Today is the 15th.

189
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Let's go to Wanxiang Temple to light some incense.

190
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Yes. Third Aunt is very kind.

191
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,420
She lights incense for the Buddha every 15th.

192
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,620
But she has given Second Young Master a lot of merit.

193
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,020
I just hope that Chan'er can be happy

194
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,220
and do what she wants to do.

195
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,620
Here.

196
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
What is this?

197
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,020
This is the cake I made.

198
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,420
Try it.

199
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,020
You try it first.

200
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,220
Thank you.

201
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
Sister.

202
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,420
I finally found you.

203
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,020
Silly sister,

204
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,620
everyone left.

205
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,820
Why aren't you leaving?

206
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
This mansion is too big.

207
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Once you enter, you can't leave this place forever.

208
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,820
But I know how to get out.

209
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Let's go. I'll take you.

210
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Come.

211
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Come.

212
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Go to class.

213
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm going back to work.

214
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Don't miss me too much.

215
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
When the new year comes,

216
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
I'll pick you up from school.

217
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
New Year,

218
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
I'll wait for you to pick me home.

219
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
New Year

220
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
New Year

221
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
New Year

222
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
Let's go. I'll take you home.

223
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
New Year

224
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
New Year

225
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
New Year
