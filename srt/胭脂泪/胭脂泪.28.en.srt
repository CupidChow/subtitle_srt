00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Did you read the newspaper today?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Last night, the mysterious old Master He

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
appeared at the Wu Xie's trade fair.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Look.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The whole Wu Xie is in a panic.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It turns out that Master He

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is not an old man at all,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but the young Master Zhou.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first thing he did

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
at the Wu Xie's Trade Fair

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
was to change all the properties

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of the Zhou family.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It is said that

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
he also invested in our hospital.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He bought all the advanced medical equipment

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in Xinjing.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This way, please.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Isn't that him?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My goodness.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Master Zhou is so handsome

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and so great.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What is he doing here?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I am also the witness

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of the murder of the Chief Zhou.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Please don't drive me away.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't drive me away.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Everyone has his own difficulties.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have to be sympathetic to others.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have to leave today.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Take him away.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Boss Zhou.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Zhi Qiu.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Tell Boss Zhou

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
not to drive me away.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You know him.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He will believe what you say.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I am the director of this hospital.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's the use of asking him?

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Ye.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When you were in trouble,

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I gave you a bite of food

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and sent you to the hospital.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You have this job.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you?

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A benefactor.

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Doctor Ye has been a doctor for many years.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He has the skills of a housekeeper.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He has become a benefactor for you.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You have made him the most drunk in the night.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He has had surgery for many times.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He has no extra money.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How can you let him be grateful?

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Take him away.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Boss Zhou.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can't do this.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Boss Zhou.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Boss Zhou.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Everyone.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am going to announce one thing.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Zhongshan Hospital

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
will be renamed

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
as Zhongshan Furu Hospital.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In the future,

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
we will support and train more women

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to be doctors.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And also,

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we will train medical students in the field of children's science.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I hope that everyone can do it.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My dream in the future

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
is to open a hospital

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
that specializes in treating women and children.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I hope that more women

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and children will be able to get sick.

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I hope that more women

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
can have children safely

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
in a safe environment

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
without being harmed by the world's ideas.

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Dr. Ye.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Dr. Ye, are you listening?

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you willing to be

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the Dean of the Zhongshan Furu Hospital?

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Dr. Ye is the Dean.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's good.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I...

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I am willing.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Of course I am.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I am very willing.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am sorry.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In the new hospital,

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
there are men doctors everywhere.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There are many women

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and even pregnant women

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
who are too shy to come to the hospital.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In the future,

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
if there is such a Furu Hospital,

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I believe

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
more and more women

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
will be able to get into the doctors' positions.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
More and more women

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
will be willing to come to the hospital to get treated.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
More and more pregnant women

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
will be able to choose a more scientific way

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
to produce the baby.

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
More and more children

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
will be able to receive

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
a more professional treatment

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that is different from adults.

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It will lower the death rate that shouldn't be.

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's great.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's great.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's great.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's great.

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's great.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's great.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's great.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's great.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's great.

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Did you read my diary

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
before you wanted to set up Furu Hospital?

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Not entirely.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I am a businessman.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think Furu Hospital

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
has its own prospects and opportunities.

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
At the same time,

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
for me,

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
it's a very meaningful thing.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then why did you choose me as the dean?

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because you are the only female doctor

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
in the hospital.

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You are more capable than anyone

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to meet the current

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and difficult conditions of women.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Whether it's to train female medical staff

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
or to treat female patients together,

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you are the most suitable candidate.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Zhou,

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you do have a good sense of propriety.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course.

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You are also under management pressure.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I am under management pressure.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What if

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am not managing well?

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you are not managing well,

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will punish you

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
by marrying me.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I have been waiting for a long time.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What if

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I am not managing well?

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What if

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I am not managing well

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and I am taking all the family business

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
as my son-in-law?

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Zhou Erhao,

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I will take all the family business

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as my son-in-law.

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will take all the family business

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
as my son-in-law.

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Zhou Yi Mo,

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you can't be a coward.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I am not a coward.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because your family and your marriage

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
are Mary.

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as you are the one who is the final one,

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can do it.

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You never answer me.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you afraid to promise me?

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Forget it.

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't need you.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
As long as you are happy.

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Changfeng sends snow to

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
fight with the army.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is my promise to you.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You are not regret.

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are not regret.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Miss Ye,

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
these are the best fabrics

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that the owner has selected for you.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They are the best fabrics in the market.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This wedding dress is good.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The style of the wedding dress is good.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it seems a little small.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Miss,

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
why don't you say something?

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why is it you?

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You look so beautiful in the wedding dress.

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Zhou Yi Mo and I

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
are going to get married soon.

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But not yet.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Isn't it?

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Zhou Yi Mo is coming soon.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are not suitable here now.

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What do you want to do?

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is the jade necklace

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I sent to the auction house in Jinghu

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for 100,000 silver dollars.

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The first time I saw it,

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I thought it was the most suitable for you.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know why I gave it to you.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now it seems

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that it is really a match.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We have been a match since we were young.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When you were young,

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you said you would marry me when you grew up.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You gave it to me.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
it can finally be realized.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That is a little flower when I was five or six years old.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
How can it be real?

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
At that time,

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you often asked me to help you with your hair.

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you remember?

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
At that time,

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I had no money and no status.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But now

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I have everything.

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yu Shi An,

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
we have all grown up.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The marriage of the new era,

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
what he wants is love.

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What he wants is a responsibility and responsibility.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You used to have no money and no business.

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But you are the only person in this world I trust.

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To be honest,

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I did think about our future.

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But from the moment you destroyed the autopsy report,

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
there is no possibility between you and me.

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I am sorry.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Officer Yu,

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
you must remember

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to take care of your family.

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do not cause trouble.

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Otherwise, you know the style of our Zhou family.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Zhou Yi Mo

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Zhou Yi Mo

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
got a batch of opium at the dock last night.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It was General Lu's.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Tonight,

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
he will go and get it back.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let him be careful.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
How can there be no bride

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but a groom?

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How is it?

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The committee and the local government

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
have arrived at the dock.

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
They are going to destroy the opium.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's great.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
General Lu can't get anything.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There is a way to find it.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Destroy the opium with a fair and smooth way.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Even if he is angry,

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know who he is angry at.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Thanks to Yu Shi An for sending us the letter.

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Otherwise, tonight will be another bloody night.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not us.

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's him who is angry at you.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Are you jealous?

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why should I be jealous?

271
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I am a man who is generous and generous.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
From the point of view of the chamber of commerce,

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have to thank him.

274
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
From the point of view of the husband,

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I believe in our relationship.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am not jealous.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Slow down.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What happened?

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Brother Yu took someone to the dock

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to find the goods of the commander.

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But he failed.

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The commander...

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Shut up.

284
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We are in the hospital.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You go back first.

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The wound looks scary.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's just a scratch on the skin.

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Officer Yu.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I am sorry.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I am sorry.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I am sorry.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I am sorry.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I am sorry.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I am sorry.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I am sorry.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You don't have to do this.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't think too much.

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I just think

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
if Zhou Yi Mo is in trouble,

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
you will be sad.

302
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is it worth it?

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not worth it.

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I am willing to.

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't move.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Commander Lu won't give up.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let Zhou Yi Mo be careful.

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This gift is too valuable.

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't accept it.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We don't have to

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
separate it so clearly.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is just a wedding gift

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I gave you.

314
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If you don't accept it,

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
then I will donate it to the hospital.

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can sell it

317
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and give it to those

318
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
who need it most.

319
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's medical expenses.

320
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I will give it to you.

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is this okay?

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Dean Yi.

323
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I accept it.

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Then I will thank you

325
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
for the patient's illness

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
in this hospital.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Deputy Manager Yu.

328
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In a few days,

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I will send the certificate

330
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
you donated to your house.

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay.

332
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I am leaving.

333
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Take care of your wound.

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I will go to the hospital.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I will go to the hospital.

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I will go to the hospital.

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I will go to the hospital.

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I will go to the hospital.

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will go to the hospital.

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I will go to the hospital.

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I will go to the hospital.

342
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I will go to the hospital.

343
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I will go to the hospital.

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I will go to the hospital.

345
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I will go to the hospital.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I will go to the hospital.

347
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I will go to the hospital.

348
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I will go to the hospital.

349
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I will go to the hospital.

350
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I will go to the hospital.

351
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I will go to the hospital.

352
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I will go to the hospital.

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I will go to the hospital.

354
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I will go to the hospital.

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I will go to the hospital.

356
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I will go to the hospital.

357
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I will go to the hospital.

358
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I will go to the hospital.

359
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I will go to the hospital.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I will go to the hospital.

361
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I will go to the hospital.

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I will go to the hospital.

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I will go to the hospital.

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I will go to the hospital.

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I will go to the hospital.

366
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I will go to the hospital.

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I will go to the hospital.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I will go to the hospital.

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will go to the hospital.

370
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I will go to the hospital.

371
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will go to the hospital.

372
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I will go to the hospital.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I will go to the hospital.

374
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I will go to the hospital.

375
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I will go to the hospital.

376
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I will go to the hospital.

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I will go to the hospital.

378
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I will go to the hospital.

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I will go to the hospital.

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I will go to the hospital.

381
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I will go to the hospital.

382
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The wind blows the red dry

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The cold you scattered around me

384
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If this cold is a lie

385
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
A Ya'nan

386
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,600
The wind blows the red dry

387
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,760
You scattered around and I am in your arms

388
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,320
If this cold Perish house

389
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,320
Where did it get burned
