00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:27,660
Episode

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,580
Please be good to my Tian Yi Jing.

4
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,900
Don't worry,

5
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,220
I sent Congratulations to Wuyi Sage to gather some straw,

6
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,740
then he's in the terms of disciple.

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,740
Mr. Chen, it seems that he fell down.

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,220
It's not dangerous at all.

9
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,860
He fell down while he was wearing it?

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,740
I've never seen him play tricks.

11
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,860
It's just a trick to fool people.

12
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,460
Throw him into the pond

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,340
and let him die a little more thoroughly.

14
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,620
That's great.

15
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,420
He finally came to save Wu Yitai.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,180
Who are you calling?

17
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,540
Wu Yitai asked me to find someone called Yu Shan.

18
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,900
He finally came to save Wu Yitai.

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,180
You...

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,700
These people don't look like they're sick.

21
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
Then who are they?

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,780
Who are you?

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,020
I'm here to inform you

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,980
that this woman was saved by Master He Fu.

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,100
Master He Fu?

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,380
He Fu?

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,740
Master He?

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,260
Could it be that Wu Yitai

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,740
is the daughter of the person he fell down?

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,100
Who knows?

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,540
Officer Yu, why are you here so late?

32
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,700
Where is Wu Yitai?

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,940
Wu Yitai was rescued.

34
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:19,980
Who?

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,580
The legendary mysterious Master He.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,260
Wu Yitai

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,460
Where am I?

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,660
Why did Master He Fu want to save me?

39
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,740
Why did he bring me here?

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,820
Go to sleep.

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,820
Yes.

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,660
Miss Yue, you're awake.

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,860
Excuse me.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,900
Where am I?

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,580
This is the Princess' Reception House of the No Within the hora.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,100
The Princess' Reception House?!

47
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,820
Yes.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,620
My Lord prepared it specially for you.

49
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,620
What Master?

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,340
Master He.

51
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,580
The one who has been looking for her

52
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,460
for years in Wu County.

53
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,740
So you've heard those rumors too.

54
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,980
But I'm definitely not her illegitimate daughter.

55
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,100
I have parents.

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,460
You'll know it in a while.

57
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,220
Master He is waiting for you downstairs.

58
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,220
I should go to thank him in person.

59
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Then you should wear this.

60
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,860
What is this for?

61
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,420
All the guests who see her

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,580
should cover their eyes.

63
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,780
Why is this old man so strange?

64
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,220
Is there some secret

65
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,380
or a secret that is not known to all?

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,500
Come on. Be careful.

67
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,020
Be careful.

68
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,980
Master.

69
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,500
Are you Master He?

70
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,900
Why are you saving me?

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,740
What do you think?

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,380
Rumor has it

73
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,060
that Master He has been looking for her.

74
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,500
I've been looking for a illegitimate daughter.

75
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,060
Did I

76
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,100
make you misunderstand?

77
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,820
Thank you for saving my life.

78
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,380
But

79
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,460
I have my own parents.

80
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,780
I can prove it.

81
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,900
Wu Xie, I'm quite familiar with you.

82
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,460
If you want a daughter,

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,060
I can work for you.

84
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm not a girl.

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,740
You're so calm.

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,100
Are you

87
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,660
not looking for a daughter?

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,580
Then why did you save me?

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,220
What can I help you with?

90
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,540
A lot.

91
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,980
A lot?

92
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,900
Mr. He,

93
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm just a little martial arts master

94
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,420
who is married into the Zhou family.

95
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,300
What can I help you with?

96
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,400
This is my record.

97
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,520
If anything happens to them,

98
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,820
you'll need to very fast then.

99
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,660
Marry me.

100
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,540
What?

101
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,100
When you are free to live again…

102
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,700
Yes.

103
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,580
But

104
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,660
you have to help me get rid of someone.

105
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,180
Who?

106
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,420
This person

107
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,460
has shot me.

108
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,660
There is a fatal wound

109
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,740
on the chest.

110
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,100
It hasn't healed yet.

111
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,540
You're so cruel.

112
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,700
You have to kill the person who saved you.

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,180
If I'm not cruel,

114
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,220
will you kill Xiong?

115
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,660
Zheng Yimeng.

116
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,580
Why is it you?

117
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,020
Why is it you?

118
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,780
You have two identities.

119
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,780
Can't I?

120
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,060
Silly.

121
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,980
You almost

122
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,380
made me your father.

123
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,140
I can keep it from you.

124
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,900
But for you,

125
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,220
I'll do anything.

126
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,740
If it weren't for you,

127
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,940
everything would be meaningless.

128
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
I'm afraid I can't

129
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,980
let you go.

130
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm afraid I can't

131
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,780
let you go.

132
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm afraid I can't

133
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,140
let you go.

134
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,820
I'm afraid I can't

135
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,500
let you go.

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,020
I'm afraid I can't

137
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,540
let you go.

138
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,060
I'm afraid I can't

139
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,500
let you go.

140
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,180
I'm afraid I can't

141
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,780
let you go.

142
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,380
I'm afraid I can't

143
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,900
let you go.

144
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm afraid I can't

145
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,940
let you go.

146
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,300
I'm afraid I can't

147
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,660
let you go.

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm afraid I can't

149
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,860
let you go.

150
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,340
After Sheng Hao died,

151
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,820
he became a pawn excessively

152
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,580
and made a lot of money.

153
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,140
He touched

154
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,060
so many properties

155
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,660
What does it say?

156
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,140
It's been pouring all night.

157
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,700
And it's been spreading all over the sky.

158
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,420
I...

159
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,300
I...

160
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,780
I'm a fake!

161
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,260
Master.

162
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,900
Master.

163
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,780
Don't do this.

164
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,420
Master.

165
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,700
Take it away.

166
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,380
Yes.

167
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:28,980
Master.

168
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,740
Master.

169
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,540
Call the doctor.

170
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,300
Yes, Third Madam.

171
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,020
The

172
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
The

173
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
The

174
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
The

175
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
The

176
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,620
You...

177
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,060
You were locked in the room, weren't you?

178
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,660
How did you get out?

179
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,260
There's a secret passage in my room.

180
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,660
No one knows it except Jinbao.

181
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,780
So all these years,

182
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,220
you've been using the playhouse as your name

183
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,820
to revive the He Family?

184
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,620
Yes.

185
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,140
Even Nanxi doesn't know your real identity?

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,660
It's dangerous for me

187
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,020
to know this from an outsider.

188
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,460
You've spent a lot of effort

189
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,900
to spread the news that Master He is looking for a illegitimate daughter

190
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,780
so that you can protect me

191
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,700
one day.

192
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,780
Yes.

193
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,180
It's two different things

194
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,780
to protect you and to be able to protect you.

195
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,660
Master He has spent a lot of effort

196
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,980
because he thinks he's more capable

197
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,380
to protect you than Zhou Yingmo.

198
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,780
I have to go back to the Zhou Mansion now.

199
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,860
It's good to hide here.

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,780
The Zhou Mansion is full of evil spirits.

201
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,740
If I go back, my father will punish you.

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,300
I've told you

203
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,540
that it's not the best time

204
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,100
for Master He to expose his identity.

205
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,340
If so,

206
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,180
I have to go back to the mansion to solve the problem.

207
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,220
Besides,

208
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,700
it's important to find the murderer

209
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,260
who's hiding in the mansion

210
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,140
and killing my sister.

211
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,140
You're so sure.

212
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
But everyone has seen it.

213
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,180
How can you prove your innocence?

214
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,980
I don't need to prove my innocence.

215
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,100
I just need to prove

216
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,700
that the person who put the blame on me is innocent.

217
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,980
That's all.

218
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,260
Master, what's wrong?

219
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,100
You're in a hurry.

220
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,660
The commander-in-chief's people are making trouble outside.

221
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,180
They said they wanted to see Miss Ye.

222
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,980
Where's Yu?

223
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,140
Yes.

224
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,940
They said they must see Miss Ye

225
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,620
and bring a team of soldiers here.

226
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,780
Tell him

227
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,820
that Miss Ye is having a hard time resting.

228
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,620
If he's still entangled,

229
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
don't blame me.

230
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,380
Yes.

231
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,860
It's Yu Shan.

232
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,740
He's here to save me.

233
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,140
Now that I'm safe,

234
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,700
I can't go back to the mansion.

235
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,660
I have to go back to the mansion.

236
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,940
I have to go out and tell him that I'm safe.

237
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,740
Thank him.

238
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,020
You're in danger and you want him to save you?

239
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,060
Under such circumstances,

240
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,420
I'll try all means and methods.

241
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,020
Of course, saving my life is the most important thing.

242
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,660
If you don't hand over Ye Zhiqiu,

243
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,620
don't blame me for being hard on you.

244
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,580
Don't be ridiculous.

245
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,980
What's so noisy about?

246
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,100
Do you need help?

247
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,060
No.

248
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,340
I can handle this.

249
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,980
Open the door.

250
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,860
Xiaoman.

251
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,860
You were saved by Master He?

252
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,660
Yes.

253
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,780
I'm fine now.

254
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Don't worry about me.

255
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,020
Is it true that you and Zhou Yimu were in the ancestral hall?

256
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,980
It's fake.

257
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,940
We were framed.

258
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,020
I knew it.

259
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,580
Come with me.

260
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,380
Where to?

261
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,980
I'm able to protect you now.

262
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Do you remember those people

263
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,300
who framed you and bullied you?

264
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm going to avenge you one by one now.

265
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,780
I don't need it.

266
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,260
What do you want?

267
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,980
Tell me.

268
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,580
I want to go back to the mansion.

269
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,220
I have unfinished business.

270
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,340
You know that.

271
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
You want to go back to the mansion?

272
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
But if you go back...

273
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,500
I have my own way to escape.

274
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,540
I came out

275
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,340
to tell you that I'm safe.

276
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,220
Thank you for saving my life.

277
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,620
Don't worry about me.

278
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,660
Xiaoman.

279
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,060
Don't go back, okay?

280
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,060
Xiaoman.

281
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,140
I'll help you investigate.

282
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,180
I'll help you investigate.

283
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,220
I can help you investigate.

284
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,100
I can help you avenge. Do you understand?

285
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,060
I just want you to stay with me.

286
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,060
Yu Shi'an.

287
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
You didn't help me when you were a police officer.

288
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,980
What I want

289
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,500
is never money or power.

290
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,020
What I want is always the truth.

291
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,620
What I want

292
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,540
is the kind of unworthy

293
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,500
in your eyes

294
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,780
and the justice

295
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,580
that belongs to me and my sister.

296
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,620
Please

297
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,060
don't bother me anymore, okay?

298
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,780
You have fallen in love with Zhou Yimou.

299
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,860
Right?

300
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,100
No.

301
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,960
when

302
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,980
Why deny it?

303
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,060
Why didn't you admit our relationship?

304
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,820
Do you really have me in your heart?

305
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,940
Zhou Yimou,

306
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,620
have you gone crazy

307
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,220
I live to take revenge.

308
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm a woman.

309
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,860
Even if I have feelings for you,

310
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,340
I have to consider the consequences

311
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,020
of being known by others.

312
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,340
Don't forget that

313
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,580
I'm your mother.

314
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,620
I almost got executed.

315
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,980
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,220
I'm angry.

317
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,140
When I see her treating you like that,

318
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll wait for you.

319
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,660
Let's

320
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,980
catch the real murderer together.

321
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
It's most important

322
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,620
that we implement our plans now.

323
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,740
Chen Yu's feelings

324
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,140
may be seen by the sky

325
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,420
on a certain day in the future.

326
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
But not now.

327
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
Don't make a promise

328
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
or sign the contract.

329
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,860
Okay?

330
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,980
Okay.

331
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,380
Why did

332
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,620
Old Man He save you?

333
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,620
Master He,

334
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Master He

335
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,100
misjudged me as

336
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,620
his long-lost daughter.

337
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,340
So he saved me.

338
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,380
After the blood test,

339
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,500
I found out that it wasn't true.

340
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Then why did you come back?

341
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,940
Do you want to die again?

342
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,700
I

343
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,620
just want you

344
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
to know the truth.

345
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,900
What truth?
