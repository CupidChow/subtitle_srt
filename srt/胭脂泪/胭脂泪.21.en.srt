Why are you here?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What's wrong?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why are you so nervous?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I haven't finished my work yet.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm here for a check-up.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My heart is beating so fast today.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I just think of someone.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have to help you take a good look.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's really beating so fast.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you think I'm still a good person?

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't think of someone else.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid I can't.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm a common man.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I only think of that person.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All right.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is the hospital.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't be ridiculous.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hospital.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mr. He just came to the valley this morning.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it my place?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm your last patient today.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have to cure me.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Then we can work together.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How do you want to cure me?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're the doctor.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can ask me.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000

I'll give you this.

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,800
Thank you.

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,840
What do you mean by taking this one?

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,240
It's for observation.

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,640
Observation?

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,880
If I get tired of this one,

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
it means that your book is also tired of it.

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,720
Then I'll buy you new paintings.

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,240
Don't you like paintings?

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll give you a lifetime of paintings.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
I don't need to be free.

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,040
If you want to give me a lifetime of paintings,

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,040
do you want to make any promises?

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,040
What?

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,880
You don't want to make any promises?

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
Someone took advantage of me

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,520
and doesn't want to be responsible for me?

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,960
But I'm still a doctor of sword skills.

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't live with a man as good as you.

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,240
So I can't be responsible for you.

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,920
I promise I'll take good care of myself.

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't spend too much money on you.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,920
The love that unites all is white.

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,960
We are separated by two people.

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't know how to feel when I see you.

99
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
Brother Yu. Brother Yu.

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,360
Let's go.

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,880
Brother Yu.

102
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,480
We know we're wrong.

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,160
Brother Yu.

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,960
Brother Yu.

105
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
I know we're wrong.

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
We know we're wrong.

107
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
You are strong and strong.

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,680
You are punished by the law.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,640
We...

110
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,640
Brother Yu.

111
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
Brother Yu.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
We're wrong.

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,600
Dean Lin.

114
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,840
Why do you let a new doctor do the operation?

115
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,920
You're still young.

116
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you have any experience in surgery?

117
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,240
Dean Lin.

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,000
You must do the operation.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,280
Dr. Ye graduated from a professional medical school.

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,600
He has several years of clinical experience.

121
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,560
He will definitely be fine with your little injury.

122
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,920
Do you like it or not?

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,240
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,640
I heard that Dr. Ye was bullied in the hospital

125
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,200
because he was inexperienced.

126
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,440
So I brought a few wounded people here today.

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,920
They are in the operating room now.

128
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,760
If you don't mind,

129
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,880
I can bring a few wounded people here every day.

130
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,560
If you don't do the operation,

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,640
just go.

132
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
I'm not going to do it.

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,320
Just go.

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,080
Let's go.

135
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,720
Dean Lin.

136
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
You should go to rest, too.

137
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,400
Are you okay alone?

138
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm fine, Dean Lin.

139
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr. Yu is my friend.

140
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,760
I mean, there are so many patients.

141
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,880
The anesthetic is not enough.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,440
It's up to you

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,720
to do it yourself.

144
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
But I want him to do it.

145
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,480
It's up to me if he does it.

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,720
What else does it matter?

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
Give him a knife.

148
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:38,980
An  Dancing

149
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
You can't move.

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,240
If you move again,

151
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,960
you'll break your legs next time.

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Dr. Ye,

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,120
go on.

154
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Love Crossed

155
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,320
Here.

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Your favorite Jasmine Tea.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
It's for you.

158
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,600
Did you get the wounds

159
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
from those people?

160
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
They're only

161
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,900
yesterday's

162
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,220

163
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,960
nominations.

164
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,200
That's all for you.

165
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,880
Look.

166
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,600
You were lucky.

167
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,940
He tried so hard to protect you,

168
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,340
You were actually hated.

169
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,380
You were actually understood

170
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,060
as a bad person.

171
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,780
Help me deal with the wound.

172
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,780
Are you looking at this?

173
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,180
Have you forgotten?

174
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,780
You made this for me.

175
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,980
I want to detoxify you.

176
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,580
After you followed the commander-in-chief,

177
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,380
you've changed a lot.

178
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,340
We're the same.

179
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,420
You're not a good person either.

180
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,300
You've been the only one

181
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,340
who has been so kind to the Zhou family.

182
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,780
It's not easy.

183
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,740
It's not easy.

184
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,780
I've never said

185
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,980
I'm a good person.

186
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,260
That's why we're the best match.

187
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,660
As usual,

188
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,660
pay the bill when you go out.

189
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,780
Thank you.

190
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,140
Master,

191
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,860
since we changed the paper bag

192
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,260
into a sealed jar,

193
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
the sales of tea

194
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,540
has obviously improved.

195
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,980
The profit is nearly 20% higher than last month.

196
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,220
The elders of the tea mountain

197
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,580
have been very happy these days.

198
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,860
Good job.

199
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,900
I didn't expect that

200
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,020
you have a good idea.

201
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,340
Thank you, Master.

202
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm willing to give you

203
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,220
a chance to take the initiative.

204
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,980
You don't have to thank me.

205
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
You can thank yourself.

206
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,780
You're a ghost that messes up the people of the Zhou family.

207
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,180
You helped me

208
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,260
to find out all kinds of information.

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,220
You've done a great job.

210
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,220
I know

211
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,300
you have ambition and ambition.

212
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,500
I've got the power.

213
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,180
You

214
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,740
and Jinbao

215
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,660
will get what they deserve.

216
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,700
Master, you seem to be in a good mood today.

217
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,020
Really?

218
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,860
Yes.

219
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,940
You and Miss Ye came back after dinner.

220
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,500
You didn't come down at all.

221
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,420
Is it that obvious?

222
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,140
Master,

223
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,820
what's Miss Ye's

224
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,140
plan now?

225
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,340
She's so mysterious.

226
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,980
Master, tell us.

227
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,940
No.

228
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,100
She wants to

229
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,220
show everyone her achievements.

230
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,140
Now, it's a secret.

231
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,820
I didn't expect that

232
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,700
you're so ambitious.

233
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,460
You're so lucky.

234
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,860
Nanxi,

235
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,700
you talk a lot today.

236
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,500
But I'm in a good mood today.

237
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,300
I won't be mad at you.

238
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,620
I'm leaving.

239
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,220
The world is here.

240
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,260
The flowers are blooming.

241
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,700
Did you hear the sound?

242
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,580
The sound of opera.

243
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,060
The sound of opera

244
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,700
is the most beautiful.

245
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,780
It's the most beautiful.

246
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,300
Send her back to her hometown in a few days.

247
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,340
Give her more money.

248
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,100
My father is dead.

249
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,660
I should end my punishment for him.

250
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Are you sure?

251
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,060
He hurt you and Miss Ye.

252
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,700
From now on,

253
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,540
he can't hurt us anymore.

254
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,940
I will go to Ye Zhiqiu

255
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,820
with my own eyes.

256
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,300
San Yitai.

257
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,580
Why are you here?

258
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,180
San Yitai,

259
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,700
what are you talking about?

260
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,380
The Queen of Qin is cheating.

261
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,460
My brother owes a gambling house

262
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,660
and wants to sell me to the brothel.

263
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,740
You saw me and pitied me.

264
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,380
So you bought me back.

265
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,780
Nanxi will remember this favor

266
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,660
for the rest of her life.

267
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,660
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,260
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,260
I thought you betrayed Gao Zhi

271
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,580
and wouldn't leave me

272
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,700
as the late master.

273
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,540
I didn't expect you to be kind.

274
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,260
Master agreed to let you retire

275
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,180
and gave you a lot of money.

276
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,660
Zhou Yimo is so kind.

277
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,380
He agreed to let me go home and live a long life.

278
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,260
Master is a man of dignity.

279
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,900
He said he would let you go

280
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,100
if you were a man of dignity.

281
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,580
Don't worry.

282
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,340
Nanxi, thank you.

283
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,980
San Yitai,

284
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,020
you're finally free.

285
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,620
I'm leaving.

286
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,740
Thank you!

287
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,780
He is right.

288
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,740
The Legend of Chusen

289
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,740
The Legend of Chusen

290
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,740
The Legend of Chusen
