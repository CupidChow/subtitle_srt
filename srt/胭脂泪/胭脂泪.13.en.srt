The Long Ballad

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Do you want to work in our General's Mansion?

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,120
The money you gave is much more than you as a police officer.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,120
Compared with the young master of the Zhou family,

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,920
the money you earned

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,720
is nothing to compete with.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,120
Miss An,

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
what do you want?

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,920
You're a young and capable person.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
But you're not as good as the young master of a rich family.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,120
Whether it's money, power or revenge,

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,320
you can get everything from the General.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
Thank you, General.

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
I'll help you with the fire in the future.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,720
I'll do my best.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,720
Report!

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,720
General, the old master of the Zhou family is here again.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Let's leave this little thing

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,320
to Deputy Chief Yu to solve it for you.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,120
Okay.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Deputy Chief Yu,

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,720
you have to take the money

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,720
when you ask me to do something.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Do you understand?

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,520
Deputy Chief Yu,

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
you'll solve it, right?

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,320
Yes.

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,720
Wuyi,

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
have something to eat.

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,120
Did anyone find out that Young Master and I are missing?

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
The mansion is in a mess now.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
No one has found out

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,320
where you and Young Master are.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,120
It's better not to care about what others don't care about.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,320
Go back to the mansion first.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,920
Someone in the mansion has to send a letter.

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,120
Okay.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Use your body to block the bullets.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Do you think you are a strong man?

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
I am.

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,520
You're awake.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,920
I'll call the doctor.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm fine.

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
You said you were fine.

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
Do you know you almost...

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,320
I wouldn't dare to die

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
without your permission?

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
At this time,

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,320
if you make fun of me again,

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,720
I'll tear your mouth off.

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,920
Don't let them in yet.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
Don't be so willful, okay?

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
Just two minutes.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,920
Sit down and stay with me, okay?

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,920
chill brothers

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
Why are you looking at me like this?

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
It's so good now.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,320
You're stubborn.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
it's not because of feelings of 남 veure  sizing

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm just Zhou Yimo,

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
not a rich young master.

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,520
We're just two equal people.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
No matter what our identities are,

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,520
we're just ourselves.

66
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I want to tell you what I want to say in the car.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
If it's some kind of mean words,

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
just don't say it.

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
One day, when I become the master,

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
I'll give you freedom.

71
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Freedom?

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
I'll let you be yourself.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
You're not a man of power,

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
nor a woman of attitude.

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
You can continue to study if you want.

76
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
You can find a job if you want.

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
I'll fight for you when you're tired.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
But you have absolute freedom

79
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
to control your life.

80
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
You want to tell me this?

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
What else do you want me to say?

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Or what do you expect me to say?

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm serious.

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
You should be free.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
It's a deal.

86
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Master, I beg you to save Chen.

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
He's your son.

88
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Please save him.

89
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Enough.

90
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Do you think I don't have the energy?

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
He's your son and he's mine.

92
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Please save him.

93
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
It's strange.

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
He offended the general.

95
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
The defendant, Zhou Yichen,

96
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
was a worker at the port of Mousha

97
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
and was arrested for kidnapping his wife and daughter.

98
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
He colluded with foreign merchants and bribe the government.

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
He was a criminal for a long time.

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
He's a vicious criminal.

101
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,520
He was sentenced to death for his evil deeds.

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
It's snowing.

103
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
It's sister who came to visit us.

104
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Go.

105
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Go.

106
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
It's cold in the morning.

107
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Your mother asked me to bring it to you.

108
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
You're here to laugh at me, right?

109
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm here to ask you

110
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
if you've ever seen a woman

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
who's so beautiful

112
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
as to be a woman.

113
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
I've never seen a woman

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
who's so beautiful

115
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
as to be a woman.

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
I've never seen a woman

117
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
who's so beautiful as to be a woman.

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm here to ask you

119
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
what you did

120
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
to my sister three years ago.

121
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Your sister is...

122
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Young Master,

123
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
can't you see it?

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
You're Zhou Xui's sister.

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
You're Zhou Xui's sister.

126
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
So

127
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
you're here just to ask me

128
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
if I killed her

129
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
back then.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I admit

131
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
I did suspect you.

132
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I've never hurt her.

133
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
She's my only family.

134
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
I might

135
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
be a bad person

136
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
who's not evil.

137
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
But I really do

138
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
love your sister.

139
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Then why did you

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
hurt her face?

141
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
I didn't hurt her face.

142
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
She hurt herself

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
with a knife.

144
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
With a knife.

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
So what happened

146
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
three years ago?

147
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Zhou Xunui,

148
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
I saw him

149
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
walking out of the house

150
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
and suspecting that my father had offended him.

151
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
I had to

152
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
watch my second aunt

153
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
torture him.

154
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
I was so angry that I didn't know what to do.

155
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
I knew that his second aunt

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
had suffered a lot.

157
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
I couldn't bear to

158
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
take her back to the private house

159
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
in the middle of the night.

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Open the door.

161
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Is anyone there?

162
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Sister.

163
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Young Master.

164
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Young Master,

165
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
where are we?

166
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Let's live here

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
from now on, okay?

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
No one

169
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
will hurt you here.

170
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
You'll be like the sculpture here.

171
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Perfect.

172
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Perfect.

173
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Young Master,

174
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
let me go, okay?

175
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
My father and my second aunt

176
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
hurt you so much.

177
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Are you going back?

178
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
But you imprisoned me here.

179
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
What's the difference with them?

180
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I...

181
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm different from them.

182
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
You don't understand.

183
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
I'll protect you.

184
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I won't let anyone hurt you.

185
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Young Master,

186
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I'm not your object.

187
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
My family is waiting for me outside.

188
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Let me go.

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Am I not your family?

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I just want to have

191
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
a family member who cares about me.

192
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Sister.

193
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
You used to love me the most.

194
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Sister.

195
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Don't come near me.

196
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Let me go.

197
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Or I'll scratch my face.

198
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
No.

199
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
No.

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
You're perfect.

201
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

202
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Sister.

203
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Get away.

204
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Sister.

205
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Don't.

206
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Sister.

207
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Let me go.

208
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Let me go.

209
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Okay.

210
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
You go.

211
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
You go.

212
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
You go.

213
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
That night,

214
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I just wanted to protect my sister.

215
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
If you really want to protect her,

216
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
why didn't you help Master Zhou

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
and Second Aunt

218
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
when you wanted to hurt her?

219
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I couldn't.

220
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I didn't dare.

221
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I was afraid that my parents would be disappointed.

222
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I was afraid

223
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
that because of my help,

224
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I would make this flower

225
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
fall apart faster.

226
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Second Young Master.

227
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Look what I brought you.

228
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Where did you go tonight?

229
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
I went to

230
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
the Lan Guan Xiang Luo Wei store

231
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
you mentioned yesterday.

232
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I bought some snacks you mentioned.

233
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Try it.

234
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Don't let Third Aunt find out.

235
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Sister, you remember?

236
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Third Aunt.

237
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Hurry.

238
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Third...

239
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Third Aunt.

240
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm looking for Young Master.

241
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Someone is looking for you outside Zhou's Mansion.

242
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Okay.

243
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
I'll be right there.

244
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Eat it.

245
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Chen Er,

246
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
have you been too close to Chu Xue recently?

247
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
What do you mean?

248
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
She and I...

249
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
A maid

250
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
can turn your lost soul upside down.

251
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Look at me.

252
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Have you forgotten

253
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
the pain we had?

254
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Am I not important to you?

255
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Answer me!

256
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
No.

257
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Mother.

258
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Don't be like this.

259
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I'm not like that.

260
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Let me tell you.

261
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
If anything happens to Chu Xue,

262
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
it's all because you forced me.

263
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm innocent.

264
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Do you remember?

265
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Mother.

266
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I remember.

267
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
From childhood until now,

268
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
as long as I like her,

269
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
and care about her,

270
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
my parents will find out

271
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
and destroy them.

272
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
I hate this family.

273
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
How many times have I told you

274
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
not to play with me anymore?

275
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Enough!

276
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Do you know

277
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
that bitch's child

278
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
has gone to school to study?

279
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
If you don't study hard,

280
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
we'll live in this shabby room

281
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
and be bullied forever.

282
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
If you don't study hard,

283
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
how can you make your father like you?

284
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
How can I be a useless son?

285
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Mother, I'm wrong.

286
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm wrong.

287
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
I won't study hard.

288
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
I'm telling you.

289
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Remember this.

290
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
From now on,

291
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
if I see you play with this thing again,

292
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
I'll tell you.

293
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
I'll study hard.

294
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
I'll study hard.

295
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Father, it's done.

296
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
I taught you well

297
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
in the open-air bowl juice.

298
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
You're too kind.

299
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm glad you're satisfied.

300
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
My wife

301
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
has a bad background.

302
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Don't blame me for not recognizing you

303
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
when I saw you on the street.

304
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
But I promise you

305
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
that when Chen'er is older,

306
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
I'll take you back to Chongqing.

307
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
I'll take you back to the Zhou family.

308
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Okay?

309
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Okay.

310
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
That's great.

311
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
You're still here without father?

312
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Nonsense.

313
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
I have a father.

314
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
He promised to come and see me today.

315
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Give it back to me.

316
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
You...

317
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Tell your grandpa later

318
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
that you've improved.

319
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Got it?

320
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Okay.

321
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Let's go.

322
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Father.

323
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Kid.

324
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
You've got the wrong person.

325
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Get away.

326
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Where did you get this kid?

327
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Father,

328
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I want that wooden man too.

329
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Okay.

330
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
I'll buy it for you.

331
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
But remember

332
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
to talk to me in front of your grandma.

333
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
No problem.

334
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
I've told you several times.

335
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Don't recognize your father on the street.

336
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Do you want me to go to the Zhou family?

337
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Okay.

338
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
It's funny.

339
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
My father

340
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
only loves himself.

341
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
And I

342
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
am just a tool he uses.

343
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
You've seen through it.

344
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
Why did you hide it for him?

345
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I want to help him hide it.

346
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Yun Yang said something

347
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
that I don't understand.
