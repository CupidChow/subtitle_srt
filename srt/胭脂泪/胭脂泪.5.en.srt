00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Old woman.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,100
Yang Mo'er, how did you do this?

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,700
This is the result of my six-year-old mother's death.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Every day, every night, the truth that Second Aunt grew up with

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,500
she hit me when she was unhappy.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,900
After every miscarriage, she humiliated and abused me.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,700
But when my father, Zhou Yicheng, appeared,

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,500
did she know that I was her only enemy?

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,900
My child, how did it become like this?

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,300
For so many years, I never gave up on finding the truth of my mother's death.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,300
Until a few months ago, the old woman who was old and in good health finally admitted it.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,700
That year, Second Aunt put a firewood in the box that gave my mother away.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,300
So,

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,700
that year, my mother's accident

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,500
was done on purpose to fight for favor.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Open the door!

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Come!

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,700
Young Master, let's go in and sleep!

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,500
Mother!

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,300
Help me!

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,100
Young Master, let's go in and sleep!

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
Come and save me, Mother!

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,100
Help me!

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,900
Help me!

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,700
Come and save her!

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,900
Mother!

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,100
How could this happen?

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
My poor child.

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,300
My poor daughter was killed by my sister.

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,700
Why is she so stupid?

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,500
If that's the case,

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,500
her end today is her own end.

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,900
Zhong Huaqian.

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,900
Mother.

37
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,100
I only ask you one thing.

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,700
Tell me.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,300
In the future,

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,100
treat my grandson as if he were your own.

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,500
Mother, don't worry.

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,100
The He family and the Zhou family are one family.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,300
I hope you think so.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,100
Of course.

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
The Ghost Valley

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
It's the clothes that the ghost wore.

47
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Why is it with Young Master?

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,500
Father, grandmother.

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,700
I found this red dress under the floor of Second Madam's room.

50
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,500
The ghost incident at the Zuo's Mansion was caused by Second Madam.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,900
Brother, you're late.

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,900
You're too much.

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
Wu Yitai is young and beautiful.

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,900
He's the same age as them.

55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,700
They even tied him up.

56
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,900
This woman is not simple.

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,500
Mother.

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,700
Li Mo, go deal with Dr. Sun in private.

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,500
Yes, take him away.

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
As for Wu, you broke into Second Madam's room.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Punish you for cleaning up the backyard for three days.

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,100
Yes, Master.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,300
Zhou Yuchen.

64
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,500
Father.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,100
You've been acting rashly lately.

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,700
Go back to your room and reflect on yourself.

67
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes.

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,300
What a big game.

69
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,700
You let me leave on purpose.

70
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,500
You made me the only suspect who killed Second Madam.

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:04:09,920
I used this to expose the past

72
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,300
Don't play it.

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,700
It seems that you have other goals besides Second Madam.

74
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,900
I don't understand what you're talking about.

75
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,100
Xiaoman, you're not going to the art club to rehearse,

76
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
but you're doing this?

77
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,900
Look, Wu Xian has a big hero.

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,900
They say he wears a mask and a black shirt.

79
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,100
He's going to the dock to destroy those ships that are being used for private use.

80
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
That's amazing.

81
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Xiao Yan is a big hero.

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,900
Save me.

83
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,100
Big Head, he's injured.

84
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,700
Hurry and go find Teacher Anna.

85
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
Okay.

86
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,100
Did you see an injured man just now?

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,700
I saw him.

88
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,900
He ran out from the door.

89
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,500
Let's go.

90
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,700
States of Luoyang

91
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
You're awake.

92
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
That's great.

93
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
This is my candle.

94
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
What?

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
No, no, no.

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

105
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I...

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I was just giving you artificial respiration.

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I'm here to save you.

108
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Thank you.

109
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Thank you for saving me.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
I know you.

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
The great hero of Xiao Yan.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
He's shot.

113
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Slow down.

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I forced you to leave Zhou's Mansion

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
to protect you.

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
There's no need to

117
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
curse yourself to meet someone else's expectations.

118
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I won't tell anyone.

119
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm looking forward to your next work.

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
What a good pair of hands.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Have a look.

122
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Chen.

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I made you lotus seed soup.

124
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Drink it while it's hot.

125
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Thank you, Mother.

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Your father values you more now.

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
He treats me better.

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
All my hopes

129
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
are on you.

130
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
I'm not afraid of anything.

131
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Don't worry, Mother.

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I won't

133
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
let Father leave us.

134
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
You'd better be good.

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Master Zhou.

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
You've worked hard in the martial arts world for many years.

138
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
You've committed a lot of crimes.

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
You need to spit it out

140
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
when you're young.

141
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
That's good.

142
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Give me more time.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Then I can

144
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
answer your questions.

145
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,460
The

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Master Zhou.

147
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
According to the traces and reports,

148
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
the results are clear.

149
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
The cause of the death of Er Yi Tai

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
is probably smoke in the house.

151
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
He accidentally burned his clothes or things.

152
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
He died by accident.

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Give it to me.

154
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
We can deduce that

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
there are three reasons.

156
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
All right.

157
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
I got it.

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
It's not a big deal

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
to work with you.

160
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Just solve the case as soon as possible.

161
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Let's ask Uncle about it.

162
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
See him out.

163
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Goodbye.

164
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Mr. Yu, this way, please.

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
By the way,

166
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I've been wanting to ask you

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
something.

168
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Father, go ahead.

169
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Is there a mysterious master in the He's Mansion?

170
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
I've heard about it.

171
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
But I've never seen it in the He's Mansion.

172
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
I've never heard of it from you.

173
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
You're not talking about it.

174
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You're just trying to distract me.

175
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Father, you mean

176
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I should investigate it?

177
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Yi Mo, you're a Zhou family.

178
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
As long as you try to prove to me

179
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
your loyalty,

180
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
the future business of the Zhou family

181
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
will probably be in your hands.

182
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
People should have a long-term vision.

183
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Do you understand?

184
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Yes.

185
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I know how to be a father.

186
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Xiaoman.

187
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Xiaoman.

188
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Mr. Yu, please be kind to yourself.

189
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Or I'll call someone.

190
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Three years.

191
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I've been looking for you for three years.

192
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
There's no news of you anywhere.

193
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I thought you were dead.

194
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Do you know how I've been living these three years?

195
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Yu Xun is really disappointing.

196
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I wouldn't have died

197
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
before I found out the truth.

198
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
I won't die.

201
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Xiaoman.

202
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The Zhou family is in a mess.

203
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
The relationship is complicated.

204
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
It's not simple.

205
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Don't get involved in this.

206
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Come with me.

207
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
You think it's simple?

208
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Don't think I'm still

209
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
the innocent me.

210
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
How did you become the chief?

211
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Didn't you step on my sister's body

212
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
step by step?

213
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
I had no other choice.

214
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
If you had to find out the truth,

215
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
the people of the Zhou family would kill you.

216
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
The people of the police station would also cover the truth.

217
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
The world is so dark.

218
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Everyone does it.

219
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
You don't understand.

220
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
I just want to protect you.

221
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
I understand.

222
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
So please, Mr. Yu,

223
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
for the sake of the past,

224
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
don't bother me anymore.

225
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Do you still have the gun I gave you?

226
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
What?

227
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
You want to take it back?

228
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Of course not.

229
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
You can keep it.

230
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
It can protect you.

231
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm very relieved.

232
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
If you have any trouble,

233
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
you can find me anytime.

234
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
It's easier to find a chief

235
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
and do things.

236
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
It's late.

237
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
What are you doing here?

238
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I saw you knocking on the door.

239
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
So I came in.

240
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I want to give you a gift.

241
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I made this myself.

242
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
This is me?

243
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm not a thief.

244
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm just a servant.

245
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm just a servant.

246
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm just a servant.

247
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm just a servant.

248
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I'm just a servant.

249
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Really?

250
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
I can't take it then.

251
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Didn't you say

252
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
you have to

253
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
stick to what you like?

254
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I did say that.

255
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
But...

256
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't get me wrong.

257
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I just want to give you

258
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
the gift I carved myself.

259
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
You don't want to take it?

260
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Young Master.

261
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm your aunt.
