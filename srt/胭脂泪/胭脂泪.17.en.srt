00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,400
Tell everyone that my father has left.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Young Mistress.

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,200
Mother.

6
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,800
Is it really you, Mother?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yi Mo.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
All these years,

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I've missed you all the time.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
But you never came into my dream.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've never met you.

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
But every year,

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,600
I've missed you all the time.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
I've been hoping

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,800
that you would be healthy and well.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
All these years,

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
you've been hurt by hatred

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,200
and evil because of my death.

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,800
Do you know

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,600
that I've been suffering from a heartbreak?

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,800
If I had known

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
that you would cause my death

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
and give birth to so many years of obsession,

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
I would have forgiven

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
all the people who hurt me

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
and let my son

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
not have to bear the grudge anymore.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not filial.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
But you still make me worried.

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Now I've avenged you.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,800
You can't be heartbroken and hurt by hatred anymore.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
You can't be heartbroken.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,200
Only in this way

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
can I leave this

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,000
trapped cage of youth.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Mother.

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Mother, don't go.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200
Don't leave me alone.

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Yi Mo.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Life and death are never real farewells.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
As long as you care about me,

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'll be the breeze

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,400
that brings you

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
every snow.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
What's wrong?

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,400
I was saying goodbye to my mother.

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Director.

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Director, wake up.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
Why are you so early?

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Let's go.

52
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's go to rest over there.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Director, let's go.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
What should we do?

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Sister Nanxi,

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Director is so sad.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
You don't know that it's normal.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Director Zhou and our Master

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
are brothers.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
These years,

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
we've been in each other's company

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
and we've been together for a long time.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
You should go to the west market

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to find Wang Jixia.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Buy a snack box, you know?

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Or you'll eat the beef tongue cake.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Master likes it.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Yes.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Where's the lamp?

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
It's getting dark now.

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
We'll use it soon.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
It's on the table over there.

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
In the blue box.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, I'll go by myself.

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Steward.

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
If I'm not mistaken,

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,600
it's the blue box.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,400
You've been with Master for many years.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
No matter how sad you are,

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you should take care of yourself.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Yes.

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
Thank you for your concern.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Go ahead.

84
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
I want to stay alone

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
with Master.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Thank you, Wu Yitai.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,200
Yufu Guan of the Commander's Mansion

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
has been here for 20 times

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
to deliver the flower rings.

90
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
You've lost weight

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and you're haggard.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you, Yufu Guan.

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm busy

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
and I'm here to see you off.

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
It's my duty.

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm here to see you off.

97
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm here to see you off.

98
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm here to see you off.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm here to see you off.

100
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm here to see you off.

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
It's my duty.

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
I want to burn some paper for Master Zhou.

103
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I wonder if Wu Yitai

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
can help me.

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,800
Okay.

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Master Zhou is innocent.

107
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
It's going to be too late

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
for Commander Lu to come to the Zhou's Mansion.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Zhou Yi Mo can't protect you.

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Thank you for reminding me.

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Xiaoman.

112
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
You'll be in danger

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
if you stay here.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Come with me.

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I have nothing to do with

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
the Zhou's family's fall.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
I have my mission.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Have you ever thought

119
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
that a tiger will eventually

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
eat the tiger's prey?

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
So what?

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
The tiger's family is a tiger's tail.

123
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
The tiger can get prey even more.

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Isn't it?

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
What's the matter?

126
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
My father is ill.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Thank you for coming.

128
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
You even burned paper

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
in front of my father and my aunt.

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,200
You're considerate.

131
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm here to see you off.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,600
By the way,

133
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
this is the general's order.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,400
I can feel the general's order.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Go back now.

136
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Tell the general

137
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
my gratitude.

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay.

139
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,200
Goodbye.

140
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
The shadow is still there.

141
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,200
You'd better worry about yourself.

142
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Everyone is

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
worried about the Zhou's family.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Si Yi Tai is back.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Master Zhou.

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Master Zhou.

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Master Zhou.

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Master Zhou,

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
it's been a long time.

150
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
It's been three years.

151
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
I think that's for a good cause.

152
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
What can you do for her?

153
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,520
After all, I'm a tecnologia Poppies

154
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,360
who looks not going to be a match.

155
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,360
It's different from

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
some messy temper.

157
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,760
You're right.

158
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,680
She was expecting you fast before she died.

159
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,440
Who is this?

161
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Wu Fang.

162
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,280
He's young.

163
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
He shouldn't be a child to you.

164
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,280
He's a coward.

165
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,080
He doesn't look like

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
a good man.

167
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm sorry

168
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,880
for what you said.

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm not good enough.

170
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
I failed to help you

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
with the last disaster.

172
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,640
You don't have to blame yourself.

173
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
I don't believe these lies.

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,280
He's cruel.

175
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,680
Come on.

176
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
Kowtow to your father.

177
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,960
Yes.

178
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
What's wrong with the fan?

179
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,120
It's so long and short.

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,920
It's so ugly.

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,640
I'm so tired.

182
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll ask them to adjust it.

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
Why is the grape seedling

184
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,400
yellow?

185
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
Go get a white one.

186
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
What are you thinking?

187
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,840
Why don't you get a red one?

188
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,520
Aunt Lin.

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
The guests will be here soon.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,560
I'm afraid that they'll do something bad.

191
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
It's the reputation of the Zhou family.

192
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Don't be careless.

193
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
Now that I'm back,

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,920
you should have a good rest.

195
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,080
In terms of status,

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
I should be the master of this family.

197
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,640
Right, Wu Fang?

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
You're right.

199
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,320
Now that you're back,

200
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
everything is up to you.

201
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,400
By the way,

202
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
those people are...

203
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,320
Let me introduce them to you.

204
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
They are the senior members of the Zhou family.

205
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
After the old master got sick,

206
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,440
we all need to sit down

207
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
and discuss

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
some of his family business.

209
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll arrange it

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,160
for the elders and seniors.

211
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,040
No need.

212
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
The butler has arranged it.

213
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes, you're right.

214
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,440
Besides,

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,000
don't call me sister.

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280
Call me Miss Lin.

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
Miss Lin?

218
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,480
That sounds better.

219
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,040
Then,

220
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,480
why don't you call me Miss Ye?

221
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,600
What do you think?

222
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,800
Mr. Xu is a man of the Si Yi Tai family.

223
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,680
You should be careful of him.

224
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
Miss Ye.

225
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm here.

226
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,920
Miss Lin.

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
Are you free?

228
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,520
I want to talk to you.

229
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
But I'm a little tired now.

230
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,680
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm so sorry.

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,320
You like reading?

237
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,920
Are you an�도 book Queen Mirae?

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,360
Oh.

239
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,000
She quit after my parents died.

240
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,640
You don't have to read them.

241
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,680
Sit here.

242
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
I'll get you a cup of tea.

243
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,640
You don't need tea.

244
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm a straightforward person.

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
You're the housekeeper.

246
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
You can't share anything

247
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,760
with the master if he's gone.

248
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
Only Zhou Yimo and I

249
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,720
can compete in this family.

250
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,640
I understand that.

251
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
It's safe for a woman

252
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,240
to keep the money in her hand.

253
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,400
Men can't rely on it.

254
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,920
What do you mean?

255
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,440
I heard that you're close to Zhou Yimo.

256
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,040
But I'm here

257
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,280
to compete for the master.

258
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
If you take him,

259
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,800
he may not care about you

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
if he has the money.

261
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,640
But if you take me,

262
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
I'll give you 100,000 Yuan

263
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,160
to keep you safe.

264
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
Miss Lin,

265
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
you're so kind.

266
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm a concubine.

267
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,800
I don't have the right to compete.

268
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
You didn't have it before.

269
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,400
But as long as you want,

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
I can give you the right.

271
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,680
Master's will is useless.

272
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,640
I have a lawyer.

273
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,320
Then listen to Miss Lin.

274
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
I was right.

275
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,800
You're a smart woman.

276
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,000
100,000 Yuan will be yours

277
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,600
when I take the master's place.

278
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,440
Put it away if you're a whore.

279
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
Did you hear it?

280
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,240
Zhou Yimo.

281
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
How could Shiwan and I

282
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
to show off?

283
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,600
Who wouldn't

284
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,960
believe it if it was 100,000 silver dollars?

285
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm a man who can die for you.

286
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,280
Don't make fun of me.

287
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,560
The mathematical reference to Prodigy

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:20,880
You're free now.

289
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
But I'm not.

290
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Stupid.

291
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,400
I'mадаemuxat inclusive of견

292
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,080
however gathering people together with your tears is precious time .

293
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,220
I know

294
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,840
what it's worth

295
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,640
to have my way.

296
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,120
Afterwards will not be afraid of hiding myself from other people's感覺.

297
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,560
I've always had you in my heart.

299
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,240
Otherwise, I wouldn't have risked my life

300
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
to help you leave

301
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,240
three years ago.

302
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,280
Then why are you telling me

303
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,400
all these things?

304
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,600
You're threatening me.

305
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
You Yi, Tang Ge is dead.

306
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
I finally have a chance

307
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
to protect you and the kids.

308
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,560
I came back

309
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,840
to take the position of the owner of the Zhou family.

310
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
I just want to ask you one question.

311
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,080
Will you help me?

312
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,920
I will.

313
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,040
I will.

314
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,280
We've been together for so many years.

315
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,240
Don't you know who I am?

316
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,280
That's good.

317
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
The Zhou family is full of people now.

318
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,560
Don't come to me alone from now on.

319
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,960
By the way,

320
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,160
the incident three years ago

321
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,360
was a misunderstanding.

322
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
You didn't leave any leak, right?

323
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,240
No.

324
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
But

325
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,640
I didn't want to burn

326
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,120
the letter you wrote to me.

327
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,440
Zhou Quan,

328
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
you didn't burn the letter.

329
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,640
Did you leave it

330
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
on purpose?

331
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,520
How is that possible?

332
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,720
You Yi,

333
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,920
that letter is enough

334
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,560
to prove that I'm a loser.

335
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,280
I'll take it out when I miss you.

336
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,400
Well,

337
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,480
I...

338
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,200
Don't worry.

339
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,080
I'll burn it

340
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,000
when I go back tonight.

341
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,080
Well,

342
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,000
take the letter tonight

343
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,240
and meet me

344
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,760
at the back yard.

345
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,520
You don't trust me?

346
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,720
I don't want to hear anything from you.

347
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,080
I just want to know

348
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,560
what you can do for me.

349
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,720
Okay.

350
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,320
I'll take it with me tonight.

351
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I'll listen to you.

352
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,280
Mrs. Wu,

353
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,040
what are you doing here?

354
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,640
I want to send some pastries

355
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,520
to Miss Lin.

356
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,680
But there seems to be someone in the house.

357
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,640
So I didn't go in.

358
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I see.

359
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,360
Leave it to our servants.

360
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
Why bother you?

361
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,640
If so,

362
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,680
I'll leave first.

363
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,960
Take care, Mrs. Wu.

364
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,440
Mr. Xu,

365
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,560
why are you here?

366
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm here to send some pastries.

367
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,080
I don't like sweet things.

368
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
But you forgot

369
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,040
to send me some pastries.

370
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm so bad at this.

371
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
I'll get you some.

372
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,120
Wait.

373
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,840
The lipstick in the city

374
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,800
is too ugly.

375
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,080
I wonder if you can

376
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
arrange some rouge

377
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,120
for me to take back.

378
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm afraid...

379
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,240
Okay.

380
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,200
Since Miss Lin asked me to do it,

381
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,800
I'll do my best to do it.

382
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,320
What's the rouge?

383
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
Sister, you're holding

384
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,480
the rouge in your hand.

385
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,560
The rouge

386
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,680
is always

387
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
Mrs. Wu's exclusive.

388
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
I didn't expect that Mrs. Wu

389
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
also got the rouge in secret.

390
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
Maybe we can

391
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
solve all the mysteries

392
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,960
after we find the letter.

393
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,200
I must find out the truth.

394
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Find it out.
