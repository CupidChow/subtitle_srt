00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
This is bad.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,500
My hands are too tight.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,700
The pressure is too strong.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,700
My fingers are too weak.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,500
If I don't open it...

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Madam Li, I'm late.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Your hands...

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,000
Your hands are too tight.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Does it hurt?

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,900
No.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,900
I'm admiring your sculpture.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
It's very abstract.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Especially this one.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
But it's perfect.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
Then why did you scratch its face?

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,500
Because it doesn't listen to me.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Will you treat me like this?

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Didn't you say you like me?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My father, my brother and Yu Shi'an.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,000
They all like your skin.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,000
But I want to admire your soul.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just want to have you.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No matter what you become.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You have used me now.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Really?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
What about your heart?

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,000
My heart...

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Of course it belongs to you.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But now it doesn't belong to you completely.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
But I believe that

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in the future,

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we will develop a relationship.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
Then Madam Li,

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000
can you eat it?

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
As long as you eat it,

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I will believe it.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is...

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
the opium.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Yes.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You will have the unimaginable wealth.

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
The best opium in the world.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
You will also be unable to leave me

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
because of it.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Can you?

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Open your mouth.

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
No.

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Open your mouth.

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Hurry.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Come.

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Hold on.

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Help her.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Help her.

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Help her.

57
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000
This is the result of your examination.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
Is it still okay?

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Go away.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Mr. Zhang, please sign.

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Okay.

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
My son.

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
He is so clumsy. What's wrong with him?

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mother.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm fine.

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I just ran into some robbers on the way.

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Wu Xie, who doesn't know you?

68
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Who dares to touch the people of the Zhou family?

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Have you called the police?

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Why didn't the police come?

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Don't call the police.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mother.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't call the police.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't call the police.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why?

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why?

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mother.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Believe me.

79
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
When I went out,

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ye Zhiqiu was just rescued.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
While you tell me the truth,

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
whether Ye Zhiqiu's disappearance

83
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,000
has anything to do with your injury?

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are confused.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She is your father's little wife.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How can you let others see our Zhou family?

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
I thought nothing happened.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are injured.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then you should stay in the hospital.

90
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
And cure your ungrateful habits.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you need anything, send someone to pick it up.

92
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't come back before you are fully recovered.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,460
The

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Mrs. Wu, you are awake.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Nanxi.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am back.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are finally awake.

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
You are fine.

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
Why did you fall into the mountain?

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Fortunately, Young Master found you

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and sent you back.

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
The whole family went out to find you these days.

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
Master was worried sick.

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
God bless you.

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
What's wrong with you, Wu?

106
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Why did you fall into the mountain?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Here's the thing.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A few days ago,

109
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,000
I went to the mountain to pray to my parents.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I got lost in the mountain.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
When I was going down the mountain,

112
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
it was raining heavily.

113
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I tripped.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I accidentally

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
sprained my ankle.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I didn't expect you to be so calm.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
You are not always carefree when something happens to your family.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Especially your family.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
You are the same.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You came to see me

121
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
when I was in trouble.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It seems that our Zhou family

123
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
is a loving family.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Third Madam.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Master asked you to go to the front hall.

127
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
He said that Young Master was missing.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Master was worried sick.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll be right there.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Third Madam heard that Young Master was missing.

131
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,000
She is not nervous at all.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Where is Yuchen?

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Didn't you ask him to come back and discuss

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
the tea business meeting in Wu County three days later?

135
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
There was a problem with the business in the neighboring county.

136
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Yuchen went there last night.

137
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
He asked me to tell Master.

138
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
But when Wu came back,

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
I forgot it as soon as I got excited.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,500
It's my fault.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
Every year's tea business meeting

142
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
is the top priority of our family.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
It's about the mayor of Hainan.

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
My brother is so busy.

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Will he be careless?

146
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Aunt.

147
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
It's time for you

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
to help our family.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, Dad.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've been thinking

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
about coming back

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to help my brother.

153
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Good idea.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This time,

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
your Aunt Wu can get it back.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
You've done a great job.

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
You're much more sensible than before.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can also

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
participate in this tea business meeting.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll do my best.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're here at night.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you here to thank me?

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're so heartless.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm the young master of the State of Zhou.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm here to help you.

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can't thank you enough.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
How's your wound?

174
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It's fine.

175
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
By the way,

176
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
how did you know

177
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
about the Zhou family?

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Who am I?

179
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
I've known

180
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
my brother's bad habits

181
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
since long ago.

182
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Thank you.

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
You're so polite.

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm not used to it.

185
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
By the way,

186
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
have you found the clue?

187
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
My sister

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
has a lot of scratches on her face.

189
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Zhou Yichen used a beauty knife to scratch it.

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
What's the deep grudge between you and Chu Xue?

191
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
I guess

192
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
my sister used to be nice to her.

193
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Later, my sister was happy with her.

194
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
She was jealous.

195
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
So she sent someone to humiliate her.

196
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
To warn her

197
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
to stay away from Chu Xue.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Stay away from Chu Xue.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Zhao Anhe.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He has made a comeback

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and is under military punishment.

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't you think

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
he's taking revenge

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
in his own way?

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Brother.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why do you suddenly think of reading a book?

207
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
What happened?

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're finally back.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I knew it.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
In your heart,

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
nothing is more important

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
than the tea business meeting of our Zhou family.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Since I'm back,

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I won't bother you

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
with the tea business meeting.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you don't come back,

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the future head of the Zhou family

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
will be killed.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm leaving.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's the matter?

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you feeling guilty?

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just kidding.

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've never been in charge

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
of the family business.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm afraid you won't understand.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Can I learn from my brother?

227
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
No need.

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's a waste of time

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if you learn from me.

230
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Brother.

231
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Your clothes are dirty.

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Next time, wear clean clothes.

233
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Thanks for your reminder.

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I'll go change now.

235
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Young Master.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I won't see you again.

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Without my permission,

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
no one can enter this room.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The tea is full of silver needles.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,500
The color is yellow.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
It's fragrant and sweet.

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
This silver needle is the best.

244
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
What's wrong?

245
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Good.

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sit.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What brings you here?

248
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Please sit down.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No need.

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
I'm here to escort Miss An.

251
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Isn't this...

252
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Young Master Zhou.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Long time no see.

254
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,000
I heard Miss An has come back.

255
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I knew it.

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,500
We'll meet again.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I just don't know

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
why Miss An is so nervous today.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What's the matter?

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Master Zhou.

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The commander has prepared a big gift for you.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Please open it

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
in front of all the tea merchants.

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What's going on?

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What's going on?

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why is it so dark?

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The 10,000 eggs from the State of Zhou

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are silver needles.

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It seems to be a bad deal.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's going on?

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What's going on?

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's going on?

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Master Zhou.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You have to make it clear.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Zhou Yun Chen.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Master Zhou.

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can give you

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
whatever you want.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please help me this time.

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay?

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ten days ago,

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
our Young Master Zhou

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
found our commander.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He took the gold

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and asked us to use it.

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Our commander sent someone to check it.

287
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The silver needle

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
from the North Consort of the King of Yun

289
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
is not a good deal at all.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But there are good ones and bad ones.

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They are both good and bad.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Right, Young Master?

293
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Young Master Zhou.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You bastard!

295
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Father, don't do this.

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Kneel down!

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm not dead yet.

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How dare you do this

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
under my eyes?

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are so helpless.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Before I die,

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you will be the one

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
who will be the one to die, right?

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Father.

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've never thought of this before.

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Father.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Guards.

308
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Lock this bastard up.

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They framed me.

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Lock him up.

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Father.

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They framed me.

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Father.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Father.

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Miss An, take care.

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Boss Zhou.

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So many years.

318
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So many people.

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Boss Zhou, explain it to me.

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Everyone.

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Everyone.

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Everyone.

323
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't worry.

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I will give you

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
a satisfactory answer.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
we should

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
call it a day.

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Explain the problem clearly now.

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This year's silver needle

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
is not a good deal.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We have to return it to us.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Right?

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Not only return it,

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
we also have to pay the money.

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Everyone.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Calm down.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

387
