1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Young Master.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Which young master are you talking about?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Young Master.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Young Master.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Ye Zhi Qiu, calm down.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm here.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm here.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm here.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm here.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm here.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm here.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm here.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm here.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm here.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm here.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm here.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm here.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm here.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm here.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm here.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm here.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Citizens present.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Please deteriorate.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yong Keyi,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
due to 150 years Forward's late death,

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,580
she's definitely равно divorce him.

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,360
Are you afraid of me being able to do so far?

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,540
If you do,

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,180
I'm afraid you might feel really Bea Todian right now.

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,980
The things that I learned from him

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,940
from me when I grew up,

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,080
I don't know what I would do.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,020
What used to be his name in some other ways

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
used a different name then.

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,300
It seems A diabetes

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,860
Wuyi Tai, you're awake.

39
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,580
Nanxi, when did you come?

40
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
Just now.

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,820
Master is in a good mood today.

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,100
All the servants in the yard

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,420
have been rewarded.

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,940
Master asked me

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,460
to bring this to you.

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,580
This is the high-end jewelry

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,820
bought by the western auction house.

48
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,900
Such an expensive jewelry.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,900
Why didn't you send it to Wuyi Tai?

50
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,740
It's been three years.

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,540
Master finally opened up to you.

52
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,700
Wuyi Tai, you're so good.

53
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,820
Wu.

54
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,660
What's the letter?

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,660
A postman sent it

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,660
to you in the morning.

57
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,740
He said it was the bill

58
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,700
sent by the auction house.

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,020
You can't be assured.

60
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
The bill for the auction house?

61
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,620
I haven't bought it.

62
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,300
Wuyi Tai

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,620
Come out.

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,700
I know it's you.

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,380
It seems you still remember

66
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,460
my handwriting.

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,500
Is there any clue?

68
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,900
This is An He

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,300
staying at the new county.

70
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,140
Three years ago,

71
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,340
a week before the bloodbath,

72
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,620
An He returned to Pei Xiang.

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,620
A few months later, he secretly killed his son.

74
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,020
He didn't have time to

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,780
get rid of the suspicion of killing your sister.

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:38,900
Did you find out

77
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,260
whose child this is?

78
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,340
No one knows.

79
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,340
Commander-in-chief Lu and An He

80
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,860
have been together for less than a year.

81
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,620
As far as I know,

82
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,020
Commander-in-chief Lu

83
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,900
doesn't know

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,180
the existence of this child.

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,780
I'll continue to investigate it for you.

86
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,180
Thank you.

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,660
I paid you

88
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,860
the market price

89
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,740
of the private detective

90
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,020
according to the current report.

91
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,580
If you think it's not enough,

92
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,740
you can still mention it.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,700
Xiaoman, what do you mean?

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,980
I just don't like

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,780
others to help me

96
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,700
do things for nothing.

97
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,980
Do you think I'm investigating for you

98
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,340
and all of this

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,700
is a deal?

100
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,580
After all, you went to An He's hometown

101
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,100
for me.

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,060
You've done so much for me.

103
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,460
You can think of it as me making up for it,

104
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,780
or as me atoning for my sins,

105
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,460
or think of me

106
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,220
as a way to protect you.

107
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,140
But can you not do this

108
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,100
and treat my sacrifice as a deal?

109
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,580
Can you?

110
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,060
Yes.

111
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,340
This is what you should have done three years ago.

112
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,300
It seems that An He retreated

113
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,980
because of this child.

114
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,940
He, the Young Master,

115
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,420
and that playboy

116
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,860
are not close to each other.

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,820
They used to be best friends,

118
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,180
but they broke up.

119
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Could it be that this child

120
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
belongs to Zhou Yingmo?

121
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,260
If my mother came to the Zhou family

122
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,420
to seek revenge,

123
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,860
could she tell me

124
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,620
that the death of Chu Xue

125
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,860
was caused by someone else?

126
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
I don't know.

127
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,700
I don't know.

128
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,700
I don't know.

129
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,660
I don't know.

130
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,580
I don't know.

131
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,580
I don't know.

132
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,820
What's the secret behind Chu Xue's death?

133
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,100
Do you have any deep grudge against anyone?

134
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,860
Do you have any evidence?

135
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,140
I can help you.

136
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,060
I caused Chu Xue's death.

137
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,180
Don't say that.

138
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,060
It's my fault.

139
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,220
Could it be that in the middle of the death,

140
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,980
Zhou Yingmo is lying to me?

141
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,260
Madam.

142
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,420
What a coincidence.

143
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,340
Young Master.

144
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,260
Why are you here?

145
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,660
I'm here to buy some clothes for Madam.

146
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,420
I'm here to buy some clothes for Madam.

147
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,020
She won't see me and Yu Shi'an, right?

148
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,180
Madam, what's wrong?

149
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,580
You're here to buy some cloth.

150
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,220
Why didn't I see you holding it?

151
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,620
I saw some pictures of myself

152
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,620
who left me in sorrow.

153
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,060
I suddenly lost interest in it.

154
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,100
I suddenly lost interest in it.

155
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,180
I suddenly lost interest in it.

156
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,540
What picture?

157
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,100
I saw

158
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,100
Madam and Chief Yu

159
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,100
meeting privately.

160
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,420
You mean that?

161
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,380
I do have some old friends

162
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,940
with Chief Yu.

163
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,900
But we just met by chance in the cloth store.

164
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,180
It's not what you think.

165
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,980
What I think?

166
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,580
Please explain it to me.

167
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,020
You're still talking nonsense.

168
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,980
You're always talking nonsense.

169
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,820
What do you mean by that?

170
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,780
It's just a coincidence.

171
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,780
Just like you and me now.

172
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,740
What are you

173
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,380
and me now?

174
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,900
What are you doing?

175
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,420
Let go, Zhou Yichen.

176
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,100
I'm your mother.

177
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
If others see this,

178
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,900
what will they think?

179
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,500
Then let them see it.

180
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,820
Madam and Brother watched a play last night.

181
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,740
She slept with Father at night.

182
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,260
She met Chief Yu in the daytime.

183
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,900
Why can they do that?

184
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,780
I can't.

185
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,220
What do you mean by that?

186
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,180
I have no relationship with Chief Yu

187
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,620
or Chief Yu.

188
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,620
But look at what you're doing now.

189
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,220
Then let them see it.

190
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,020
It's best to let the police catch us.

191
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,780
Then we can ask

192
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,620
why Madam would rather hide from me

193
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,860
than meet Chief Yu's outsider.

194
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,780
Now,

195
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,860
I can only make it worse.

196
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
Why should I hide from you

197
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,380
instead of them?

198
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,180
Why don't you reflect on yourself?

199
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,900
Because you didn't do well enough.

200
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,100
I didn't stay with you

201
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
as happily,

202
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,940
freely and freely as I did.

203
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,260
Don't you understand

204
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,260
such a simple principle?

205
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Is it my fault?

206
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,660
Don't blame others.

207
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,140
Reflect on yourself.

208
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,300
Nobody could change the fact

209
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,660
he liked to dance.

210
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,900
He had Iceland wronged

211
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,460
and值ed his life.

212
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,060
You must be the¿¿識

213
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,020
you know better than those two men

214
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,220
back then.

215
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,860
They would be Done區

216
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,820
Brother.

217
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,100
Get moving quickly.

218
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,740
Don't let me wait.

219
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,380
Get still.

220
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,100
nausea throughout the state

221
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,660
is such a rude behavior.

222
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,700
You know me?

223
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,900
If you wanna order me

224
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,860
I'll take charge

225
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,820
Ye Xiaoman.

226
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,980
How did you know?

227
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,500
I know you.

228
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,020
Your sister showed me a picture of you

229
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,420
when you were in school.

230
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
I recognized you at a glance

231
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,220
when you came to the theater.

232
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,540
I know you didn't kill my sister.

233
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,700
Of course.

234
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,700
The one in this room

235
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,180
must be the one who cares about her the most.

236
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,180
You're the one

237
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,860
who's been guiding Liu Mengmei, right?

238
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Sir, I spent money today.

239
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,940
An He must pay me today.

240
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,540
An He.

241
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,460
An He.

242
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,700
An He.

243
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,860
Open the door.

244
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,660
An He.

245
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,260
Get down.

246
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,580
I can hold you.

247
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,060
It's too high.

248
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Trust me.

249
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,940
Trust yourself.

250
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,620
Hold on.

251
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,380
Hold on.

252
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,700
You're the same as the wine-drinking trend.

253
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,460
You've been living a humble and hard life.

254
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,300
Why are you always smiling so happily?

255
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
Because I have a dream.

256
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,860
What's your dream?

257
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,420
Freedom.

258
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,740
An He, do you want freedom?

259
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,540
What's freedom?

260
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,900
It's the feeling of now.

261
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,660
We're just ourselves.

262
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,140
We're not slaves of others.

263
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
We're not the heroes.

264
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
We don't need to be beautiful.

265
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
We don't need to be obedient.

266
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,820
We don't need to be obedient.

267
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,980
Freedom of thought.

268
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,020
Freedom of dressing.

269
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,180
Freedom of love.

270
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,300
Freedom of making money.

271
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,740
Will there be such a day?

272
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,860
There will be.

273
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,100
I never thought

274
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,460
she would choose this way

275
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,740
to end herself

276
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,620
in such a good way.

277
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,940
My sister didn't kill herself.

278
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,780
Someone killed her.

279
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Why did you say that?

280
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,580
I got the autopsy report.

281
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,500
I almost got burned in the police station.

282
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,580
Before she died,

283
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,140
she was abused and abused by the common people.

284
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,340
She was thrown into the pond and drowned.

285
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,420
She was killed in the pond.

286
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,700
She never thought about

287
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,820
taking the initiative to die.

288
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,300
So,

289
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,540
you married into the Zhou family

290
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,580
to find out the truth?

291
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,820
Yes.

292
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,180
I have to find out the truth

293
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,740
even if I die.

294
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,100
Who do you suspect?

295
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,020
Zhou Yi Mo.

296
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,260
Zhou Yichen.

297
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,900
It's not Zhou Yi Mo.

298
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,420
Why?

299
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
From what I know about his character,

300
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,780
it can't be him.

301
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,900
The eldest young master of the Zhou family

302
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
is a man who is unruly.

303
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,140
It's rare that you,

304
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,700
the wife of Hongyan,

305
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,420
would listen to him.

306
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,220
You misunderstood.

307
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
I met him frequently

308
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,180
to bring your sister out.

309
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,020
The second aunt of the Zhou family was too arrogant

310
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,420
and always hurt your sister.

311
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,260
So, she made excuses

312
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,300
to bring him out to listen to the opera.

313
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,020
Actually, she did it to help your sister.

314
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,060
She has suffered a lot.

315
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,780
Really?

316
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,540
As for Zhou Yichen...

317
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,420
What's wrong with Zhou Yichen?

318
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,460
I don't want to talk about it.

319
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
Miss Bai, are you leaving?

320
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,780
Don't keep him waiting.

321
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,380
I have something to do.

322
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,260
I'll leave first.

323
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,220
Wait.

324
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,820
You and my sister

325
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,100
are so close.

326
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,540
Why do you have to break up?

327
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,500
It's my personal matter.

328
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,380
Anyway,

329
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,100
it's not her fault.

330
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,140
Everyone has secrets.

331
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,900
I respect you.

332
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,540
But if these things

333
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,300
are related to my sister's death,

334
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,260
I'm sorry.

335
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,740
I will find out the truth.

336
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,340
What is freedom?

337
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,020
It's the feeling now.

338
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,540
We are just ourselves.

339
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,900
We are not slaves of anyone.

340
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,100
We are not the best.

341
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
We don't need to be beautiful.

342
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,380
We don't need to be obedient.

343
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
We don't need to be obedient.

344
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,740
Freedom of thought.

345
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,780
Freedom of clothes.

346
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,860
Freedom of love.

347
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,980
Freedom of money.

348
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,020
Sister.

349
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,940
If it's really like what An He said,

350
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,460
my sister's death has nothing to do with Zhou Yi Mo.

351
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,500
Then what happened between

352
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,340
my sister, Zhou Yichen

353
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,340
and him?

354
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,700
Wuyi, you are back.

355
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,460
Master is waiting for you in the back hall.

356
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,100
I'll go there in my clothes.

357
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,900
I think you should go now.

358
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,060
It's not good to let Master wait.

359
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,300
Please.

360
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,020
Please.

361
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Kneel down.

362
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,340
How dare you!

363
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,060
What did you do

364
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,700
to Master's wine last night?

365
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,900
I dare not.

366
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Then what is this?

367
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,820
This is what we found in the female room.

368
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,500
Master's gold is not for you to make.

369
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
This?

370
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,300
Sister.

371
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,620
You don't know

372
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,820
this is the most popular

373
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,660
in the market now.

374
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,540
You...

375
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,660
You are shameless.

376
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,260
If I were you,

377
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,060
you would have tried new things.

378
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Now,

379
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,020
Sister is not coming back for a long time.

380
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,300
We three are living a better life

381
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,700
than anything else.

382
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,180
You are right.

383
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,580
Master.

384
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,860
This is the medicine for you.

385
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,580
If you encourage and allow it,

386
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,500
what will happen next?

387
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,700
Who knows what's in

388
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,900
these dirty things?

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,780
Have you forgotten about the second child?

390
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,460
Enough.

391
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,300
Don't mention that woman in front of me.

392
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
That...

393
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,900
That should be punished.

394
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,420
I know my fault.

395
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,980
I dare not do it again.

396
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,100
Banzhi,

397
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,820
you can take care of this problem.

398
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm tired.

399
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,820
Since Master asks me to deal with it,

400
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,820
I can

401
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I'll teach you a lesson tonight.

402
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,660
Wu Yitai, I'm sorry.

403
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,860
Wu Yitai, I'm sorry.
