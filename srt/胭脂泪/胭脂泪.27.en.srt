00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't be nervous.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm just testing this gun.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The evidence of Zhou Quan is here?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Actually, I've always been curious

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
since when did you become a person who kills without blinking?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why did you take this wrong path?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is this the new maid my mother brought back?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Isn't this just a child?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What work can you do at such a young age?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I can do work.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can cook,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
mop the floor, and sew clothes.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't sell me.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can cook?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can cook at such a young age?

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can step on the board and cook.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can wash the dishes.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can clean the house.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can...

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't worry.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We won't sell you.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's go and play.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I have to work.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't worry.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We'll tell them later that you've cleaned the house.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go and have a look.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I just entered Zhou's mansion.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
When I met you,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I thought I had the best two brothers in the world.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I didn't expect him to show up.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello, Young Master.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hello.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nanxi, here.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So many?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you, Young Master.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Share this with the girls in the yard.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In the future,

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
tell me more good things.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Help Chu Xue pick a good-looking one.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Take it.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Jin Anhe is performing in Qingfeng House.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I asked someone to pay for it.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You go with me.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Young Master.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I like Tian Anhe's opera.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you take me with you?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm always on his side.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll take two.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Young Master.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have a lot of things to do.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have to send the cake to the second child.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The cake?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nanxi is here.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nanxi.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Send the cake to the second child.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Anhe told me to leave the best for you.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm just a dog.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Nanxi.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello, Young Master.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are you here alone?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Where is Sister Chu Xue?

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
She went to the opera with Young Master.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She went to the opera again.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
By the way,

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
you like opera, too.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why didn't you go with her?

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm busy.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to send the cake to the second child.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I asked Young Master to take her.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Young Master.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why did you change a sachet?

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I embroidered it for you.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The sachet you embroidered for me

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
was old by Sister Chu Xue.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I embroidered a new one.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She changed it?

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Does it look good?

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go ahead.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm leaving.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've always wanted

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to have a brother like you.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But I didn't expect

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that after Ye Chu Xue died,

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
nothing happened in the Zhou Mansion.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Only you

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
asked about the progress

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
of the case

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
at the beginning.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nothing happened.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't expect

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
anyone to mention it.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's exactly what you want.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you want everyone

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to know the truth?

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I've planned everything

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
for this case.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Including the butler and the handwriting.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I didn't expect

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
no one would investigate it.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
At this time,

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I realized

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the maid

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is just a maid.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Even if she's happy with her master,

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
she's no different from

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
a pet dog.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I must climb up.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't want to be a maid.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I want to be a master.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You designed me

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to be the master of the Zhou Family.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Actually,

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
when Jinbao told me

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you were the master of the He Family,

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't think

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I would use this trick to trick you.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because I did see

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the hope of controlling

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
my own fate in you.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But it's all Ye Zhi Qiu's fault.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He dragged you to check the handwriting

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and asked San Yi Tai

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to find the whereabouts of the three-point money.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This woman is too smart.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
She must have found out my crime.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
San Yi Tai's death

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
is all because of Ye Zhi Qiu.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's all because of him.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He forced me to do it.

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why are you here?

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Actually,

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I could have dealt with him.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But at this time,

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have Zhang Jinbao's child.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can only

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
break the relationship between you.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Only I, Nanxi,

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
have your child, Zhou Yi Mo,

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and your child,

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
can be completely reliable.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Ye Zhi Qiu forced me to do it.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have no choice.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
now everything is not important.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Money,

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
freedom

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and the child

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
are all important.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And the safety in this chaotic world.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I, Nanxi,

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
can finally start a new life.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I really want to congratulate you.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The evidence is in there.

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait for me to give it to you.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll wait for you.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Nanxi.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Nanxi.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You moved to Zhou Quan.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You think you can run away?

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Lan'er.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's you.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Didn't you say you would wait for me?

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's only been a few days.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I thought you couldn't come back.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I couldn't come back.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
are living in the Zhou's Mansion?

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Zhang Jinbao.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How dare you betray me?

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I betrayed you?

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are a murderer.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You have been pretending to be a little white flower for so long.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Who dares to live with you?

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Get out.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is my home.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Zhang Jinbao.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What did you say?

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Say it again.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You helped Second Young Master sell opium.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you really think I don't know?

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What else do you want to say?

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I would have known you were a murderer.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't want to have too much future with you.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You crazy woman.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Zhang Jinbao.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll kill you.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Qing Dynasty.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No king.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How can Qing Dynasty be a king?

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Princess.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's go back.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Go back.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Lan'er.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Master.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Jinbao asked me to give this to you before he died.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He said he was sorry.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Buy two good coffins and bury them.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes, Master.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's go.

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The one who betrays the one he loves will be the one who is betrayed.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He will be the one who is lonely.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is the police station.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What are you doing?

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is the evidence that you are corrupt and corrupt in the hands of Nanxi.

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you want to see?

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Use power to kill people and protect them.

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Quite a lot.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No wonder Nanxi took you to death.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you still doing?

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hurry up and catch Jinbao and the police.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hurry up.

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stop.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
As a security guard,

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you take the gun to fight for the people.

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Put down your gun.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You...

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yushen.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I treated you well before.

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well?

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I still remember that

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
brothers were born to die for your master.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
In the end,

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
they were just your dogs.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But who was born to be a dog?

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Brothers.

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will give you a chance to see the situation clearly.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If you lose your power,

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you don't have to be a dog anymore.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Understand?

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No one will force you

243
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
to do anything ungrateful.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No one will

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
threaten you with your family.

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Take her away.

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you, Brother Shi'an.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I really can't see you suffer.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You don't have to come today.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why don't I have to come?

251
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't care if your head is open.

252
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But I just can't accept

253
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
her head being shot.

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm here.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She won't.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Zhao Yimo.

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yu Shi'an.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
My sister finally got to be a member of Zhao Xue.

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Thank you.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you.

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We're just kidding.

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Right?

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The three of us

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
care about our lives more than anything else.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Right?

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who wants to live with you?

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You live alone.

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Live with him?

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wu Xie's report!

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Chief of Wu Xie Police, Zhou Quan

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
committed a crime of murder,

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
protection and bribery

274
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
with his own power.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The court of the Republic of China

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
has no evidence to prove it.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He was sentenced to death

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
according to the law.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He will be executed immediately.

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sister.

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You told me in your dream

282
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that you had let go of your hatred.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Revenge

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is just my obsession.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But I want to say

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that I only keep following the real murderer.

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's how I can feel

288
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
that you

289
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
have been by my side

290
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and never left.

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't feel

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
how happy I am now.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How relieved I am.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it seems that we

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
have lost contact.

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Isn't that right?

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You have to live well for me.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Sister.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Live well.

302
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Work hard for yourself.

303
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I will come to see you

304
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
every time it snows.

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Sister.

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The wind blows the red dry

307
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You are cold and I am warm

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If the cold is the fruit of the rose

309
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How can it be the waiting

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The moonlight soaks the dark night

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The moonlight soaks the dark night

312
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Suddenly the white of the moon

313
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
is shining in the corner of the pond

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The blood-red love is floating in the mirror

315
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I take the murder given by his foot

316
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I take the murder given by his foot

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I take the murder given by his foot

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I take the murder given by his foot

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The moon is shining in the mirror

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I take the murder given by his foot

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I take the murder given by his foot

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I take the murder given by his foot
