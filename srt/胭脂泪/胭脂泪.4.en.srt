1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let me down!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Don't move.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What do you want?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're in such a mess.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Aren't you afraid that my father will pursue you tomorrow?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He has already been treated with opium.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He won't remember anything tomorrow.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As long as you don't tell him,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
no one will find out.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I admit that I underestimated you.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Really?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The one who is the mastermind behind the baton

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is you, right?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Before the wedding,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
there was a woman who claimed to be a maid at the Zhou Mansion.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She went to the lantern shop and checked the lanterns.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But there were no maids in the mansion.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
On the day of the wedding,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you gave my father a scent of baton grass

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and stood up to save him.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just to make my father look at you.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why did you use Nanxi to expose the baton grass to me?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What is your purpose?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I just want to see

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
if you are really dead.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Dead or alive.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
On the wedding night,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you secretly sent a letter to Er Yitai

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and tricked him into going to the pond.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You asked someone to play a trick on him

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and wanted to kill him.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's my mother.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She is my closest friend.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why should I harm her?

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Young Master is the son of the late Madam.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When Madam was pregnant,

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
her husband died.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But her family is the richest family in the world.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So our Master married Madam

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to make our Young Master have a father.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Our Master is handsome.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So he was attracted by Madam's sister.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
After Master He passed away,

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
our Master married her to be Er Yitai.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
After Madam died,

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Young Master passed away

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to be Er Yitai.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All these years,

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you've been living a life of a playboy.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What you're doing

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
is to avenge your mother's death.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The murderer is Er Yitai.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You know so much.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I've killed myself countless times

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
before I could get here.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You came to Zhong Mansion

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to avenge my mother's death.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Young Master,

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
who doesn't have secrets?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mind your own business.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Since we have the same goal,

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can do anything for you.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't understand what you're talking about.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Tell me.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I can help you.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Help me?

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't deserve it.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Master,

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
look at my golden hair.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Isn't it beautiful?

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You said

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you only love me in this life.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But why did you find them?

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're so heartless, sister.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You've spent your whole life

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
on a man.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not true, right?

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Maybe you're the one...

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you love him?

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
...who is pitiful and pitiful.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You love me.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You love me.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Did you see that?

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Second Master's face was burned to the ground.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I saw it. It's terrible.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Enough. Stop looking.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Leave.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, Young Master.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Madam.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I met Second Sister yesterday.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She's gone today.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The police sent someone to investigate.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll stay here.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Go back to your room and have a good rest.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you, Second Master.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll go back first.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go back.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wait.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I guess

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
this is the Wuyi Tai who just entered the mansion.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yu.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There are many people here.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll let Madam go back and have a rest.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If the fire is big,

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you can use a stone pot.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No need.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's my first time to meet you.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm Yu Xun.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Xiaoman.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Brother Shi'an.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My sister couldn't have killed herself.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She must have been killed by someone.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can you check again?

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I beg you.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Can you check again?

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Use the compensation fund of the Zhou family

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to live well.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you still live in the mansion,

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I won't expect you to be like this.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But...

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But my sister...

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If she wasn't hurt by someone,

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
why did she burn the body in such a hurry?

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's clearly a murder.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Brother Shi'an.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll investigate it.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll pay for the blood.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll give you an answer.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay?

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother Shi'an.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Can I trust you?

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Silly.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can not trust others.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But you must trust me.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The Zhou family is so generous.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The family received compensation fund.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They won't pursue the blood anymore.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Please deal with the case file and the case report as soon as possible.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
After the case is over,

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you will be the acting chief.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
After all, you and our master

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
are brothers.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't worry.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've arranged the people who believed in me.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now they are destroying the house in the backyard.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why are you here, Xiaoman?

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Step aside.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Xiaoman, don't be impulsive.

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why are you holding the gun?

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I said step aside.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ye Xiaoman.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't have enough time.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Put the gun down.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go back.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why did you lie to me?

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Give me the thing.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm protecting you.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go back.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's my first time to meet you.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
May I ask what is the name of Wuyi Tai?

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wuyi Tai is Wuyi Tai.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's the name?

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is it important?

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Please cooperate.

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My surname is Ye.

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My name is Zhiqiu.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What a coincidence.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I had a friend before.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
His surname is Ye.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
His surname is Ye.

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But I have no contact with him now.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm tired.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Can I go back?

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Last night, Wuyi Tai died.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The whole Zhou family will be investigated.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are right.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Wuyi Tai was with my father last night.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why don't you investigate my father first?

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You are investigating my father?

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You are the chief of the Zhou family.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My father is a cousin.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Not to mention Jingqu.

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The whole Wu County is our Zhou family.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The young man of the Zhou family

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
speaks with a strong voice.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's better than you

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
using a real knife and a real gun to scare people.

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yu Xunzhang.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are right.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
My mother was burned to death inside.

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are a chief.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You are not working hard.

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You are pulling a young and beautiful old man.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What right do you have

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to let me talk to you?

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wuyi, let's go.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you want?

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know that police officer.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Young Master is thinking too much.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did you set the fire?

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yesterday, you pulled me out

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
from his room.

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't set fire.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I just wanted to see

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
if you were still alive.

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I didn't do anything.

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I just wanted to see

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
if you were still alive.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You wouldn't know.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's you who is more suspicious.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
After all, the way he died

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
is the same as your mother's death.

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Whether it's me or not,

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the police will give the truth.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
As long as I'm sure it's not you.

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Truth?

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The so-called truth

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
may be that the whole Wu County

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is the Zhou family.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The Zhou family is black is black.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The Zhou family is white is white.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Whatever you want to do,

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can help you.

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can protect you.

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Master has an emergency.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Call all the family members to the hall.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Who is he?

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The driver Zhang Jinbao.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
His own person.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's split up and go to the hall.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You go first.

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Zhou Yimeng, I warn you.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Life is in the hands of God.

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't play tricks.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I promise you.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Back then, my He family was in Wu County.

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It was a glorious and dignified life.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You, Zhou Huaiqian,

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
were favored by my He family.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I married you

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to his two most precious daughters.

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now, I can't be a good wife.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Although he is a concubine,

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I watched him grow up.

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If you don't give me an explanation,

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
how will our He family survive?

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Mother, don't worry.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will investigate this matter.

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Master, the doctor is here.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Master.

262
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is the second son?

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It seems that the second son's family

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
is here to seek justice.

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Where did you go last night?

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Last night,

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I stayed in my room.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't go anywhere.

269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Master, he's lying.

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yesterday,

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
when I went to the orphanage

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to check the second son's pregnancy,

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I saw the second son's mother

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
was in the room.

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When I was checking the second son's pregnancy,

276
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I saw the second son

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
was dragged out of the room by the second son.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I heard the master shouting in the room.

279
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Stop burning. Stop burning.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You bitch.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's you.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
As long as I bite Zhou Yi Mo to death,

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
what if he sees it?

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Sorry, I'm late.

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Here he comes.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Lao Lao.

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
My grandson, get up.

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yi Mo, let me ask you.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Did you see the second and the fifth son's mother last night?

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I saw them.

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Of course I saw them.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can help you.

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can protect you.

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, no.

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I knew this bitch was lying.

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How dare you lie to me?

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Master.

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Father.

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What does he want to do?

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What does he want to do?

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I've seen the fifth and the sixth son's mother.

302
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I also know something important.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You bitch.

304
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You betrayed me.

305
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why did you tie the personal clothes?

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Father, please guess.

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What did he do to the second and the sixth son's mother all these years?

308
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Lv Damping.

309
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Li Xue Ping.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Li Tatao.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What do you want to do?

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Xu Zotong.

313
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wait and see.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Xiong Erchun.

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What are these?

316
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't understand.

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Father.

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
These are all the western medicine that you can't take.

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What?

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Heart.

321
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The reason why my aunt didn't admit it

322
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is to care about your face.

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yesterday, my son learned that the second aunt was in a bad mood.

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He wanted to chat with her.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That day, he just arrived, but he found the fifth aunt.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He was holding the medicine and was in a confrontation with the second aunt.

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
At first, I thought it was the fifth aunt who was making trouble in the room.

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I dragged him out of the room.

329
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When I arrived this morning, I went to the hospital to ask.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It turned out that the second aunt had been giving you medicine.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I would never betray you.

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why are you doing this to me?

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why?

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Calm down, father.

335
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If you can't get it, you'll destroy it.

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's not the first day you met the second aunt.

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So this is where you played.

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
