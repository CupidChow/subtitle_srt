1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:54,000
It's me, Gao Jia

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,680
Sister

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
have us to pay Brian for killing me,

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,720
and now you're making me suffer.

6
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,840
Finally.

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,040
Young Master Evening.

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
You are childlike.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
As for Mr. Zhou,

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,080
he will be given more money

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,760
because of his superstition.

12
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
As for these two young masters,

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,320
there must be someone

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,720
who has insulted you among them.

15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,920
I won't let them live well.

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,720
I've been saying that I want to go shopping with you.

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,200
But I'm not feeling well.

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,160
So I've moved all the money

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,400
in the shopping mall to your home.

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
You can choose.

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Thank you, Master.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
But there are too many people.

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,800
I can't choose.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you afraid of?

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
You two

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
are not good friends.

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
Why are you standing here?

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm helping you choose.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,640
Okay.

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,560
I think that one is good.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,560
This one is a little plain.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
That one is good.

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,280
This one is a little dark.

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,560
I don't like them, Master.

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,160
I'll help you choose one.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,920
How about this one?

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,640
It's not good.

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,720
It's too thick.

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,440
I like it because you like it.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
Actually,

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,600
the two young masters you just chose

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,560
are not bad.

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,280
You can change the style

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,720
and style occasionally.

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,560
You can change the style.

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Okay.

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,720
Well,

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
it's too troublesome to choose one.

49
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,720
Leave all of them.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Send them to the room of Wuyi Tai later.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,720
Okay.

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Father really loves women.

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,760
Brother,

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,160
we should learn from him.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,360
Lift your eyes.

56
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,040
To your loved woman of course,

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
you have to do better.

58
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,320
By the way,

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,760
I guess you two

60
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
must be getting married

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,440
at the age of last year.

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,360
I can't marry him, father.

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,280
I'll be trapped if I marry him.

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,440
As his brother,

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I'll let him marry you first.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,400
Brother,

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
I'm not as sincere as you.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,720
Besides,

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
I have a lot of business

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
to learn and manage.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
A man should have a good family

72
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
rather than delay his career.

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,240
You're right, Xiaowu.

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
You two are different

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
and suitable for different girls.

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
How about this?

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,240
I'll be Zhang Long.

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,880
I'll ask Xipo to handle this matter in a few days.

79
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,440
Good.

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,520
Xiaowu, you're so considerate.

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm relieved.

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,320
Young Master.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,360
It's late.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
Why do you want to see me?

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Xipo has found some good girls for me.

87
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,560
I want to give you some freedom to choose from.

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
I've asked for the photos.

89
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,160
They like you,

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,240
what your hobbies are,

91
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
and what your personality is.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,480
I've asked Nanxi to find out about them.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Take a look first.

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,120
If you have any good girls,

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
I'll arrange for you to meet.

96
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,760
Young Master,

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,440
I think every girl is good.

98
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,440
Her family is good, her personality is good,

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
her appearance and her education are good.

100
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,360
What's wrong?

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
Don't you know

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,520
what I like?

103
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,600
I don't know

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,400
what you like.

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,840
Then I don't want them.

106
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,120
Young Master,

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
take a look at them.

108
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,840
What's wrong?

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm not interested in marriage.

110
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
If you insist,

111
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll accept it.

112
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,440
I have a lot of things to do today.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
If you have nothing else,

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,520
you should go back and rest.

115
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll leave the photos here.

116
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
I'll go back and rest.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,800
There are so many girls

118
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
and Young Master doesn't even look at them.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I wonder what kind of girl he likes.

120
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,640
He's not interested in women?

121
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,040
He doesn't like...

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,360
Don't talk nonsense.

123
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,720
Does Young Master have a best friend?

124
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Is that why he resists the blind date?

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,240
No.

126
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,600
Definitely not.

127
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
These three girls

128
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,400
are very strict with him.

129
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Not only do they want to know their friends' identities,

130
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,640
they even want to choose

131
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,440
the best maidservant for them.

132
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,840
But I've never seen

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,640
any maidservant around him.

134
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
A few years ago,

135
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
there was a maid.

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,200
She was a scholar.

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
She was close to Young Master.

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
But after the Third Prince found out,

139
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,880
she sent her to the Second Prince.

140
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,400
You mean Lan'er?

141
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
She's called Chu Xue.

142
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,640
She jumped into the river and committed suicide three years ago.

143
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,960
After Young Master found out,

144
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
she was sad for a while.

145
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,320
It seems that she has a different

146
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
relationship with this maid.

147
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,120
I think

148
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,520
this maid

149
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,560
has a better relationship with Young Master.

150
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Have some tea.

151
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,320
Take your time.

152
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,800
I didn't expect that

153
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,480
you and I are the same.

154
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,800
You like to gossip about Young Masters.

155
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,280
I know them better.

156
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
Then I can help them

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,200
figure out the right person.

158
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
You're right.

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,040
Mrs. Wu, let me tell you.

160
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,880
Young Master used to go out to listen to opera.

161
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,680
He always took Chu Xue with him.

162
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
It's said that

163
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,400
he, Young Master,

164
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,600
and that maid

165
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,360
are not close to each other.

166
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,360
What maid?

167
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,280
A female opera singer who specializes in acting.

168
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
Her name is An He.

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
But three years ago,

170
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
An He passed away.

171
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,760
Young Master was so nice to him.

172
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
He took Chu Xue to perform for him every day.

173
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,680
He just announced that he would pay for it.

174
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,960
This morning,

175
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
Young Master bought the tickets.

176
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
An He

177
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,680
Sister,

178
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,520
who did you learn this from?

179
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,560
Her name is An He.

180
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,720
She is my best friend.

181
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,240
I'll take you to see her when I have the chance.

182
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
You'll know

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
what is

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,880
the best friend.

185
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,480
It seems that

186
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
An He is the key clue

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,560
to the relationship between sister and Young Master.

188
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
Please inform me.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm Zhou Yi Mo.

190
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Miss An has left your family.

191
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
She can leave the rest of the family.

192
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
But she definitely wants to see me.

193
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,400
Young Master!

194
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,080
Thank you for your hard work.

195
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,200
You may leave.

196
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Long time no see.

197
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
Long time no see.

198
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,160
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

199
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,560
What do you want from me?

200
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,640
You performed well today.

201
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,240
I have to come to the concert.

202
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,400
Here you are.

203
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,520
Sister's jade pendant

204
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,280
is in Zhou Yi Mo's hand.

205
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,840
I killed Chu Xuan.

206
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
Don't say that.

207
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
It's my fault.

208
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,120
He,

209
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,160
Young Master,

210
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,400
and that character

211
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,040
are not related.

212
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

213
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
Five, four, three, two, one.

214
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,640
Five, four, three, two, one.

215
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
Why are you here?

216
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,760
Have you forgotten?

217
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,000
I asked the bride to send you the information about the blind date.

218
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,440
But it doesn't matter.

219
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
It's the same here.

220
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm not interested in this.

221
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,040
If I say

222
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
there is someone Young Master cares about...

223
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
You came to me

224
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,160
just to show me this?

225
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,000
You know him?

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Not only that,

227
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,480
we were close before.

228
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,840
But now

229
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,440
you come to me.

230
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
What does it have to do with me?

231
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,720
leaning against brothers

232
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
isn't real.

233
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,160
Now...

234
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,200
Your sister

235
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
never here but cold.

236
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,920
If I were really guilty,

237
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,480
I would have known my mother's identity.

238
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
Why did I have to be your target?

239
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm doing this to protect you.

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
Young Master, you used this kind of lie

241
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,520
to trick my sister?

242
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,240
You don't suspect me, your sister

243
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,200
and Miss An He, right?

244
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
Do I need to suspect you?

245
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,760
You used my sister's jade pendant

246
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,640
to please that playboy.

247
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,880
The jade pendant was given to Miss An He by your sister.

248
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
They are best friends.

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Later, they broke up.

250
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
An He asked me to return it to Chu Xuan.

251
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,920
I couldn't bear to

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,560
keep it in my hand for so long.

253
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
Do you think I will believe you?

254
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,120
I, Zhou Yi Mo,

255
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,080
have never had an ambiguous relationship with a man or a woman.

256
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,600
I already have someone in my heart.

257
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,240
The Ye Xiao Man you are looking for has disappeared.

258
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,440
We can't find him either.

259
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,600
His only sister jumped into the river to commit suicide.

260
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,200
After he went back to his grave,

261
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,720
he never came back.

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
I said I had half a lie.

263
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,680
You can take this heart away at any time.

264
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,920
April 28, templates

265
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,680
The moonlight soaks the night

266
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,680
The night is covered in moonlight

267
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,680
The white of the lily in the pond

268
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,680
The blood-colored love in the mirror

269
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,680
The Kitchen tiden

270
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:36,580
The亞 Center for Culturalני

271
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Look at them from there
