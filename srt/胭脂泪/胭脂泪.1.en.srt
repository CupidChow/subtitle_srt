1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Club

2
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,280
My Lover

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,580
Zhuo영 contradicted yourcha

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
You have me in your heart, too.

6
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Don't you?

7
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
No.

8
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
No.

9
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
No.

10
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Zhou's Mansion is haunted.

11
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,300
His Lordship is a

12
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
Mi Ba Zi Young.

13
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
He's a Wutai,

14
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
but he's also a stranger

15
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
who can't be sought

16
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
even for a good home.

17
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
As long as I can enter Zhou's Mansion,

18
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
I am a ghost.

19
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
I am a mountain.

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Three years ago,

21
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
my sister Ye Chu Xue

22
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,300
was a maid in Zhou's Mansion

23
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
and suffered a few cruel torture

24
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
and then died.

25
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Zhou's Mansion and the prison should be the truth

26
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
and be the cause of the suicide of the rebel king Cao Cao.

27
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
I will let all those who have hurt my sister

28
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
pay the price.

29
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,300
I will let all those who have hurt my sister

30
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
pay the price.

31
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,300
I said where did the fragrance come from?

32
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
It's my new nanny Wu.

33
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Young Master.

34
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
You've seen me before.

35
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Young Master is a man of great strength

36
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
and a man of great power.

37
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
You are kind and elegant.

38
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I am a man of great strength

39
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
and a man of great power.

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
I am a man of great strength

41
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
and a man of great power.

42
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
You are so sweet.

43
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
I also got the footwear of the beloved.

44
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
I also got the footwear of the beloved.

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Young Master, you can't kill people.

46
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Brother, don't be rude.

47
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
The second young master of Zhou's Mansion.

48
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,340
The future master of Zhou's Mansion, Zhou Yi Chen.

49
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Hello, second young master.

50
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
My nanny knows me.

51
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
My nanny has already checked all of us.

52
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Brother, don't be rude.

53
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
My nanny, this is my brother.

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,340
He is used to playing with fire.

55
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,340
You can't hurt him.

56
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
I am used to it.

57
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Don't worry.

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Father is busy.

59
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I will take you there.

60
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Thank you, second young master.

61
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
This is the result of betraying me.

62
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Please wait a moment.

63
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Steward, clean this up.

64
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Yes.

65
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Father, please go to the hall.

66
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Yes.

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Father, please go to the hall.

68
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
You should go to the hall.

69
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Let's go.

70
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,380
The clouds are not raining.

71
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,380
The air is clear.

72
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
Today, the people of Zhou's Mansion.

73
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,380
My master is in his prime.

74
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,380
He is going to get the fifth house.

75
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
First bow to the spring light of the tea mountain.

76
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,380
The wind is good and the tea is full.

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Second bow to the spring light of the tea mountain.

78
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Third bow.

79
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Where did so many bats come from?

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Be careful.

81
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Hurry.

82
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Master, are you okay?

83
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I am fine.

84
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
You are hurt.

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
I am fine.

86
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
I am fine.

87
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
I am fine.

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
You are not afraid of bats.

89
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
You are afraid of fire.

90
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
I am afraid of fire.

91
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
Does your hand still hurt?

92
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
No.

93
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Master Zhou is in a panic.

94
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
How could this be?

95
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Master.

96
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
Since you are married into Zhou's Mansion.

97
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Don't regret it.

98
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
What are you doing?

99
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
Ge Zhen is listening to you.

100
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,420
I just want to ask about my father's health.

101
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
What health?

102
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
You know that.

103
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,420
These years, I have been in a bad mood.

104
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
Brother.

105
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
You are so steady.

106
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Isn't it stimulating him?

107
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
You are so stubborn.

108
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
You are talking about father behind his back.

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
You are a gentleman.

110
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
You are father's little gift.

111
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Don't be so nosy.

112
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
When father needs you the most.

113
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Where are you?

114
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Congratulations, Wuyi.

115
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
This is the recognition and reward from master.

116
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Master is very good to his wives.

117
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
You will know it in the future.

118
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Thank you, butler.

119
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
I am sorry.

120
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I am sorry.

121
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I am sorry.

122
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I am sorry.

123
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I am sorry.

124
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I am sorry.

125
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I am sorry.

126
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I am sorry.

127
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I am sorry.

128
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Thank you, butler.

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I will go back by myself.

130
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Please wait.

131
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay.

132
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
I stayed anyway.

133
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
The weather is so nice.

134
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I found Ye Chu Xue's body in the kitchen.

135
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,400
There are 137 traces of opium on the victim's body.

136
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Next,

137
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
the suspect who killed sister will be the first one.

138
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Who is the victim?

139
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Tell me.

140
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Who did this?

141
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Er Yi Tai.

142
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I really don't know.

143
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,400
It seems that you are adopted.

144
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Madam.

145
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I sent the body.

146
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
You and the new Wuyi Tai share it.

147
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
A poor and miserable ghost.

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
He deserves it.

149
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Nan Xi is just a maid.

150
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
She doesn't dare to forget the master's matter.

151
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
If you have any questions,

152
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
you can ask master directly.

153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Tell me.

154
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,400
How did you get this knife from Guo Wu?

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
How did you get this thing?

156
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
I took the knife by myself.

157
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
No one touched it.

158
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I don't know.

159
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Get out.

160
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Go.

161
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I know what you did that year.

162
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
You killed sister.

163
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
I know what you did that year.

164
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Come to the backyard tonight to find me.

165
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Who called me?

166
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Who?

167
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
You are still acting like a ghost.

168
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Let me go.

170
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I know it.

171
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
No.

172
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Help.

173
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I don't want to die.

174
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Er Yi Tai.

175
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
What's wrong?

176
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Er Yi Tai.

177
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Are you okay?

178
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
He wants to drown me.

179
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
He wants to drown me.

180
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Ghost.

181
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Ghost.

182
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Where is he?

183
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Go home.

184
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
There is a water trap over there.

185
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Send Er Yi Tai back.

186
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Find all the servants in the house.

187
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Search.

188
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Yes.

189
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
This way.

190
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Follow me.

191
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Search here.

192
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Don't move.

193
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Yes.

194
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
This way.

195
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Be careful.

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Why are you still here?

197
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

198
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I heard the call.

199
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
How could it be so coincidental?

200
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
It's my turn to ask you.

201
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Why did you come to the backyard at the first night of the wedding?

202
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Do I need to report to you?

203
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
It's the first day of the wedding.

204
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
You are wandering around in the backyard.

205
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
It's hard not to let me suspect that you are not here for something else.

206
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I have something important to lose.

207
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I came out to look for the lost.

208
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Young Master.

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
I am your aunt.

210
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Please be careful.

211
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Is your aunt looking for this?

212
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Where did you find it?

213
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Tell me how to repay me.

214
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I will think about it.

215
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
As long as you help me wear it,

216
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I can repay you in any way you want.

217
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I will do it.

218
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I will do it.

219
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I will do it.

220
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I will do it.

221
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Do you want to take a look at

222
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,400
what your father gave me?

223
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
I am not interested in knowing his evil taste.

224
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
But I am interested in you.

225
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Let me go.

226
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Let me go.

227
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
You are making me cry.

228
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Tell me.

229
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Where did you get this jade pendant?

230
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
The bathroom in the house is full of jade.

231
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Why do you care so much?

232
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
I will not say that this rope will only get tighter and tighter.

233
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I will ask you one last time.

234
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Where did you get this jade pendant?

235
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Who are you?

236
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Who else can I be?

237
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I am your father's

238
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
little mother.

239
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Really?

240
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I will pretend that nothing happened tonight.

241
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I have never seen you.

242
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
You have never seen me either.

243
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
You have never seen me either.

244
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
You are very cruel to yourself.

245
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
So you will be even more cruel to the person who is threatening you.

246
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
You better stay away from me.

247
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
It is really her.

248
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I know her.
