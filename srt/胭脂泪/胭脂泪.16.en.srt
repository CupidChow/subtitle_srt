1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,000
That day,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,800
I was poisoned by the love-sickness powder that Third Sister gave me.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
I couldn't even say a word.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,400
I couldn't explain it to you.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,600
The whole thing between me and Zhou Yu Mo

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
was all because of Third Sister.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
She wanted to get rid of me,

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,200
but she had her own purpose.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Nonsense!

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,200
What purpose could I have?

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,800
Tell me clearly. What purpose did she have?

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,400
Master, you don't know that

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Third Sister claims to go to the Buddhist Hall to recite scriptures every day.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,200
But in reality, she went to the theater after the Buddhist Hall to listen to the opera.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Nonsense!

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Master, look.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,000
The day An He was released,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,200
I saw Third Sister at the theater.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,400
She said she wouldn't listen to the opera anymore.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,200
But she played it more than Young Master in the back yard.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,200
You took the Zhou family's foundation.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,400
You took the Eastern border's land property.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,000
I trusted you so much.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
I gave the Zhou family's property to you.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,800
For so many years, you...

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,400
You treated me like a fool!

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,800
Master! Master! I...

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Third Sister sold a lot of Zhou family's properties.

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
She bought a big house for the opera.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Now, Zhou Yi Chen is not there to protect you.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Are you very panicked?

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Master! Master! I was wrong!

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
You wanted to frame me and Zhou Yu Mo

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
and want to get rid of us.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
What you're afraid of is that one day,

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,200
we'll be able to find out the truth that only Zhou Yi Chen knows.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,400
Master, do you understand now?

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Zhou Yu Mo and I are innocent.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,800
We're loyal to you.

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
He is the real traitor.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Shut up!

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Ye Zhi Qiu, if it weren't for you,

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Chen Er and I would have been fine.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Enough, Han Shang.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
Han Shang.

48
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Han Shang!

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Take her away with me.

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
I don't want to see her again.

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Let's go, Third Sister.

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
No need!

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
I will go by myself.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Zhou Huai Qian,

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,800
you have a wife.

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,200
Why can't I have a man?

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
You...

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Han Shang,

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
kill her.

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Kill her!

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Enough!

62
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Master wanted me to die

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
because I was shot like Chen Er

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
or because I was killed like Wu.

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
My Chen Er,

66
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,800
he did so much for you.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,200
He used you and sacrificed for you.

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
He didn't even betray you until he died.

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
What about you?

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Did you have any mercy

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
for us?

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Master, life is like heaven.

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Don't be rash.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Why don't you lock Third Sister up in the cold house

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
and decide it later?

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Han Shang.

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Find the playwright

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,400
and kill him.

80
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,700
Yes, Master.

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
By the way,

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,200
let Li Mo go.

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,600
He hasn't eaten for 3 days.

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Hurry.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,520
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,200
Master, please don't drive me away.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,120
What's the point of this?

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,920
Master,

89
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
please take care of yourself.

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,320
Master,

91
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,080
Master, please take care of yourself.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Master, please take care of yourself.

94
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,640
Master, please take care of yourself.

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,760
Do you remember

96
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,800
the owner of this dress?

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,760
He's a man of virtue and virtue.

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
He's a gentle man.

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,840
He can't stand being beaten.

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,640
He's been beaten up every few times.

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
He's been found out

102
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,240
with all the money

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,000
you gave him.

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,840
Ye Zhiqiu,

105
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
why did you do this to me and my son?

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,680
We didn't offend you.

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,640
You still think you're innocent?

108
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,920
If you hadn't seduced Chen'er

109
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,920
and exposed everything,

110
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
he wouldn't have died.

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,520
So every man who's been close to Zhou Yichen

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,720
is being framed by you.

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,120
Kindness?

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,040
Come on, let me hear it.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,640
What kind of kindness do you have?

116
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I don't have any.

117
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I don't have any.

118
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,720
But there's someone

119
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
who was kind to

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,920
Zhao State and sympathized with Zhou Yichen.

121
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,360
You almost sold him to the brothel.

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
Do you remember him?

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Chu Xue?

124
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,960
How did you know?

125
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,240
You bitch.

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Bitch?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,360
He just gave Zhou Yichen

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,920
a little warmth that's normal to everyone.

129
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,120
When he saw you

130
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,560
destroy all his favorite sculptures,

131
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,920
he hid them for him.

132
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,680
When he saw you

133
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,440
force him to please Master,

134
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,640
he just said a few nice words.

135
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
That's why

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,680
you gave him a bitchy name.

137
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
You sent a pure girl

138
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
to the brothel.

139
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,280
He's lucky.

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,680
He escaped.

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,640
No.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,600
He was saved by your good son.

143
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,800
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Is Chu Xue in there?

145
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,920
Hurry up.

146
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,480
Third...

147
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,200
Third Madam.

148
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm talking to Young Master.

149
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
Someone's looking for you outside the manor.

150
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
Okay. I'll be right there.

151
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,760
You're the master.

152
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,080
You're sold to the South.

153
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
Please.

154
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
Please let me go.

155
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,160
Please let me go.

156
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,440
Young Master.

157
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,240
Young Master.

158
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
They sold me here

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
as soon as I left the manor.

160
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
I know.

161
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
I know. I know everything.

162
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Don't mention this to anyone

163
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,880
after you go back.

164
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll arrange for you to work

165
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
at Second Madam's place.

166
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,400
I'll be there.

167
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
I'll send you to Second Madam.

168
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,480
Just

169
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
keep a distance between us.

170
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
Why?

171
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,880
Did I do something wrong?

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
I'll pay you double.

173
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,800
But

174
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
you can't stay with me anymore.

175
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:33,720
Getting over in No.3 Cr usa

176
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,480
In the eyes of others,

177
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
you're the despicable thing

178
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
who can't be stopped.

179
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,440
What's your relationship with Chu Xue?

180
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,400
How do you know so much

181
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,480
about her?

182
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,120
Why did you marry her?

183
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,080
I left you alive

184
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,800
because I didn't want you

185
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,520
to be like Zhou Yichen.

186
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,880
From now on,

187
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,120
you'll never be able to return to your life.

188
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
Yi Zhiqiu,

189
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,080
you can't die!

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
No one in the Zhou family

191
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,360
can end up well.

192
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
You're the same.

193
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,920
Focus on what you're doing now.

195
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
I'll make them pay for it one by one.

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,400
The last one!

197
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,160
The last one!

198
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,000
The last one! The last one!

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,880
The last one!

200
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,400
Come on.

201
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,200
Give me one.

202
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
The newspaper is selling well today.

203
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,320
The news is going to be a hit today.

204
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,640
It's going to be a hit again.

205
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
It's happening in the Zhou family, the richest family in the world.

206
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,320
It says that the Wuyi Tai

207
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,080
was set up by other Wuyi Tai.

208
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Is it true?

209
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,480
Of course.

210
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
The truth comes out when Master He comes out.

211
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,280
If the thousand soldiers and the younger brother and sister of the richest man

212
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
are in trouble, how can they get along?

213
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,520
Someone must have been secretly bullying the Wuyi Tai.

214
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,640
That means

215
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
if we offend him,

216
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,400
we'll offend the mysterious He family.

217
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,640
Of course.

218
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,760
The He family

219
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,440
is said to be capable of covering up the sky.

220
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,200
Okay.

221
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,880
I'll try.

222
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,440
Come on.

223
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,160
Take it.

224
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,880
What's wrong?

225
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
What's wrong?

226
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,880
Look.

227
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,000
The newspaper is selling well today.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
We've got the headline of the Wuxian newspaper today.

229
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,480
They are all boring reporters

230
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
who write some boring stories.

231
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
What's there to listen to?

232
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
And what?

233
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,800
The thousand soldiers and the brother and sister of the richest man

234
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,720
are all in trouble.

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,360
Your brother and your father are all me.

236
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
What are you afraid of?

237
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you want to be someone else?

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,760
Shut up.

239
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
I'll go to the newspaper tomorrow to warn them.

240
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,360
Don't write nonsense again.

241
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,080
No.

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,520
I'll ask them to do it again tomorrow.

243
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,480
Zhao Yingmu,

244
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
what do you mean?

245
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,880
Now the whole page is mine.

246
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you mean?

247
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,080
So you arranged them to write these articles?

248
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,280
Why did you do that?

249
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,280
Use the stories written by dogs

250
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,760
to blur the relationship between us?

251
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,720
But it's not necessary.

252
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,400
I don't need it.

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,560
You don't need it.

254
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
You just pretend not to care.

255
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,280
But I can see them misunderstanding you every day,

256
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,960
slandering you, and looking down on you.

257
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,920
I want to make all the headlines of these newspapers

258
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,440
stand out and clear your name.

259
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,000
The love story

260
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
is forgotten.

261
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,840
It shouldn't end like this.

262
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,160
I can't tell the distance between us.

263
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
Can you

264
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,400
exchange our first encounter

265
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,000
like this?

266
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,200
I love you so much that I can't hide you.

267
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,360
You are everywhere in my heart.

268
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,400
The Love Story

269
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Any new clues?

270
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
I checked the house record of the butler.

271
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,480
Three years ago,

272
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,840
the servants were all together

273
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,480
and proved that they were not there.

274
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Besides,

275
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
they didn't have the chance

276
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,480
to come and go freely in the mansion.

277
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
Could it be Aunt San?

278
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,400
Aunt San is suspicious.

279
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,400
But Nanxi told me

280
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,960
that the night of the New Year's Eve,

281
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,040
she accompanied Aunt San

282
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,840
to the ancestral hall to send the scriptures until dawn.

283
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,680
Besides,

284
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
the butler and the driver

285
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
also testified about it.

286
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,880
It's a pity that I wasn't in the mansion

287
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
on the night of the New Year's Eve.

288
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,000
But I should believe Nanxi.

289
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,320
There is another person.

290
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,400
After having the reunion dinner that night,

291
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,920
he left in a hurry.

292
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,040
Who?

293
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,160
Si Yi Tai.

294
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,840
But it's hard to find him.

295
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,680
After all, he hasn't been back for three years.

296
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,440
Young Master.

297
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,520
Wu Yi Tai.

298
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Master is sick.

299
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,160
Maybe

300
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,680
we'll see Si Yi Niang soon.

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,160
Don't worry, Father.

302
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll take care of

303
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,200
these household affairs for you.

304
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,240
Come on.

305
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,120
Let's make a handprint.

306
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,600
Master Zhou.

307
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,080
All the properties of Zhou Family

308
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,160
have been transferred to

309
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,240
the name of

310
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,800
the young master Zhou Yi Mo

311
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
according to your order.

312
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,640
But the property outside Wu County

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
is still in Si Yi Tai's hands.

314
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
We'll make a decision

315
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,360
after he comes back.

316
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,040
Leave.

317
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,040
I'll talk to Father alone.

318
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,360
Go.

319
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,440
Father.

320
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,400
Why do you have to

321
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,840
give me the property of the Zhou Family?

322
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,920
Si Yi Niang has been working outside for so many years.

323
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,080
It's not easy to

324
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,280
take care of two children.

325
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,400
I

326
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,160
took it back.

327
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,560
Why?

328
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
It's all mine.

329
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,800
What can I give it to her?

330
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
It's all yours.

331
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Si Yi Niang has done so much for the family.

332
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,560
She doesn't want to admit it.

333
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,280
Master.

334
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,080
My property

335
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,120
is not for anyone to take away.

336
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,760
Father.

337
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,200
You've always done it for yourself.

338
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
From the day you married my mother,

339
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,600
you only wanted to get the He Family.

340
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,160
Do you think I don't know?

341
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,560
You knew that

342
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,000
Second Madam was going to kill my mother

343
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,120
and humiliated her.

344
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,120
I...

345
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,400
You...

346
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,760
You knew it.

347
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,440
Father.

348
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,400
Save my mother.

349
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
It's all your bad idea.

350
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,440
Please burn them both.

351
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,960
What are you afraid of?

352
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm not your biological son.

353
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,680
From now on,

354
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,840
I'll give you

355
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,680
as many as you want.

356
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,680
Okay.

357
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,560
Give me more, okay?

358
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
I was so angry that

359
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,440
I found out that you turned the business of the He Family

360
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,560
into a cover for the silk duck.

361
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,400
I've always known that

362
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,720
you and your father did enough.

363
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
I've been running away from the family for years.

364
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Now I've lost the power of the He Family

365
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
just to avenge my mother one day

366
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,520
and take back the He Family.

367
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,800
You don't know yet, do you?

368
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,400
The He Master you've been looking for

369
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
is me

370
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,160
and

371
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Aunt Wu.

372
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
I like her very much.

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll love her for you.

374
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,540
Father.

375
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,980
and somehow laughed it into a fairy tale.

376
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,260
Hello, how can I serve theです

377
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,300
That's for leisure

378
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,260
I'm busy

379
